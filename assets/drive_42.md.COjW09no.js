Often times, they didn't do this out of adherence to personal values, but because their wealthy constituents would benefit from harmful policies like closing public programs, selling off public property to oligarchs, or cutting taxes that were needed to counteract poverty. \\nRacism has two sides. Individual prejudice and Systemic, structral racism. The Modern conservative Presidents actively entrenched systemic racism and cut systems meant to reduce systemic racism. Since Bacon's Rebellion, the US's wealthy have always depended on racism to keep working class white voters from supporting egalitarian public programs. This enriches wealthy americans. Progressives reference Reagan's individual prejudice not to just lambast him for *saying racist things*. We point to the individual prejudice *to prove* Reagan's entrenching of racist systems was not a happy accident. He wasn't truly colorblind. It shows he had motive and intent to benefit the wealthy to the detriment of the least powerful..By the way, Reagan wasn't just racist to Africans, which is our heritage fyi, he said [american city streets became jungles at night](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-newly-discovered-audio-is-reviving-debate-over-reagans-legacy-on-race)He also said [this quote](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/christopher-petrella-reagan-created-mlk-day-because-he-hated-mlk/) about his Black constituents in California. If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, Reagan insisted, it is his right to do so.The quotes in isolation are not that important. But when we understand he opposed the Civil rights act, he vocally opposed the Voting rights act, and he handicapped the Housing and Urban development Department. Mitt Romney's father, a mormon conservative, resigned from Reagan's cabinet, due to his limiting of Romney to do his job. Now lets look at the polar opposite end of the Spectrum. A Texas, Conservative Democrat. LBJ was clearly indivually prejudiced. In fact, when he first saw the rising civil rights movement of the 60s, he assumed Black neighborhoods were infiltrated by communists. He started the [Kerner Commision](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/1968-kerner-commission-got-it-right-nobody-listened-180968318/) to look into the motivations and grievances that were leading to Black protests and activism..The Kerner commision pointed out that *systemic, structural racism*, was the cause of urban strife and that the country could not survive maintaining Jim Crow segregation. With this knowledge, despite LBJ's *individual prejudice*, he used all his political capital, social networks and influence to *materially change* conditions on the ground for Black Americans by trying to desolve *systemic and structural racism*. His war against poverty, Reagan tried to cut. His Equal Housing legislation passed after the death of MLK, was meant to address the legacy of redlining, Reagan handicapped the HUD causing Romney to Resign.LBJ passed the Voting Rights Act. Reagan seated Louis Powell to serve the interest of corporations, and Powell's legacy on the seat handicapped many systemic reforms passed in the 60s. \\n**Similar to how Christians have personal values that are contradictory to Trump. Yet, they still vote so that he can entrench policies that systemically benefit Christians.*Black civil rights leaders knew LBJ was hateful and personally prejudiced. But they knew he was the most flexible in getting laws passed that would systemically help the Black community**. Kennedy was less racist, a Northerner, and said all the progressive things publicly. But he stagnated policy to adress systemic racism. LBJ was racist southerner, but he used all his influence to heal systemic racism.","title":"CMV: Democrats give LBJ and Roosevelt a pass their racism when they were just as bad as Reagan or Nixon, if not worse."},{"text":"please shut up. please shut up and go away.","title":"Hillary Clinton: Musk offer to give Taylor Swift a child rotten and creepy"},{"text":"if it was a roast of Trump.That's *the rest of social media* outside of Facebook, Twitter, and Truth Social.","title":"South Carolina students oppose Kamala Harris roast featuring far-right host"},{"text":"I think type 1 too wants to be saved.

Your suggested change wouldn't really change much this picture. The point is that the small states are not systematically over or under represented. Delaware has 990k people per a representative against California's 760k. What the increase of number of representatives would do is that it would dilute the effect of senators in determining the EC votes. But I would say that while there would be a small advantage in such a change for Democrats, it wouldn't be huge as both parties control both large and small states. Regarding your last comment, yes ranked-choice is obviously better compared to the FPTP. Gore would have definitely won in 2000 in a ranked-choice system. But to me that's still rearranging the deck chairs compared to the fundamental problem with the EC + winner-takes-all system for the elector allocation.

We all do that, and it's never a good thing, but when these folks in rural areas do it, they end up shooting themselves in the foot.

In other words it is not good/healthy to expect read receipts by default. People who want read receipts want instant attention and gratification. They should manage that urge by giving other people the space to share and respond on their own time. Read receipts are a mechanism to avoid conflict by giving a false sense of communication to soothe someones fragile ego. But even worse they often just give the sender a crippling sense of anxiety over why someone has not responded. Sure, in a perfect world people would have the emotional intelligence to not let an blue check affect their mood, but in a perfect world read receipts would also be totally superfluous and unnecessary. In real life we know that people make assumptions and get offended when someone doesnt respond after reading. This brings me to my last point which is the idea of transparency or open communication. The assumption you are making is that more information always leads to better communicationbut that isnt true. Frequently limited information can be worse than no information. Without knowing the full information sometime the additional data can lead to incorrect conclusions or mistaken assumptions. Such is the case with read receiptsthey dont offer accurate information about ones intentionsyet are frequently interpreted to mean the worst. This is why I turn them off. There may be perfectly valid reasons for why I didnt respondbut I dont necessarily trust all of my contacts to assume the best. I dont think that is disingenuousI think its just a recognition of how technology has shifted our social intersections in both positive and negative ways. Im particularly confused by your assertion that the reader should expect others to give them the space they need. That makes zero sensenobody else can define how much space you need for yourself. Opting out of read receipts is a perfectly fine tool to manage your personal communication preferences. Its literally no different from just ignoring or turning off your phoneexcept its considerably more convenient for me. So yeah, I think read receipts tend to be at best unnecessary for healthy and open communication among good faith participants, but at worse and in practice read receipts tend to create unhealthy expectations, unjustified assumptions, and unnecessary social pressure.","title":"CMV: It is disingenuous to turn off your read receipts."},{"text":"Ah yes, the old, \\"Blame the victim to protect the perpetrator\\" routine.Trump is bad, so it is OK to blame him for people wanting to go after him.When it really is, the Democrat rhetoric against him is bringing out their crazies.","title":"Hillary Clinton Goes Wild With Disturbing Comments on Trump and Free Speech, JD Vance Responds"},{"text":"Stop putting Hillary up front on everything.

From 2016-2020, I saw Trump as a controversial but not that problematic figure. His policies were fairly normal for a president, but mainstream media (aka news papers and social media corporations) did a few things that would make him sympathetic:1. Charlottesville - cut a 3 second clip from a 5 minute speech to make him look like he was supporting Nazis. This gave his opponents the ability to call him a Nazi publicly, despite 97% of the speech disavowing the alt-right.2. Covington Catholic - this one was more egregious. News companies took a 10 second clip online and used it to call some kid racist for smiling at a Native American while wearing a MAGA hat. Turns out the people in front of the kid were * drumroll please*  Black Israelites trying to stir up trouble. (NBC settled a lawsuit on this)3. Social Media Censorship - I think its fair to say that Twitter (X) was ran by a left leaning staff during the 2010s. Starting in late 2017, there was a slow process of moving from banning more extreme right wing to the more moderate right leaning elements of discourse. Usually if you had a problem with immigration, or thought Covid came from China in the early days, you would be shadow banned or outright banned.4. George Floyd - this one is a little bit odd at first, but it connect with why Jan. 6 wasnt heavily opposed. When the BLM protests occurred, several places within black communities quickly turned into riots and heavily damaged/looted the stores in the area. CNN went to one of these rioting zones and called it fiery but mostly peaceful protest, which kinda embarrassed them. The right then held this against the left and the next year when 2021 passed, they did Jan. 6. I was already leaving the right sphere at the time because I recognized that Trump thinking it was rigged elections and not what I listed above was a massive sign of an echo chamber. However despite this, I heard that some in the crowd were trying to discourage people from breaking in because, after all, the right already had a very bad rep from frequent slander.\\nWhy does all this matter? Its like a frog slowing boiling in water. Everything I listed above can be verified to some degree and would make some moderate conservatives fear that they are being persecuted. And as for Trump, if its between siding with someone you may dislike vs people who hate you and did every in their power to destroy your reputation for clout, is it even worth trying to appease them anymore?

This high opportunity cost means that it's in national interest to demilitrize. For example Ukraine, in 1994 was in economic crisis. They reduced the army size by 70-80%, sold most of their arsenal, tanks, rockets, planes. And the country made it out.They also made a lot of money from Europe sponsoring demining program - it involved building a factory to safely dispose of mines.Most European countries do not spend the minimum NATO suggested amount on military - because they do not have to, while resources are always running short on social services.In my view, capitalism helped to demilitrize.

If not, then that would be a good thing but it wouldn't fix the main problem of EC, which is the winner-takes-all allocation, which leads to the fact that most states are completely ignored by campaigns and only the swing states matter. Regarding the original plan, I don't think the writers of the constitution imagined that the system would degenerate to two parties and all states allocating their EC votes using the winner-takes-all system based on a popular vote in the state. I'm quite sure that if they had known that that's the result of the system that they created, they would have had a rethink. The idea of the EC was that the electors would actually negotiate and use their judgement in deciding on the president.

Republicans seem to prefer a classist approach where certain groups should be doing certain things with low costs and low taxes, where Dems want that to be spread out and allow everyone opportunity, naturally meaning high cost and high tax. Economically, both strategies work, but the Democratic one is (for now) better, and theres data to show it. Economy always does better under Dems. Clinton caused an economic boom and helped clean up some of the damage from Raegan and Bush. Obama did the same, helping the country out of Bush jrs infamous 2008 recession (which was EXCEPTIONALLY bad given it was war time, and American economy EXPLODES during wars, usually), and then Biden helped recover from Trumps blunders PRE COVID. I mean, COVID, too, but everyone likes to use COVID as a get out of jail free card. Though we can definitely consider Trumps management of COVID as another driver for how bad inflation got. If it was managed better, then the gas prices and supply chain issues and all of that would not have cascaded so badly. However, I do think that thats not quite a Republican thing as much as it was a Trump thing? Its hard to say. The GOP was so different before Trump.Anyway, I know it can be harder to conceive of how higher taxes can result in a better economy and more wealth when people are clearly struggling. It might be worth noting that theres a but of a cycle to it. Democrats get in power, increase taxes on either everyone or just the wealthy (if they can pass it), and create lower costs for everyone in other ways, like lower gas prices due to better infrastructure, lower cost of living, etc. Then Republicans come back in, redo the taxes in favor of the wealthy, often raising it for the poor and middle but even sometimes lowering it (which Trump did, IIRC), and slashing costs everywhere, increasing day to day costs for everyone. This in turn has the effect of funneling more of that money to the wealthy. This is pitched as then going on to fuel more development of businesses, but thats been proven to be not as true as it was sold on and just too slow to keep pace with the increased costs people incurred until conventional Republican rule. None of this, youll note, is democratic or not. That concern was not as much in the forefront of political discourse until Trumps bid for a second term. He drastically moved the party away from its earnest belief that if you work hard and stay the course, you will find your way to success and more toward nepotism, racism, division, and authoritarianism. Maybe the GOP was misguided before, since they were less popular party, but maybe not. I think its important to note that not all Republicans are the extremists you see and hear so much about in the news. Theyre lunch pail working regular people that want to believe that theyre working hard in a friendly competition with everyone to achieve the American Dream.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"The whole \\"Would you rather run into a man or a bear in the woods\\" would have been immediately recognized as hate speech if you'd replaced \\"man\\" with \\"black person\\" or \\"muslim\\" or \\"jew\\" or any demographic other than men.","title":"CMV: Most online hate comes from MAGA supporters"},{"text":"Media: \\"How many more assassination attempts do we need to get you to vote for our guy?\\"","title":"Hillary Clinton Denounces Trump's Decision To Blame Dems For Apparent Assassination Attempt | \\"If he were really a leader, he should be doing what he can to calm the waters,\\" the former U.S. secretary of state said."},{"text":"Somehow he still manages to make it all about himself","title":"Trump Slammed After New 'Inflammatory' All-Caps Claim About Kamala Harris"},{"text":"She is the real danger.

Or the opposite could be true and we find out that the current polling was a few percent off in the wrong direction and we're dealing with Trump 2, electric boogaloo.

Kill the racism of single-family zoning, setback requirements, parking requirements etc. Build baby build.

Cities set their housing policy using FBC and master planning.My city uses this so I know in the future I am going to have a supermarket 4 minutes walk away from my house. The next sub-division to be built triggers the requirement to build out a commercial area that includes restaurants/stores/a supermarket. Everywhere new has sidewalks because of the FBC, FBC also mandates trees so its still tolerable to walk down the sidewalks in FL sun.Urban requires active regulation in the form of affordable housing mandates, these are already used but not as much as they should be.

Kinda, yeah. But also, they are providing a service that I don't think should be exclusively in the hands of the government. I get not liking landlords, but what do we do about it?What we think of as a landlord is a person with three separate roles, encapsulating all factors of production: - A laborer; a small landlord might be someone who can actually repaint a wall or patch up a hole\\n \\n - A capitalist, who uses wealth (borrowed or their own) to direct capital to build houses that they can then rent out\\n \\n - A landowner, who has a piece of the Earth that they call theirs and can charge for the use of.At the end of the day, a landlord is someone who owns the land. Land is not a commodity, and it has an unchanging supply. Because of this, it commands a monopoly price, i.e. the price to rent is as much as people are willing to pay.The money a landlord makes as a laborer, or a capitalist, is absolutely earned; the money a landlord makes from their ability to gate off a portion of the world that we all live on and charge for the privilege is not. This is why hate for landlords scales pretty closely with how expensive rent is. As you get into higher rent areas like the middle of a city, the justified return to labor and capital gets smaller compared to the unjustified return to landowner.Ideally, these returns would be used for community purposes. Fixing the cost of rent gives money only to those lucky enough to get a rent-controlled apartment, reduces future investment, keeps people in apartments that are bigger than economically necessary, and results in shortages. What you would want is to take the money that goes to landowners, tax that away, and use that for government purposes or give it back to people directly.","title":"ELI5 the Neoliberal Consensus on Housing"},{"text":"Thanks, now I'll laugh every time I see her initials.","title":"Kamala Harris running mate Tim Walz is officially under investigation for connections to the CCP."},{"text":"the swifties are breaking ol Teflon don","title":"Trump just dropped the RECEIPTS on every single Democrat who has contributed to the hateful rhetoric against him which led to two assassination attempts."},{"text":"Now post a list of the hundreds of Republicans also calling him a threat to democracy.","title":"Trump just dropped the RECEIPTS on every single Democrat who has contributed to the hateful rhetoric against him which led to two assassination attempts."},{"text":"Republicans: \\"I should be able to say the N word or whatever I want anytime, anywhere without consequences!

This makes people cling more to their jobs even if they dislike them because they fear being unemployed for some time. It is basically some sort of power struggle. ITs like treating a donkey. You want it to pull as much as it can. You also want to minimize food cost and time spent nurturing it. If the donkey were able to work more, you would simply increase its workload.I picture it more like 10 donkeys pulling a cart (I have no idea how donkeys work).  If one of those donkeys decides not to work, you have 9 irritated donkeys.(they actually wouldn't care - I think there is some thought that this is one of the strengths of humanity.  Most animals are indifferent towards equitable exchanges which encourages freeloading.  Humans are sensitive to it and the effect is that reciprocation is a much bigger deal, enhancing community efforts).On a commune, same attitude.   There aren't many ways to have things that don't involve working for it.  That isn't capitalism enforcing it, it is that other people don't want to have someone take advantage of their efforts.All of which is kinda beside the point, I think.  I still don't quite get the evidence for thinking that people are asked to put up with more as a result of mental health professionals being able to help them deal with more.  When I look around the world, there is plenty of bad, but I can't see any evidence that the bad resulted from the ability of people to tolerate more of it..  Life is better than it was.  Improving conditions haven't resulted in pushback to make it more miserable just because --- the places on earth I wouldn't want to live are generally the ones that have less mental health support.For example, working with people with PTSD.  PTSD didn't start with the modern world, it long proceeded mental health care, it just went untreated (or as best they could).  Are you saying treating PTDS makes people think, \\"oh, well, its okay if I abuse this person then, they can get treatment later\\".  Same for depression, anxiety, everything?

If youre not too loud and proud they might say youre one of the good ones.

On the other hand, there are politicians/faith leaders etc who personally are not homophobic but are too cowardly to take that stance publicly because they dont want to lose their job, community, or livelihood. I think Ben Shapiro is more likely the first kind of person because I think he genuinely believes that gay relationships are not as legitimate as straight ones. Hes a deeply religious person and thats what his religion dictates. I think its better to coax these people towards stronger allyship than to punish them for not being good enough and I think thats what Biden is trying to do here.

Sometimes it says it because the window/app was in the foreground even though I wasn't looking or wasn't on that device at the time. If I unlock my phone to make a quick call and the message window is open, I might not even look at the message window as I rush to my task, but the app will say I saw or read the message. Rather than allowing that miscommunication to happen and fixing it, I prefer to not let the miscommunication happen in the first place because it's a waste of everybody's time. If I want somebody to know I read something, I can respond. If I don't have time I can just thumbs up or something.Usually though, there is no reason a person needs to know I saw it before I respond. Most messages aren't time sensitive enough that you need to know I saw it but simultaneously not time sensitive enough that I don't need to reply. So it's a cost with no real benefit.

Smaller, more rural states would not sign on to the constitution out of concern for their needs and wants being ignored by the larger states. There's the archaic need for reporting election results in the conceptualization of the electoral college as well, but in this modern age, that can be ignored. Right now, candidates are sinking most of their resources into a number of states considered up for grabs, and areas of the nation may feel that they don't 'matter', but popular voting would likely result in the same; candidates would go to big cities to campaign, since their outreach will bag the most votes there, and completely ignore rural areas as worthless. A rural voter will get a vote, same as anyone, but campaign agendas will be built to respond to large urban areas, as that is where you will find your plurality. Current system, as flawed as it is, has candidates crisscrossing rural Wisconsin and Michigan as much as they're in Milwaukee and Detroit, and that's where I think it has merit. Only a smaller batch of states is 'up for grabs' but you need a plurality of voters in that state, so most of the time ignoring urban or rural areas entirely isn't an option.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"You.

I think part of the problem is that the nature of liberalism is progressivism and change while that of conservatism is change-resistant. Being young, there is very little change to the current liberal landscape--it's all you know. Claiming to be young and liberal doesn't mean as much when you haven't had your hardcore beliefs that you grew up with challenged or progressed. When one can grow up as a young liberal and keep up with the current liberal beliefs through the different trends and changes into late adulthood and senior years, then that is more indicative to the essence of liberalism.  So maybe \\"turning\\" conservative as one gets older isn't exactly correct. But rather it exposes whether one's beliefs can weather the dynamic, changing liberal landscape. It brings to light the people who were \\"liberal\\" growing up by virtue of following the status quo as they \\"become\\" more conservative. However, where it might lead to \\"becoming\\" more conservative is when the current liberal narrative causes a backfire effect. When a person's core beliefs, the status quo, becomes challenged by a new liberal paradigm, I argue that it may cause them to adopt more conservative beliefs than they originally had. So to be consistent with your analogy, if a person was a 5 on a 1 to 5 scale of conservative to liberal, which has now changed to 1 to 20 but they are still a 5, then my point is that this backfire effect may have even dropped this person down to a 4 or 3.  An extreme example comes to mind: Elon Musk. Now I don't truly know his political leanings, but what started as more liberal has become conservative. Did Elon's beliefs change to become more conservative, or has his liberal beliefs remained the same but is considered conservative now? I argue the former, and IMO this may be a case of the backfire effect where he has doubled down and regressed in his beliefs.","title":"CMV: A lot of people dont become more conservative as they get older, its just that what it means to a liberal constantly changes and they dont fit the definition of what it used to be when they were younger."},{"text":"They got the guy.

In countries with jury-based systems, everyone may be asked to be included in the judgement. However, jurors who also happen to be members of a particular branch of government are not acting in their official capacities, when they serve on a jury.

I think densification and cutting some of the endless obstacles in the way of building is a priority. Living in generally higher density areas makes essentially everything more efficient. And there definitely exists some point at which building more housing will begin to DECREASE costs for consumers and not just slow the increase. I'm not sure how likely any given place is to get to that point, but I'm sure it is possible.As for housing being an appreciating asset, I think that's one of the most toxic little ideas in American culture. The idea that you should be able to buy a house and have it accumulate value in excess of inflation for decades is awful. Housing SHOULD be an expense. You are using a depreciating set of physical objects on a daily basis for years. No matter how gentle you are, things are wearing down and things are breaking. Unless you happened to buy a house built by Frank Lloyd Wright or something, every house should be worth less than it was the year before it all other things being equal. That means for housing to be an effective investment, the land has to accumulate value faster than inflation and depreciation combined and I think that can be a bad outcome.Land becoming more valuable over time in some places is inevitable, but I think there's a a lot of places where voters very consciously enact policies that create artificial scarcity so that their house prices go up by enormous amounts year over year and I think it's one of the biggest issues facing the whole country.","title":"ELI5 the Neoliberal Consensus on Housing"},{"text":"Lets manifest the Fed cutting by 50 bps tomorrow folks.

As you get older things make more sense, and it is not about fixing the world, but about making the most out of very limited resources that you have.This might be illustrated at a political party meetings. There are always young ideological lot who come up with their own manifesto about how to change the country - but in reality they cannot manage to organise a single event in months - because they are busy our partying or on holiday or whatever.

Regardless, Maricopa County is irrelevant, because Phoenix only contains about a third of the population of, and doesnt dictate election results in, Maricopa County. It has not been unusual in recent years for Phoenix to vote Democrat but for Maricopa County and the state to vote Republican.Thanks for the correction. Whatever the county Las Vegas is in virtually decides the politics of Nevada.Anyone with even a passing familiarity with New York politics knows that there has been a political antagonism between Albany and NYC for at least a century and that NYC does not control the state. We can look at the states chronic underfunding of the MTA and Hochuls recent decision to put congestion pricing indefinitely on hold as obvious examples of this.This has nothing to do with the point. 1 city literally holds a sizable minority of the entire state. That city plus maybe Buffalo hold the majority of the states population. All that extra crud youre arguing is irrelevant to how much a state is decided by 1 area that thats, geographically, 5% of the entire land mass of the state.Republicans have had total control of the Pennsylvania legislature for 24 of the last 30 years and controlled at least one chamber that entire time. Theyve also controlled the governorship 12 of the last 30 years. The idea that Philly and Pittsburgh control the state is laughable. Youre also pretending Lackawanna, Monroe, Dauphin, Centre, and Erie County dont exist for some reason.This is irrelevant. Were talking about national elections for the president, not governor elections. PA has voted blue in every election, except 2016, since 1992 for the presidency. State governorship doesnt automatically align. For instance NJ is has voted democrat in the presidential election since 1992, but had Chris Christie as a governor from 2010-2018.This is possibly the only legitimate example youve given, although it seems obvious that almost two thirds of a states population should have control over its politics, and thats ignoring the other ten counties outside of the metro area that also usually vote for Democrats.Again the at 2nd part is irrelevant to the pure example of a state being virtually controlled by 1 or 2 cities.

Sub facts to that: Every single study ever conducted has proven masks dont work against airborne viruses. We have research dating to 1981, dozens and dozens of peer reviewed studies and the final say was the Cochrane Study. ANY doctor worth their medical license understands this. You can smell a fart through a mask, so no, it doesnt block viruses either. Subfact 2: Every vaccine (of which the mRNA ones arent, theyre gene therapies under patent) combined has killed fewer people than just the Covid ones. The inventor of the mRNA platform came out against them, saying unsafe for humans. He was proven correct as millions died from heart attacks, strokes, turbo cancers, and immune malfunction. Fact: Biden-Harris tried to force everyone to be vaccinated, against the Constitution and against any sense of medical freedom. That is fascism and authoritarianism to the extreme. Many of us were waiting to grab our guns at that exact moment, but we patiently waited for the courts to deal with it. Thats as close as Ive ever come to deciding theres a reason for the 2nd Amendment and this is it. Fact: Borders are part of every country in the world and not enforcing them is tantamount to treason.

If there are 1,000,000 people and they elect Frank to be in charge. Frank got 60% of the vote. He decides to kill off the 40% that voted against him. How do the people stop it?  They can only exert their power via plebicite.  They only have power during the election. In that election that gave their power to Frank.  At that point Frank is the authoritarian until the next election.  Otherwise all one million people have to wake up each day and vote for who is the minister of fisheries and silly walks. And this after noon they vote on the alternate members of the council of non-bovine cheeses, and tomorrow the Vice regent of commerce for hats.So, now that we have established that 100% the people have the power democracies cannot exist, i.e. they are only democracies in that moment of election.  And we have also demonstrated that those pure democracies are mob rule (with Frank taking care of those pesky 40%).  This leaves non pure democracies as the only viable alternative. So federal democracies like the United States have democratic institutions (the house of representatives) held in check by lesser democratic institutions.  Because our language is flexible we often apply words that are not 100% accurate to describe a thing. For example, my car is red even though it is a wide racing stripe that is white.  Some people on reddit will say it's not really red, because red cars do not have racing stripes that are a different color.

Imagine you're a state of 10,000 people. You have land, resources, and produce goods used by many in the region. Now imagine you're a state of 1,000,000 that produces mostly services with the goods from the other state. You outnumber them 100:1. The proposal is 1 vote per 1 person. The smaller state realizes the significantly larger state can vote in a way to completely overwhelm them to the point where their votes do not matter. What logical reason would you join that organization if doing so immediately presented a significant risk that you're overpowered? You wouldn't, so the electoral college, a fixed amount of senators per state, etc. were created to address this.Without these systems, we'd likely have never created the United States of America. If they were removed today, the smaller states would be faced with the immediate threat that dissuaded their forefathers. California has a population of about 39M people. To come up with an on par number would take Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, West Virginia, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, Mississippi, Kansas, Arkansas, Nevada, Iowa, Utah, and finally Connecticut would put them ahead. 22 states would need to align to have the voting power on par of a single state. Only someone not at all interested in their own well being would agree to a system where they're so completely overwhelmed based solely on population. They want representation, they refuse to be drowned out by larger states, and if you wanted them to join up, that came at a cost that may be disadvantageous to larger population states. Yet, they made the deal. Other states accepted that deal. That's why we have the USA now, and removing it in favor of putting forth something disadvantageous to smaller states threatens it's ability to exist in the future.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"WHO research indicates red meat and processed meats as a class 4 carcinogen and all the unhealthy fats that go with it is creating a obesity crisis in the west, and overburdening healthcare resources.Class 4 WHO classification is specifically 'not a carcinogen to humans' - by definition there is no such thing as a Class 4 carcinogen.The obesity crisis is not created from red meats, but rather from easier energy intake v outtake.

The overwhelmingly more common system is representative democracy, where elected officials take on the task of legislating and managing the nation on behalf of the people who elected them. That means for all intents and purposes, legislative bodies (e.g. parliament/congress/etc) and heads of state *do* hold the power of the nation in their hands. It's conditional on being elected, re-elected, and not suffering a recall, impeachment, vote of no confidence, or other such mechanisms, but they do hold that power so long as they're in good enough standing with the electorate and their peers in government. Separation of powers is simply one way to subdivide how a nation is administered. It has implications as far as how much control any given elected position can directly wield over the government, but it doesn't fundamentally change the amount or kinds of powers given to the government by the voting public. You're still in the same system of people being elected to take care of the country on behalf of the electorate, which includes appointing qualified workers to key positions which hold some types of powers. It's democracy with extra steps, but the power still fundamentally rests with the people, and they can change the direction of their government if they so decide.","title":"CMV: separation of powers is not a feature democracy, it's rather a way to manage autocracy; in fact, separation of powers cannot even exist in a democracy."},{"text":"You think you've seen rug pulls before, just wait.","title":"Trump launches crypto business amid funding race with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Just saw your ad on wfmy this morning, and I will be voting for that little girls Dad!","title":"Shutdown theater back again. - Rep.

I am not sure if a parent is doing this (whilst also not reaching out to a teacher, say) is abusing the child by 'not getting help'. I also think schools are massively stretched thin and so cannot secure the care required.Actively encouraging is abuse, certain professions as parents doing nothing is abuse, a lot of parents simply do not have the facility to respond to this by getting help.A parent may not know how, or may try to and not succeed due to resources - this would qualify as not getting help but is not necessarily abusive.Note, I am not disagreeing with you, I am Side C-ing this because I do not want dead children, but I do like fake internet points.","title":"CMV: It is child abuse to not get help for a suicidal child (as a parent)."},{"text":"This! ??If voting made a difference it would be banned.","title":"Trump just dropped the RECEIPTS on every single Democrat who has contributed to the hateful rhetoric against him which led to two assassination attempts."},{"text":"Replaced by a new model?","title":"Democrat vice presidential nominee's wife Gwen Walz calls on teachers to get out the vote"},{"text":"He also has done zero for his district","title":"House Dems sleeper seats suddenly in sight"},{"text":"FBI should note down all the TDS suffers from this sub alone - tag any of the ' Trump is a threat to democracy' parrots, totally unhinged when you look at their history ..nothing but Trump fixation.\\n..\\n?they are of the same ilk as crooks and the latest democrat gun nut.","title":"Trump just dropped the RECEIPTS on every single Democrat who has contributed to the hateful rhetoric against him which led to two assassination attempts."},{"text":"I think neoliberalism is centered right, center, centre left, because it really just is libertarianism with some differences.

And if it is, why specifically rural voters?Fair question, but honestly, because of the reality of the size of the US.  People in geographical regions tend to feel a bond with others in their region moreso than with people 2000-3000 miles away.  Similar to how humans have a finite space for the amount of friends they can actually care deeply about ([Dunbars Number: Why the Theory That Humans Can Only Maintain 150 Friendships Has Withstood 30 Years of Scrutiny - Neuroscience News](https://neurosciencenews.com/dunbars-number-social-brain-19210/)), the further people are away from you, the less connected you will feel, because the less connected in any aspect of life you'll be.  The US is roughly the size of non-Russian Europe, and different country or not, a Greek person cares more about what is happening to the land and people in Serbia than they do the land and people in Denmark.  Why?  Because they are more connected to that group of people.  Similarly, people in California don't care much about what happens in Kentucky as much as they do what happens in Washington state.  These are all huge generalizations, but my point is, I don't think you can have a landmass the size of the US and maintain \\"popular vote\\" presidency outcomes without more ire than we even have now.  It's why something like the electoral college is ridiculous to consider on a city or state level, but on a gigantic-country level, it makes sense.  It's also similar (sort of) to how the United Nations knew they'd have to apportion their voting.  Since there are individual bodies (ie: countries) voting, you count each one the same, but you don't care or take into the population of the country.  It's not directly analogous to the EC, but it is another instance where total population isn't taken into account, and in no way should it be, regardless of how that results in citizens of Country X having less sway per person than citizens of Country Y.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"But a majority of the country agrees this polarizing topic should not be happening, and yet you will get a suspension and then a ban if you say you agree with the majority of the country.

I know a few, and they are fine enough folks who *think* they know it all about libertarian philosophy, but then they are perfectly happy to use government to achieve their ends. They also tend to buy into some very common, very bad economic fallacies. Decent enough folks, but I would take what they say about libertarianism with a few grains of salt.Non-aggression isn't a \\"new\\" idea. Rather, non-aggression and \\"no harm\\" would both be expressions of very old ideas that are closely related, but not exactly the same. Non-aggression is akin to the rule from the Code of Hammurabi, \\"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\\". If you don't want to suffer violence, don't create violence, but if you do create harm, be prepared for consequences.\\"No harm\\", on the other hand, is closer to Christ's teaching, \\"if your enemy strikes you on the cheek, turn and offer him the other.\\" Again, a very old standard of living, but very radical everywhere it is fully practiced.In my life, I aim for no harm, but at the same time I try to be ready to defend my family and others if needed.

The Electoral College is directly tied to the 3/5's compromise. The South didn't want to get dominated in elections by the more populous north, who would have certainly pushed for the abolition of slavery much sooner, nor would they have wanted enslaved peoples to vote themselves, they would have just voted for their freedom, so they counted them as part of the population to even things out, but only at a fraction. Rich white landowners didn't want to lose any of their power. Here's case and point why the electoral college is a stupid way to elect a chief executive: The Election of 1824 saw 4 different challengers for the Presidency, all from the Democratic-Republican party, which really was a race between outsider Andrew Jackson and establishment favorite John Quincey Adams. Jackson handily beat Adams in both the popular vote and in the Electoral College, at a vote of 99 to 84, however neither reached the threshold to win outright. The election was deferred to Congress to decide, and of course they picked their guy, John Quincey Adams. All the EC did there was protect power. In the Election of 1860, there was again a 4 horse race between Lincoln the Republican, John C. Breckenridge, the pro slavery Southern Democrat, John Bell the constitution party, and Steven Douglas, the Northern Democrat. Now, the guy with the most votes won, so there was no controversial outcome, but imagine it went differently. Lincoln finished 1st obviously, with 180 Electoral Votes and 1,800,000 PV, but Breckenridge finished 2nd, sweeping the south, despite having over 1 million less votes at 800,000. Douglas finished 2nd in popular votes, with 1,300,000, but finished 2nd in every state Lincoln won except one, and only picked up 12 Electoral Votes and finished dead last. The Civil War should have settled the debate on whether we are one nation or a coalition of different nations like the EU. We no longer view ourselves as the UNITED STATES of America, and instead see ourselves as the United States OF AMERICA. We can do a straight popular vote now, or at least ranked choice.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"You refuted the claim of the capitalist class holding the power by saying \\"there is no such thing as the capitalist class\\", and you also said \\"no country is a democracy\\", and since democracy is generally understood as meaning the people have the power, then I don't think its at all misrepresenting you what I said.And IDK what your asking me to pontificate about power is about.

Now from what I get, one of the main differences between Reddit and say Twitter, is that there are real people working as editors/moderators on each subreddit, which in turn have strict rules about what can be posted and not. This is better for focused discussion, and should lead to more interesting in house debates. Trouble might be that we discuss whats on Twitter. But there are a lot (?) of right wing echo chambers on here if you want to, as well as a lot of left leaning ones. My opinion: I think that human editors guided by certain ethical/moral or policy rules is preferable compared with Elon Musks volume of so called free speech (another topic) any day of the week. But of course this will lead to biased discussions, and the editors/moderators along with the groups members will soon streamline to the groups original purpose. Maybe this is why Reddit, as opposed to MANY (most) other social media platforms governed by algorithms that maximize  volume for profit (through commercials) have been able to make a left turn. All the others seem to me that they are effectively run over by more right wing extremists.About that statement, whats considered left leaning, its both very generic and heavily politicized. Im not sure that statement will hold the test and need to read a study of all subreddits in total before I can acknowledge it. But yes, I have a much wider variety of upholding a conversation on here with folks with slightly different views than mine, than on any other platform Ive been part of, where its a free for all and you can get hit with very cheap, off topic and shallow attacks by actual Nazis in very interesting discussions about any subject. I dont see exclusion as a problem if its purpose is a focused discussion on a certain subject. What ever the complaints from extremists on any tower, this is not a matter of censorship but of having a certain discipline.In this perspective, for you to have your answer, I propose to look at the algorithms governing whats edited/shown on Reddit versus other platforms. How is truth doing? What is suppressed? If the answer is that fact checked lies are not repeatable on a lot of subreddits, versus they are repeatable and lead to the same engagement at Twitter or Facebook, creating echo chambers filled with toxic information rather than facts such as climate change is real and human activity is the main cause; earth is a sphere and not a disc; Haitian immigrants did not eat the cats and dogs of the friend of a friend of a certain woman named Erika Lee in Springfield (Facebook) etc. Is it by design pointing towards rage bait that will engage you but not enlighten you, or is it a smorgasbord where you chose your favorite topics/discussions consciously?

We are all a drop in the ocean in the grand scheme, but we understand that we must participate for the system to function. Just because California has the deciding vote, doesn't mean those smaller state votes don't contribute. California is not 100% blue after all.This seems to place an enormous amount of importance on state autonomy and suggests that states having equal representation is more important than every citizen having equal representation. If I understand you correctly, I think what you're saying is that states would not willingly participate in this model *because* they want to have unfair over-representation / voting power in their favor. This assumes what states want is sufficient to essentially blackmail the entire country and its population into a particular system. The reality is that a state must either adhere or secede.

And I'll give my main reasons for eachTrump: one he needs to just shut the fuck up. Even when he was elected in 2016 the gimmick wore off quick. Second I just don't want to listen to the whining from left wing people about Russia this, he totally had some illegal help on that it wouldn't be Russia it would be the mafia aka the people he has paid off before so Trump Industries could do anything in NYC. Third he has achieved most of what I wanted even as someone who didn't cast a vote for him. No new wars, began to set up to leave the middle east including Israel, cheap gas and cheap food.Harris: first I'm not trusting someone who openly lies and laughs at people she's fucked over and now acts like they're the greatest people. Anyone with a pot charge ever should hate her guts and anyone black should hate her more because the death row convict she nearly got executed WAS FUCKING INNOCENT AND SHE TRIED TO BLOCK THE EVIDENCE THAT PROVED IT. Second she downplays her unwillingness to push for anything as VP. She was the deciding vote for anything in the Senate and did nothing. Third she never admits she has and is a problem. A president she said she'd never work with is who she's the VP for.Now for my actual vote. It's going to be wasted, but if it pushes the Libertarian party up a step I'll take it. Chase Oliver. He's campaigning on your basic libertarian platform. However I'll tell you my biggest points for him. He refuses to consider an abortion ban. Instead he does want to push more sexual education and alternatives, but not in the \\"oh just adopt or put the kid up.\\" No he wants to rebuild the adoption system because it's heavily ran by Christians that deny LGBT+ families from adopting. His stance on guns is yes you should be allowed to have them including platforms like the AR-15, but he also acknowledges that the ATF has been failing at their job which is literally making sure if you have anything that would put a hold or deny you when you submit a 4473 it actually sends back as such. Not Buffalo where the guy had a pending assault charge which should place any purchase on a hold and the dealer just sells it anyways and in that case the dealer would be held liable because they broke the law if they were told it would have to be on hold until the court case.Now then why should you vote for Trump. I'll play devil's advocate.First he didn't start any new wars and began preparations to leave Afghanistan which Biden fucked up. This needs first a minor historical context. The Taliban was not always a terrorist organization. Shocker I know. In fact they got their training from the United States. The reason we see them in the horrid light is because for that training we also removed the younger men from Afghanistan to ensure their safety from the Soviet Union. One of those boys/young men was Osama Bin Ladens son. He was apart of a group being trained to essentially take over for the Afghan military in their special forces. He died. The training was so hard he literally died. Shockingly Bin Laden didn't like that his son died. I know very shocking he was angry his child died yet he lived. Well after the Soviets got out and we left, prematurely, the Taliban was in charge by a different man placed there by the US government. He was as close as you'd get to a pro US person as we could find. Then like 2 weeks later Bin Laden killed him and you know the story from there. Note this is all declassified and you can look it up I just suck at spelling anything not American(and frankly half of the American names I'd find a way to fuck up) so sorry I'm not just writing out names. Perspective for that... I thought Quaran was spelled with a C. Regardless of my failure at foreign spelling Trump when he approached the Taliban didn't go in like they were just mindless angry people. He was organizing a day to formally leave under major conditions. That's why when any military advisor says he was looking at May it was not he was pulling out in May. He wanted to ensure all assets were able to be removed as well as the Taliban/Afghan leadership understood firmly when that last flight was leaving if they pulled anything we would level the country. In December and January before he left office he had nearly signed all of Israels neighbors to peace treaties so that wouldn't be a reason to go back. He never finished negotiations, but he was just going to have Iran as the pain in the ass if he finished his plans. Those plans meaning so long as Iran played nice we would have peace in the Middle East and not troops on the ground. This all gets overlooked conveniently by January 6th mind you.Second unlike everyone else in DC there isn't a friend to Trump. That means a lot more than most left wing people understand. Trump doesn't have friends meaning he isn't liked by either party. He is so against the do nothing attitude and blatant waste he made them all his enemy. If you can do that you're doing something that doesn't benefit you. Ironically it's also easily proven he wasn't benefiting himself. His net worth unlike everyone to enter DC as a politician in the last 20 years went down. It cost him money to be president. Third as much as Biden wants to tout himself as this great peacemaker he is not Trump. Nowhere near. Yes he finally got the rest of NATO to finally start moving towards doing what they agreed everyone should do, but he also antagonized Russia into the most, and this is because I love war history, hilariously failed invasion of a blatantly weaker nation since Czar Nicholas failed in invading Japan(at the time they controlled Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula). Sidenote I'm almost certain Putin is going down like Czar Nicholas because it's way too repeat of that war. Back on topic though he's also let incidents like Chinas aggression towards Taiwan go with just nothing. Not to mention the genocide actively going on at the moment. Yes there is an active genocide of Muslims in China active right now. Biden has done nothing besides praise Xi Xingpeng as a great leader. The respect Trump showed Putin wasn't him showing favoritism btw. It was an understanding that started with the firm no Ukraine in NATO because apparently for the person with a shit understanding of geography I can still see a map better than any left wing person. The reason Ukraine was a non starter was because if you go east you're in the Caucuses... Russians main oil refining center. No shit Putin doesn't want NATO to have a direct line to that. Anyone with half a mind militarily would want that. It would be like Russia wanting to put active bases in El Paso(the Mexico side). Throw in the fact that Europe as a whole doesn't produce anywhere near enough oil to sustain the countries and \\"accidents\\" have led to wars for less and yes I can explain why Putin invaded even when he tried every excuse besides just admitting it was to defend his oil. In the end however I wish I could get more people to say let's vote Chase Oliver because at least his views are actually centrist not Biden or Harris saying it's centrist when it's blatantly left wing. Yeah I skipped basically all of Oliver's left wing ideas. Mostly to piss off left wing people and I am not ashamed or going to be upset if this gets deleted for admitting that.Oh bonus for Trump though. You get to have the Cheeto in Chief again. Still haven't come up with a good one for a changeling yet so I'll get with the boys about that and get back to you for Harris","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":" Most of them don't even believe it themselvesYou'd like to think so: perhaps, however...","title":"The Democrats have an army of lawyers to wage lawfare against us and remove us from ballots.

Its now ubiquitous of course, but there was a time where we could use Whatsapp to text people without the pressure of signaling a read receipt on every message. (Mind you, there was still the annoying/convenient online feature - depending on who you ask). Ultimately I think the bigger concern here is tech companies choosing to dictate every aspect of how people behave when they communicate with each other. Meta, Apple, and other owners of texting apps stand to gain by this soft imposition of the pressure to use your phone again and reply quicker. People have a right to not respond and a right to not show whether they have seen your message or not. (mind you, there is still a delivery receipt which should be more than enough and itself as a feature is also relatively new in the history of text based communications). In the face of all this, turning off the blue tick/read receipts is a last measure to curb the feeling of being surveilled by anyone who has your number  whether you chose to give it to them or not  especially when you consider women and young children are, more often than men, subjected to unwanted messages from random strangers/stalkers. Better controls on these texting apps to choose who you want to enable read receipts for might help with this  but again, these features are all dependent on the whims of these large tech companies who own this infrastructure and make modifications only when it serves their financial interests.","title":"CMV: It is disingenuous to turn off your read receipts."},{"text":"I always see a fish... he always looks like a fish or an axolotl or some kind of water creature","title":"Uh Oh??

Since we are a coalition of states and the senate should represent the state not just the people the winner of the popular vote statewide gets the 2 electors representing the senators.One of the biggest reasons not to go pure popular vote is it'd be  easier to cheat.  Please note I don't think election changing widespread fraud has happened but in a nationwide winner take all scenario it'd just take a couple bad actors stuffing the box.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"All this is based on an assumption that Rome had some right for hegemony in the region and subjugation of their competitors.

So they shut our pipe line down and buy oil which makes it more expensive for the American people, but our politician is reaping the benefits of buying oil from another country instead of drilling in America.  They say its because if \\"global warming\\" or some other bullshit, but we would be drilling oil regardless. Why would we buy from another country when we have plenty here? We could be giving jobs to the American people and not paying so much for oil and keep gas prices and inflation low. The democrats don't care about the American people, they care about getting rich fast. It's the same with big pharma. It's all a scam. Drug prices are a lot higher here because of our politicians. Trump wants what is best for the American people and he has no problem firing people who are corrupt. Whereas the democrats don't fire anyone because they're all making fraudulent money and in cahoots with one another. The corruption runs deep. This is why Trump brings up the fact that they don't fire anyone. Trump will fire you if you're not doing your job and if you're not doing what is best for the American people.

Thats a wildly reductive take. The notion that supporting Trump either means youre misinformed or actively working against democratic values? Give me a break. Its not that simple, and frankly, its an insult to millions of voters who actually have very legitimate reasons for their choicesreasons that dont align with a kumbaya vision of democracy held by people who ignore the real issues. And speaking of issues, let's talk about *Kamalas radical financial policies* that you seem to have glossed over in your rush to make this all about democracy.Lets break down the economic *disaster* Harris is proposing. Her tax on **unrealized capital gains**? Its not just radical, its economic suicide. Imagine youre a business owner or an investor, and suddenly you have to pay taxes on gains you *havent even realized yet.* That means selling off assets just to pay Uncle Sam, which would tank the stock market. Middle-class retirement savings, 401(k)s? Say goodbye to those because the rich wont be the only ones selling. The ripple effect hits everyone. And wheres the democratic values in a policy that cripples investors, forces selloffs, and leads to market chaos? Its not about taxing the richits about turning the entire economy into a sinking ship while pretending its for the greater good. But hey, *democracy*, right?And what about her price controls on groceries? It sounds great if youre sipping lattes at a university debating economic theory, but lets be realprice ceilings have been tried before and *failed miserably*. Look at history: during WWII, Nixons era, Venezuela, Cubathey all tried it, and it led to **food shortages**. So, while Harris is out here with her solutions, shes setting the stage for chaos in the grocery aisles. Were talking basic economicswhen you cap prices, supply drops, and demand soars. You get less food, not more. Hows that for looking out for the everyday American? Does making it harder for people to feed their families align with those *democratic values* youre so concerned about? I dont think so.And let's not forget her **healthcare for undocumented immigrants** plan. Sure, everyone deserves access to healthcareon a humanitarian level, thats a given. But economically? Its a nightmare. California is already buckling under the weight of this program, costing over $6.5 billion annually. Extending this nationwide would bankrupt state budgets and infuriate taxpayers who are already struggling to make ends meet. You really think people are going to stand by and cheer when their tax dollars are funneled into a program they didnt ask for? Its policies like these that have people turning to Trumpbecause theyre tired of paying for feel-good initiatives that sound great on paper but ruin the economy in practice.So, the idea that Trump supporters are *either* misinformed or anti-democracy? Thats a lazy oversimplification. For a lot of people, voting for Trump isnt about rejecting democracy, its about rejecting **bad policies** that would tank the economy and hurt working-class Americans. People see Trump as a necessary disruption to a system that increasingly caters to the elites while serving them a nice plate of economic ruin. Theyre tired of watching politicians like Harris push through policies that feel more like social experiments than viable solutions. Theyre voting for their own survival in a system that seems rigged against them.Lets stop pretending this is about being for or against democracy. This is about real-world consequences, and right now, many Americans see Trump as the lesser evil compared to a candidate whose policies could wreak havoc on their livelihoods. Its not about wanting tyrannyits about wanting a government that works *for* them, not one that slowly squeezes them out with reckless financial decisions and ideological pipe dreams. If you cant see that, then maybe it's your understanding of democracy that needs reconsidering.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"Tomato tomahto, MAGA, ISIS...Both are extremely dangerous terrorist movements and she would be right to max up her and her fans' security for protection against either.","title":"Why Taylor Swift shocked everyone  even Swifties  by endorsing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"There was a lot about the Bush years that were even worse than the Trump years.

So yes, I would argue that half the country is misinformed, if not much more because both sides engage in misinformation. Using your examples: CPI increased because of inflation and supply chain disruptions, which is a global phenomenon and consequence of the pandemic, the beginning of which Biden was not president for. I dont think anyone could have stopped Covid and its economic consequences, but you cannot blame Biden for a problem he inherited. By all accounts, the American economy had the best recovery and one of the lowest overall inflation rates of any country. Biden managed to soft land the economy and avoid a recession, which was seen as basically impossible to avoid during the pandemic. There is no evidence that Russia wouldnt have invaded Ukraine or Hamas wouldnt have attacked Israel if Trump was president. That is baseless speculation, simple as that. And the fact that many of our allies in NATO are convinced Trump would not have supported Ukraine and do not trust him to maintain protection of our allies should speak volumes. Other things I typically see are: Gas prices, which are way down now thanks to Biden increasing fracking to drive prices down.\\nGrocery prices, which are higher due to a mix of supply chain issues, inflation, and corporate price gouging, which is something the president cant really address directly. \\nTax increases, which are happening thanks to Trumps tax plan implemented in 2017.Other than that people say that the economy was better under Trump. Apart from being anecdotal, it is also failing to factor in that 2016-2019 were pre-pandemic and a continuation of the unprecedented stock growth started under Obama. An individual president can only do so much regarding the economy, and Biden started with an objectively bad hand. Grading the Trump and Biden years on the same scale is unfair and often based on ones feelings about the economy as they remember it 8 years ago.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"The right is not racist or misogynist.

A product of Democracy is a competition for a vote. Trump and Biden, for example, compete with each other for getting more votes by declaring their programs on economy and social issues to get more votes. Therefore, Democracy is a system in which people have a right to choose. If people can't choose for whom to vote, that is an autocracy. And thus, we can establish a spectrum between a pure democracy and a full autocracy. So, US is somewhere closer to absolute democrat, while China is closer to autocracy.Secondly, The illusion that you don't decide anything is pretty common in people living in US and other developed countries. And those people don't realise that they have a right to vote. As a person form the country where is a little to none of Democracy, I can assure you that if you think your vote doen't count  you never lived in Autocratic country in which in fact there is one party, one president. The judicial system doesn't work (you can be imprisoned for ANY reason, and no one and nothing can defend you, except for if you are a part of rulling class, of course). And to be honest, I watch US election as if I'm an American citizen just becuase  all \\"elecitons\\" in my country are absolutely Hoax.  \\nThirldy, I can see anti-capitlast sentiment in your comment, so, consider the fact that in \\"socialistic\\" countries in fact there is no democracy at all: USSR was a one-pary state, all trade unions were governed by the goverment (so, the literal monopoly); North Korea (aka Democratic People's republic of Koria) is in fact is a monarchy in which the power is absolute and passes form a father to the son; in China there is a one-party system again and after recent reelection of Xi, it seems that China became even less democratic as it used to be since Deng Xiaoping. And many others examples how communists absorbed the power, depriving all rights and freedoms form populaiton.  \\nIn conclusion, Democracy is a very frigile thing and it easily can drift towards autocracy, and it'll be hard to restore it.","title":"CMV: There has never been democracy in the United States"},{"text":"I can concede that there are democratic elements to the United States or capitalism but I guess what I am saying is the level of representation for the average participant (especially prison laborers or workers from the global south whos products are exported and sold here) is massively overstated.

Lesser spenders win local elections to Congress and state governments all the time, and there are many cases where the dominant political party in an electoral district might spend less than their opponent because they know the election is also a sure thing. The idea that the United States is not a democracy is just a factually incorrect statement and I'm not really sure what there is to debate about. We have a wide variety of elections and the municipal, county, state and national level, and in almost all of them the winner is the person who receives the most votes(electoral college is weird but most elections are first past the post). That makes the United States a representative democracy by definition.The two dominant political parties in America both have significantly different opinions on both national and local political issues and operate differently when holding power. I think the reason that people buy into the narrative that both parties are just the same is that the design of Congress encourages political gridlock, but this doesn't mean that they are just one in the same. If anything, Republicans and Democrats are farther apart on most issues than they've ever been in modern American history. There's just seldom been times recently where one party has been dominant in national politics, and polarization has made it so little changes because no one can agree on anything.I think maybe the issue you have is that there isn't a true 'leftist' party in the United States, since both parties are economically capitalist, but that doesn't mean that there aren't still substantial political differences between them. But really, true leftism isn't really that popular in the West in general, there are far more true leftists in Europe than there are in America, but capitalism is still the dominant economic philosophy in the West, so are you arguing that no one in Europe is living under a democracy either?","title":"CMV: There has never been democracy in the United States"},{"text":"One of the rare times go back to Africa isnt that bad of a statement.","title":"White House condemns 'irresponsible' Elon Musk post on assassination attempt"},{"text":"You have the right conclusion, but are looking at the wrong indicators.Point 1:Yes [the U.S. is NOT and has never been a democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeSEx7veNKI).Point 2:As I have read from other comments,1.

I believe that there cannot be truly effective democracy while there is an oppressor/oppressed dynamic in the economic system of a society (whether that be slave society, feudalism, or capitalism). The reason is that the economic oppressor class generally has the power to inform the world view of the oppressed class, or what common sense means to them (this concept is called manufacturing consent). Under socialism it is possible to approach democracy, but not in an earlier dictatorship of the proletariat stage. I think about this quote by the Grenadian socialist revolutionary Maurice Bishop whenever I think of democracy:There are those ... who believe that you cannot have a democracy unless there is a situation where every five years ... people are allowed to put an X next to some candidates name, and ... they return to being non-people without the right to say anything to their government, without any right to be involved in running their country. ...Elections could be important, but for us the question is one of timing. ...We would much rather see elections come when the economy is more stable, when the Revolution is more consolidated. When more people have in fact had benefits brought to them. When more people are literate ...The right of freedom of expression can really only be relevant if people are not too hungry, or too tired to be able to express themselves. It can only be relevant if appropriate grassroots mechanisms rooted in the people exist, through which the people can effectively participate. ...We talk about the human rights that the majority has never been able to enjoy, ... a job, to decent housing, to a good meal. ...These human rights have been the human rights for a small minority over the years in the Caribbean and the time has come for the majority of the people to begin to receive those human rights for the first time.","title":"CMV: There has never been democracy in the United States"},{"text":"But McCain would not stop talking about his military service until Trump well and truly put him in his place and rightly called out that he was a loser who got captured.

Power given to states (not a thing, getting into that in a second) would be exactly proportional, unless you define proportional as exactly equal to other states in which case your preferred system gives disproportionate power to less populous states, and if disproportionate power must be given it is strictly more moral to give it to more people than less2. States are not monolithic. There are more Republican voters in California than any other state, who go completely unrepresented. Theoretically every state allocating their EC votes by proportional representation would fix this problem, but no large non-swing state would do this because it'd mean the majority party in that state loses the presidency forever unless all the other states followed suit simultaneously. NPV represents everyone equally3. As states are not monolithic, there is no such thing as 'state power', it is a construct we created. Without the winner takes all EC system states don't have power at all. There is no such thing as California Power Over The Presidency in an NPV system because there are just R voters and D voters, doesn't matter where from.4. State interests largely don't exist anymore. This is an easy one. Your average R voter has more in common with an average R voter in any other state than they do a D voter in their own state.

A short time later one of the Afghan soldier escapees sends me a video of a Taliban man who has stabbed a civilian and grabs him by the hair and proceeds to cut his neck sawing the knife back and forth with great effort to remove his head while the mans arm is flailing back and forth in a weak attempt to defend himself. I did not have the stomach to even watch and fumbled as I tried to make it stop. My Afghan soldiers longing to escape being murdered send me countless videos and photos of the barbaric cruelty that I cannot even fathom. What value do we each put on the lives of life around us, and what atrocities can we justify? The Canadian sniper is hunkered down at his post and his two Ukrainian spotters insist on cigarette outside so the smoke does not bother the Canadian, against his advisement, and the brilliant glow of cigarettes finds the crosshairs of the Russian tanks cannon and body parts fly. Russians bum cigarettes from two Ukrainian civilians whose town they now own and shot them in the back as they walk away. How do we justify killing in any form? .I would think that the more civilized and progressive we get the more respect for life we would have. I would probably fall in the category of barbaric killer as I laugh about her and kill chickens in the same day. When is it acceptable to kill another human-being? I think that the vast majority of advanced civilized society would land on the side that killing a human is generally unacceptable. If we all are opposed to the unjust random killings of civilians how can we go about our daily lives and not act when thousands of our innocent neighbors or getting murdered by a terrorist like Putin, and how can we sit idle as genocide occurs in Afghanistan and Myanmar and other places around the globe.  \\nAs the Taliban is committing genocide and killing the majority of the Afghan population; we have 5900 Afghan soldiers ready to deploy to Ukraine and we have 10,000 of the Syrian free army(less 67 killed in the earthquake last week) that Ukraine and the US refuses to allow and coordinate them to go and fight in Ukraine. After spending five months in Ukraine I began to realize that it was impossible for Ukraine to win this war and that the world should not have grand thoughts that it is possible. I presume that I must be clear, that while on the current path Ukraine will not win, it is imperative for the world that they do win, and that is why this book is so important, for us all to recognize that losing is not an option and what we must do to win. I obviously did not write this to make any money, as that is totally unimportant; the extremely important issue is that we openly discuss daily the major issues that face Ukraine and what we each must try to do to fix them. This is a conflict of global importance and the outcome will affect us each and every one for the rest of the world.  \\nIt is tragic that we are too immature as leaders to be modest and humble and bend over backwards to forge relationships. If we are the worlds leader we must be able to set the example of how of unselfishness and kindness and caring and be able to sit in the dirt floor with the most common struggling souls among us and share their pain and try to make their lives better. There would be little need for any world news or any news outside of our own community if we all intend to do nothing. What is the point of even covering the story? They take the picture of the mother and child decapitate on the kitchen floor with the kids head on the kitchen table because it is not normal or acceptable and if we are not moved to act we must be heartless shells of humans.\\"","title":"Ukraine's Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity"},{"text":"Yes, I'm looking forward to the national guard shutting down McDonald Trump's insurrection part 2.

An equal voice. That's not what the Electoral College provides. The Electoral College is increasing the value of votes in small states at the extreme expense of everyone else, and in doing so actually creating the problem that it's claiming to solve.Let's say that you're a Republican in California. On a national level, your vote is completely meaningless. Your voice has been entirely taken away, because you will never have a prayer of turning your state red. The same applies to Democrats in most of the south. The Electoral College has taken those people's voice away.But let's assume that you're a republican in Wyoming. Your vote matters disproportionately more, and you're being afforded special treatment. If the Electoral College were abolished, that wouldn't take their voice away, it would bring it down to the same level as everyone else's. They would have the same amount of voting power as the newly enfranchised California Republicans and Alabama Democrats, and the same amount of voting power as California Democrats and Alabama Republicans. They would have the same amount of voting power as everyone else in the country.But it gets even worse when we get to swing states. Right now, the only states that see any actual attention from politicians are large swing states. Those are the only states where your vote matters regardless of the party you support, and the states where your vote matters more than anywhere else in the country, and *those* states dictate policy. Giving smaller states disproportionate voting power doesn't give everyone a voice. It just makes swing states the places that get courted.

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \\"combative\\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the patriotism of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States. Gingrich furthermore oversaw several major government shutdowns.[74][75][76][53]University of Maryland political scientist Lilliana Mason identified Gingrich's instructions to Republicans to use words such as \\"betray, bizarre, decay, destroy, devour, greed, lie, pathetic, radical, selfish, shame, sick, steal, and traitors\\" about Democrats as an example of a breach in social norms and exacerbation of partisan prejudice.[5] Gingrich is a key figure in the 2017 book The Polarizers by Colgate University political scientist Sam Rosenfeld about the American political system's shift to polarization and gridlock.[6] Rosenfeld describes Gingrich as follows, \\"For Gingrich, responsible party principles were paramount... From the outset, he viewed the congressional minority party's role in terms akin to those found in parliamentary systems, prioritizing drawing stark programmatic contrasts over engaging the majority party as junior participants in governance.\\"[6]","title":"Bush called out on Trump-Harris: When democracy calls, you cant just roll it over to voicemail"},{"text":"damn nypd basically did a mass shooting","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Malarkey level of going all in on $WLFI (aka TrumpCoin)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I have used the FBI formWhy, so they can congratulate each other around the office?","title":"Extreme gaslighting: \\"The Democrats have been the only ones consistently against political violence this century.\\""},{"text":"I have friends Im still trying to forgive for sitting out the vote because they didnt get Bernie, their favorite, as the candidate.","title":"Hillary Clinton reflects on the Taylor Swift endorsement"},{"text":"Need to get on the first note of Runaway","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Wait a minute","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Its crazy to think how mentally unwell a person like you is to believe that all republicans think this is a dream.

Im on the anti-assassination left (like most of us) so let me try to explain why we feel the way we do about him, not to convince you but so you see where were coming from and why (if you believed all of this was true) we are so anti Trump. I think the blm RIOTS were bad and the people that participated in criminal activity should face repercussions. Im curious if you would have the same opinion on the J6 crowd. You stated that J6 looked like kindergarten by comparison and Im really afraid that not many Americans know the whole story, which is what really scares me about Trump. Trump had a whole plan created by his lawyers with help from some republicans in congress and state republicans to overturn the 2020 election. This is 100% fact in thousands of court documents and testimony from his own people involved in the plan. Trump did not claim innocence on these charges, only that he should be immune as president which the Supreme Court controversially gave him despite decent. I will lay out the plan.1) Trump started a misinformation campaign before the election that the mail in ballots would be fraudulent. Then he declared victory early before they were counted so his supporters would believe they rigged it despite it being known that it would take longer to count them. This was called notably by Kyle Kulinski on Joe Rogan on election night.2) After the loss Trump planned to have his slate of electors in the swing states [show up](https://youtu.be/P_NgLQxMV9c?si=QlYiSbMN7yjRyNtY)to the capital with counterfeit ballots to cast for him before the Biden electors got there. This is illegal which is way many electors refused and he had to recruit new ones. Many of these people have since gone to jail and some claim they were tricked.3) Trump pressured the DOJ to falsely claim the election was stolen to give legitimacy to his claims and when they refused he threatened to replace them. Hundreds of DOJ officials threatened him back with mass resignation so Trump conceded. 4) Trump wanted to blindside the dems during the certification of the vote on J6 by having Mike Pence throw out the Biden electoral votes under false claims of voter fraud and replace them with his counterfeit electoral votes thus giving him the presidency.5) Expecting the Dems to throw a fit at the election being stolen for Trump, the plan was that it would go to the states which Trump held a majority or the Supreme Court which favors Trump.6) Mike Pence refused after being told it was illegal to which Trump allegedly said he is too honest. Trump then turned his supporters against Mike Pence on social media and at his rally on J6 before the riot. (As seen by the gallows built and the hang Mike Pence chants).7) Trump was warned that the protesters were armed and walking past security to which he did nothing.8) Trump waited hours to tell his mob to leave despite getting calls from several republicans telling him he was ruining his legacy.Here is a [link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot) for more information about what Im talking about and I recommend you do your own research. Like I said Im not trying to change your mind but hopefully this explains why democrats claim he is a threat to democracy and at least why I think its important he doesnt win. I strongly urge you to put aside your biases and truly think about all the claims Trump has made and the motives he has to make them.","title":"Why do people genuinely want trump dead?"},{"text":"Which sounds like a South African accents saying fascist.

In times of war, they defend against invaders or claim new territory and resources for their own nation, in times of peace they can help maintain order or discourage future invasions. The Spartans needed a large standing army because of the constant fear of slave revolts, but they also needed so many slaves because all the men had to be in the military. For most civilizations, men were required to train for war, but large standing armies were not the norm until much later. The need for laborers was more important than career soldiers. At least in Europe, standing armies didn't really exist until the 17th century when large countries started forming and the conflicts grew in scale. Nations would have some soldiers holding forts and protecting nobility, but when wars started they relied on their vassals to raise armies from their serfs.

Addressing the U.S. mental health crisis and preventing suicide are top priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration and part of President Bidens Unity Agenda.  \\n...  \\nSAMHSAs 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (PDF | 706 KB) reported that 5% of adults C about 12.8 million people C had serious thoughts of suicide; 1.4%, or 3.7 million, people made a suicide plan; and 0.6%, or 1.5 million people, attempted suicide in the past year. Among adolescents ages 12 to 17, 12.3% or 3.2 million, had serious thoughts of suicide, 5.6% made a suicide plan, and 3.3% attempted suicide. About 21.9 million adults and 4.5 million youth ages 12 to 17 reported having a major depressive episode in the past year. Over 49,000 people died by suicide in 2023, that is 1 death every 11 minutes. This is why the Biden-Harris Administration named tackling the mental health crisis a core pillar in the Unity Agenda.  \\n...  \\nIn April, the Biden-Harris Administration launched a new National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and first-ever Federal Action Plan, which provide concrete recommendations for addressing gaps and meeting the needs of populations disproportionately impacted by suicide and more than 200 actions to be initiated and evaluated in the next three years.  \\n...List of recipients for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:Every September we recognize Suicide Prevention Month as a time to raise awarenessto remind those struggling that they are not alone and that there is hope. Many people who have experienced suicidal thoughts are alive today because they got help, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, The Biden-Harris Administration is deeply committed to expanding and improving suicide prevention in order to save lives. That is why we launched the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline two years ago and why we continue to invest in suicide prevention programs that help save lives across this country.-In other press releases:* [FACT SHEET: Congressional Republicans are Wasting Time Instead of Delivering for the American People Yet Again](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/09/fact-sheet-congressional-republicans-are-wasting-time-instead-of-delivering-for-the-american-people-yet-again/)* [BLM announces steps to improve engagement with Tribes, public on mineral development](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-announces-steps-improve-engagement-tribes-public-mineral-development)* [Now Live: Living Cells Can Be Seen With Infrared Light | NIST researchers use new method to measure biomolecules in live cells.](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/09/now-live-living-cells-can-be-seen-infrared-light)* [AHRQ Announces Funding Opportunities to Establish State-based Solutions to Accelerate Health Care Improvement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/09/09/ahrq-announces-funding-opportunities-to-establish-state-based-solutions-to-accelerate-health-care-improvement.html)* [Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Foreign Interference in or Undermining Public Confidence in United States Elections](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/09/09/press-release-notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-foreign-interference-in-or-undermining-public-confidence-in-united-states-elections-2/) * [Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Foreign Interference in or Undermining Public Confidence in United States Elections](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/09/09/message-to-the-congress-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-foreign-interference-in-or-undermining-public-confidence-in-united-states-elections/)* [HUD Announces More Than $5 Million in New Investments for Camden, New Jersey | New awards will support climate resilience and energy efficiency renovations.](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_230)* [EPA Completes $2 Million Contaminated Soil Cleanup at Belanger Park in River Rouge, Michigan](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-completes-2-million-contaminated-soil-cleanup-belanger-park-river-rouge-michigan)* [Interior Departments Office of Native Hawaiian Relations Awards $1 Million in NATIVE Act Grants to Native Hawaiian Organizations](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-departments-office-native-hawaiian-relations-awards-1-million-native-act)* [CBP, USDA Partner With IATA for First International Airline Recycling Program](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-usda-partner-iata-first-international-airline-recycling-program)-Enforcement:* [FTC Sends Refunds to Consumers Deceived by Genetic Testing Firm 1Health.io Over Data Deletion and Security Practices](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-sends-refunds-consumers-deceived-genetic-testing-firm-1healthio-over-data-deletion-security)* [EPA Region 7 Fines Hawkins Inc. of Camanche, Iowa, for Alleged Hazardous Waste Violations](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-region-7-fines-hawkins-inc-camanche-iowa-alleged-hazardous-waste-violations)* [HSI New York Investigation Lands American Airlines Mechanic 9-Year Prison Sentence for Conspiring to Import Cocaine Bricks Under Jetliner Cockpit](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/09/09/hsi-new-york-investigation-lands-american-airlines-mechanic-9-year-prison-sentence)* [HSI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service Investigation Leads to 12-Year Sentence for Massachusetts Man for Mailing Fentanyl and Fentanyl Trafficking](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/09/09/joint-investigation-leads-12-year-sentence-massachusetts-man-mailing-fentanyl-trafficking)* [Newton Man Charged in Scheme to Conceal Bomb Making | Defendant allegedly sought to inspire Armenian militants](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/newton-man-charged-scheme-conceal-bomb-making)","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $68 Million Awarded for Suicide Prevention, Mental Health Care Programs in support of President Bidens Unity Agenda for the Nation"},{"text":"That's why it still confuses me when I see so many people in this subreddit so desperate to reform the Republican party.
