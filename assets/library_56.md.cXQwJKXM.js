So while we might all want the same thing, they refuse to deal with the reality that in such a large country with so many people, resolving these issues isnt simple. They dont have easy to remember, glib, one liner descriptions, because the problems true nature defies such a thing.Too many people want to believe that we can fix everything by going back. The genie of globalism cant be put back in the bottle. You might as well try to take the wetness out water than try to remove globalism from modern life. Were simply too integrated now. In the same way, ideals about small community existence cant handle the reality of large multicultural population centers. I get why people think this way. But its despicable that any leadership in this country has told all these people that they can essentially have their cake and eat it too. Our modern world comes with very real problems that cant be hand waved away. But as long as people are willing to be complicit in their own deception because they dont like the actual answer, were going to be stuck in this ridiculous and dangerous place.My comment is already too long but I feel I should conclude with a concrete example.Something like the EPA. The Industrial Revolution made an agency like the EPA absolutely critical to modern life as well as a few other such agencies. You need dedicated experts to catalog that you shouldnt store chemical x within so many feet of chemical y in your warehouse. Its boring, tedious work, but it helps prevent tragedies like the Beirut explosion from a few years ago. Understanding this isnt all that complicated but it does require a bit of nuance and thought. Something that weve apparently decided as a nation is just too much to ask. Were about to reap the consequences of dumbing everything down to catchy phrases. God help us all.","title":"Here me out..

The bonus, also known as the Tombstone Bonus, was promised in 1945. The marchers were protesting the hardships of the Great Depression. On July 28, 1932, the U.S. government ordered the police to remove the veterans from government property. When the veterans resisted, the police shot at them, wounding and killing two. President Herbert Hoover then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers campsite. The Army, led by General Douglas MacArthur, used tanks, tear gas, and bayonets to drive out the veterans.

Genuinely curious if someone here may know the answer to this question.-This is actually reassuring to those who fear a predictable trump presidency. Or at least for myself.

Honestly a lot of politicians from all kind of different political parties did some shady things like that and were one way or another put into trials but because it is the far-right this time it is mediatized much more and a lot of people who voted for her are starting to defend her just like a lot did for Trump. Like it's not big deal she's a criminal or do illegal things because others do, they're saying it's a conspiracy to prevent her from running for president in 2027 and so on. Same kind of brainwashing.I was following very closely the US election and hoped for Kamala to win, but seeing how Trump won the popular vote as well, I'm starting to think seriously that we lost the internet and information wars for good, and we can't fight against propaganda, fake news, bot farms, AI and so...  We weren't prepared enough for the damages and brainwashing they could do on social networks and internet. I'm starting to fear that soon, one by one and little by little, countries in Europe will fall in their elections to the far-right/fascists/extremists and some in certain countries will be more than happy then (looking at you Vladimir). There's no way they won't try to mimic what Trump succeeded in doing in all the elections that are about to come. A lot of RN voters (those who voted for Marine Le Pen and her party) are actually very happy that Trump won and they're now also using the same tactics on left voters here that some influencers do on Democrat voters in the USA, making videos ridiculing the left, showing left people crying and so on saying the french left is outraged by Trump winning even though technically you can't really compare political parties from different countries , but because Trumpist called the Democrats lefties, well in France now Left voters are associated with the Democrats in the USA... Same thumbnails same videos, same speeches, same propaganda to shame them and mock them, and I can't help thinking that's a way to make the far-right popular enough and win the presidential elections in 2027 and I can't see how we can stop that seeing how it turned out for the USA.Sad times incoming I fear.

The US population is 51% women and 50% men.In terms of racial demographics, the armed forces significantly over-indexes among black people (30%) compared to the US population (14%), under-indexes with white people (68%) compared to the US population (75%), and is pretty much at parity with Hispanic people (18%) when compared to the US population (19%).So what is the makeup of leadership in the armed forces? It should be relatively similar in proportion to their representation, right? Well, luckily we have [data](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RBA2011-1.html) on that.Regardless of their proportion of the overall workforce, we can look at the raw numbers and determine the promotion rate (which is more of an apples-to-apples comparison that measures each racial/gender demographic against itself). I think it's fair to say your race/gender doesn't inherently make you more/less capable or qualified for promotion, so we should expect to see similar rates regardless of race/gender, right?Over time we see the promotion rates among minorities and women improve, but there is still a disparity. Obviously it will never be perfect, but the numbers don't lie:For promotion to O-4, Hispanic officers are 45 percent less likely to be promoted and Black officers are 39 percent less likely to be promoted below the zone than are White officers. Similar differences are observed for promotion to lieutenant colonel (O-5) and colonel (O-6).So the idea that somehow women or minorities are being 'unfairly' promoted because of 'DEI' just doesn't bear out in the data. Are there anecdotal examples of people being promoted that others believe wasn't merited? Absolutely.

Neo nazis can't get anywhere with this prevailing attitude.

It doesn't matter even if you sit down with a conservative and a microscope and show them a germ and scientifically debate them.

Gaetz] had with women who were given cash or gifts\\nin exchange for sex.**THE COVERUP**Rep. Gaetz reportedly asked then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows\\nfor a preemptive pardon from Trump regarding the sex-trafficking investigation.**In February 2023, the DOJ informed attorneys for Rep. Gaetz that the department\\nwill not bring charges against him.**On February 22, 2023, CREW submitted a FOIA request to the FBI and DOJ\\nCriminal Division seeking all records related to the now-closed investigation conducted by DOJ\\nand the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) that are not covered\\nby grand jury secrecy pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\\nincluding but not limited to DOJs decision not to bring criminal charges against Rep. Gaetz.**CREWs FOIA request explained that the records sought would help explain\\nwhy Rep. Gaetza prominent member of Congresswas not charged with any crime despite\\npublic reporting suggesting an abundance of evidence that he likely violated sex-trafficking laws\\nand the conviction of his close associate on similar charges. Id. The request also explained that\\nThe public has a vital interest in learning whether the decision not to prosecute Rep. Gaetz was\\nmotivated, even in part, by considerations apart from the sufficiency of the evidence against\\nhim.On June 5, 2023, the Criminal Division acknowledged receipt of CREWs FOIA\\nrequest No. CRM-301920897 and wrote that [b]ecause your request presents unusual\\ncircumstances (See 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii)), we are extending the time limit to respond\\nto your request an additional ten days as provided by the statute. Exhibit **By letter dated November 24, 2023, the FBI categorically denied CREW's\\nrequest No. 1585062-00 pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) because CREW's\\nrequest ha[s] not sufficiently demonstrated that the publics interest in disclosure (relating to the\\noperations and activities of the government) outweigh the personal privacy interests of these\\nindividual(s). Exhibit C. The FBI acknowledged the existence of FBI records relevant to this request, but claimed those records are exempt because processing these third party records\\nwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.**On February 21, 2024, CREW submitted a FOIA appeal to the FBIs\\ndetermination, arguing that the FBIs reliance on Exemptions 6 and 7(C) was improper, and that\\nthe FBI was required under the FOIA to still disclose all non-exempt, segregable portions of the\\nrecords.**To date, CREW has not received a determination on its FOIA appeal of the FBIs\\ndetermination.*To date, CREW has not received a determination on its FOIA request to the\\nCriminal Division.**\\nEDITx2: It kind of pisses me off that they refer to the victims as both \\"underage\\" and \\"women\\" in the same breath.

In his latest book, published this summer ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Hegseth called on Americas next commander in chief to shift the militarys focus  beginning by reverting the Department of Defense to its pre-1947 name, the Department of War.\\n Some of Hegseths writing also appears to echo the virulent rhetoric of white nationalists and Great Replacement theorists, taking particular aim at Islam. During Trumps campaign to return to office, his team courted Muslim voters, many of whom were angry with the Biden administration over its handling of the war in Gaza. In his 2020 book American Crusade, Hegseth fulminates against Muslim birth rates and what he characterizes as the infiltration of American communities by refugees and migrants whom he accuses of leeching off government support. He writes that Islam is not a religion of peace, and it never has been and claims that all modern Muslim countries are either formal or de facto no-go zones for practicing Christians and Jews.\\nIslam, he writes, has been almost entirely captured and leveraged by Islamists.","title":"Trumps Pentagon pick dismissed military diversity, demonized Islam"},{"text":"The leader of our nation has to behave in an ethical manner?

Divide is exactly what some other countries want from Americans. Fighting from within. And it's working. Don't let them win!Side rant to no one in particular except for the younger folks just getting into understanding world events and politics - If you don't think there isn't a long play by a few countries to take the USA down, then you are being willfully ignorant and need to start reading up on what some countries have pledged even decades ago. It is not some right wing conspiracy theory like the media tries to mock. Its what's going on right. now. They got you so busy worrying about taking the kids to school, or what you have to do for work tomorrow, and how you're going to afford the bills and STILL buy the kids something for christmas, meanwhile the radio and tv either want to sell you something or it's paid-for media companies pushing the owners political agenda. You have NO time nor even have a second thought about some other country wanting to do something to you. You're so busy with your own life you forget how MUCH freedom you have. How free your government (For now) lets you live your life however you want, with no service to your country except for taxes.  The countries that are not fans of the USA's mega-power are plentiful. China is a big one. Iran is another and a communist sympathizer. Russia and now they are more than ever willing to negotiate with anyone who will help them. We are fighting over how.. \\"orange\\" and \\"smelly\\" (seriously it's gotten to toddler level ad hominem attack)  the president is and getting people to literally ostracize friends and even family just for their support of a man. Meanwhile china has had massive 5 year plans since the 80s. They said they WILL invade Taiwan in 2027. People keep saying something \\"big\\" is coming for \\"disclosure\\" like ufos and uaps. I honestly think it's gonna be when that sh*t goes down in Taiwan. Meanwhile usa is fighting Russia via proxy war in Ukraine. American politicians of all supposed political affiliation are making millions off this including Nancy Pelosi who even bragged about it and claims she's doing nothing wrong. Meanwhile we have millions and millions of Americans at home barely making rent payments let alone able to afford their car payments and the skyrocketing price of food. Companies reported astronomical profits after covid restraints were lifted and things returned to normal.... so shareholders told them to keep prices jacked the fk up. No one intervened. And then inflation kept going up up up. We got kamala spending 1b on a failed election which had a ironic focus on how well she would run the economy. Sadly the campaign is reported to be in DEBT to the sum of 20 MILLION ?? I digress. We have china. Iran. North Korea. And Russia all willing to become their own little club and usa is suffering from inflation so bad that our debt payments on USA DEBT that will mature in Jan of 2025... the US DOLLAR WILL BE WORTH 50% OF ITS CURRENT VALUE AS 50%, WILL NOW GO TO INTEREST PAYMENTS. WE ARE IN A CRISIS.but we're still sending billions to Ukraine. We still are fighting a war that isn't ours. \\nWe have a open boarder and a record number of deaths reported at said boarders and now a massive influx of cartel business for smuggling, s*x trafficking.

However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VAs direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://web.archive.org/web/20240709101712/https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization. Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap significant cost savings.The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nations administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.","title":"Jasmine Crockett Lays Bare The Stunning Hypocrisy Of Trump's Unqualified Picks"},{"text":"\\"Not the worst!

However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VAs direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization. Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap significant cost savings.The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nations administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.","title":"Ramaswamy wants to defund unauthorized government programs - like veteran healthcare"},{"text":"Scotland:Immediately irrelevant.","title":"Scotland: Congratulations to the Convicted Felon Donald Trump."},{"text":"It will be the shit stain Ryan Walters.

For Trump to have the military at his criminal beck and call, hed have to persuade a lot of officers to violate their oaths to uphold the Constitution out of loyalty or fear. Although he could pardon them in exchange for the commission of crimes, that carrot is unlikely to persuade many who have dedicated their careers to public service and fidelity to the Constitution.Then theres the broader federal workforce. In his last term, Trump had cooked up what was?[known as Schedule F,](https://www.govexec.com/management/2024/11/what-trumps-win-means-federal-workforce/400870/)?which would have stripped civil-service protections for federal employees, allowing him to replace them with personal loyalists.

Many Americans are understandably frightened by the potential reach of his vindictiveness.But Trump can hardly turn the country into a dictatorship with a few strokes of a pen. The courts are still working in America. The sprawling federal bureaucracy is formidable. And presidents do not control the individual states.Although the far-right Supreme Court majority in?[Trump v. U.S.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)?created criminal immunity as a gloss on Article II of the Constitution, that provision affords presidents only a confined list of powers.The president is commander-in-chief of the Army, Navy and state militias when theyre called into active federal service, and he can commission federal military officers. He can also receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers and pardon federal crimes. He can make treaties, and appoint ambassadors, agency heads and Supreme Court justices with the advice and consent of the Senate. And he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed  except that, thanks to?[Chief Justice John Roberts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf), he is immune from prosecution if he uses these powers to commit crimes.But bear in mind that, compared to those of Congress, the presidents express constitutional powers are limited.

Trump has made?[over 100 threats](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/trump-enemies-prosecution.html)?to prosecute political enemies,?[including President Biden](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/trump-retribution-enemy-list-00187725)?himself, whom he said should be arrested for treason. He vowed in a speech to appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family. (Biden, however, would get at least a presumption of immunity for all actions taken as president, thanks to the Supreme Court.)Advisors from Trumps first administration have since made public their efforts to stave off his worst impulses. John Bolton, his former national security advisor,?[said](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/us/politics/trump-administration-criticism.html), The United States missed an incalculable number of opportunities in Trumps first term because senior officials necessarily concentrated on keeping a few key policies on track. Those folks wont be around to babysit him this time.But criminal indictments require a few things to get off the ground. They require a law, facts and either a grand jury or a judicial officer (usually a magistrate judge) to sign off on the governments proposed charges. In this moment, at least, the federal courts are still functioning with fidelity to the rule of law and the Constitution (with a few unfortunate exceptions, including the Supreme Court majority in Trump v. U.S.).Of course, a Justice Department beholden to Trump could ruin lives in the investigative phase, regardless of whether there is any actual probable cause of a crime. But rogue prosecutors operating at the whim of Trump  a relationship that the Supreme Court specifically insulated from oversight, on the theory that directives to the attorney general are beyond criminal scrutiny  will in the vast majority of cases be stopped by federal judges.","title":"Heres whats standing in the way of Trump getting whatever he wants"},{"text":"Bet he has a whole bunch of em.

The talents of cretins like Matt Gaetz do not extend beyond bloviating and causing gridlock in Congress; they lack any semblance of the management skills required by the positions Trump wants them to fill.Second, as a former government attorney who practiced down there, whether Trump likes it or not, the federal bench is still filled with a whole lot of credible judges who take the law seriously (see: e.g., Trumps 60+ spurious election cases, all of which were tossed for lack of merit). The instant any redhat thugs try to go door to door and round anyone up the whole idiotic effort will grind to a halt as dockets swell with thousands of immigration cases.Fourth, other than his tax cut for the wealthy, Trump accomplished basically none of the things he campaigned on. True, there are less guard rails now that magats control congress, but the fact remains that Trump's administration was such a raging revolving door of idiocy, incompetence, leakers, litigation, and constant infighting and schizophrenic lies that they couldn't really focus on any one issue.Personally, I'd be much more worried about foreign influence, counter intelligence, and Elon Musk's ratfucking than any wide-scale immigration round-ups or concentration camps.","title":"In Trump's mass deportation plan, the private prison industry sees a lucrative opportunity"},{"text":"She'd better use the right fucking email address tho","title":"Trumps intelligence chief pick Tulsi Gabbard is Russias girlfriend"},{"text":"*\\"...and the 76 million Americans that voted in support of him.\\"*FTFY","title":"Scotland: Congratulations to the Convicted Felon Donald Trump."},{"text":"The left is claiming he's like the Islamophobic version of Hitler because he supports Israel's genocide of a different group of people (Palestinians).

According to two sources, Wiles was briefed Wednesday night about an allegation that Hegseth had acted inappropriately with a woman. One of the sources said the alleged incident took place in Monterey, California in 2017. According to the transition source, the allegation is serious enough that Wiles and Trumps lawyers spoke to Hegseth about it on Thursday. A source with knowledge of the meeting said that Hegseth said the allegation stemmed from a consensual encounter and characterized the episode as he-said, she-said. On Thursday evening, Hegseths lawyer Timothy Parlatore said: This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it. [...] Ahead of the Thursday meeting, one high-level MAGA member familiar with the allegation said Hegseth wasnt properly scrutinized before Trump made the controversial pick. He wasnt vetted, the source said. But the senior transition source disputed this. Hegseth was vetted, but this alleged incident didnt come up. [...] One Hegseth ally blamed the surfacing of the sexual misconduct allegation on GOP establishment members who are trying to thwart Hegseths nomination. Theyll try to kill all these nominations before the confirmation vote, the ally said.","title":"Trump's Defense Secretary pick Pete Hegseth said to face previous sexual misconduct allegation"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/tpi8lhlo0z0e1.jpeg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=429081008cf47a6e0159d900552b85b2c72405de","title":"Undocumented mechanic says he wont regret his support for Trump even if hes deported"},{"text":"He's going to be secretary of not paying legal settlements.","title":"RFK Jr condemned as clear and present danger after Trump nomination"},{"text":"Because he tells it like it is.

Even going back further to the Articles of Confederation, one of the main reasons the anti-Federalists supported the Constitution was because of the tenth amendment (delegating power not vested to the federal government in the Constitution down to the states), but yet we obviously live in a country with a more powerful federal government than state governments.

I am not anti-vax, i just was not buyin into that pharma grab. The followers of this guy were pretty much forcing their questionable pamphlets in parents faces and asserting their beliefs to people who clearly had their hands full. How they propagandized this situation just didnt sit right with me, particularly since everyone i talked to in the group came from a place of privilege that was not afforded to the people they were supposedly trying to reach. I try my best to be an empathetic know nothing, and i found this group to be condescending and self righteous. Contradictory im sure. I did see one mother eventually come up to thank us because she did not trust vaccines, and her child needed the best doctors she could get in the door with because she had a terminal illness. She inadvertently supported this hospitals policies because they still let her child in despite her vax status, but that was the only person that seemed to be ingratiated by our efforts that day. I found their practice to be insensitive, and the supporters to be alienated from beliefs other than their own. In my opinion, such a stance will only hurt humanity more than it already is. In my opinion, we need to put aside our differences of opinion and unite over the major issue that is being ignored: the children and their future in this world. I believe the world needs to heal from generational trauma, much of which (imo) is designed to keep the masses in an adolescent-like state. I believe this guy is a false idol that has gained popularity because he spoke on issues that no one else was willing to, from the fringes of the political arena. He gave a voice to the millions of people that were silenced during peak covid, and i think this very well means he is a plant to remain standing once the rug is pulled. If the screen is advertising someone in anyway, i immediately distrust them. Yes, its a very pessimistic outlook, but the mockingbird has made me this way. I believe that the only ones that can save us are ourselves, and i am tired of people putting all their hopes and dreams into personalities that have pr reps and lawyers on retainer.
