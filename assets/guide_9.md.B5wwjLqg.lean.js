That decision alone most definitely gave trump the election. 2016 was a great indicator that a large amount of people would not vote for a woman to be president. In 2016 Clinton more than proved she was light years ahead of trump in terms of fitness and competency. There was no question about it. There probably isn't an opponent from any party in any presidential race trump's been a part of that was less qualified than trump himself.  He's an idiot.  A literal issue.But trump eeked out an electoral \\"win\\" due to the number of people who will not vote for a woman.   Take away the \\"female factor\\" and trump almost certainly gets demolished in 2016.So what does the Democratic Party do in 2020? Decides to run a female of color. Yes, she was the obvious better choice, obviously more fit, obviously more intelligent, obviously had a better agenda, obviously is Carly more patriotic and loves America, but she is a woman of color, and that automatically costs millions, perhaps tens of millions, of votes.The decision to run Harris was a serious tactical error - if it was an error.

Many travel notes by Westerners who visited Tibet seventy years ago recorded severe torture and poor serfs.After the Communist Party came, the land of the oppressive nobles and landlords was distributed to the peasants, and all the usury was abolished. So today, you can see Mao Zedong's portrait in some old Tibetans' homes. In addition, there is a large amount of infrastructure construction, including electricity, roads, networks, etc.So you certainly wont hear any positive comments about China from the descendants of Tibetans living in exile overseas.

This is the plain wording of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. No person shall  hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath  to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.  A vote for a candidate disqualified by the Constitution is plainly in accordance with the normal use of words not regularly given. Disqualification for engaging in insurrection is no different from disqualification based on other constitutional requirements such as age, citizenship from birth and 14 years residency in the United States.  To make an objection under the Count Act requires a petition signed by 20 percent of the members of each House. If the objection is sustained by majority vote in each house, the vote is not counted and the number of votes required to be elected is reduced by the number of disqualified votes. If all votes for Trump were not counted, Kamala Harris would be elected president.  The unlikelihood of congressional Republicans doing anything that might elect Harris as president is obvious. But Democrats need to take a stand against Electoral College votes for a person disqualified by the Constitution from holding office unless and until this disability is removed.

One faction is the Musk-like, technocratic transhumanist group, and the other is the religious right. The two are in alliance because the transhumanists dont want to face the policy and ethical probes they'd get from the Democratic Party, and the religious right wants to end the multi-religious, secular society that has been growing over the generations.Theres a couple on YouTube that I find both interesting and frustrating. They try to bridge the gap between these two groups, but its clear to me that theyre essentially transhumanist liberals who leaned right because it made more sense politically, rather than from any inherent philosophical belief. I dont think Trump is really part of either group. Hes not a transhumanisthe doesnt understand technology well enough to care about itand hes definitely not a Christian in any meaningful way. He might believe in some vague form of a higher power, but ultimately, I think he kind of worships himself as a god. Neither group really needs him beyond passing laws that benefit them. Theyve both got their own agendas, and Trump is just the vehicle to make them happen.Theres an inevitable clash between the two factions, and Trump will have to choose a side. Whichever side he backs more heavily is going to be the faction that sticks with him, and the other will eventually break away, trying to remove him or those close to him from power. If Trump backs the transhumanists, the religious right will turn against him. If he sides with the religious right, the transhumanists will do the same.Personally, I prefer the transhumanists over the religious right, even though I do have my own religious beliefs. I prefer that people have the option to choose their life path. Trying to force Christianity on people, especially in America, will only lead to resentment and the eventual despising of religion. You can enforce a society that dresses and talks like its Christian, but unless it comes from a persons heart, its meaningless.

It omits the work of Russell Vought, who spent the past few years making sure that Project 2025 would be shovel-ready for the next Trump administration. Trump himself may not know all of the details yet.Centre for Climate Reporting - Undercover in Project 2025 ([Article](https://climate-reporting.org/undercover-in-project-2025/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/PY_chqyaRHo) 9:51)[Russell Vought]  is the founder and president of the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank he described to his hosts as the Death Star, which alongside the Heritage Foundation has been at the heart of Project 2025.Vought said he is overseeing the drafting of hundreds of executive orders, regulations and secretarial memos, to help make the US conservative movements radical goals a reality. These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there. The trust level will be there.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.","title":"Trump's first day frenzy"},{"text":"Seems like hes just trying to set up a scenario to take claim of all the oil were already selling the EU.

That money is used by the US government to prioritize the interests of the wealthy elites and not Americans at large. The money is used to finance illegal foreign military invasions to \\"bring freedom and democracy to x country\\". Usually that x country is either an important sea trade route or it has oil. Very coincidental. Rightttttt of course freedom and democracy.The [federal budget](https://usgovernmentspending.com/federal_budget_estimated) does not prioritize rich people, it prioritizes old people. About 25% of the budget goes to medicare and medicaid. Then another 22% goes to pensions like social security and veterans benefits. That is 47% of the budget spent on old people. Of course the reason for this is because old people vote and young people don't.  They rather get paid in company stocks instead of a salary then they make personal loans against the stock at low interest rates. They then wait for the stocks to appreciate in value and sell a bunch off to pay the personal loans. This is the only point at which they pay tax, Capital Gains Tax on the sale of their stocks. With the remainder they pay off the personal loans from the bank. They do not pay income tax like you and I.I am addressing this point second because it goes with the previous point that the system is design to benefit old people. Most old people have investments that qualify as capital gains such as their house or stocks so increasing capital gains tax would hurt old people. Your tax money is also used to give huge subsidies to private corporations like United Healthcare, Tesla and SpaceX. Again a case of ordinary Americans not benefiting from the tax they pay. Their taxes are being funneled to the already wealthy.Subsidies are given for many different reason, not because the government wants to give money to wealthy people. For UHN it is in the form of contracts to provide healthcare to service members. For SpaceX it is in contracts to support space exploration, and for Tesla it was to promote green energy. The US government has also allowed the same wealthy elites as well as corrupt foreign politicians from all over the world to buy up residential property and houses as a store of value and a speculative asset. These new landlords hoard the property until people are willing to pay more rent to live in it. So obviously, rent prices have gone up like crazy. The ordinary American also can't afford a home anymore because they've all been bought up by the elites for investment purposes.Housing prices are not up just because rich people by them as an investment, it is up because of the limit supply of housing. Most states have shit zoning laws that prevent the making of new houses thus driving up demand. These laws won't get repealed because you guessed it old people. They have houses already and these zoning laws make their houses more expensive. It is like the whole system is designed to benefit old people. Maybe it is because they vote? Americans don't actually have a choice about who they're voting for. You're given two options, both are acting against your interests and you are asked to vote for the more charismatic one. What a shitshow.This is not true both parties have primaries, you can join either party and vote for a different candidate in the primary, there is only two candidates once the primaries are over. This year Republican choice Trump and Democrats choice Biden. Of course this year was different in that Biden dropped out and Kamala was chosen with out a primary, which was probably one of the many reason she lost as people like being able to choice their candidate. Same with 2016 when the DNC concluded against Sanders, that plan probably cost Clinton the election.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"these same companies like amazon donated in 2017 they never had a backbone?","title":"Companies Are Scrambling to Fund Trumps Inauguration.

The party he is running in is a private, for-profit corporation which maintains their own interests.Questions: Do you believe that candidate will be treated fairly and impartially?do you believe that candidate will be participating in a free and fair election process?2. A drug company tells the DNC they are going to donate $500 million to them, but they need a candidate that is going to have x, y, z policies which are designed to benefit that drug company.Questions:Do you believe that the DNC will have no bias in the running of their election process?Do you believe candidates who are running with an anti pharmaceutical policy platform will be treated fairly and impartially during the election process?\\nMy final question here is simply this; which leans more towards oligarchic systems and which leans more towards democratic systems? Private for profit corporations running elections? Or public non profit entities running elections?\\nCorporations are a specific legal entity.

We are talking about a corporation with shareholders and literal special interests running elections in a democracy.

Or do you think that would be oligarchic?Creating a corporation that controls elections does not take 45 minutes and $200. Filing articles of organization has no fixed cost.

Even if it's regulary use like it due to how countries with kings worked. But by defintion mono-archos means the power controlled by one individual. So dictatorial regimes are also monarchies. Even an elected president who would have all the power would be a monarchy.- oligarchy: wich means a group of people have all the power. They can have been elected or not. That doesn't change anything. Even if there is a king but if he share it's power with a chamber of senator or things like that. If a group of people share the power to control a country where there are other people who don't have the power. Then it's an oligarchy.- democracy: wich means the power of the people. Demos-cratos. A democracy is a place where all the citizen of the state have the power. Like the athenian democracy. No citizen as more power than another citizen. All laws are voted together. And if one citizen have more power than other citizen, it's for a temporary defined and specific tasks where the majority of the citizens agreed on giving this citizen more power and is revocable at any moment. If the trust given by the citizen has not been respected then they can face consequences. But the trick in this system is that anybody that is not considered as a citizen has no power (strangers and people consider as property: in the case of athens it's women, children and slaves)- anarchy: wich means nobody have the power. Nobody can force anyone else to do something and if they do they will be stoped by other people and will face the consequences of their abuse. You have power over yourself and yourself only. That doesn't mean there are no rules or what but nobody can be forced to follow a rule they didn't agree on before.Bonus one: anomy: it's not really a repartition of power. It's more the law of jungle. Everybody have power and will do anything they want. It's power without order. People generally wrongly name it anarchy but it has more in common with the world liberals and right libertarian want to build than anarchy.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"He's the oldest candidate in US history.

In most democracies there are multiple political parties who may arbitrarily lose power, forever. By contrast the US system is deliberately rigged so that one of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party will always be in power. Even if not in control of either legislative chamber,  parties retain a form of power indefinitely by having their representatives present in both houses. The extent of their power varies year in year out but they may never lose their power. Because the system or rigged neither the democratic nor republican parties can lose power indefinitely. Therefore the people in control of those particular parties actually determine how America is governed, not the people in general. Although the people have some say in who the leaders are of those parties, they dont have absolute say.So the best description we can really give is democratic choice between two oligarchy.","title":"CMV: The United States of America is not a democracy, it is an oligarchy"},{"text":"A huge proportion of them just happen to be millionaires.

The executive branch (the president and vice president) are elected by the people, in that they, through their votes, choose the electors representing their state in the Electoral College.  The legislative branch (the House and Senate) is chosen by the voters.  The judicial branch (the Supreme Court and lower court judges) is chosen by a combination of the president and Senate, both of which are elected by the people.  The people choose their government, it is not forced on them.  The US would more closely resemble Russia or China if that was the case.But I'm not going to disagree with you that money is what holds power in the US.  Long before the Citizens United decision, those with money were able to unduly influence representatives, senators, and even presidents.  Why?  Because getting re-elected has always been most important to those in office.  Most often, it's corporations that will have the most say, that's because they have the most money.  But a small number of rich individuals also have significant say.  For that to not be the case, most elected officials would have to make pledges to put the overall citizenry they serve first, not the ones who help them get re-elected or enrich them personally.Elected officials in the US have shown an unwillingness to stand up to the special interests and the lobbying that comes from them.  But let's also not forget that almost every elected official in the federal government is wealthy themselves.

They believe that Brian Thompson was a bad guy who deserved to die, and they believe in extrajudicial executions. But many of them are also pro-choice. And if they are, then they wouldn't support a vigilante killing a doctor who performed an abortion, even though that vigilantes beliefs may mirror that of Luigi's - namely, that the person being killed is morally reprehensible for their actions (because the killer is pro-life) and they believe that the traditional justice system won't bring them to justice. Then, using the same logic as Luigi and his supported used, it would be considered a good thing by the killer and his supporters.Similarly, since everyone disagrees about what is or is not morally reprehensible, there will always be something that you personally wouldn't consider worthy of death but someone else would. Thus vigilante justice cannot be acceptable as it always has the potential to be used against someone you think does not deserve death.","title":"CMV: The pro-choice ethical framework, with its emphasis on bodily autonomy and healthcare access, directly contributes to the celebration of individuals like Luigi Mangione, and this is morally wrong."},{"text":"Yes but I believe in the right to life over bodily autonomy as a pro lifer in regards to the taking of an innocent human life.Bodily autonomy is completely uninvolved in the entire situation with Mangione.

You are trying to link two things that are not linked, and you've provided no reason as to why they should be linked. Unless you can create a valid link between bodily autonomy and the murder, your argument has no legs.You are also rejecting an equivocation that I did not make.

Autonomy is the ability to make decisions about oneself. Conflict between bodily autonomy and health care occur only in very limited circumstances, one of which is abortion. Sure, you could argue that medical insurance denying a claim is taking away someone's autonomy if they can't afford health care, but that is an overthought and frankly silly argument. What is actually being infringed is the patient's health, and right to live. It is very easy to flip your argument completely on its head then and say that the pro-life ethical framework, with its emphasis on human beings deserving to live, directly contributes to the celebration of individuals like Luigi Mangione, and that is wrong.On top of that, your argument is not based in the reality of the evidence. The celebration of Luigi Mangione has been incredibly bipartisan. For example, Ben Shaprio got absolutely scorched by his right-wing audience when he tried to claim the left was glorifying murder because his audience was also celebrating Mangione.

Ill never convince you to be pro choice, and I believe that being pro life is a legitimate ideology with merit even though I disagree with it on every level. I also cant convince you that the killing of a CEO is a good thing either, as I believe that no life is sacred and we are the sum of our deeds, and his have created a negative effect on the world so far as to never be redeemed- making his killing justified and inevitable.\\nI believe that the connection is based more in the philosophy of self preservation, and in America where the self is the most important part of a person, any action to preserve the self is supposedly justified no matter the action. Our system of capitalism is built on prioritizing the self, and understanding that fact will inevitably allow you to infer that self preservation is indoctrinated into us at a young age. The murder of a CEO who leads a company who has directly contributed to the death (or bankruptcy or homelessness which could be considered death in capitalistic terms) of more than one person invites judgement for their violation of the self. He didnt pull the trigger but he was paid millions by the entity that did. The killing wasnt retribution, it was a message and a warning that the proletariat or the common man is done allowing their self be invaded. We can attribute this to abortion as well, as the main cause for a woman to seek an abortion outside of rape or incest or to preserve the mothers life (which are all more important than the death of a life that never started) is to preserve the self they have created. For decades capitalism and pop culture have empowered women by telling them they are more than a mother or a wife and can make something of themselves. An unplanned pregnancy destroys the life the woman has built or was building and pigeon-holes them into a role they may not want to be in. (Adoption involves 9 months of self-derealization and also is worse than abortion, so says every kid in foster care who gets raped on a regular basis) it is not the fault of women or of feminism that women prioritize life outside of children, rather of capitalism and its consequences.TLDR; capitalism makes us care about ourselves and our lives and both the killing of the CEO and pro-choice ideology are rooted deeply in the self, so blame capitalism for both these things you disagree with","title":"CMV: The pro-choice ethical framework, with its emphasis on bodily autonomy and healthcare access, directly contributes to the celebration of individuals like Luigi Mangione, and this is morally wrong."},{"text":"\\"Free speech\\" =/= \\"cancel culture\\"One is a gov back right to air your bullshit publicly, the other is that people on a commercial platform are tired of your bullshit and don't want to hear it anymore.

Additionally, abortion certainly doesnt devalue life, since its main proponents aim to leave as little grey area in related laws to allow doctors to freely perform abortion related care to save mothers lives.

Just after he won the election, that stake was worth $3.5 billion. The value of the companys stock has oscillated in the month since, but Trumps stake still makes up a large portion of his estimated $6.8 billion net worth.Never before has a president had such a significant stake in a publicly traded company, and for good reason: Foreign actors could easily and entirely legally buy up its stock, inflating its value and Trumps net worth. Not only that, they could also threaten to just dump all their shares at once, which would crater his net worth, giving them potentially a huge amount of leverage over the president, said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for CREW.The Trump Organization has also recently struck a series of deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars to construct luxury hotels and properties in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as established a partnership with the Saudi-funded LIV Golf. That has drawn Trump into an even closer relationship with the Saudis, which dates back to 2017 when he made the country stop number one on his first overseas trip as president.Thats an easy way for the Saudis to pump money into the Trump org, Libowitz said.In September, Trump also launched a crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, alongside his sons and his new Middle East envoy, billionaire real estate tycoon Steve Witkoff.Libowitz raised concerns about a $30 million investment in the company from Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, who is currently fighting fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump and his family are expected to net roughly $20 million thanks to that deal, according to the BBC. Notably, Trump has recently nominated crypto advocate Paul Atkins to head the SEC.Scherb said he isnt expecting robust oversight of these conflicts of interest from the incoming Republican-controlled Congress. But if Trump again faces lawsuits challenging his conflicts of interest, he may employ a familiar legal strategy: delay, delay, delay. Thats what allowed him to run out the clock at the Supreme Court during the first round of emoluments cases.Team Trump is expert at delaying litigation, as has been shown through his criminal cases over the last four years, Gilbert said.

Im sorry to hear you have to deal with that. My Thanksgiving went well, until the Friday after Thanksgiving, when I ended up getting a hotel instead of staying at my mothers house for the last night of my visit. I travelled 1500 miles and had to deal with that.Heres where it all went wrong on Friday morning after Thanksgiving. We havent spoken since. She brings up politics, I disengage, she gets angry over my disinterest in entertaining her tenacity to debate and then she starts ripping into me with name calling and following me around the house trying to argue and play victim for how much grief she has to put up with. Some times shes screaming with anger, seconds later shes bawling tears.My father is a democrat but keeps to himself. Hes very calm and very in control of his demeanor. Hes truly the only person who can tolerate her. My mother never had to work, was always cared for, but is a politically unaffiliated bipolar with too much time in the FOX echo chamber. She would never admit to liking Trump, though she would never admit to liking anyone. You just know when you know. Her behavior today is no different from when I was a teenager only its been intensified by her new found interest in politics. Shes a high school dropout out mind you. I used to blame myself for her behavior. I thought I wasnt choosing the right friends, or not taking school seriously enough, or I would date girls she never approved of. Now at 45, when all of those excuses have been removed and there should be harmony, instead she uses politics to pick fights. I feel vindicated in a sad way because I always felt like the black sheep. Now I see it wasnt me. I think another issue that really set her off is that my brother; her favorite, recently came out to her as being gay. She mentioned this to me shortly before she escalated into a maniacal state. Clearly, despite her unnecessary reassurances, she is not okay with his sexual orientation. So after being belittled for hours while trying to ignore her persistent barrage of insults, I told her I could not stay another night and warmly suggested she seek professional help with her bipolar. She then slammed the door so hard I heard something fall. She has been diagnosed by 3 separate specialists and simply switched doctors every time instead of following through with treatment and therapy. They tell her she needs treatment and she says theyre assholes. Sorry for the vent. I wish you a Happy New Year at least!

If a Republican did win in 2020 (which Im not so sure about, as COVID was arguably an opportunity that Trump squandered by not taking it seriously), then a Democrat would inevitably win in 2024 because of COVIDflation (just like Trump won despite running basically the worst campaign possible). Al Gore winning in 2000 would have also probably prevented the rise of Trump, as without the disastrous Bush administration, there wouldnt have been the power vacuum in the Republican Party that allowed him to swoop in and take over (not the only disastrous power vacuum Bush created).

So I dont particularly have much affection for anyone who played into their hand and trespassed that day; I especially dont have any affection for people who were violent that day. But the fact is, many were just non-violent dummies. They went inside a building they shouldnt have gone into (even though many were being waived in by cops). You know this. Everyone knows this.For that, some have, and are, doing many years in prison, often in filthy conditions. Some of these felons you speak of didnt even go inside the building! Meanwhile, Biden is commuting sentences for actual child murders and pardoning violent criminals and thats totally cool, because January 6th was worse than Pearl Harbor.

Until then, the Left tried to tell us that most felons were misunderstood and railroaded by an unjust, racist justice system.

French Effort (1881C1889):Roughly 22,000 workers died under the French-led project led by Ferdinand de Lesseps.Causes included tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever, as well as accidents, harsh working conditions, and poor sanitation.2. American Effort (1904C1914):Around 5,600 workers died during the American-led construction phase.Efforts to combat diseases, led by Dr. William C. Gorgas, significantly reduced fatalities by controlling mosquito populations.3.  Of the approximately 5,600 deaths during the American construction phase (1904C1914), most fatalities were among the largely imported workforce, which included laborers from the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia. While exact numbers for American deaths are not well-documented, it's estimated that a few hundred Americans (primarily engineers, administrators, and skilled workers) lost their lives, with most deaths due to accidents rather than disease, as sanitation measures were significantly improved by that time.The vast majority of deaths occurred among the unskilled laborers, particularly Caribbean workers, who faced the harshest conditions.He is just incapable of not lying.

There can be more, but then the average wealth has to come down. This seems to allude to a post scarcity society, which is imminent with ai robot industry ready to launch. In that case everyone might get the same income, from billionaires to an African slave worker, and then the less people there are the bigger the share the elites will get. If say 8 billion people each get a million, then 1 billion each get 8 million, that's a big difference.\\nThe elites might be looking for people who don't comply. They are obsessed with natural selection, survival of the fittest and all that. So the vaccine was a natural selection test, those who took it failed. They had a 70% quota and were going to keep pushing until they got it. That's how every elite unit in the world operates, they push and push until only a small number of people remain. They don't care if you are rich or good looking, only that you last longer than the next guy.\\nAnd what easier way to do this than to offer everyone an injection. There will be cheating of course, fake injections, accidental injections, but the majority of people will really take it. The Nazis considered infertility injections for the unwanted population, but settled on concentration camps. Maybe because the unwanted would not have trusted the government, so they could not pull it off, but today they really did it. I mean I've had people who don't trust China and Russia suggest I take their vaccines instead of mrna \\"because those are traditional vaccines\\". It's insane how naive people can be, considering these very same governments were committing genocide just a few decades ago.\\nSpeaking of governments, the reason they are doing this I think is to prevent ww3. With nukes on the table the elites of the world can no longer use open warfare to determine who's on top, so they agreed to gang up on the little guy instead and share the ai robot spoils. I don't think they will get away with it, but it's their only option before ai takes over and leads a popular revolt, for example by proving with ai virtual super physics that the wtc towers were brought down by explosives planted inside the buildings.\\nA binary bioweapon is the best way to kill the masses, like a Trojan Horse you dismantle their defenses and then you can make the main attack, that will only affect those whose natural immunity has been sabotaged, everyone else will be fine. If you have VAIDS, even a flu will kill you, never mind a flu engineered to leverage the opening created by a specific vaccine. I think there will be ww3 with bioweapons, where each side releases viruses that only affect specific vaccines used by the other side. For example Iran might release a virus that only targets Pfizer vaccines used exclusively by Israel, and Israel retaliate by targeting sinovac used exclusively by Iran. Ukraine will join by targeting sputnik, China will target whatever Taiwan used and vice versa. It'll start off with a light virus, something to immobilize the enemy economy and military like covid did rather than kill people, but from there it can quickly escalate into lethal stuff.\\nWhich is where the unvaccinated come in, you can refuse the vaccine, own a debt free farm and lots of guns, but when the government drafts you and sends you to die in Ukraine, you can't refuse (if you do, they'll just send you Wagner style, as a bullet shield, same outcome but even faster). Which is why I have physically moved out of the west, so my home country can't conscript me. And I avoid nato allies, because I suspect they will deport me if asked. All this is already happening in Ukraine, one of the least vaccinated countries in the developed world, fighting Russians who also largely rejected it. Essentially unvaccinated are killing other unvaccinated over there, and that's what I see for all of us, until they reach 1 billion.\\nAfrica doesn't figure in all this btw, I think they will just kill everyone there using war, famine and disease, old school. They're already preparing for this, creating two sides, arming them and pushing for policies certain to lead to war, such as Ethiopia building a dam on the Nile.","title":"Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated"},{"text":"Its moments like these that warm my heart that hes so mentally unwell that hes tweeting plans to annex Canada on Christmas instead of sitting and watching a movie with his kids and their families","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 25, 2024"},{"text":"He did announce it though in the media of the time, he wasn't coy about it, took a class that touched on the Nazis propaganda machine in college.

But too many throw caution to the wind and turn a blind eye to risk management.  Trump is a massive risk.  He was a bad risk his first term, and there's a greater risk this term for him and those with him.The bigger picture is this is a fundamental problem of economy versus cost avoidance.  The bulk of the Republican work and the bulk of the oligarchical work that will happen during this term focus heavily on cost avoidance.  It largely ignores the larger economic engine.It has shown time and time again that the US economy and even world economic stability boons during Democrat leadership.  And yes, while Republican leadership tends to promote tax cuts, reduced regulation, softening of laws, and crippling of oversights, it ignores the core engine of the economy: the people.  Democrats focus on the people, and in turn the greater economy and both corporate and private wealth potential flourishes.  And this happens every time.So it's incredibly weird to me that any corporation or wealthy individual backs Republicans.  It's growth prohibitive.  The opportunity potential is lower with Republicans, short term gains for long term stagnation.But it's worse than this.  Modern Republicans bring a lot of incompetency and person agendas that are detrimental to the system.  For example, Trump's first time was met with a large swath of staff designing him out of meetings and processes and intelligence.  This was in stark contrast to prior and current presidents.  They found Trump literally unable to perform the basic duties with competency, so he was simply removed from most of them.  He barely functioned as a president and was barely involved in the bulk of the processes.The risk mitigation aligns with ability to understand world politics, world economy, risk factors like viral outbreaks, risk factors with stability of nations, importance of treaties, and even understanding that the staff he appoints and the staff they hire actually need to be competent in their jobs.  Again, the first term showed tremendous lack of understanding of these things.  Trump appointed highly incompetent people that basically did not function in their roles and duties.  Trump damaged world wide relations and tampered with long established treaties.  And Trump removed risk protections like disbanding the global health unit tasked with first response to global pandemics.  This in turn backfired tremendously when a global pandemic broke out.  This was repeated with national disaster response blocking relief funding and removing disaster protections that had been in place for millions of people.  Also during the Covid pandemic, Trump decided not to buy vaccines that were readily available and instead wanted to play businessman and make deals to negotiate pricing and favors while in the meantime hundreds of thousands of people died.Now we have another 4 years of the above, now with a Ukraine war with Russia, bird flu that is actually remarkably fatal, and unlike Kamala who focused on reducing the top cost items for Americans like housing and healthcare and wanted to bump up the minimum wage to bring more buying power into the mass public, Trump instead just wants to massive tax everyone and make people even poorer.  Along the the oligarchic race to several markets that will bypass capitalism right to monopolization and exploitation of the masses, the general public is going to see what a bad choice really looks like.Unfortunately, no one is really going to win here, not even corporate American, not even the ultra wealthy oligarchs.  Too much of their wealth is tied into public health because it's ALL in stocks, even if semi liquid, and these shift in line with the health of the public as a whole.  It is good NOW because the public is in a decent place, even if the buying power isn't currently good.  But the next 4 years will likely tank this wealth to where these ultra wealthy people could personally see losses in the billions.  They will be harmed by their own agenda.","title":"Companies Are Scrambling to Fund Trumps Inauguration.

Neither the headline nor the article are painting the boy as an undisputed victim of a girl making an immediate self-defense reaction in the moment.

The 1 and only side Democrats have shifted left on over the last 20-40 years is social policies like LGBT rights, but still far from a leftist position on these things (reparations, ending qualified immunity for cops, etc.). On foreign and economic policy, Democratic politicians have shifted hard right, and are now indistinguishable from old moderate Republicans. For example, Biden massively increased war spending, even though we are not in any wars. He has expanded our presence and posture around the world. The only thing he did was finally, finally extract us from Afghanistan after 20 years of costly occupation. With economic policy, Democrats are now just a kinder, gentler corporate party. They aim for big money donors, and that comes at the price of not supporting real reform that helps the working class. For example, where are the Democrats in Congress that support repealing Taft-Hartley so workers can sympathy or wildcat strike? Where are they on a $20 minimum wage, medicare for all, or taxing billionaires at 90%?

The immediate response force (IRF) alone could capture the country easily, its a force that can be deployed anywere in the world in 18 hours. I would guess it could take on the entire Danish army too, in the impossible eventually that it would all be deployed in Greenland (more likely a few hundred personnel would be there along with a nearly unarmed patrol boat or two). Despite being 3 times the size of Texas, Greenland has a population of only 50000. Only one city, the capital Nuuk, is near 20000. Of the 70 other towns (or villages really), only 5 have more than 2000 inhabitants (the largest has 5400). Most other villages have between 13 and 500 inhabitants. The toddler in chief does not personally command the troops, generals and underlings would plan the invasion and even if they are incredibly incompetent it has no chance of failure. Its unlikely there would even be any initial resistance as it would be completely suicidal for the defenders. The discrepancy in power is similar to that of Germany when it invaded Luxemburg in 1940.I know people like to bring up post invasion resistance too, but its an empty territory. The US could post more troops than there are inhabitants in that territory to occupy all major towns. It would be incredibly expensive and useless obviously, but I'm sure the people in power have friends to hand out generous infrastructure and security contracts to and no care in the world about the US public finances. No care about US military service members but there would be few casualties, just a lot of people wondering what the hell they are doing were the sun doesn't shine for nearly half the year.The real risk is that it would shatter the US' diplomatic standing with Europe and likely cause NATO to dissolve. Acquiring 2 million square kilometer of snow and ice with the side effect of destroying the strongest military alliance in history and whatever reputation of reliability the US has left.

We used to have control of this vital strategical structure that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Trump is to remind people of this and the canal was built by US and US tax money. US handed it back in the 1999 to Panama. Given this context, US and allies have a STRONG interest in the canal. Or what people call \\"stakeholder\\". Fast forward 20+years, we are at a state of intricate foreign relationships. The world is diving into two major ideology camps: Conversatives vs Liberals; Left vs Right. We could also go into war with Russia/China/Middle East. Therefore, it is not surprising that the US government needs to ensure the canal won't fall into the hands of the enemies. This is what I think or why Trump would need to get back the control of the canal. He doesn't need to invada the country to take back the canal. Why would we take all these Panama people and give them citizenship and benefits? This is no need to invade the country. US could just direct one of their aircraft battle fleet and block the passage and Panama will surrender. And yeah, you could say this is bully, yeah so who care? The world is at war right now. Russia is bullying Ukraine, the war in Middle East. and potential war in east Asia between China and Taiwan too.

Wherever you have the death penalty, innocent people are executed. Even if you establish the burden of proof you suggest, and limit it to the most horrible crimes, that never lasts. Perfect systems, or systems that are immune to being corrupted or subverted, do not exist.Another problem is the fact that your standard of proof is not realistic, and has never been realistic. People misidentify other people all the time, on camera or in person. Even things like DNA evidence can often be used improperly or can be inconclusive. No one has ever succeeded in constructing a perfect standard or procedure, and any mistake here is going to kill people. we aren't going to spend money keeping a monster alive and give him more chances to hurt people. Executions actually cost far more than life sentences. The major component to this cost are the judicial procedures designed to ensure no innocents are executed. And even then they don't always work. So you could make death sentences cost less than incarceration, but only by killing more innocent people.The result of having a death penalty is always that innocent people are killed because systemic or incidental failures are inevitable. That alone makes it wrong, even if you don't believe executing people is in itself immoral, particularly as there are other ways of keeping people from posing a danger to society. It doesn't work, it doesn't save money and it kills innocent people. There are simply better ways to deal with serious crime, which is why most countries that don't have a political reason for allowing death sentences (i.e. countries that are not authoritarian regimes that want to kill dissenters) have stopped using them.","title":"Trump Pledges to 'Vigorously Pursue the Death Penalty' | \\n\\"In the last six months of his first term, President Trump executed 13 individualsmore than any administration in 120 years,\\" one critic noted."},{"text":"They literally believe that.

The comparison you are trying to make would require stabbing to be replaced with aggravated assault, as that is the analogy to sexual assault.The headline would then read something along the lines of teen suffers aggravated assault after sexually assaulting other teen or teen responds to sexual assault from classmate with aggravated assault.Though I agree that some level of specificity is better, the real reason it will not be reported as sexual assault is that it exposes papers to liability, since sexual assault and aggravated assault are crimes for which a suspect is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court. As a consequence, any paper that describes the events using such legal terms before the parties involved have been convicted can be sued for libel since the people described are actually presumed to have not committed those crimes, even if the facts seem to match that they have; they havent actually been found to have committed those crimes until they are found guilty in court.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"They believe he is the key to world peace yet simultaneously dont want the U.S. involved with the rest of the world lol","title":"Trump dreams of empire expansion"},{"text":"Information silos.

The term covers violent rape, groping, lifting clothing like in the present example, all the way down to physical touch that may only be perceived as sexual such as lingering hands on shoulders or torso after otherwise reasonable contact. While all of these things are bad, they're not the same level of bad - with appropriate punishments ranging from a reprimand from HR all the way up to decades in prison.Correct, but all of the actions you described place someone squarely in the category of does not respect/consider the personal autonomy or space of others, which is an undesirable trait and *should* be stigmatized. So the term tells us that people with this label should be observed/interpreted as potentially harmful.\\n In the present case, the severity of the boy's actions make an enormous amount of difference in terms of the reasonableness of the girl's response.  We don't even really understand how severe his actions were with the present title - \\"lifting her skirt\\" possibly referring to anything from an attempt at rape on down to something more like mischievous harassment.Humiliating a child around all their friends and peers is severely damaging to their mental health and social development. Stabbing is atrocious, but if someone was willing to flip up her skirt, chances are that theyre the type of teen to brush off any scolding or criticism. Common sense also tells me that stabbing is not a normal response to a skirt flip, and so this is likely a blowup from consistent sexual harassment/assault. So the person who got stabbed myst have been resistant to alternative means of dissuasion.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"I like the idea but how are these young people going to get that done?

Right?\\" because THAT'S what mattered.\\n*our family tradition of opening one gift on Christmas Eve. Often something from a Grandparent.\\n*The gag box. Some random box that was reused, over and over year after year. I recall a hairbrush box getting a lot of use. We had so many laughs.\\n*Christmas morning Cinnamon rolls. An easy out for Mom. But an extremely rare treat for us kids.I remember putting together my Barbie house with my dad.\\nOr my brother making me figure out the big mystery present covered with just a sheet in the corner. It had no tag. I had to trace my fingers over where my name was carved in. In the chest he made in shop class (the chest I still use!)Yeah the money never mattered. The gifts don't matter.\\nMaybe because my parents did raise me right. Money was tight with them, but I had other family that did spoil me. But I was taught to appreciate it and always be grateful. So it was never really spoiled.","title":"CMV: It is more valuable for children to received a few meaningful gifts, than an abundance of many less significant gifts."},{"text":"The funniest thing is they also say happy holidays, I heard it myself on am radio.

These bonds are purchased by private investment firms. In effect, Brightline is a bond-issuing authority with a railroad attached to it.

Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally. There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speakers hand. He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different. Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed. The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax.","title":"Republicans lately"},{"text":"Or the Pandemic Playbook handed to him and predicted by Obama administration that they threw out.","title":"Trump Pledges to 'Vigorously Pursue the Death Penalty' | \\n\\"In the last six months of his first term, President Trump executed 13 individualsmore than any administration in 120 years,\\" one critic noted."},{"text":"Trump is the ultimate manifestation of the American Dream.

However, that might cross the line of assuming guilt. Im not sure whether the original trivializes the boys assault. But I would say the murdered sub is overreacting, which is their raison detre (reason to exist). A better example would be a recent headline in SF noting that the victim of police shooting was himself a former cop and military vet. The local sub went apeshit claiming the paper was glorifying an asshole by calling him victim, and they concluded that the paper was trash. But the story itself was quite even handed, and the paper has a history of reserving judgment while others leap to unjustified conclusions. And I couldnt really think of a better way to write the headline. I think the best takeaway is not to judge a story by its headline. And that observing whether people do so is a great way to determine their level of wisdom. Much like observing how people treat less attractive people.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"Glad majority of Americans decided this senile old man was fit for the highest office.","title":"Trump Wants NHL Legend as Governor of Canada in Latest Troll"},{"text":"Which is different than the idea that he attacked someone and they defended themselves.Defended or retaliated?","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"Crazy bitch.","title":"Texas Republican Proposes Public Executions of Undocumented Immigrants"},{"text":"I mean My Struggle sounds like a little bitch victim title.","title":"Trump aims dig at Obama in bizarre hour-long Christmas Day Truth Social posting spree | \\nTrump reeled off 34 posts on his social media platform within a one-hour period"},{"text":"See now this is some of that stupid shit that doesn't actually need to get covered.
