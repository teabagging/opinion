Walters claims the office will carry out Trumps educational agenda, including the Freedom to Pray initiative.The first prong seeks to attack secular public education by promoting Christian symbolism and prayer in schools, along with religious-infused curricula. In Louisiana, for example, a new law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments was?[blocked earlier this month by a federal judge](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/louisiana-ten-commandments-classrooms-unconstitutional-rcna179767)?and will remain on hold until the case is argued in January.

It joins a number of states that have done so, including South Carolina.The second prong seeks to create publicly funded religious charter schools, now seen as the first phase in the larger fight to do away with the U.S. Education Department, which the far right sees as a woke cartel. At the heart of this fight is a proposed charter school in Oklahoma, the[?St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School.?](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/oklahoma-high-court-rejects-plan-publicly-funded-religious-school-rcna158860)If approved, it would become the nations first publicly funded religious charter school.

These rituals were done with the aim of personal growth of participants with an intended purpose of connecting spiritually with a lost deep masculine identity or inner self.It originated from feminist Movements in the late 1800's and to the early 1900's. Men saw the freedom and liberation it brought women to freely explore their gender and not be bound by the expectation of being defined by \\"the opposite\\" (which would be by men). Likewise, men wanted to be defined by themselves and not what \\"the opposite\\" defined them as. A key concept in feminist theory is that we define \\"what is a man\\" and \\"what is a women\\" not by what it is, but by what is *isn't supposed to be.* We define masculinity (in the traditional sense) by anything not feminine, and femininity as anything not masculine. Lacon or any Jungian author could help explain this idea further if you want. The term \\"Toxic Masculinity\\" was created *by men* trying to have their own \\"feminist movement.\\" These movements were important to trying to help ailing men with their grief about being a man in a post-industrial world where they arent burndened with the unrealistic expectations placed on them by the patriarchy. But something changed..CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED AROUND THE 1980'S?These men were branded terrorists and \\"weak men\\" by the establishment and thrusted in the anuls of history. MGTOW was originally branched off from the Mythopoetic Men's Movement by men who were let's say still kinda on the side of the patriarchy. And in 2004, being upheld by the worst people on the internet until in 2014, about the time when the Nazi's came online, Milo Yiannopoulos made it mainstream and became a beacon for incels. The original purpose completely subverted and the original message to men to serve the very system they tried to get rid of. It's really sad to see the only real surviving group around the time of the MMM and its for men who are so angry at women achieving freedom and liberation they will do anything to see them suffer even if they themselves are invalid as a result.Edit: I feel I should clarify too, MGTOW branched off the larger Men's Movements that came from the large braches of all of them, not necessarily from the Mythopoetic Men's Movement. There's more evidence it came from the Men's Rights Movement that also happened the same time, as it had very different goals as well as philosophy. There's actually quite a sizeable amounts of [Men's Movements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_movement) at the time.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Current administration guidelines suggest getting real close and smelling the hair weirdly","title":"Bizarre moment Trump asks to buy young girls hair for millions at golf club"},{"text":"it was a topic at the debate, their golf handicaps, we know this is what the country cares most abotu","title":"Biden Will Be at Trump's Inauguration"},{"text":"They need cheap housecleaners and landscapers, lol.","title":"Deporting Illegal Immigrants Will Define Trumps Legacy  and in a Shock Poll, 3 Out of 4 Americans Now Say Its a Priority"},{"text":"Exactly this.

Men are looking for a form of social independence not seeking literal independence from a system that has forced their lives and well-being to depend on the permissions, restraint. and good will of the other gender. It's the difference between a decision to live a certain way versus a form of revolution against a ruling class. Not that there's anything wrong with the idea of either one as long as it doesn't get too misogynistic or misandrist although I'll point out the necessary truth that misogyny is much more likely to end in violence. Like if I were to get fed up with the system and go, \\"ugh I hate men.\\" It's pretty much just words that they don't mean literally. Even if they are 4B (though some do-but the extent of it is usually just deciding to be 4B, not actually going out to enact violence against men).  Whereas when a man hates women he often contributes to a culture of violence against them, very likely harassing them himself or contributing to the popularity of violent porn, sexual  harassment, and potentially even assaulting, raping, and murdering them himself in extreme cases. Like who really hates who you know? I'll admit that MGOTW is not inherently like that but I've been a curious observer in the community and the level of hatred I see towards women is staggering whereas women in 4B for the most part is more of a defensive strategy against a world that hates women enough to put their lives and rights in danger.

Telling women \\"you are right to be afraid of men and avoid them because they're (all/mostly) dangerous\\" *is* wrong. It's like the man vs bear example: rationally speaking, if you told me I was going to be 5 feet away from a random man or a random bear in the middle of the wilderness, of *course* I ought to choose the random man, because almost all men would be perfectly safe to encounter in the wilderness, whereas a random bear has a nontrivial probability of attacking you in that situation. Any person/politician who says the bear is the safer choice is doing something wrong.At the same time, I *don't* think it's \\"bigoted\\" to \\"take precautions around men\\". NOT because all men are dangerous, but because a small portion of men are dangerous, and it's OK to be a bit cautious.I've had *many* female friends who have a story about a man approaching them and giving off super-creepy vibes. E.g., my girlfriend has multiple times had a guy follow her in a car while she was jogging. Just... follow her, going at her speed for a few blocks, until she found a way to \\"get away\\" / get to a place with other cars. I've never had that happen to me, and I can't really imagine it happening to me - but if that was something that had happened to me a couple times, I'd be a bit more cautious walking around by myself.I think whether caution like this is bigoted depends on your reasoning and your level of caution.I think it's *always* bigoted to turn away customers of a \\"public accommodation\\" (a business/service open to the public) because of their race, gender, etc. Part of running that kind of business is agreeing to work with everyone. E.g., an Uber driver only picking up women, or refusing to pick up black people, would be wrong.I think it's *not* always bigoted for a woman to cross the street when a big, burly man is coming her way on a dark night. After all, while almost all big, burly men are lovely people, a small fraction are not - and being big and burly, the tiny fraction who *are* dangerous would be able to overpower a woman who got too close to them. If it were *always* bigoted to cross the street in this situation, then wouldn't we be telling women that they have to frequently get very close to strange men on a dark night, even though a small fraction of men harass or assault women, and wouldn't this lead to women occasionally being assaulted when they could have avoided it?That said, it *can* be bigoted to cross the street in this case, if the woman's decision-making is based on bigoted beliefs (e.g., \\"all men are pigs / monsters\\").Edit to add: it'd also be either bigoted or simply rude/hurtful for a woman to ostentatiously cross the street, glaring fearfully at the approaching man. Obviously she should look out for herself first, but she should be aware that he's almost certainly a lovely person and should be mindful of his experience, too.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"The OP is suggesting he didn't legitimately win, that's what I was contesting.

The manosphere is a highly, highly, misogynistic group founded on principles of anti-feminism and male supremacy. It is simply one branch of the redpill philosophy. 4b is a movement that branched from pretty mainstream feminism. Feminism, as a whole, is an ideology that aims to achieve gender equality via focusing on womens rights. Its not about hating men, its about getting us to a point where men and women are treated like equals. So thats just the start. One of these movements came from a hate group, the other came from a civil rights movement. If thats not enough, maybe you should also consider this: womens reproductive rights are absolutely under attack, so abstaining from sex is not simply a political statement. Its a way to protect oneself. Women in states with strict abortion bans are literally dying, and its not misandrist to want to avoid that fate. On top of that, the event that triggered 4b in the US is the election of a man whose party platform includes stripping rights away from women. This includes, but is absolutely not limited to, no fault divorce. Do you know who suffers the most when no fault divorce is gone? Women. Its not a bad thing for women to want to protect themselves from this. With all of that said: no one owes anyone sex or a relationship. The problem with MGTOW was never that men simply wanted to do their own thing. The problem was that they did it while spouting misogynistic rhetoric, AND they did it in such a way that hurt women in other ways. Example: plenty of MGTOW men have stated openly that they refuse to hire women, if women already work for them they refuse to talk to them, etc. this bars women from economic opportunities, and given that men still control the majority of businesses, its not okay for men to have that mindset.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"/u/SuicidalChaos (OP) has awarded 4 delta(s) in this post.All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1h0ifqn/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_the_4b_movement_and_mgtow/), in /r/DeltaLog.Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"From the [article](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/11/26/trump-will-deliver-the-final-death-blow-to-the-liberal-order):Some?[human rights organisations](https://reproductiverights.org/trump-presidency-2024-threats-reproductive-freedoms/)?also expect an uptick in surveillance and prosecution of abortion service providers and patients.

Can't get clean and fresh with water pouring out of the pipes before the shower head!We, the People, can make a difference.  A.I. hasn't dominated every facet of making and selling things . . . yet.I'll focus, for the sake of brevity, on one aspect.  Unions.Most labor unions were compromised and corrupted for a very long time, and no longer truly work for the benefit of the represented employee, under it's idealistic design of 100+ years ago.Yet, they do still have potential power, if forced by their membership to properly utilize it.The Teamsters were forced to listen to their membership and hold off on making a POTUS candidate endorsement, which goes completely against their standard operating procedure these days.  They've grown political, using membership dues for influence in government, rather than forcing prudent corporate governance.  The proverbial cutting out the copper before the showerhead.If you look into the history of the labor union, it began with \\"locals\\" being just that.  Local.  Like, within a specific company, and within a specific shop within that company, some workers represented the group to management, knowing the needs of their co-workers from practical experience.Fast forward to today, and you can go to college and get a degree in Union Management, never be in that craft, yet speaking for the worker that is.  This is a flaw.  But, it can be corrected.  Once people become informed as to how bastardized their paid-for power is with union representation, they can work to make changes on the short term that place a union in a position to help protect that copper piping and keep the shower head running.  The union is more nimble in their ability to be a voice for positive change than the behemoth corporation, or the super-behemoth government.   The unionized worker has great power, if they return the power to themselves.But, in many facets beyond just unions, we're going to have to prepare for some pain to reap the reward.  On a personal note, I was doing some home remodeling.  In that process, I spilled blood and sweat and tears.  But, the sweetness of the reward of finishing it was enhanced by my very own \\"skin\\" in my very own \\"game\\".  The project took much longer than expected.  However, for better, or worse, I don't have a nagging wife harping on me to finish it quicker.  I'm confident that if I did, it would have been finished faster, with the same amount or more of blood, sweat and tears that accompanied.  A Union has the ability to be the corporations nagging wife.","title":"Tariffs and slave labor"},{"text":"Protest voting is performance art for narcissists who want to virtue signal but don't actually care about the people or values they profess to.","title":"Eric Trump demonstrates in 30 seconds he doesnt have a clue how tariffs work"},{"text":" And, Rolling Stone, I think the word you want is \\"bearing \\" but I'm not a professional writer.That jumped out at me too.

There are actually two separate codes provided by two separate parties. You would consider one party good and one party bad. I don't place those labels, because I don't find them necessary or accurate.Both codes serve the same purpose- to provide information to the public. The codes are not a secret language that the issuing entities use to communicate to each other. Both issuing entities are fully telepathic. Any major event that is planned to happen in our reality by any party with power to control the reality is required by the hard coded laws of this world to disclose those plans in advance. There is no getting around this rule. However, disclosure does not have to be straightforward. It can be hidden in plain sight, and the party you would consider bad has created so many distractions that it is virtually impossible for most people to see the code, let alone crack it.The codes themselves are largely irrelevant. Cracking them does not really help you. Until you master your own self, you cannot do anything to stop or change planned events. What it is important to focus on is your own personal growth.

MGTOW essentially sees women as less than men and more like obstacles, so women are treated like objects instead of people. On a fundamental level, they also differ wildly. 4B is essentially abstinence until change happens. MGTOW still has having sex with women as a goal. As I understand it, you focus on improving yourself, but you also treat women like a cash commodity, still having sex with them, but treating them like garbage / not committing / playing with emotions type of stuff. You do stuff to improve your own self esteem, which in this case means devaluing the status of the opposite sex to ensure your own value stays high. To me they are very different on multiple levels, and even in terms of outcome are very different. To your original viewpoint, 4B women dont have sex, dont want to have sex, and wont have sex until change occurs. MGTOW men still want to have sex, its just that they devalue women to be completely inferior, so that their own ego is boosted and they dont have to have emotional commitment because it would hold them back. I think this is the simplest challenge to your viewpoint - one still has sex, the other doesnt.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Yeah, 34 separate accounts of paying hush money to  the same individual for one sexual act.","title":"Trump Charges to be Dropped"},{"text":"Which would probably lead to 90% public approval for total war","title":"Take Trumps Threats of U.S. Military Action in Mexico Seriously"},{"text":"Even the huevos will cost more.","title":"Trump vows 25% tariff on imports from Mexico, Canada: What are tariffs?"},{"text":"I'm rooting for whatever Trump does that hurts his base.

Because paying $20/hr cash let's them avoid payroll taxes, health insurance, bonding costs, etc. Migrant cash workers that work normal full time jobs lower the working standards for everyone.

It wasn't men going their own way, it was men posting about how they hated women, how all women were guaranteed to cheat, how all women were gold diggers, and yes, posts inciting violence against women, which lead to the subreddit being banned. Calls to shoot your ex or find a young woman and sexually assault her were, while not common, common enough that the mods of MGTOW weren't handling it to the point their sub got banned. I watched that sub up until it was banned and it was constant bitter hatred towards women, with the few positive posts that encouraged hobbies or actual ways to decenter women getting no traction or even fairly negative comments from the other men. Looking at the main 4b subreddit, it's mostly women talking about how they tried dating and it wasn't for them, or how they are autistic and haven't done well in relationships already, or how they just don't want kids anyway. They're not posting any calls for violence. I can't find any posts that say they hate men, or that all men are evil, or that all men are rapists. It's talking about how if there's no right to abortion, having sex where pregnancy is a possibility is dangerous and not for them. I've also not seen the feared and discussed constantly \\"feminist screaming kill all men\\" in their threads at all while browsing. The women seem fairly positive and upbeat about hobbies and ways to decenter men, and those posts tend to get decent traction in the subreddit with positive comments. Right now, while there are similarities, the difference is in actions and words.  One group was encouraging violence and spouting sexist rhetoric in nearly every post. The other one is mostly actually managing to hold to the goal of decentralizing men. Of course, if this changes an 4B women start posting regular hate against men and memes saying all men are X, Y, or Z, then I will revisit my view. If the women start calling for violence against men the same way, they'd deserve just as much criticism.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"I dont know how all these white supremacists can continue thinking they are the superior race after voting a conman as president.","title":"CNN National Exit Survey Finalizes - Gen Z Hispanic Men swing hard &amp; tie Gen Z White Men at 54% &amp; 53% Trump, Gen Z Black Men very slightly slip from 2020 to 77% Kamala"},{"text":"I'm so tired of insane wannabe crusaders.

This form of thinking is very tribal and primitive in nature. To attribute personality traits (which are highly volatile and vary from individual to individual) to a whole group, based on anecdotal evidence is flawed because it doesn't account for thousands, millions, or in this case- billions of people in which one has never met, spoken to, or even has had the opportunity to understand.

But you have to put both movements in a social context.4B, as you say, is a movement started in response to rampant misogyny in South Korea. And keep in mind, an extremely common complaint by women is that the division of labor is unfair - they're expected to do 100% of the housework, child rearing, taking responsibility for birth control etc. Basically, in all 4 aspects of the 4B movement, women are feeling not just oppressed, but overworked and undervalued. So you can see the 4B movement not just as refusing to interact with men because of sexism, but also as a way for women to reclaim their time and labor - by only taking care of themselves and not their boyfriends/husbands as well. In addition, the reason it's sorta catching on in the US is because after the election and the repeal of Roe v Wade, a lot of women feel like their rights are under attack and it might not be safe to get pregnant, because they might not have access to health care if something goes wrong. In that context, adopting the 4B movement is literally for their own protection - can't die of pregnancy complications if you don't have sex with men, right?MGTOW started a few years ago in Western countries (the US first I think?) because men believed the opposite of the 4B movement: that men were actually disadvantaged in Western society, that finding love as a man was impossible, and that they might as well give up on women altogether. But you'll notice that the motivations aren't quite the same here: in 4B, women want to stop being mistreated by men. In MGTOW, men want women to stop ignoring them. In fact, a lot of incel rhetoric and principles permeate MGTOW, especially around ideas of how women date (super promiscuous when young, find a sucker to attach themselves to and get money from when they get older, etc).You also have to look at the timing: 4B starts during a wave of anti-woman sentiment, and women want to disengage from men because they feel mistreated and oppressed. MGTOW starts, in fact, at a peak of success for women and feminism - more women than ever are independent, make their own money, and don't need to be reliant on men to provide for them. And when I say that, keep in mind that until 1974, banks could consider the marital status of a woman when reviewing credit applications. So until 50 years ago, and about 30 years before the start of MGTOW, there were some *real* barriers to financial independence for women. So right about when women can exercise more agency and have higher standards for the men in their lives, because they don't *need* a man, is when a lot of men start feeling like finding love is too hard because women's standards are too high. Are you connecting the dots yet?My point here is that 4B, in many ways, is a way for women to protect themselves from a sexist society. MGTOW is not that. It's, at best, a reactionary movement that responds to women's independence by saying \\"ok but what about me?\\" At worst, it's a temper tantrum that simply existing as a man is no longer enough to get a woman.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Its wild how a DOJ policy has more weight than the rule of law or justice for that matter.","title":"Jack Smith Has Made a Grave Mistake Letting Trump Off the Hook | \\nWhat became of the principle that no person is above the law, not even a former president?"},{"text":"*Boris the Grifter*","title":"Top Trump aide accused of seeking money to boost potential nominees"},{"text":"I was just watching a documentary about a plane crash.

Women aren't entitled to men's romantic attention any more than men are entitled to women's romantic attention. The problem is that MGTOW, as a movement. Is led by people who *don't* leave women alone. Andrew Tate is a human trafficker. I don't know anyone in the 4B movement who has trafficked men. That is the opposite of leaving men alone. The rhetoric and rationale behind the movements also seems slightly different. 4B is in response to women facing systemic discrimination, violence, and disrespect in the form of intense misogyny driven by an entitlement to women's bodies and labor. Its goal is for society to change its mistreatment of women. In the US it gained popularity after the country voted for Trump despite him having helped overturn roe v wade which has led to spikes in maternal mortality. The number one cause of death for women who are pregnant or postpartum in the US is being murdered, often by an intimate partner. So the threat of both systemic and interpersonal violence is very real. And it is caused in large part by men, as men were more likely to vote for Trump, men make up the majority of government and the supreme Court, and men are typically the ones being violent towards women.The MGTOW movement is based less in grievances towards systemic discrimination, and more in a reaction to cultural rejection. Women aren't statistically more likely to kill them or trying to take away their rights, but they are more vocal about their anger towards men and rejection of the status quo around what they see as toxic masculinity. But since women's behavior around this is driven by their systemic oppression, the MGTOW movement almost seems to be an expression of *\\"We're mad that you're mad about being oppressed. So we're gonna reject you the same way you're rejecting us.\\"*Like I said there is nothing wrong with a man deciding to go solo because of negative interactions with women. Power to him. But people are justified in having different feelings towards 4b and MGTOW based on their pop culture leadership and motivations.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"I am more worried about trump and co than all their paranoia created delusional enemies.","title":"Trump Camp Says China is Attacking U.S. with Fentanyl.

They're calling for SOF raids and airstrikes conducted by the US military possibly without coordination with and consent by the Mexican government, under the theory that even the most optimistic estimates about cartel fragility are too cautious.Realistically, this is playing on the racism and hate the GOP have been cultivating in the US populace, and the goal is to saber rattle and produce strike footage and dead brown people for Trump to parade on social media.

This allows them to control not just politicians, but also the media, more effectively than at any point in history.While it's true that wealthy Americans have always shaped media to serve their interests, most of today's media landscape is dominated by a few monopolies, making it easier for the ultra-wealthy to manipulate information on an unprecedented scale. This consolidation of power simply wasn't possible in the past.You argue that the middle class has historically been able to push back against wealth concentration, but that assumes the same dynamics are at play. Automation and AI are reducing the reliance on human labor, which weakens the middle classs bargaining power. Furthermore, advanced surveillance and technology gives elites tools to suppress dissent far more efficiently than any government could in the past.As for Trump's economic policies, while you claim things might need to worsen before improving, the ultra-wealthy are mostly insulated from these consequences. They wont feel the pain of tariffs or inflation in the same way the middle and working classes will, if they notice them at all, allowing them to retain their power while others suffer.In conclusion, relying on historical patterns ignores the profound technological and economic changes that have fundamentally shifted the balance of power. The mechanisms that once allowed for systemic change are being eroded, and theres no guarantee that worsening conditions will lead to improvement for the majority.","title":"CMV: money in politics will lead to a new age techno-feudalism in the US"},{"text":"Do it!

They also know that people who are like Hitler cannot be trusted and must be reined in and kept under thumb. The GOP and the SCOTUS used him to get votes and into power, but even then, the GOP has a slim margin of power and a lot of chaos in their caucus. They won't hand him, or even Vance, total power because they cannot be trusted. Make no mistake, the illusion of unity in the GOP is just that, an illusion. Behind the scenes, they plot and scheme against one another on the daily. Keeping the Status Quo in place is their best bet to maintain their power.Another advantage we have today is Trump is no Hitler.Hitler was intelligent and did good things for Germany (still a mass murdering monster and deserves to burn in hell for all eternity) and pulled Germany out of a massive depression after WW1 and made them into an economic powerhouse. Life for the Non-Jewish, average German was good under Hitler.Trump is old, stupid, has dementia, possibly has cancer or other terminal condition (hence why he has been rapidly losing weight, has pale thin lips, and is caking more makeup on to hide his deathly pallor), and will NOT cause an economic boom but a recession or possibly depression with this catastrophic economic incompetence that will piss off the majority of the country.Trump will be unable to rally support, publicly or politically, in the way Hitler did in Germany. Even then, Hitler had people trying to assassinate him all the time so even he didn't score that 100% lord and master level of loyalty he dreamt of. If Hitler couldn't do it being younger and more influential, Trump being an old, dying moron sure as hell can't.The SCOTUS and the GOP know this. They know Trump's time is up and the MAGA movement will fall apart. They'll do what they can to cut social programs and give more tax breaks to billionaires and corporations, but come 2026, their party will be in the toilet, and they know it. They'll lose the majority in the house and senate, crawl back under their rocks, criticize everything democrats do and try again in 2028 to regain their power, but will lose because of the hatred there will be for Vance and his ass kissing of Trump. Yeah, it'll be Vance in 28 because he, along with Trump's \\"cabinet\\" will betray the Orange Fucker and 25th amendment his ass faster than you can say \\"aortic dissection\\".The last thing that keeps the SCOTUS and the GOP from giving Trump total power: The American people. Americans are the most heavily armed, unstable, pissed off and violent population on the planet. If they gave Trump total power and he crossed the wrong line with the American people, there will be armed revolts, daily assassination attempts on political leaders lives and complete and total chaos. The cops will turn on them, the military will turn on them, and there will be no one to protect the GOP or SCOTUS or even Trump.

You're looking for individual promises made by candidates during a short campaign vs the overall ideologies (or at least perceived ideologies) of the two parties. The left has, for a long while now, been hyper-focused on identity politics. Everything is seemingly broken down into who should be considered an oppressed class and who should be an oppressor class. Race, class, and sex. And the bad guys, in most of the breakdowns, are men. Unless it's a question just of race, in which case minority men and women would be the oppressed and white men and women would be the oppressors. But even in those cases, there's \\"intersectionality\\" where minority women can be oppressed by the intersecting oppressors of both whites and men.The whole idea of toxic masculinity is from the left and, while not against all men, does give the lingering impression that its message is basically \\"all men are trained to be toxic by society.\\" But most, if not all, of the characteristics that are considered \\"toxically masculine\\" are actually not at all gender specific. So on one hand you have a \\"men are bad\\" message, then on the other hand, the left promotes quite vigorously the idea that there's no such thing as the \\"gender binary.\\" People are not born one gender, they're just assigned one at birth. So the message young men hear from the leftand I'm not saying this is the accurate message, just their perceptionis that men are mostly bad, but also not really an actual thing, unless we need to point out how they're running everything and getting paid more than women and dangerous, in which case they're a thing that's bad.I don't think there's a lot of messaging coming out of the left, for a long while, that's particularly inviting to men. I wouldn't go so far as to call it misandrist, but I think it can be seen that way. Especially online.

Trump could reinstate travel bans for certain countries, restrict or delay visas, deny federal funding to colleges that offer financial aid to undocumented students, and even call for deporting undocumented students.There is a lot of fear and anxiety, said Rebecca Hamlin, professor of legal studies and political science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Some campus leaders and immigration?[advocates are advising](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/07/metro/massachusetts-lawyers-helping-daca-recipients/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)?foreign students and professors to return to campus from winter break?[before Trump takes office](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/16/metro/trump-umass-amherst-immigration-foriegn-students-election/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), carry copies of immigration documents in case they are stopped by law enforcement, and invest in travel insurance if traveling abroad.Many higher-education leaders fear that Trumps isolationist and anti-immigration rhetoric could discourage talented foreign students and professors from coming to the United States. Enrollment of new international students declined by about 8 percent between 2016 and 2019, according to data from Open Doors, largely due to visa restrictions and heightened screening processes under the Trump administration, said Miriam Feldblum, executive director of the Presidents Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.Declines in international student enrollments over the next few years would be a devastating cultural and financial loss for colleges, many of which are already struggling to keep a balanced budget amid declining populations of US college-aged students, according to several higher-education leaders and professors. Schools rely on foreign students as a critical source of revenue because most pay the full cost of attendance. Foreign talent is also crucial for fostering innovation and conducting groundbreaking medical and scientific research, colleges say.We want to have a student body with students from everywhere, and the truth of the matter is, Massachusetts needs an infusion of talent from people who come here all over the world for our workforce, said Marty Meehan, president of the University of Massachusetts system.More than 82,000 international students study in Massachusetts, said Rob McCarron, chief executive of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts.The higher-education system in the US is still the envy of the world, and even more so in Massachusetts, with the incredible array of institutions that are here, McCarron said.[Lawyers are helping some](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/07/metro/massachusetts-lawyers-helping-daca-recipients/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)?of the 400,000 undocumented students studying at US colleges to apply for more protected immigration statuses through employers, while also preparing to defend students who could be detained because of travel bans or mass deportation orders.","title":"College campuses scramble to protect foreign and undocumented students under Trump"},{"text":"Donald Trump is mad at the fact that conservatives don't run Mexico and Canada, so Donald wants to punish them like they were 'blue states' here.","title":"Trump vows 25% tariff on imports from Mexico, Canada: What are tariffs?"},{"text":"I agree.

Trans is a fact of the 21 Century, not a growing trend. The radical libs are as guilty as the conservative in sowing disharmony between Main Street and this back yard identity. There is a natural course to societal change: we start with fear (mostly of the unknown) then we learn a bit and move to reluctant tolerance. From there we grow tolerance, then acceptance and finally institutionalization (laws). In the case of Trans, none of us, were allowed to evaluate and adjust. We were told, even legislated, at the fear stage. The Lefts bad! Going so far as cancelling comedians -one of our pressure relief mechanisms for things we do not understand.The Trans community were described by two competing radical Left and Right notions, they did not reveal themselves to us, they were interpreted for us. Many feel robbed, not by the Trans reality, but by the short circuiting of the organic means of societal accommodation: discovery- fear- knowledge- tolerance- acceptance\\n-institutionalization.  We went through this exactly with gays. Now, the gay community is lumped in a group of people (LBGT+) that are just a loose assembly of non-conforming on the sex/gender expectation scale and the Gay community have almost had to go back and start again to restore their institutional protections.It is a biological fact, one can not suck and blow at the same time.

The mistake would have been to continue. Trump will make the prosecutions disappear either way, as the article agrees. Prosecuting him will only feed his supporters rage. It also does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Continuing the prosecution would only give further credibility to trump's victim complex and amplify his victory over injustice narrative. Forcing maga politicians and judges to demonstrate their disregard for institutional rules hasn't stopped them so far, in fact it seems to embolden their maga base. They want to destroy the establishment. And so do many non maga trump voters. The establishment has never worked for these people, only for those above water. Anyone under water, nothing has changed for them. Continuing to prosecute him will only feed the misconception that democrats are determined to stamp out their hopes. _What became of the principle that no person is above the law, not even a former president?_The principle of nobody being above the law only works in the absence of corruption. There's has always been corruption. With or without trump. In order to uphold this principle, you would need a justice system that punishes every law breaking politician. There's a long line of criminals in politics that will never be brought to justice, next to a paltry few who were. That's just how things operate in DC. Politicians rely on \\"greasing palms.\\" We practically made bribery legal. You can't uphold pie in the sky ideals under circumstances that are less than pie in the sky. The more incongruence between the idea and the circumstances, the more miscalculated the results. The more people see the chasm between idea and practice. The US government represents corporations and the extremely wealthy. Not the average people. This is no longer a controversial or fringe opinion, if it ever was. Citizens United accelerated this change. When things don't work and people get desperate, they choose any other option than the same old thing. They would rather choose a hero that flips the table and scatters all the pieces. They are tired of playing the game. Ironically, flipping the table and scattering the pieces does not guarantee a fairer game and may make their circumstances worse. But that is after the fact. They will still do it. There is no winning move here. Only losing ones and more losing ones. I argue prosecuting is the more losing one. The other option is to admit defeat in this round and prepare for the next one. If there is a next one.","title":"Jack Smith Has Made a Grave Mistake Letting Trump Off the Hook | \\nWhat became of the principle that no person is above the law, not even a former president?"},{"text":"The infighting has already begun.

Lets set the record straight with facts:**Billionaires Did Not Absorb Market Fluctuations**: During the COVID-19 pandemic; Billionaires **profited massively**. Between March 2020 and November 2021, their wealth increased by **$1.7 trillion** (Americans for Tax Fairness, 2021) due to Federal Reserve policies that inflated asset values. Meanwhile, ordinary Americans suffered:\\\\- **22 million jobs were lost** (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020).\\\\- **Over** **10 million households fell behind on rent** (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021).The evidence shows that billionaires were insulated from the economic fallout and actually *gained* wealth during the crisis, **while everyday people faced hardship**.**Billionaires Inflate Housing Costs:** Large investment firms backed by billionaires, such as **Blackstone** have turned single-family homes into investment vehicles, driving up housing prices. From 2020 to 2023, **housing prices rose by 45%** (Federal Reserve, 2023). This has directly **priced out** middle-class families, preventing them from buying homes and building wealth.**Wages Have Not Kept Up with Productivity:** From 1979 to 2018, productivity in the U.S. rose by 69.6%, but wages only grew by 11.6% (Economic Policy Institute, 2020). This wage stagnation is a direct result of corporate practices, including:\\\\- **Anti-union tactics.**\\\\- **Outsourcing jobs.**\\\\- **Automation.**These practices have kept wages stagnant while corporate profitsand billionaire wealthcontinue to grow.**Wealth Inequality Hurts Economic Growth**: The International Monetary Fund (2015) directly states that **rising wealth inequality slows economic growth and deepens recessions**. When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, it reduces middle-class spending, which is essential for economic demand. This leads to slower overall economic growth and contributes to economic instability.**Billionaire-Controlled Monopolies Drive Up Basic Goods Prices:** Monopolistic control by billionaire-led companies in sectors like agribusiness has led to increased prices for basic goods.\\\\- **The meatpacking industry is controlled by just four major firms, all with ties to billionaire wealth.** These firms inflated meat prices during the pandemic, even while production costs stayed stable (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2022).?\\\\- This consolidation reduces competition and directly contributes to higher food prices.These price increases disproportionately affect middle- and lower-income households, who are most vulnerable to inflation.**Amazon Reduces Wages**: Amazon, a company with direct ties to billionaire wealth, has been shown to **cut warehouse wages by $1.6 billion annually** compared to industry averages (Economic Policy Institute, 2021). This is a direct result of Amazons focus on profit maximization at the expense of fair compensation for workers.Billionaires do not stabilize the economy or improve middle-class purchasing power. The evidence suggests rising billionaire wealth is directly linked to:**- Stagnant wages.*- Unaffordable housing.*- Inflated living costs.*- Economic instability.*If you can provide evidence that the growth of billionaire wealth doesn't harm the middle class and stabilizes the economy more than the harm it causes**, Id be eager to examine it. Until then, your claims remain unsubstantiated. Remember, the burden of proof doesnt rest solely on one side; *both* of us need to support our positions with credible evidence.","title":"CMV: money in politics will lead to a new age techno-feudalism in the US"},{"text":"Trump voters, \\"Groceries are too expensive!\\"\\nTrump, \\"I'll make them cost $125 for what used to be $100!\\"\\nTrump voters, \\"Yay Tru....wait, what?\\"","title":"Mexico suggests it would impose its own tariffs to retaliate against any Trump tariffs"},{"text":"Thats just for declassifying.","title":"Mexico suggests it would impose its own tariffs to retaliate against any Trump tariffs"},{"text":"Legalize and regulate is less about accepting the drug as \\"okay\\" or \\"beneficial\\" and more about providing safe supply, opening up lines of communication between doctors and addicted patients, providing supports, minimizing crime, and ending elicit markets.You can't half ass it though; safe supply needs to be accompanied by a robust policy framework or else you can end up with a free for all Iike you see in some places, and an eventual public knee-jerk response/backlash.

If you haven't heard of it I suggest reading into the Opium wars. From about 1840 to 1860 China was at war with Great Britain and for a time France because China had attempted to ban opoim. Both the British and the French benefitted from their citizens deoendance on the drug and so they went to war with China to force them to legalize Opium. Ultimately China lost and was forced to pay reparations, and to agree to a slew of unfair treaties that granted lesser tariffs.And in a really interesting development because of their weakened position China ended up having to, among other things, hand over Hong Kong to the British (for a set term).

They are mainly a tool in the toolbox of negotiations for long term trade deals.We have been corporate captured as far back as POTUS Nixon, where trade deals did not favor the USA citizenry, but, benefited corporations and the citizenry of other countries.  If you look into when mom had to enter the workforce in the early 1970's, as heavy industry was shipped overseas and the imbalances began in earnest, you saw entire towns and entire industries devastated by the loss of good paying jobs and plant closures.  Dads were not only jobless, but, without a career at all with the loss of an entire industry.Using OP's example of the steel industry, the US used to be the most major miner of ore and producer of finished steel.  That number is way down now, in comparison.  Although China is one of the major producers, they are not as big a producer as Australia.  So, to implement tariffs on Chinese steel vs. Australian steel with no tariffs, the supply chain could adjust to continue to provide for our needs at reasonable price-points as we re-tool, re-start and ramp up our former best industry.I would have to trust, at the onset, the manner tariffs are implemented and applied under the Trump administration, and I'm willing to give benefit of the doubt, for now, that they aren't going to ruin the US in the process.  But, my amateur ass is watching, and learning, and ready to shout out objection and protest if there's no good explanation of things going more sideways than they are today.

Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), legislators wrote that the simple descheduling of marijuana will not end federal criminalization, resolve its harms, or meaningfully address the gap between federal and state cannabis policy. Possession and use of recreational marijuana  and much state-legal medical marijuana   will continue to be a violation of federal law.The letter was signed by six other Senators, and six members of the House. The signatories include Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), as well as Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).President Joe Biden issued several rounds of pardons to individuals convicted of marijuana possession and other non-violent drug offenses throughout his administration. Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. Criminal records for marijuana possession have also imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities, Biden said in 2022 after the wave of pardons.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dems-biden-decriminalize-weed-trump-1235181464/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dems-biden-decriminalize-weed-trump-1235181464/)","title":"Dems Call on Biden to Limit Weed Prosecutions Before Trump Takes Over"},{"text":"Actually the song \\" listening\\" by the Everything you knows proved this:Everything you knowIs all just for show(I dont wanna go on listening)Suits and tiesFeed me lies(I dont wanna go on listening)","title":"Trumps Election Win Proves There Are No Rules Anymore"},{"text":"We're just moving our kid into a very liberal city district.

Bloomberg famously hates guns while other billionaires are hunters. Some are very religious and other are abortion lovers.\\nSecond money is not dispositive. Trump was outraised 2-1 in both of his winning races. History is replete with bad candidates spending huge sums for little to no votes. Bloomberg, Perot, etc. it is not just in the presidential race, Sherrod  Brown senator from Ohio outspent his opponent 4-1 and lost. John Tester, Senator from Montana, same thing.

He won men by 11% in 2016, and he won then by 12% in 2024.The big story of 2024 is that Trump won big with women. Democrats used to win women by 13%, but now are only winning by 8%. They lost 5% of women in 8 years.Democrats don't need to win back the votes of men. They need to win back the votes of men and women. They held one of the most important cards about bodily autonomy in this election, and women turned away from them in droves.It's also not all men and women that Democrats are losing. They're losing minority men and women and they're losing people who are less educated. Trump actually did worse with white men and women in 2024 than he did in 2016!So the story is not Democrats need to win back men. The story is, Democrats need to win back men and women who are black and latino and people who are less educated. And this makes perfect sense.These are groups that Democrats take for granted and just assume will vote for them. They basically never get anything. Core interests for both groups are never addressed. So now they're leaving.Getting these groups back will require serious changes and sacrifice. It means completely changing the priorities of the party to address the needs of these groups. Something they haven't done since the days of the civil rights movement.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Trump shouldve gone.

What are the instances that favour women that counterbalance these facts to make things even?The idea that there is a gender disparity is not fanciful, it's plain and obvious. Nor is recognising this imbalance an attack on men, these are deep seated cultural and social issues that work at the subconscious level, it's going to take generations to change them. The very idea of progressive politics is to fix these social disparities, for all minorities or marginalised groups.

I *don't* think it's necessarily bigotry for a woman to only accept rides from female Uber drivers - putting yourself in a car with someone gives them a ton of power over you, so a woman who's been sexually assaulted by a man (for example) might feel extremely anxious getting in a car driven by a strange man, or entering an elevator alone with a man. Now, this may not be an entirely rational fear - but then, the woman isn't preventing the man from using the elevator or driving the car, nor is she (necessarily) saying that the man is dangerous or evil or worse than a woman. She might be saying, I like men plenty and think they should totally take the elevator and drive for Uber, it's just that my anxiety spikes when I'm alone with a strange man due to past experiences.Rather than expand the definition of bigotry, I'd rather contract it slightly. So, e.g., if someone votes for Trump due to his economic message, some Democrats view this as misogynist since Trump has sexually assaulted women (\\"you must not care about women since you voted for this guy who's hurt women\\"), but I don't think this should be seen as misogyny. Or, if a white person accidentally says a racial slur (e.g., I think I read about a city council member who was invited to participate in a class discussion about race, and they were asked a question about the word and used it while saying it was a wrong word to use, then apologized), this should not be seen as proof that the person is racist.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Smith didn't let him off the hook, he just had absolutely no path to a conviction with the time allowed.

Attorney General Merrick Garland is partly at fault for waiting so long to commence the investigation into Jan. 6; his institutionalist instincts paralyzed the Justice Department for nearly two years, giving Trump a chance to run out the clock by the time Smith finally indicted him. Judge Aileen Cannon is?[guilty of sabotaging](https://www.yahoo.com/news/wow-aileen-cannon-really-dismissed-185738320.html)?Smiths?[other prosecution](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/06/trump-indictment-criminal-conspiracy-charges-explained.html), over the theft of classified documents, a prosecution which should have been a slam-dunk. In a simplistic sense, the voting public also bears culpability for putting Trump back in the Oval Office despite his egregious attempts to steal the previous election. But that victory could not have happened without the Supreme Court, which?[essentially nullified](https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-unanimous-trump-ballot-165628042.html)?the constitutional bar against insurrectionists returning to office, then?[awarded Trump](https://www.yahoo.com/news/don-t-believe-john-roberts-163126011.html)?sweeping immunity in Smiths Jan. 6 case. The courts immunity decision guaranteed that the former president would not face trial before the election, which in turn prevented the public from hearing the full range of evidence against him.Perhaps the most stunning aspect of the Jack Smith filing is that if you squint at it just so, it reads not all that unlike the majority opinion in the Trump immunity case, as penned by Chief Justice John Roberts: Its a dispassionate reading of the scope of presidential power and highlights the necessity that a sitting president be able to carry out his duties in a robust and fearless manner. Like Roberts reasoning in the immunity case, the Smith pleading is rooted more in institutional vibes than constitutional commands. After all, the separation of powers principles cited by the OLC were not written down in the Constitutionfrom which theyre entirely absentbut made up by lawyers seeking to grant more power to the president. Smiths decision to adhere to the letter and spirit of the OLC guidance is? a choice, a norm, not a constitutional command. The need to punish criminality ultimately sags under the policy preference that a president be able to fulfill his constitutionally contemplated leadership role and the constitutional interest in the Presidents unfettered performance of his duties. In both instances, the abstractions that animate this constitutional discussion about executive authority exist in a Trump-free vacuum. Here we have the courts and the Office of Legal Counsel in substantial agreement on a maximalist view of unfettered presidential power.The lesson here seems to be that whether you are a Merrick Garland or a Pam Bondi, a Juan Merchan or an Aileen Cannon, a Jack Smith or a John Roberts, when the institutionalist rubber meets the temporal road, the Donald Trump character wins every single time. While one side doesnt feel any compunction about ignoring the law, the other is hesitant to upend a nonbinding institutional norm. Lawlessness appears to be an agreed-upon outcome, a literal get-out-of-jail-free card, for whichever entity evinces the most contempt for the law.","title":"We Know Whos to Blame for Trumps Evasion of Justice.
