Leviticus 19:34, 'The foreigner who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the foreigner as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.' Genesis 23:4, I am a stranger and an alien residing among you; give me property among you for a burying place, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.' Matthew 25:35, 'I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.' Deuteronomy 27:19, Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.' Then all the people shall say, Amen! Jeremiah 7:5-7, For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly one with another, if you do not oppress the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt, then I will dwell with you in this place... Job 29:15-17, I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame. I was a father to the needy, and I championed the cause of the stranger. I broke the fangs of the unrighteous, and made them drop their prey from their teeth. Zechariah 7:9-10, Thus says the Lord of hosts: Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another; do not oppress the widow, the orphan, the foreigner, or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another. Ezekiel 47:22, You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as citizens of Israel; Romans 12:13, Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers. Leviticus 19:10, Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the Lord your God. Deuteronomy 10:18, He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. Hebrews 13:1-2, Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. Deuteronomy 10:19, And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.

Everything he says is bullshit. Hes just saying whatever gets him to the next room.  Serious or not serious is like asking if he means it or not.  That is not Trump.  He does not mean things.  He is just saying things.  And his motivations right now are very loosely correlated with whatever they might be in the future.  There is a very likely chance that nothing more ever comes of this.  That is by far the most likely outcome. But, the idea of invading these counties *has been said,* and so might be said again. And if in that future moment, Trump decides that pushing forward on it is what will get him to the next room, he will push forward.  He is not going to *not* do something simply because it is insane.  To say he is not serious about it is to say that he does not intend to do it, that theres a release valve, that at some point he would stop it before it gets too far along.  That is not Trump.  That thing that tells a person when something has gone too far does not exist in him.  That is his whole deal.So serious and not serious have no meaning.  Trump is bullshitting.  This is bullshit.  Almost certainly this bullshit goes nowhere.  But thats just because its a dumb idea, so it wont get him anywhere.

The cartels simply wouldn't stand a chance.I agree. My reservations lie with the fact that this incoming administration doesnt have the tactical acumen or strategic expertise to not only go after the cartels OBL style but to follow through with a nation building plan. That plan would involve coordinating with Mexico to ensure the corrupt officials who benefitted from the cartel dont remain in power. Given the fact that the US is abysmal at holding its own criminals accountable, this is the part that would determine whether or not the cartels experience a resurgence over time.  **The question wouldn't be American blood, it would be innocent Mexican blood.** The American military is very different than the Mexican military, not just in terms of capabilities, but in terms of structure, and being far less prone to corruption.I agree. The initiative would be whether or not this stays as a special military operation using only SF &amp; intelligence agencies or if it pulls in US Marines or US Army. No one can match our military, no questions there, but it goes back to how much do we invest and commit to? Concepts of a plan isnt good enough.  I'm not in the camp of doing this, per se, but I do think that it's the only real solution to the problem, and that broadly speaking it is very much in both countries interest to do. **This opinion has nothing to do with the drugs at all, but is a result of how the cartels have just completely corrupted and destabilized a country that we share a border with, and it's entirely because we buy their product and it generates such a profit that the cartels have literally been able to corrupt the highest seats of government.**I apologize if my comments come off as attacking you. Youre absolutely correct that this problem didnt pop out of thin air. I straight up do not trust this regime to handle this with the tactical or strategic planning an operation of this sort requires.  I mean Escobar offered to pay off the entire Columbian national debt. When someone has access to that kind of wealth, how do you prevent corruption?I get you. Id wager the cartels probably have as much money or more as the entirety of Mexico. I think they just want to keep the money flowing as well as the near untouchable status they have now. I do not think they can stand up to the US military. Not even a combined SF/CIA task force. There just has to be a multilayered plan not just to eliminate the cartels but how to capitalize afterwards.

Now add that to the fact that there are now ferocious Santa Ana winds that have been punishing the area the last week or so. These winds are hot and dry. They are the perfect winds to spread wild fires around That has created the 'perfect storm' for raging wild fires. This is literally the worst wild fires ever to hit these metro areas.

A powerful / influential USA in the global stage ensures your groceries will be cheap (one day). That's the most I can dumb it down.To expand on that (a little)... the reason we spend so much as a country and thus run as a deficit (increasing inflation) is to make sure that we have a strategically foothold world-wide. This foothold is financial, geographical, militaristic, cultural, etc... in other words, we spend money to create a sphere of power and influence. Within that sphere, we are safe from economic and military abuse from other countries (yay!). We have taken this for granted because for several generations, we have not had live without it. Many other countries with no sphere of influence suffer as a result of that. They have to become someone else's bitch or get abused. There are other powerful countries all over the world who have grown tired and bitter of American influence in their markets, culture, etc. And they would love nothing more than to take our place and make us their bitch. Democrats have made that increasingly possible. We purposefully gave up power and influence but did not reduce spending. In fact, we increased it. Consequently, China has moved in on Latin American markets (hurting ours), the middle east (where we have a lot of oil based interests), and is now in chaos and largely unfriendly to us. We risk loosing control of the pacific which would threatened our safety and our access to some of the most vital tech goods we source from there (semiconductors and others). If we decrease spending abroad and do nothing else, we will further decrease our sphere of influence... then you will REALLY feel it in your pocket.

We refused to participate, maybe because we believe they'd protect us anyway, or maybe we are just confident in not being targeted. Canada can't protect the Arctic, from the failed submarines, to ordering sleeping bag that are not warm enough for the winter to not having enough ice breakers. It's not pretty. The US has the capability, and the willingness to spend on defense.Cultural/political differences: Canada as a state could spend for itself a universal healthcare and stronger social safety nets.Economic gain: The GDP of Alaska is $69,794 millions while the North West Territories is $5,478 millions, Yukon is $4,330 millions, and Nunavut is $4,825. The massive difference is in large part because Canada doesn't have the means (and perhaps knowhow) to finance the exploitation of these ressources. The border delays alone cost $30,000 millions, and that study is from 2009. It would be much higher now. And that's just one glaring inefficiency, there are more.Administrative Challenge: Yes, it would be complicated and would take many years. The US went to the Moon and now a bit of bureaucracy makes them fold? Higher cost with few returns: Perhaps, but maybe the US would gain stronger public services as it could be an opportunity for the US to get a parallel universal healthcare system  la NHS (iirc). It would be a great time for much needed reforms. And as you alluded to earlier, Canada is relatively small, these expenses are not really significant for the US.

The GOP is a huge threat to their safety.But I think that public opinion is on a trajectory that'll make open hate less and less of a winning issue - meaning fewer and fewer attempts to pass hateful laws.  We're now at the point where the public overwhelmingly supports gay rights, not just gay marriage, and where a lot of the old tropes about same-sex attraction being deviant or dangerous are starting to die.  Trans rights are clearly lagging behind that, but now trans people are visible, and seen more and more as our neighbors, friends, and family members.The current situation where trans people are the preferred target of Republicans is pretty familiar to the old folks here.  Back in 2004, the GOP had started an unpopular war, was openly talking about cutting Social Security, and was clearly in the bag for rich people.  George W. Bush had inspired historic hate among Democrats.  And the GOP won it all.  How?  In large part, by attacking gay people.  Gay marriage was the trans sports of 2004, and states were tripping over themselves to pass Constitutional gay marriage bans.  *California* did so in *2008*!But now, gay rights are so popular and expected that eleven Republican Senators voted to codify gay marriage in 2022.  Among Democrats and Independents, supporting gay rights is just the expectation.  And that happened because gay people kept existing and insisting on their rights, in the face of powerful opposition.  And more and more people began to stand with them.It's unfair and awful that this is even necessary.  But the LGBT+ community is far more organized and strong than they used to be.  And in terms of cis/straight allies, I'm here, just like I was for gay folks back in the day.  Many more are, and we consider LGBT+ rights to be one of the main reasons to be politically involved.At the top of this thread, it says \\"We're not going back\\" in nice, big letters.  That's for all of us.

Look at the bigger picture: that is how the US maintains influence and power projection internationally.

A Ukrainian militant assassinates the Russian prime minister in Sevastopol, which the aging President Putin uses as pretext to invade, after having received assurances from Beijing that Moscow had a \\"blank cheque\\" to pursue whatever course of action in Ukraine as they saw fit.The United States, Korea, and Japan mobilize their troops. China launches a hasty surprise attack on Taiwan, hoping to use it as a base for future operations against Guam and Okinawa. The United States is unable to provide enough manpower to defend Taipei, despite their superior equipment and training. After weeks of grueling fighting, Taiwan is conquered, and Chinese atrocities fuel global outrage. However, Korean, Japanese, and American troops are able to hold the line in Korea, narrowly averting the capture of Seoul but also unable to advance to Kaesong. Just as happened in 1951, the Korean peninsula soon settles into horrific trench warfare.Chinese forces in Tibet are surprised when Indian forces, which Chinese generals had assumed would take months to fully mobilize, stormed into Tibet, but the People's Liberation Army wins a massive victory in Lhasa which results in Indian forces being routed and China gaining control of Arunachal Pradesh. Pakistan, which over the course of previous decades had shifted from a close US ally to a close Chinese ally, sees the Chinese victory at Lhasa as a sign that they should press their claims to Kashmir by force. However, an unexpectedly harsh winter and lack of proper equipment results in thousands of Pakistani soldiers freezing to death in an ill-fated push on Srinagar, which Pakistani leadership blames on the Sikh Community._flash forward five years and tens of millions of deaths_Soon after the guns fall silent, Europe enters an economic golden age. The Euro replaces the Dollar as the global reserve currency, as a deeply indebted US struggles to establish colonial control over new possession in Iran and Pakistan. Though obtaining control over Iranian and Pakistani fossil fuels, this does virtually nothing to assist America's economic recovery while engendering new national and religious tensions in the region, which will see sectarian and post-colonial conflict devastate the lands between the Euphrates and Indus for decades to come. It appears that  the century of _'Pax Americana'_ approaches its end not with a bang, but a whimper.Though humiliated by the independence of Tibet and Japanese-Korean occupation of Guangdong, China quickly recovers, with the first years after the establishment of the Weifang Republic seeing China once again become an industrial powerhouse. Though its military strength is greatly constrained by the Treaty of Edo, it maintains a GDP roughly equal to that of America. However, its political future seems increasingly precarious, as parliament is increasingly dysfunctional, and paramilitary violence between gangs of Ultranationalist Revanchists and pro-Indian 'Automationists' lead to sympathizers of either faction becoming ever more militant for fear that the other will seize power.","title":"This is a real post by the GOP House Foreign Affairs Committee"},{"text":"Hey half the country turned out to meet him","title":"Crowds Greet Donald Trump Jr When he Lands in Greenland"},{"text":"When the military attempts to roll over into Canada and the shells start dropping on American cites in response to the invasion, youll bet the United States wont be United anymore.

Canada is far from a progressive monolith. Just look at Trudeaus popularity. This is such a classic US Redditor take - looking longingly at European socialist countries through a Romantic lens and seeing the progressive paradise you want to see but doesnt really exist. The strategic alliance between Canada and US in a merger situation would probably net the greatest economic gains in the world today of any two countries joining together. Only China and Russia could make a claim to a strategic and economic advantage in the same scale and even then, Id say US and Canada alliance would be even larger in terms of economic efficiencies than Russia and China.

When talking about that scale, much of the land *isn't* the responsibility of landowners; It's public, undeveloped land owned by the state.Second, both public and private entities trying to do the necessary work to clear out old brush, create firebreaks, and set up infrastructure to deal with fires are met with lawsuits and injunctions, ironically by \\"environmental\\" groups who demand multi-year surveys and studies on the environmental impact of the work, and will often chain them back to back if anything is found in the first one (e.g., they find a species of lizard exists within the line they want to dig out a firebreak, so they will then require the project to triple its budget to relocate the lizards if they want to continue, otherwise they have to submit a new proposal to go 100 yards out of the way to avoid the lizard habitat - which triggers a new lawsuit and a new 3 year study. In the meantime, a fire happens and kills all the lizards anyway).It's a problem that happens so often in California specifically because of how they structure construction and land permits, and the level of authority they give to environmental groups, who can massively exploit the system - but they're also afraid of altering this because reactionary people see it as \\"deregulation\\", which is a boogeyman term associated with the \\"extreme ultra super nazi far-right\\".","title":"Trump warned about the fires years ago."},{"text":"Yes, they have voted on this multiple times and have had a ton of different movements throughout their history.

Fox News probably has requirements where they have to say Woke   Trans   Sex change surgery  at least 20 times a segment so MAGA Americans are triggered AF by people who do not fit there narrative of only 2 genders. And its harder to suppress women if the lines are blurred . In their mind its God . Man . Woman . Child . No room for complexities or silly little things like testosterone or estrogen..If you run the stats :340 million Americans . 1% or less trans , 10% or less gay , Minorities combined 32 % of the population and these use these trigger issues to turn people apathetic and cold to others humanity and Constitutional rights . FYI the Trump campaign paid millions to run anti-trans ads during NFL games ..and it worked .Science is not always black or white or either or but a mix of both or all.Native Americans recognized 7 gender expressions yes they had trans, femmes, masculine women then too.But heres some science for fun :What are X&amp;Y chromosome variations? X&amp;Y chromosome variations refer to conditions in which a child has an abnormal number of sex chromosomes, also known as X&amp;Y chromosomes. Other words used to describe X&amp;Y chromosome variations are sex chromosome anomaly, sex chromosome abnormality and sex chromosome aneuploidy. How do X&amp;Y chromosome variations affect boys and girls? Males usually have one X and one Y chromosome, and females usually have two X chromosomes. Occasionally, because of problems with the formation of a parents sperm or egg, a child can be born with extra or too few sex chromosomes. For reasons we dont completely understand, children with X&amp;Y chromosome variations can also have developmental delays,?learning disabilities and social-emotional difficulties. Babies diagnosed prenatally or during infancy with an X&amp;Y chromosome variation should be monitored closely during early developmental years (birth to 5), including standardized developmental assessments to determine if early interventions are needed. Children with an X&amp;Y chromosome variation should have neuropsychological testing during early academic years to monitor for learning disabilities, attentional problems and social/emotional concerns. Boys with extra X chromosomes need to be seen by an endocrinologist during puberty to help monitor their testosterone levels. Girls who are missing an X chromosome (Turner syndrome) also need ongoing monitoring and treatment by endocrinology, cardiology and other specialties.? X&amp;Y chromosome variations in males include:?\\t?47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)\\n?\\t?47,XYY\\n?\\t?48,XXYY\\n?\\t?48,XXXY\\n?\\t?49,XXXXY X chromosome variations in females include:\\n?\\t?45,X (Turner syndrome)\\n?\\t?47,XXX (Trisomy X or Triple X)\\n?\\t?48,XXXX (Tetrasomy X)\\n?\\t?49,XXXXX (Pentasomy X) What causes sex chromosome variations?? Children are born with X&amp;Y chromosome variations. These conditions are caused by a problem in the division of the X and Y chromosomes during the formation of a parents egg or the sperm, which are then involved in conception. The exact cause is unknown, and these conditions are typically not inherited.It really pisses me off they dont use real math or statistics. 340 million Americans . 1% or less trans , 10% or less gay , Minorities combined 32 % of the population.","title":"Mike Johnson Quietly Implements Nancy Maces House Bathroom Ban"},{"text":"Precisely this","title":"Any LGBTQ members for Trump?"},{"text":"The bad leaders are the ones who point fingers, but can't say what everyone else did wrong and don't offer to help at all.","title":"Trump Blames Biden for L.A.

So the point is pretty moot.?You could use that argument anytime a discussion about a past president occurs, so I'm not sure why you're bringing that up. This also means your point is pretty moot.

Some ppl may not wanna read this but it's the goddamn truth.For one, the cartels in Mexico rose to prominence bc we whacked Pablo Escobar and created a power vacuum when we destabilized the Colimbian cartels. Then, the US sent Special Forces to Mexico in the late 80s, early 90s to train Mexican special forces in counter terrorist and counter narcotics operations. These Mexican SF guys then broke off and joined the Gulf Cartel, employing what they learned from the US SF, and later broke off from them forming the Zetas. These guys are essentially single handedly responsible for upping the psychological warfare game amongst the cartels by employing incredibly brutal tactics (beheadings, skinnings, etc). In two considerable ways, the US is directly responsible for the current political situation in Mexico.Fast forward several decades, and you now have so called Americans advocating for the same tactics to be employed that helped destabilize an entire region of the planet, but now for a country that borders our own. Are people fuckin nuts? The solution to all of this is simple: legalize/decriminalize drugs. Do people not remember Mexico tried to legalize weed in the early 2000s and who it was who twisted their arm into not following thru on that, and did nobody speculate why? Military intervention, even if covert and targeted, may not yield the results people are hoping for and might create a much more chaotic environment. People need to think about what it means if Cartels are designated as terrorists for the average American citizen. Right now, if an American is whacked, it's bad for business for Cartels. They don't do it bc of that. If they're labeled as terrorists, that small layer of protection is gone and it's open season on Americans. I realize American citizens have already been killed, but I don't think ppl realize just how bad it will get if this is escalated.","title":"Are You for or against Trump labeling Drug Cartels as Terrorist organizations"},{"text":"Bullshit.

They wouldn't. They looted our 401ks and pension funds to buy them...And then they used an artificial test scarcity to create an artificially high IFR... Then they used the high IFR to justify mass testing with an absurdly high 45+ cycle PCR test (which results in as high as 95 false positive rate.) Then they counted ALL DEATHS WITHIN 60 DAYS up until they got their pandemic declaration... (Which allowed them to keep the pandemic bonds, which were distributed to fund global Covid/vaccine propaganda.)So in a sense, we paid for our own coercion but most never knew it because they skimmed our retirement holdings for those funds.And this all goes back to exactly what you said: \\"excess deaths\\"Which they knew were coming because 80-85 years ago there was a population explosion.That's why almost all Covid deaths were people PAST life expectancy!Why is this so hard to understand?
