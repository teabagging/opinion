It arose in opposition to the French Revolution attempting to lessen the power of the monarchy. All other conservative \\"values\\" are public relations to sell those who do not have immense wealth and power on the idea that they should support a system that solely benefits those that do. Notably, conservatives were once far more open and honest about this. You can read the writings of people like Burke or de Maistre and see quite explicitly laid out that there are a class of people chosen by God or Nature that are just better than everybody else and deserve to rule. The wirtings of America's founders also contain many of these notions (which is why Burke supported the American revolution but not the French). Throughout history, conservatives have opposed every move towards a more democratic system. Only as they've lost these battles - first with allowing any voting at all, then with allowing non-landowning males to vote, then with allowing black men to vote, then women, and so on -  have they been forced to create ideas like \\"meritocracy\\", \\"personal responsibility\\", \\"taxation as theft\\", \\"the spirit of competition\\", various culture war issues, etc. as a way to allow a system of de facto aristocracy to continue under other guises. Fundamentally, conservatives do not oppose dynastic or generational wealth, or any fetters at all on the ruling classes and elites.

They don't create more incentives to work - they do the opposite.Rich parents facing heavy inheritance taxes often retire earlier and spend their wealth on luxury consumption instead of keeping it productive in businesses and investments. Their kids also work less during their parents' lifetime because they need to help manage complex tax avoidance strategies.I run a family business. If I knew 40% of it would go to the government when I die, I'd sell it, lay off workers, and blow the money on fancy cars and vacations. How is that better for the economy than passing it to my kids who could keep growing it and employing people?And forget the \\"nepo\\" argument - most inherited wealth is gone by the second generation anyway. 70% of rich families lose their wealth by the time grandkids grow up. The ones who keep it usually do so by being productive themselves.The current system where people can pass on their life's work creates multi-generational businesses and long-term thinking. An inheritance tax just encourages short-term consumption and tax schemes.

Good one.","title":"Justice Thomas Did Not Disclose Additional Trips, Democrats Say"},{"text":" i agree that those are the weights that have been lifted but can you walk me through your math here? cuz according to my calculations, 701/2= 350.5. so 50% more than 701 would be 1051.5, a number smaller than the men's world record, 1104. Maybe go back and read the part you quoted where I said \\"over 50%\\" verbatim. Holy fucking shit man. Even if I hadn't wtf do you think the point being made is? Like if I had said it was 50% and it was actually more than 50%? Oh my god it would be *more* than 50% instead of *exactly* 50% and that definitely refutes the point being made.This is almost the equivalent to where someone on reddit acts like someone is wrong because they made a typo, so they laugh and point at the typo instead of arguing the point, except in this case it would be analogous to the spelling being correct all along and they just can't fucking read.  according to your logic, it's ok for michael phelps to have a biological advantage because he's been beaten. would it be ok for trans women to compete in sports if they are regularly beaten?No, that's not the logic at all. We are not talking about sports being separated on specific biological advantages of individuals we are talking about them being separated by biological sex. It's pretty fucking simple. Roughly 50% of the population falls on one scale based on this specific characteristic and roughly 50% falls on the other scale. From there, depending on the sport, they often *do* separate further based on other simple characteristics like age and weight and that's about as far as it goes. It has been generally agreed upon and refined over decades that these are the general frameworks from within it makes the competition the most fair to the most people.You generally would not expect for example an elite 12 year old runner to come anywhere near competing with an elite 25 year old runner. You generally would not expect a 120lbs man to compete with a 250lbs man in wrestling. Hardly anyone would consider it unreasonable that these sports further group by age and weight yet when it comes to biological sex, for some reason that logic goes out the fucking door and it's \\"discrimination\\". It's like saying the 250lbs man is being \\"discriminated\\" against for not being allowed to wrestle in the same weight class as a 120lbs man even though there is a clear innate advantage to being much larger in that specific sport. They have made the playing field more even for different common body types in that specific sport. Is the 25 year old runner being discriminated against because they won't let him compete with literal children? That is a reasonable thing to do and it is reasonable for biological sex, **not gender**, to be the highest overarching category over all of it. Gender identity has fuck all to do with your biological sex. It gets a lot easier to understand if you realize it's being separated based on biology and not social constructs.The ceiling and the average of performance is so much higher on the men's side in virtually every physical sport that it necessitates the separation. If you have done sports like wrestling or track and field or weightlifting and the like you would know that there is a *vast* gulf of difference in performance. Go watch a high school track meet or something and see how much faster the guys are than the girls. It's like you guys literally don't care about the objective truth of the matter and the reasoning behind all of this so you determine that it *must* be discrimination and will cling to weird shit like Michael Phelps and will hear nothing to the contrary even though you clearly don't know shit about sports.Like damn even the [polling on the issue](https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx) is trending towards this. 69% of Americans agree with this. You can't get 69% of Americans to agree on *shit* but they agree on this. Most women don't wanna compete with biological males and I cannot for the life of me understand why certain people cannot understand that. Being trans doesn't even ban you from competing. You can compete. You just can't have special exceptions that forgo the rules that are there for a reason that has nothing to do with transphobia. Think of the men's category as the open category or something, I really don't care. Whatever makes you feel better. For what it's worth women generally *can* compete on men's teams. I saw it all the time in high school sports like football and wrestling. It is the opposite direction that is not allowed for good reason.","title":"Biden administration abandons efforts to protect transgender student-athletes from discrimination"},{"text":"I get it.

Then after Biden/Harris provided almost no tangible relief to the corporate greed driven inflation and offered no real student debt relief - the same strategy lost again. Mind you - the winning play has been absolutely apparent. Progressives have by and large won their elections and show the STRONGEST polling against trump - yet the DNC actively works against them.This wasnt democrats failing the Democratic Party that mindset is so incredibly egotistical.

Gerald the Orthopedic Surgeon who has enough money to send his kids to good schools and to travel the world throughout his retirement probably isnt a perfect person, but he is nowhere near the level of parasites like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.Maybe this is colored by my own background as the son of two lawyers, but I think that the lower upper class or upper middle class has more in common with the common person than the oligarchs. Nothing short of an economic downturn on the scale of the Great Depression could bankrupt Elon Musk, but even your supposedly successful doctor or lawyer can be screwed over by having a chronic medical condition or making a few unlucky investments.Americans should be united from the suburbs to poor urban cores and rural areas against the very top that screw the rest of us over.

The flaws with the welfare systems are that there are disincentives to working, rather than labor doesn't give superior compensation.  I won't pretend to be an expert, but my understanding is that if you receive $1,000 per month in support and earn $0 income, your support would change by more than what you earned if you did earn income.  This creates the perverse scenario where working is detrimental to living unless one can get wages at least above their total support prior, which isn't the easiest.  This system is broken.  It should make people more or less the same level from $0 income to whatever level of support they were getting. Another variant of the anti-welfare argument is that it's a safety net.  If a crowd of people were crossing the street and someone tripped and fell, it's pretty likely someone would stop to help lift them up.  However, someone laying in the street and expecting to be dragged along by all the passersby isn't doing much at all aside from being a burden.  In my anecdotal experience, this argument is a much larger proportion of the anti-welfare argument.; that it enables people to be dragged along.  Someone with inheritance isn't discouraged from working, they just don't need to.  They aren't being propped up by anyone else, they're just in their own world.

The trust funds are used to pay out Social Security benefits and cover administrative costs, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA).The trust funds hold money that isnt needed in the current year to pay benefits and other expenses. By law, that money \\\\[$2.9 Trillion\\\\] is invested in special Treasury bonds that are guaranteed by the U.S. government and earn interest, SSA explains.\\\\[From your third source\\\\]This $2.9 trillion, put back into the fund, would solve the problem for another 5 or 10 years. Add to that time extension the falling number of recipients as the Baby Boomer generation passes on, and that number can be extended even further. That leaves the question of whether Congress can put the money back without damaging the national budget.\\\\[From your first source\\\\]If you yearn to point the blame for Social Security's imminent cash shortfall on Congress, go right ahead. Just make sure you're blaming lawmakers for the right issue.  \\n...  \\nAs you probably know, Democrats and Republicans each have a primary fix for Social Security that works. Democrats wants to see the payroll tax earnings cap raised or eliminated, which would require the well-to-do to pay more into the program. Meanwhile, Republicans favor a gradual increase to the full retirement age, which would lead to a reduction in long-term outlays from Social Security. Although both solutions get the job done, neither has the votes to pass in the Senate.   \\n  \\nPerhaps even more baffling, the perceived weakness of each solution is perfectly addressed by their opposition. For instance, the GOP's plan to reduce outlays takes decades before lower expenditures are realized. This is remedied by the Democrats' plan to immediately boost tax revenue. Comparatively, the Republicans' plan helps to tackle lower birth rates, rising longevity, and lower net-immigration rates that the Democrats' solution fails to account for.   \\n  \\nIf you want to blame Congress for something, let it be their lack of action to resolve the program's imminent cash shortfall when so many solutions are on the table.\\\\[From your second source\\\\]","title":" Millionaires pay??

In a Truth Social post in November, he asked the Senate to block the nominations because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges.If a majority has 60 votes in the senate that can always get creative.

It's not necessary and serves no purpose outside of revenge, which is not an emotion the state should be indulging. Execution is murder. It serves no purpose that incarceration does not, and the only defense of it that's been presented here is monetary gain and sadism (because that's what revenge is).

Men are all the way down in the low 3:40s. It's practically a galaxy apart. There are high school boys state champions that can easily clear the women's *world record*. I've personally known guys who can run faster than every woman on earth in a given event and they were practically nobodies outside of local competition.The women's deadlifting record is 701 lbs while the men's is 1,105 lbs. That's over 50% more weight.Acknowledging the athletic performance difference is not calling them weak, it's just giving them their own scale to compete against. Like damn, why is this so hard to understand.","title":"Biden administration abandons efforts to protect transgender student-athletes from discrimination"},{"text":"He means either fuck em I got mineI think old people should have to starve or eat cat foodIf I Stan for the billionaires hard enough, maybe theyll see Im a good boyMan, this boot tastes good","title":" Millionaires pay??

They are terrified of us, thats why they abuse their power in front of everyone to try and steal the moment and force everybody's attention, snd why the media is their tool, because they really sont have any true sense of reality.  THEY are the one's who put up barriers around the government buildings before any riots even happened.  They are the ones that tried implanting the idea of a civil war in case we didnt follow along.  They are terrified.  If power goes out, and the cops arent responding, then the culture of your neighborhood will have to be your only response to solve problems.  Make friends with your neighbors, Christmas is the perfect time for that, make a dish or invite them over.  As far as being scared and thinking the way is copying them...that's part of the trick too, and it's as old as it gets.  Don't be baited into aggression, stay in truth and you'll always find good company.  This is from the Bible, it's Paul's letter to the Corinthians and talking kind of along a similar problem.  It's the same reason why so many succesful riots are peaceful.  They want to discredit us by making us aggressors.  2 Corinthians 6  \\n3 We put no stumbling block in anyones path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. 4 Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; 5 in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; 6 in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; 7 in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 8 through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; 9 known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; 10 sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.They've been trying to discredit people far longer than this, but think of how the Christians were succesful at overcoming it.  They endured in truth, and they couldnt be tortured or murdered because they considered it an honor to be treated anything close to Christ.  It worked so well that Constantine had the entire Roman religion changed and that led to conquering from the inside, but that is a whole different comment for another time.  But I hope this reaches you in peace!  Bots are everywhere, nonsense on the media will be everywhere, and theyll all repeat the same few catch phrases.

Vyana Vayu is said to be the expression that is activated when someone is sweating, getting physical goosebumps, smiling or anything to do with liquid movement in the body. It's location is in the bladder so yes you can activate this energy from that area and when you do you are activating this specific expression.Lower than that is Apana Vayu and permeates all of your lower body below your bladder.Other than the five major Vayus there are a lot more minor ones and that is why you can activate this energy wherever you want with just your intent (takes practice, momentum to control and having your meridians cleared/activated) so of course flexing your lower groin area when you want to feel that energy expression can activate it but you can also activate this energy anywhere in your body.People joke all the time about being able to activate it while holding pee, peeing or going number 2. It's a fact because the expression of Vyana vayu Is about circulation and Apana vayu expulsion.External triggers like music are good opportunities to become aware of their energy, analyze it to the maximum and then try to bring it back up without any triggers.

If it isn't, then it's only the illusion of democracy that they tolerate because they have already bought it. In fact, the ultra wealthy are a symptom of a socioeconomic problem just as poverty is. They represent a malfunctioning political and economic system, a concentration of power that is a direct threat to the people. When they appear, cut them down to size or they will destroy society.The reason they are now openly supporting oligarchy and dictatorship is not that they didn't support those things before. They are simply aware that the popular rage caused by the system they control has to be turned towards something that isn't them if their power is to survive. They were always OK with fascism and would always have chosen it over even the mildest compromise with social democracy.That's the reason why no democratic society should allow people to own so much, why the rich are and have always been the enemy of the people. Not because they are inherently evil people, but because their position puts their interests at odds with the interests of the rest of society; they are no longer part of it in any meaningful way, so they start acting in an anti-social way while also being above the law.

How is it that I can't even begin to understand right wing ideology? Logically, if there's no way to understand and empathise with one another, how do we begin to even bond?But it's not that right-wing agenda is incomprehensible, it's that it benefits only a small percentage of the population. So why then is there a significant amount of people who are below middle-class and right wing? Well imo, the truth is harsh to hear, but it is because some people are unable to recognize the source of their own issues. It's easy to understand success when looking at a rich person, it's easy to accept they must be capable of more than most, and so it's easy to hand over control in hopes that they will change the world for the better. When the same person sees money pour into their account in return for their hard work, they see that as a small-scale success. It is positive reinforcement that they're also on a path to success. The problem occurs when wages are low, and a liar like Trump goes into power, promising economical prosperity. The people do not recognize that the tyrant they vote for is the same guy who will steal from the wallets of the working-class to ensure it.I felt as if the answer to this paradox was education, and long-term outcomes will yield a population that can see past the lies.

Laos has officially launched its first large-scale solar photovoltaic project, spearheaded by the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN). This significant initiative aims to bolster the countrys energy efficiency and economic growth, officially commencing on Wednesday at CGN's clean energy base located in Oudomxay province. With an installed capacity of 1 million kilowatts, the solar project is expected to generate approximately 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year, fulfilling the energy needs of about 10 million households. This output is not just remarkable but also poised to have substantial environmental benefits, as it is projected to save 510,000 tons of standard coal and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.4 million tons annually. The collaboration involves over 70 Chinese and Laotian enterprises, aimed at establishing this solar venture as a benchmark for electricity cooperation under the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation framework. By facilitating cross-border electricity transmission, the project will strengthen power interconnection between China and Laos, transforming the latter's natural advantagesprimarily its solar potentialinto tangible economic benefits. Once operational, the project promises to accelerate Laos' transition to renewable energy and assist its industrial upgrading. The solar power generated will be transmitted to Yunnan Province, located just across the border in Southwest China, thereby supporting the areas need for sustainable energy. Leading the execution of this ambitious solar initiative, CGN has pledged to work with more than 40 Chinese companies alongside local firms, ensuring the project not only integrates advanced renewable energy technologies but also maximizes local involvement. This collaboration is expected to create at least 1,000 new jobs, significantly boosting local investments to over CNY150 million (USD20.6 million). To cultivate local expertise, CGN is actively involved in training programs alongside Laotian universities. Through these efforts, the company has successfully trained 50 Lao engineers, who are now playing integral roles within the countrys burgeoning clean energy sector. The implication of such workforce development initiatives extends far beyond immediate economic gains and speaks to the long-term sustainability of the energy transformation. The solar photovoltaic project is merely the first phase of CGN and the Lao government's broader vision, which includes the comprehensive clean energy complex aiming to expand renewable energy sources throughout several Laotian provinces. Construction is underway for additional projects, which will incorporate wind, hydrogen, and solar power generation, along with energy storage solutions. Last year, CGN formalized its commitment by signing agreements with the Lao government to develop these extensive energy solutions. A subsequent agreement followed this September for the second phase of their complex, which will see the addition of another 580,000 kilowatts of solar capacity and additional projects initiated within Laos. Beyond the numbers, this project symbolizes broader aspirations for economic cooperation within the region. It aims at promoting resource sharing, market complementarity, and fostering industrial collaboration, aspects which are pivotal for the sustainable development of both countries. This ambitious project reinforces CGN's established position as a leader within the renewable energy sector, currently operating over 100 million kilowatts of installed clean energy capacity across 30 provincial-level regions and 16 nations. Laos is positioned to reap significant benefits as it enhances its energy infrastructure and pursues greener energy solutions. Indeed, CGN's solar photovoltaic project is not only pivotal for reducing reliance on fossil fuels but is also set to generate transformative economic benefits for Laos, demonstrating its potential as a model for future energy projects across Southeast Asia.!ping SEA&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It was","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Works for republicans.

This rhetoric enabled their tool (Trump) to rile up and broaden his loyalist base and get out the vote among lower- and middle-class Americans (of various backgrounds, not just white folk) who perceive themselves as aggrieved and victimized by the current economy (which perception of victimization and economic ruin are at base carefully managed constructions reinforced by Fox News and by social media manipulation). The blame the immigrants leitmotif was a way to divert the target electorate's attention from the matter-of-fact benefits that Biden's policies and legislative accomplishments have brought and will bring to those same demographics in the short and long run. Foremost among these was the successful cooling down of rampant post-COVID inflation that resulted inevitably from an overheated economy driven by pent-up consumer demand, global supply chain issues, and increases in government spending during COVID and its aftermath, needed to to stave off both the widespread economic turmoil of broad unemployment as well as a massive economic recession. It remains to be seen if Trump's puppeteers (corporate and non-corporate, domestic and foreign) will direct him actually to follow through on any of those promises. I'd be surprised if they do, considering the rampant economic disruption it would bring by depleting the supply of low-wage labor upon which corporate America relies so heavilynot to mention the problematic optics of family separation/human rights infringementas well as (greater concern for Trumps handlers) the inflationary pressure that would result from funding the actual costs of mass deportation through massive new government spending (printing money to expand DHS personnel and build the new or additional infrastructure of mass deportation-including but not limited to building multiple huge new incarceration facilities, transport of targeted undocumented migrants, and legal costs and timing delays of defending against predictable and multiple Constitutional challenges in courts, etc.). The whole project is too costly and too inflationary as a governmentally funded enterprise, too disruptive to the labor markets on which Trump's handlers depend, and too problematic from a legal standpointmeaning that the whole thing would rightly become stuck in courts for the entire Trump 2.0 term or at least until the midterm elections, which predictably will swing leftward in view of the impending failures to govern that typically result from Republican control of the Congressnot to mention the recession that will result from Trump's fiscal, trade, and tax policies, combined. Mass deportation along with tariffs could very well result in both the rekindling of rampant sudden inflation (note the Fed's loss of enthusiasm for 2025 rate cuts this week) as well as the spurring of economic recession through disruption of labor markets and the cooling off of consumer demand in view of rising prices and novel supply chain problems (tariffs again). I dont see and have never seen mass deportation as anything except the latest version of the Southern Strategy (to lure white voters to vote against their own economic interests) and more chillingly a borrowed page from the Nazi party's scapegoating of Jews as an electoral rallying point. And in view of that, there's every possibility that Im wrong about all of this and the MAGAs are willing to follow through on mass deportation despite the social, economic, and political costs Ive outlined here. But my hunch is that the anti-immigrant ideologues and True Believers (the Stephen Millers, et al.) arent really in charge here, and theyre just as much part of the window dressing and puppet show as Trump himselfas opposed to the corporate entities and interests that are and always have been truly in charge of Republican governance and policy-making. Unfortunately I do predict some smaller-scale operations that will impact smaller numbers of undocumented immigrants, launched merely for symbolic propaganda optics and talking points, but it won't (I hope) amount to muchjust like the diversionary Wall-building shadow play of the first Trump term.  Either this or else maybe they really are genuine Fascists, in which case we are deeply and truly fucked.  One last point:  These assholes may be clever, but theyre not really that smart, and theyre reasonably likely to nose dive their own aspirations through their lack of competence and inability to govern. Maybe Im whistling in the graveyard, but here's how I keep my chin up in these last dark days of 2024. Trump and his masters will certainly do a lot of additional damage, on multiple fronts, but I dont think they're likely to follow through on this one. Mass deportation may prove to be only a mass diversion, Trump once again swindling his own base. Anybody wanna buy a sixty dollar Bible?

Of the people I know that didn't vote, it wasn't because she was a woman or black. And of the Republicans I know that voted for Trump, it didn't matter who the Democrat candidate was, they were never going to vote for a Democrat, even if they pretend like there's some candidate they prefer. I'm just having a really hard time finding anyone real, that cares that she's a woman or black. I do think the sad reality is that we probably wont see a woman win a Democratic primary, but more so because people believe the narrative you're suggesting. Which is ironic. It wont be because the country cant handle a black woman president. Its because people *think* the country isn't ready for a black woman president. And the reasons people believe it, are such a red herring. - Hillary Clinton was shit candidate. Whether she was a man or woman is irrelevant- Kamala Harris got pushed into the position under poor circumstances. She didn't win a primary, in fact she performed quite poorly during the 2020 primary. And on top of that, she had very limited time to run a good campaign for 2024. To say that they are evidence that we cant have women presidents is misleading and unfortunate. Because there are women like Stacey Abrams and AOC who could conceivably make great presidents, if they are given all the same opportunities to run.I think, for the reasons you think we cant have a woman president, we'll probably have to wait for a Republican woman to win the presidency before people feel comfortable with Democrats ever running a woman again. At this stage, I think that's the only thing that will convince people that a woman can be president and that's really a shame.","title":"Senate confirms Biden's 235th judge, beating Trump's record"},{"text":"The worst part about Mike Johnson is Mike Johnson.","title":"Trump Wanted Shutdown to Happen on Bidens Watch, Not His"},{"text":"I appreciate the language being used here but I'm still not sure he's not part of another club.","title":"Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries \\"House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys club which wanted a 4 trillion dollar blank check.

Over 22.5 gigawatts of power was generated by the countrys on and offshore wind farms over the day, according to the National Energy System Operator. This beat the previous record set last Sunday of 22.4 gigawatts, which saw turbines generate more than 22 gigawatts of power for the first time ever. Wednesdays record meant wind power provided 68.3% of Britains electricity. Setting another clean electricity generation record just four days after the previous high shows the pivotal role wind is playing in keeping the country powered, RenewablesUKs boss Dan McGrail commented. However, it follows a new record for gas generation across the UK recorded last week as a lack of windy conditions exposed the intermittent nature of the countrys power grid. Britains last remaining coal-fired power station, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, closed in September, leaving the likes of gas, nuclear and biomass as non-intermittent sources of power. Gas prices had spiked above 107p a therm towards the end of last week as a result of the still weather, but dropped as low as 96.99p this week as wind returned to drive turbines. Spot electricity prices also averaged 56.22 per megawatt hour over the course of the last day in line with higher wind generation, against around 294.30 a week ago.!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"baby they got a stew goin","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"John F.

It just so happens that smaller government almost always aligns with their views.The progressive left doesn't give two shits about freed, justice, or liberty.  Hence they are quite happy to advocate for a larger authoritarian government if it's one that claims to support their form of authoritarianism.

Some of the rea-sons for the high cost of the death penal-ty are the longer tri-als and appeals required when a persons life is on the line, the need for more lawyers and experts on both sides of the case, and the rel-a-tive rar-i-ty of exe-cu-tions. Most cas-es in which the death penal-ty is sought do not end up with the death penal-ty being imposed. And once a death sen-tence is imposed, the most like-ly out-come of the case is that the con-vic-tion or death sen-tence will be over-turned in the courts. Most defen-dants who are sen-tenced to death essen-tial-ly end up spend-ing life in prison, but at a high-ly inflat-ed cost because the death penal-ty was involved in the process.From the right-wing Cato Institute:[The Financial Implications of the Death Penalty](https://www.cato.org/blog/financial-implications-death-penalty)One argument for the death penalty is that the usual alternativelife in prison without possibility of paroleimposes a financial burden on taxpayers (about $60,000-$70,000 per death row inmate per year, according to a recent estimate).Yet capital punishment is costly, too:Contrary to popular misconception, the expense of the death penalty does not lie in the end less appeals of death sentences. Although appeals do consume relatively more resources, capital trials also consume more resources than similar trials with a maximum sentence of life in prison. One early study found the additional trial costs exceeded those of appeals by a factor of four (Cook et al. 1993). Estimates of the marginal capital trial cost vary, but Collins et al. (2015) offer a middling figure of just under $1,500,000 (cf. Roman et al. 2009). The reasons for the increase are several. Attorneys spend more time preparing cases, and many states require the appointment of two defense attorneys to any defendant who cannot afford private counsel. Jury selection is more complicated. The process can take days or even weeks, partly because of the need for death qualified jurors, i.e., individuals who neither universally oppose nor support the death penalty. Capital cases also produce more hearings and court filings. Expert witnesses are unavoidable. Mitigation evidence, which argues for leniency in punishment, can require a significant travel budget. For these reasons and more, capital trials are uniquely expensive.One overall assessment concludes thatIn the 32 states in the Union where the death penalty is legal, as well as the federal government, the death penalty has grown to be much more expensive than life imprisonment, whether with or without parole. This greater cost comes from more expensive living conditions, a much more extensive legal process, and increasing resistance to the death penalty from chemical manufacturers overseas. These costs could even become higher, pending the outcome of various lawsuits against various states for their botched executions. Each death penalty inmate is approximately $1.12 million (2015 USD) more than a general population inmate.And in at least one state, the implication of the increased expenditure is ironic:When a local government bears the expense of trial, it must raise funds or reallocate them from other sources. In Texas, among other states, the cost of trial is borne primarily at the county level. A panel of Texas county spending over the last decade, constructed from audited financial statements, shows counties meet the expense of trial by raising property tax rates and by reducing public safety expenditure. Property crime rises as a consequence of the latter. The death penalty may therefore impede criminal deterrence if its finance is left to local, rather than centralized government.Thus not only does the death penalty burden taxpayers; it seems to increase certain kinds of crime. Existing evidence suggests executions have minimal impact in deterring violent crime like homicide.","title":"Biden considers commuting the sentences of federal death row inmates: report"},{"text":"What was the cause?

In fact, it was one of the closest elections in the last 50 years. So whatever changes the Democrats decide to make, they really dont have to be fundamental changes.Maybe not all Republicans are racist, but all racists are Republican, as well as all homophobes, xenophobes, bigots, and misogynists. And now Im going to say something that is NOT MY POSITION. As close as this election was predicted to be (as well as turned out to be), if you want to attract votes from the other side, then picking a black woman as your candidate might not have been the best move you could make, because it damn well matters to some if not most Republicans. Should her race and/or sex have been an issue for anyone? No. Were they? Undoubtably.In hindsight, its easy to see mistakes the Democrats made.  First, they hid Bidens real condition from the public. To this day, I have no idea what his condition really is or how fast hes declining, if in fact he is (Personally, Id pick a somewhat compromised Biden over Trump any day, plus we really dont know how bad Trumps decline is, either). There was no way to hide it for the entire duration of the campaign; a flub like the debate was almost guaranteed. Then, they hesitated far too long to make a candidate change. Every day they waited was a wasted day that the new candidate could have been campaigning. I do think they did an admirable job uniting behind Harris, but I admit the lack of controversy over picking her kind of led me to have a false sense of security.So picking a candidate that was not going to attract many Republicans (and might well have been a problem for some Independents, too) made her job to get elected harder, as did every one of the mistakes that the Democrats made. And still she lost by a tiny margin. That reinforces my point: the Democrats dont need to make fundamental policy changes, they just need to be smarter about campaigning. And Im not suggesting that their policies are perfect by any means, or that they do a good job promoting or communicating them. Right, wrong, or indifferent, rich people can contribute far too much to campaigns, and campaigns are expensive. People dont like the Democrats hobnobbing with the rich, but money in politics is a problem. Nevertheless, Democrats have to play in the real world in which many rich people dont want to pay taxes, revolting as that attitude is. We cant expect a 100% progressive platform to carry the day in 2028, although it ought to look pretty attractive after the wreck that Trump and company are going to leave in their wake. But picking one glaring issue, like health insurance, and beating on that issue with a simple description (Medicare for all is a genius formulation because it incapsulates a whole concept in just three words) might be the way to go. Just pick one, think it thru, figure out a simple way to communicate it, and stick to it.","title":"To those who did not vote for Harris &amp; Democrats: It's not that Dems didn't earn your Vote.

Then compare that to what Trump wants, which is wide, sweeping tariffs that don't make any distinctions between products and with no investments to US production in order to make up for the price increase.

They aren't small self owned businesses but they're not monopolies or cartels either. Labor can do the same.A Union is nothing more than a corporation whose product is labor. Like a staffing agency. People sign up for it because they promise to provide certain expectations for job assignments, and then they negotiate with businesses that need labor. It can be monopolized but it doesn't have to be.Imagine if we broke up other kinds of suppliers. Imagine if a steel company claimed that an iron ore company was \\"carteling\\" and forced the government to break it up into small individually owned iron mines.If a union is inherently a cartel even when it isn't a monopoly, then so is a corporation.

The initial plan Biden agreed to was he would serve one term and the DNC would run a younger candidate in 2024, meaning they'd have nearly 3 years to find and groom their candidate to take on Trump in a national election. However, like many elderly high ranking Democrats recently (RBG and Feinstein),  Biden refused to relinquish power and announced he was running again. The Democrats in DC have known for years that he was in serious mental decline due to his age, but the real sad part is nobody in the Democrat party had the guts to intervene and hold Biden to his word. Biden's debate performance became the most embarrassing political moment of the last 100 years, possibly ever. It made the Democrats look weak and totally ineffective as leaders.

People have been wanting drastic and radical change for a very long time, the the point where literally every presidential election since 2008 has been decided by who can best offer change. The sheer hubris it took to run such a centrist establishment campaign in 2024 is outright maddening.Beyond that I just can't wrap my head around anyone who actually thinks it's something that should lie on the feet of people who didn't vote for Harris.

Bidens' failure to turn back the tide of Trumpism will define the era. Joe Manchin is purely to blame for the failures of the Biden presidency to make significant gains amongst the voting population.Joe Biden eeked out  a victory over Trump of about 40,000 votes in 3 states. Polls showed that among Biden voters, over 80% were actually casting votes against Trump, and not for Biden.Biden said he wanted to be the modern FDR, but Joe Manchin was a stick in the mud from day one. Joe Biden never fought on the PR front for what the fights in the democratic primary were for, and he took the moderate position, increasing the minimum wage, a public option, and free community College. He accomplished none of these three major objectives and forgot about every one after inauguration.He was the ultimate participation trophy president.

Frankly, I think he was at best middle of the road: yes, he helped get the IRA and CHIPS Act passed, became the first president to join a picket line, helped mitigate the worst of COVID by aggressively supporting vaccination programs, and nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to SCOTUS and Lina Khan to the FTC.But on the other hand, his AG, Merrick Garland, had all the urgency of an eight year old at bedtime when it came to addressing both the Jan 6 insurrection as well as Trump's myriad crimes, he actively suppressed the railroad worker strike, his insistence at running for re-election despite his initial statements in the 2020 campaign that he would be a \\"transitional\\" candidate and despite his campaign KNOWING he was losing to Trump led to the election of an aspiring autocrat, and actively supported the slaughter of what is, by now, almost guaranteed to be hundreds of thousands of Gazans.Do the positives or the negatives win out?

The policy youre describing, tying highest incomes to lowest incomes within firms, is proposed by the most left wing parties in Europe like France Insoumise and Die Linke. Im not trying to demonize, just trying to be accurate. Studying economics Ive met many libertarians and conservatives, as well as conservative history and political theory professors, they simply do not believe inequality qua inequality is a problem, certainly not one to be solved with redistribution. This has been expressed from Rothbard to Hayek to Friedman to Regan to Trump. Maybe this is more of an elite conservative/libertarian position but when inequality is brought up I have frequently been told, The problem is poverty, not inequality. Its a fairly common view among conservatives that the way to improve peoples lives is to encourage business growth and therefore inequality.The new right does exist and they have a different worldview that inequality and cultural liberalism are products of globalization that should be rolled back.

He proposed raising the debt limit so his next administration can spend recklessly on implementing whatever crackbrained policies come to mind, not to mention all of the special interest players, corporate cronies, rich MAGA loyalists, social climbers and finance \\"bros\\" that Trump is appointing to his administration.Inauguration is still a month away, and we're already getting a sense of the corruption, cronyism and conflicts of interest in store for us come next term.While one of the richest men on the planet has literally paid his way into Trump's administration, not only contributing hundreds of millions towards his presidential campaign, but also turning Twitter into a bastion of far-right propaganda and misinformation, essentially running election interference for Trump, and in a way that's far more subversive than anything Trump has ever *accused* Democrats of doing.This MAGA coalition is more emboldened than ever, empowered by Trump's rise to power again, and the fact that Republicans will have a majority in both houses and a SCOTUS packed with kowtowing conservatives.And maybe the worst part is that Trump doesn't have a handle on things. Republicans are going to take advantage of his ego, his mental instability, the transactional nature of his relationships, among other things, to enact a far right agenda through him.But first, they'll try to establish a unitary executive with broad, unchecked powers, privileges and immunities, an executive branch ruled by a king more or less. From there, they'll seek to cripple the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of this executive. At the same time, there will be an effort to cleanse these agencies of civil servants whose jobs didn't previously rely on their level of loyalty to the president and the MAGA agenda. Executive actions like Schedule F will help them fill whatever positions are left with staff whose fealty lies first with Trump, not with the American people.We're already looking at a total restructuring of the government that fills the needs of the few at the expense of the many. A plutocratic, oligarchical, kleptocraticwhatever you want to call itregime, whose main goal will be to consolidate power and create what can only be conceived of as a one party system or state. If it can be achieved, Republicans won't hesitate to try and achieve it.We're encroaching on some familiar territory. This is *not* populism, which is one of my main gripes with this whole thing. Republicans have the audacity to run on some kind of populist platform, when in reality, they better represent a modern age of the robber baron with corrupt ties to politicians.

Democrats need to stop being a party representing corporate interests and start being a party representing their stated working class values. This is essentially why their base is so flaky, and also why so many people are successfully duped into voting Trump/republican despite Trump and the republicans policy goals being diametrically opposed to anyone outside of the billionaire class.Is it unfair to expect democrats to fight back against corporate greed and stand for something despite Republicans basically just using anti immigrant/anti trans rhetoric to get in power?

Let's start off by saying I would rather vote for my testicle to explode than any current GOP candidate. Both sides are not the same. But we're blind if we don't think there's stuff to fix outside of blind preaching.1. Let's get the obvious out of the way. \\"Why are we pointing out flaws with democrats when the Republicans are so much worse?\\". Because the democrats lost. The winning team has no reason to change its play. The losing team does. Does it suck that the rules/standards are different? Yes. But why would Republicans change that if theyre winning?2. I disagree with your first sentence completely.  In a free and fair election, the winner is the person who gets the most votes. In this case, it was the Republicans. You can call Americans stupid, say they're full of hate, but in the end you need more votes (or electoral colleg votes) to win.  I would argue that 'earning votes' is the biggest job of the party., because the party that convinces more people to vote for them gets to enact their policies. Blaming the people doesn't change the outcome of the next election, changing party poicy/strategy can.3. As for preaching to the choir, it seems like all we do are get our point out in like-minded echo chambers and get the most up votes. Opposing views are downvoted, which is barrier to any further discussion. At a party level, Republicans have a strong base in every city, county and state. The democrats have focused on cities and suburbs. There are states they have practically given up on. Jon Tester in Montana and Lance Kunce in Missouri were excellent candidates who never got any support. This leads to more disinformation and the circle continues. I dont think the problem was the democratic messaging, but who actually saw the message.","title":"To those who did not vote for Harris &amp; Democrats: It's not that Dems didn't earn your Vote.

Blame the DNC for sticking to the status quo, rather than embracing something different. Trump already obliterated the neocons, and he pretty much just did to the neolibs too. And, they are still sticking with their ideology. Pelosi sabotaging AOC? for some geriatric? I voted for Harris, despite being an actual leftist. I wasn't happy about it. I was pissed about it.

Trump won by about 1.5% in the popular vote - that is an incredibly thin margin of victory. Now Elons efforts coupled with Republican governors throwing millions of people off the voter rolls and the Russian bot threats in key democratic voting districts in swing states, and then Harriss inability to excite just enough democratic and new voters that her presidency would bring positive change is what gave us this result. And it was a win for Trump, Elon, and the Republicans. And Im not saying we dont address the corrupt elephant in the room, but we have to keep in perspective that Elon and Republicans put in all this effort to win by one of the slimmest margins in presidential election history (5th lowest by popular vote, Trumps 2016 election is the lowest ever by popular vote). They still won and theyll pull out all the stops again, but if democrats can get people energized around a candidate, the party, and a platform that will impact meaningful change for peoples lives I think their whole machine collapses no matter how much money, bots, and propaganda that Elon throws at it or all the dirty tricks republicans try.Its not a lost cause.

And then in 2021, the 10th circuit court of appeals ruled contrary to the statement in Burdick. In that case, Trump had pardoned a soldier, Clint Lorance, who had ordered his troops to shoot and kill three unarmed Afghans. The court of appeals ruled that his pardon was *not* an admission of guilt. (Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdick_v._United_States))This makes sense to me. Suppose Lorance were innocent and wrongly convicted; it'd be unfair for him to have to admit guilt in order to get a pardon.

Neither of us are right here as we are just stating opinions. You used war time to explain why taxing rich is good, during that hunting communists part the Soviet Union were seen worse than the Germans, concentration camps were liberated only to be treated worse and they had better living conditions within the camps than outside them. They were also at a great threat of a civil war due to everyones rations being no where near enough to work 18 hours and survive.\\nOnto the communist part, it is communist seeing as the Soviet Union did the exact same thing, they killed oligarchs and tyrannical business owners. Should something have been done about them? Yes, it should have been new legislation however some fuckers are too lazy to right in a book.The killing part is where everyone has hailed a murderer as a saviour, I just saw a post in which it was an AI generated photo in which he is portrayed as a god and he id floating above others.

Wouldnt be many from Kamala as I only saw a minor amount of campaigning and she was brought in late however student debt cancellation is a method of literal wealth sharing. The democrats persistence to not help the housing market in reducing prices, I know they always propose building thousands of homes in here there and everywhere but I dont know a single one thats been done, this is the removal or private property in my eyes and this is worldwide, the west has made it impossible for a majority of the population to go out and buy a home without being screwed by insane interest rates on mortgages (which they increase the interest on whenever they want and caused an enormous amount to lose their homes reinforcing the cycle of not being able to own a home) but once again its just due to carelessness and unwillingness to invest into the system and instead go for a option which should be in addition to rather than a replacement for. In terms of the blocking by republicans, Ive got no idea how that kind of thing works. I know how congress works and I know how the senate works, I have 0 idea how they work together and how it relates to the president but what I do know is that in the UK there is a manifesto in which any laws you propose are automatically passed through the House of Commons and House of Lords if voted in.

It very much is, and its a very hard concern but one we deal with and think about very very often. I swear I discuss this with my father like every week. We really do care about monetary inequality.The problem is similar to what you say, how do we fight the filthy rich drowning in money while not discouraging people to make good products or services? I mean genuinely. Lets take Bezos as an example. We tax him to high heaven. Ok cool hes gonna combat that by firing all of him employees and using drones or robots to do his work for him. We make that illegal cool hell find some other loophole where he can get labor cheap elsewhere or do whatevers necessary to keep the lowest loss in income.Big issues are A. These people arent dumb theyll try to find loopholes to stuff. B. Anyone now working in an industry with a good product now gets taxed to hell and cant use cool technology like drones so were punishing innocent good business. And C. Now well have a crisis of unemployment because we decided to interfere, when we couldve just let him be rich and at least people would have jobs. The best solution me and my father have discussed is that their income is based on a certain percentage or equation of a percentage (we can figure out the exact number, ie: 1000% or 100% x every ten thousand employees) of the lowest income of their company. This means they can get more money if they pay better, theyll want more employees if we do it based on number of employees and it wont hurt anyone else. 2. Its absolutely both in our eyes. I dont know what you think conservatives are like but frankly in my eyes it sounds like youre just absorbing what the media or maybe other people will tell you were like rather than us being actual humans like anyone else. Were getting paid less too, our cost of living is going up too, our inflation is going up too, our gas bills are going up too, our grocery bills are going up too. Were not suddenly immune to these issues or our grocerys get more expensive and we go huh lays is charging me more, ok well less money for anything else okey dokey Genuinely do you think our money issues the same that you have magically disappear because we value different things. Yes we absolutely believe the establishment is pushing wrong views. But to think we have no issues with our money being taken more and more is beyond me. Thats not just ok. Not to you. Not to us. Not to anyone. I want to say this to EVERYONE if you hate conservatives, hate conservative views, hate politics or dont understand conservatism. Go talk to a conservative. Dont talk politics specifically. Just spend time with one. Hang out, go to an arcade do mini golf go to a mall. Do something with someone you know is conservative. Were not aliens, were not some out their species whos entirely different in every way. Were actually quite similar and believe a lot more of the same things then you think. The fact is were all human.It doesnt mean you have to agree, but I used to love doing this all the time. Nearly all of my friends were liberals. Did I fully believe that they were making the world worse in their worldview and beliefs? Ab-so-lutely every day. But who cares? Let people believe what they want to believe. Deep down you hate that theyre a maga loving gun owner? Awesome cool believe that nobodys telling you otherwise. But go be with them, ignore all that for a second and just be human. Go spend time with the great amazing people who are on both sides.To every conservative not every liberal is a blue haired screaming they/them who will tear you apart for the wrong pronouns or kill you for using a gas car or having a gun.And to every liberal not every conservative is racist, wants to take away your bodily autonomy, and will murder any lgbt person. Were humans people! Humans. All of us. So grow up and stop thinking the worst of the other side. Theres things to love about all of us, and things we can disagree on and discuss. But we need a common love and a common bond with one another for real work to be done on both sides. And thats something no matter your political view that you can contribute to.I know Im biased so if you want to ignore this feel free. But I believe the reason liberals lost in a landslide this election was because you dehumanized every trump supporter as a racist maga gun toating homophobe. If you think trump supporter and associate it with bad person in any way, thats a stereotype you need to break. Hate the guy? Fair. Dont hate the people. When you do that people just see you as an asshole and the ones on the edge will leave and go to the non asshole side. (Trust me theres a TON of conservative asshats too) but so many of yall dont even treat us as human anymore. So change that and maybe youll see a chance for more progress to be made on your views and more people respecting and agreeing with you. Again Im not saying agree with us, but just have some common decency and be human with us. As we all should back to you as well. I know this got off topic (sorry) but I just saw this as an opportunity to educate and share my experiences because (no offense) this just seemed so out of touch with reality and hopefully help bring us together because we always need more of that. I hope at least one person at least treats the opposing side a little bit better with me saying this. Doesnt matter which side either.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"hes among the most disastrous foreign policy presidents of the last 50 years lmao what are we doing here","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"Selling the wall for scrap is the most petty thing I've ever seen them do.","title":"Trump Files Amicus Brief To Stop Bidens Border Wall Fire Sale"},{"text":"So, the wealthy are the right.They use their money to collect disparate blocs of people who are too filthy in character to be accepted by polite society, into a coalition that votes for the party.The Republican party is not a serious party, it is a front for the wealthy, who only need it because if they didn't own a party they would be totally overrun by the electorate.

All the good Biden did will be unraveled by Trumps incoming administration","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"Hindsight is 20/20 of course, and before I list some of Biden's achievements, I have to say that one of my main gripes with Biden was his decision to run for a second term. A criticism I think a lot of Democrats share.And yes, he was also a poor communicator, and made the same mistake that Democrats have been making for decades. Trying to reach across the aislea fruitless gestureand refusing to fight fire with fire.Biden, along with other Democrats, failed to communicate clearly why issues that Americans cared most about were multifaceted and nuanced. Instead of bragging about economic metrics and job growth for instance, the Biden admin should have conveyed why issues like inflation were out of control, and even how the Trump admin and Republican policies contributed to economic issues that extended into his administration.Biden was stuck between a rock and a hard place when he stepped into office. If Trump had won the 2020 election, he would have faced the same issues no doubt, and it's very likely that the outcomes would have been worse, and precisely due to Trump's previous foreign and economic policy record. Perhaps this is the only thin silver lining here.Democrats also failed to not just communicate why Donald Trump should have been disqualified from ever running for president again after events like January 6th, but they also failed to act on it.Instead, a large chunk of the electorate had essentially memory holed Trump's presidency, which was in itself a cautionary tale.What we can understand from this last election, is that Americans cared more about their immediate circumstances than anything else, including Trump's incompetence and any threat that he poses to core Democratic values. However, what makes this even more challenging is how many of these Americans are low propensity voters, they're not often making politically informed decisions, instead, they're voting based on their *feelings*, And that's basically what got Trump elected, feelings...Republicans are much more effective at appealing to feelings, fears, grievances and phobias. This is what fuels their culture wars.And while I don't want Democrats to engage in the same level of chicanery let's say, I still think they should have campaigned in a way that was not only more in touch with this kind of electorate, but also pushed back fervently against the Republican gamesmanship that relied largely on appealing to the lowest common denominator. It also doesn't help that a large percentage of the American electorate trusts the information being delivered to them through algorithmic formulas on social media.Studies consistently show that misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda, foreign disinformation efforts, lies and misleading data travel farther, spread faster and reach wider audiences on social media platforms where Americans receive more information than anywhere else.The truth is far less engaging by comparison. It's really a potent combination and a recipe for an uninformed electorate.In a different world, voters should have been better informed about both Biden's *real* achievements and Donald Trump's failures as president.*That being said:*Here are some of the Biden admin's achievements, which deserve some level of recognition:- His American Rescue Plan, which he campaigned on delivering, was estimated to have helped our country avoid a double digit recession early on in his presidency. And while it originally received bipartisan support and was popular at the time of its passing, Republicans later criticized Biden for it while taking credit for its positive outcomes.  - The plan also invested in child care. Which helped keep care providers open, lowered the cost of child care and increased pay for child care workers. It also invested in home and caregiver support services.  - Biden's agenda was more \\"America first\\" than anything Donald Trump delivered. - His policies were strongly pro union, and protected worker's overtime pay and pensions. He was the first president to show up on the picket line. Biden also championed legislation that ensured federal support for union jobs, construction projects, higher wages, collective bargaining and labor standards.- Under Biden's admin, the gender pay gap narrowed. His administration also targeted workplace discrimination and the PUMP Act provided workplace protections for pregnant and post-partum workers.- Biden's infrastructure agenda invested in rebuilding roads, highways, and bridges, in replacing hundreds of thousands of lead pipes, in expanding access to clean drinking water and high speed internet, and in electrifying  public transit.- It also funded tens of thousands of infrastructure projects nationwide. Many of these projects require that all manufactured goods and construction materials be made in America.- Biden's CHIPS and Science Act invested in the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, in workforce advancement and training, and in chips research and development. As a result, the US is expected to produce a substantially greater global supply of chips over the next decade.- The Biden administration has helped lower the cost of prescription drugs and insurance premiums for those on public healthcare and pushed for the negotiating of lower prices on prescription drugs for the disabled and seniors. Those enrolled in Medicare will have their insulin costs capped at $35. Unless Republicans have something to say about it.- Republicans aren't happy about the Biden administration's investment in climate initiatives. Measures like the Inflation Reduction Act cut pollution, and invest in US clean energy manufacturing. These laws provide Americans with consumer tax credits on clean energy technologies, and have helped create hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. - Biden signed an executive order that enforces the Buy American Act, which helped prioritize domestic manufacturing.- Under Biden, small businesses in the US boomed. Almost 20 million new businesses filled out applications, which is a near record and a higher number than prior to the pandemic.- The Biden admin helped to implement a corporate minimum tax and a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.- although it may seem contentious, especially to Republicans, the Biden Administration provided more funding to the IRS so they could crack down on wealthy tax cheats. They've since collected billions in unpaid taxes from the wealthy.- And yes, believe it or not, under the Biden administration, the US saw one of the strongest economic recoveries in the world.- Last year, the US reached one of the lowest rates of violent crime in recent history, while murder rates decreased sharply.After all is said and done however, Americans will probably look back on Biden's \\"legacy\\" as one with either a thin silver lining of being sandwiched in between two Trump terms, or he'll be remembered for ushering in a second Trump term. What good will these achievements do if Republicans end up consolidating power for the foreseeable future, reversing whatever Biden era legislation they can, while pushing a far right agenda that's already being implemented and backed by various corrupt and rich, special interests, even though we're still a month away from the inauguration.","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"I think that is the spot where age caught up to him.

Straight headline spending figures, no it isn't close. Adjust for purchasing power parity and things that aren't included in the chinese figures that probably should be and the numbers start getting into the same ballpark. For example, the People's Armed Police and their budget is not reported by the chinese as part of the defense budget. Sounds reasonable perhaps. Except that the PAP are directly under the military central command, are equipped and trained like the PLA and can field their own independent mechanized infantry divisions. Yes, you heard that correctly. Divisions. And one of their explicit purposes is to support the PLA during wartime. Also they number 1.2 million active personnel. The regular PLA has around 2 million active personnel. It would be like if someone carved off the military police from the US defense budget, equipped and fielded them like they were mechanized infantry, made them an independent branch under the DOD, enlarged them to half again the size of the marine corps, and then said these are totally not part of the military just trust me bro.Also purchasing power. 1$ spent in China goes a lot farther than it does in the US. PPP adjustments increase the spending by anywhere from 1.6x to 2.11x And, then there's the hidden parts of the budget. US defense spending is extremely transparent. Anyone can look up how much the US is spending to purchase and maintain F-35s. No such information is available for china. How much does a J-20 fighter cost? No one knows. After accounting for all these things you get various 'corrected' estimates. [This](https://youtu.be/mH5TlcMo_m4?t=2829) australian defense analyst puts it around 550 billion.
