No, he is not an intelligent man and there is no question that Kamala Harris is smarter than he is. In a courtroom where things like evidence and building a case that stands up to legal scrutiny matter, she smoked his ass.But a podcast in the bro-den is not that. Kamala lacked BIG TIME in the 2 things that American voters value above all right now: Authenticity and Change. She did not pitch a plan to change things (see her interview with The View) and came off as inauthentic (see her responses to flipping on Medicare for all and fracking).The reason why Bernie was so successful in his interview with Rogan is because Bernie's passion and personal drive to change the inequities of our system are clear and evident. He stands on his principles. Kamala ran a focus tested campaign that betrayed how own stated positions. Rogan was already uncharitable to her (hence the Trump endorsement) and it would not have gone well.That is not to say she should have abandoned the idea from the jump. I think Tim Walz came off as more authentic (his passionate advocacy for feeding schoolchildren, talking with AOC online about playing Dreamcast games etc) and would have possibly done well on Rogan. It would have been a difficult sell after Trump as it would have seemed like Kamala was scared but if you get him in there earlier, I think it hits better.But ultimately, this campaigns problem was not \\"messaging\\" it was \\"the message\\".\\nI would recommend taking a look at the responses to AOC on Instagram reaching out to people who voted for her and Trump instead of her and Kamala. There is a consistent through line: they believed Kamala was selling them bullshit and felt that Trump was an outsider who represented a shift from their dissatisfaction with status quo. It doesn't matter that that's insane, that's where the voter base is right now, you have to run a campaign that reaches those people.

Meanwhile, solid big red states such as Florida and Texas shifted even further to the right.

During Obama's Presidency he decided to abandon the Traditional Democratic Base of minorities, the poor, and the working class in favor of Marxist Identity Politics.? The \\"Race Card\\" had worked well for him so he collaborated with Harvard to develop Critical Race Theory (CRT) to win Elections.? CRT was instrumental in the George Floyd riots and the Democrats leveraged them in the 2020 Election and they have also embedded DEI everywhere they can.? These successes encouraged Democrats to include Sexual Identity by embracing LGBTQ+ and Transgenders via Radical Gender Theory. In so doing, the Democrats sowed the seeds for losing in 2024, and perhaps many future elections. The Democrats problem lies in the Marxist? Oppressor-Victim Dynamic, which can enable a single minority to exert disproportionate Political Power, but it's Mathematically self-limiting when applied broadly.? In other words, the more Victim classes you add, the greater the Oppressor base grows with exponentially negative outcomes. For example, a straight white Father objecting to males playing in his daughters sports is simultaneously labeled as a Misogynist, Racist, and a Transphobe. Another example are Holocaust-surviving Jews being labeled as Genocide Supporters because they back Israel in the Gaza War. Obama's Marxist Identity Politics is now a Tyranny of the Few over the Many without any benefit whatsoever for the Many, so there was every reason for Democrats in 2024 to seek a Party that can better represent their interests such as on the Economy, Realizing the American Dream, and so on.?

The Gulf states have no issues finding millions of desperate people to sign up. So really it's just a matter of how much consideration or stake host countries want to give immigrants out of principle. The answer for Trump and the GOP is very little to none.The right wing goal isn't to completely eliminate immigration, it is to get the benefits of workers while minimizing the costs and side effects. The solution to this is to keep immigrants from being treated as full fledged members of society or having a path to permanent residency. For instance, there is a lot of talk about filling demographic holes with immigration... But permanent immigration doesn't fix that, it makes the underlying issue worse and kicks the can down the road. What does solve the issue is foreign workers who leave when they get old themselves. This is the direction the right wants to move in: treating immigrants more as resources to be used up than as people to be integrated.From an amoral perspective allowing large scale illegal immigration while treating those immigrants as poorly as possible with no path to citizenship is the most practical approach. It's the best of both worlds for the country (at the expense of the immigrants).

At one point the dude and I got into discussing some of the issues of being men, mainly in regards to dating. The girl went \\"oh yeah, I completely understand\\" and then proceeded to say a comment that showed she completely _did not_ understand. We went on to try and explain but it was futile. I don't think this would be unexpected at all. Haven't you had experiences and reasonings that other people can't understand without having had a particular experience? Just go do some LSD and try to explain it to someone who's never done drugs, they just won't be able to get it. So there's some things that they'll be able to comment about (such as maybe correlation between drugs and mental illness) but other stuff they won't be able to comment on (the stuff that is particularly tied to the experience of having had LSD).Does it really seem impossible to you that some of these experiences would be tied to belonging to a certain demographic? What is your foundation for that claim and what are you suggesting it should tell me.Admittedly, my source is my personal experience (since there are no studies afaia that go over people having opinions on other demographic's experiences and their own). It's like when people make the \\"free speech shouldn't be censored\\" claims they are usually libertariand, right leaning or just spouting some insane Nazi/White Supremacy stuff. Against, no statistical studies but just go look at Twitter for a while and I'm sure you'll agree.And what this should tell you is that when these opinions get outright dimissed its because its often a minority demographic that is feeling attacked and like the white person is trying to reduce all of their life experiences to a few statistics and intruding into their spaces and discussions. As mentioned in the post, can we not take that to its logical conclusion and use that arbitrarily to exclude all but the most specific people from having opinion since everyone, is a member of multiple demographics and have individual experiences?Again, it really depends on what we're talking about here. Going back to the drugs example, if we're discussing wether drugs are tied to mental illness then sure you can pull statistics and be part of the conversation even if you haven't had any drugs. But if we're talking about what its like to have LSD then yeah, your opinions are pretty much worthless. Best you can do is pull on the experiences of people who actually tried it, and even still you won't \\"get it\\".Remember, whenever we take data and statistics we're shifting from qualitative study to quantitative study, and this requires extreme levels of abstraction. For statistics to make any sense we need to reduce the entire problem to a couple of metrics so that we can actually measure and aggregate over a large sample. But this inherently leaves a lot of detail out. When this translates to issues that are specific to a certain demographic (say for example, abortions and women) there will be certain things you can talk learn about and certain things that you'll just never get because you don't have that experience.For example, assuming you're a straight dude, you just won't understand really how it feels going home with a guy and the fear that comes with the sheer difference in physical strength. Its scary knowing that this person could just choose to overpower you and have their way with you and there's very little you could do about it. If you don't get this, there are simply lots of conversations about dating from a women's point of view that you simply argue about because you don't really \\"get\\" the other side.  Yes why wouldnt that be related to content and not demographic?I'm not sure I understand the question here. Certain experiences are simply tied to being part of a certain demographic. There are unique experiences to being a woman, to being a black person, to being a white person, etc. Sure, some experiences might span whole demographics, but some won't.","title":"CMV: Validity of opinion is based on content not demographic"},{"text":"He was probably trying to be the one in charge of it lmao","title":"Progressive billionaire Mark Cuban deletes his tweets supporting Kamala Harris"},{"text":"They're starting to realize.","title":"20 million Democrat votes missing"},{"text":"Deflation  in aggregate is bad, but it would do wonders in supermarkets.

Only content should matter but it doesn't as the context of who says it is useful to help sort out shit opinions from good opinions.But yes, if you have a wealthy black person who grew up in the upper middle class outside of the less affluent black community. Their opinion can be valued less than the person who is just as black but grew up in a poor black neighborhood.  In short, they likely have less experience in the subject matter.People put more weight on the opinions of those who have experience in that subject matter. To be honest, race is really quite a poor application as skin tone is increasingly becoming a worse and worse indicator of life experience. It's slow, but black people are making gains economicly and socially over time, and their shared life experiences vs all other Americans have likely been homoginzing over the last decades since the 1960's in particular. I doubt this is unique to black people either. The shared experiences of all races of Americans are likely homoginzing as Americans are increasingly becoming mixed races and living in integrated communities. Again, progress is slow but happening.

Well, it is a slider or a gradient. I will value a paralegals law opinion over a plumber's, but I won't value lawyers over a plumber's.

The policies that made the average American frustrated with the current economy (meaning the past 10 years) is not something specific to the Dem party.  They're arguably more to do with neoliberalism and the GOP's economic policies, anti-union behavior, deregulation, etc than anything else.  It's hard not to see that the Trump protest vote represents a very real unhappiness that is also incredibly misguided.  But, when you are unhappy and someone is offering easy answers in tandem with non-stop misinformation about how everything is shit right now, it seems like the easy answer so people get sucked in.Hillary ran on converting coal country to jobs of the future and they rejected her.  I know that was not an easy sell for them since it felt like an end to their history, but that doesn't mean they were correct in their choice.  Government is how the working class combines their power to overcome the negative forces of the wealthiest actors within a capitalistic system.  The irony of them electing a billionaire grifter who promises to tear that all down (with very obvious policies that benefit the wealthiest) cannot be ignored.  We've had a massive conservative economic influence for decades, including from the centrist left, and they voted for more of that?  This is why people say they're in for a rude awakening.There is definitely an information gap for voters, which is why these \\"Dems were too mean\\" claims fall so flat.  It isn't that Dems are actually saying mean things on any real level.  It is that low info voters are told that Dems are saying mean things by charlatans trying to manipulate them and aren't able to see through it.  So, I completely understand the situation.

Heres why: If a starving person, whose mind has been fully captured by propaganda, is offered a banana or a steaming pile of shit and chooses the shit because theyve been conditioned to believe its good for them, then debating whether they shouldve been given an apple or a plum misses the point. The real issue isnt the selection of fruitits the underlying power of misinformation and propaganda. Saying its out of touch or arrogant to point this out is absolutelywellbananas. The core problem is propaganda. No amount of finger-pointing at Democrats or dismissing their efforts as inadequate will change the fact that powerful entitieslike Fox News and certain social media platformshave excelled at spreading misinformation that keeps large swaths of our population misinformed and fearful.And heres the truth about electing the right candidate: if the choice is between a candidate convicted of multiple crimessomeone proven to be a felon, a fraudster, a racist, a rapistand anyone else, a critically thoughtful person should be able to tell the difference. The proof of this critical awareness? Black women and Black men, who consistently show up to the polls with clarity. This voting bloc faces immense economic pressures and has just as much, if not more, to lose from poor leadership. Yet 92% of Black women and 80% of Black men voted in a way that resisted propaganda, despite living with the same inflation, cost of living, and economic anxiety as everyone else.Its time to confront the fact that propagandanot the supposed shortcomings of Democratic candidatesis why so many people are disconnected from reality. Articles that critique Democrats from a both sides stance assume everyone has an equal grasp of reality. But while we all live in the same world, some people are manipulated to believe otherwise. This is not accidental; its a strategy that benefits those who seek to take advantage of them.

The same cannot be said for the United States Senate.With very few votes left to count in last weeks election, the Republican Party appears to have flipped four Senate seatsin Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Montanagiving it a presumptive 53C47 majority. On the surface, that outcome may not seem dramatic, and in fact represents a fine performance for Democrats. The party had no realistic pickup opportunities this election cycle. Meanwhile, it had to defend three seats in red states and five seats in swing states. Democratic incumbents lost all the red-state races, but won four of the five purple-state contests: in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michiganall states that voted for Trump.The real problem for Democrats is that the 2024 map was only slightly harsher than usual. Going forward, every Senate election is going to be brutal. The institution is so skewed in favor of the current Republican coalition that Democrats need at least a few red-state seats to win consistent majorities. Now they have none.The partisan divide of the 50 states is not an immutable fact of nature, but heres how things look for the foreseeable future: 24 states are solidly red; 17 are solidly blue. Over the past three presidential cycles, only six states have swung back and forth: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. Throw in New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Minnesotawhere Trump or Kamala Harris won by about four points or lessand America has nine purple states in total, representing 18 Senate seats. To hold the chamber, Republicans need to win just two of those seats if they control the presidency, and three if they dont. Democrats need to sweep almost all of them. They must pitch perfect game after perfect game to have a shot at even the narrowest majorities.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/t66enQWA](https://theatln.tc/t66enQWA)","title":"The Democrats Senate Nightmare Is Only Beginning"},{"text":"These same European countries are also at the forefront with experimenting with this kind of deliberative democracy and Citizens' Assemblies, driven by their people's dissatisfaction with the status quo.","title":"Can We Make Democracy Smarter?"},{"text":"She would need almost all of those to go her for her to win the state.

There are certain topics that are, for one reason or another, tied to specific groups. People within that group will have unique views from people outside. The insiders and outsiders views are both subjective. Ideally you would seek objective analysis and criticism of the topic, the in the real world analysis and criticism is always going to come from a person and people always have subjective bias. Objective perspectives are almost like an idealistic thing, anyone claiming objectivity is almost always a charlatan. Like unless you are talking math or science (and even then a lot of the time) its impossible to make statements about human culture without being subjective.Within this subjectivity we generally offer others deference to define themselves. Deference is not necessarily like a confirmation of veracity or objectivity or anything, its just more of a \\"people generally know themseoves best and have the right to define themselves\\".Like your example of black and white people commenting on the effect of hip hop, which is to say extremely black coded music, on the black community. Generally speaking, there is a history of antipathy between black and white people, subjectivity they see the world in greatly differing ways. They are going to see the out springs on one culture differently from wach other, and they are going to suggest that these cultural out pouribgs are affecting the group the sprang from differently. Generally speaking, its better to defer to analysis and criticism of black media done by memebers of the black community because the culture is an expression of the group, so people within the group should understand it best. Now thats not to say outside analysis and criticism has no value, but the value that is has definit should be considered secobdary and with the caveat of disclosure that the critism is coming from an outsider. The criticism may be of more or pess value, value is also subjective to the critic audience, but it is important to law biases and subjectivities at the door.I think a lot of people get wrapped up in this idea that like secondary and tertiary analysis and criticism have no value. This simply isnt true. White people can listen to hip hop and they are allowed their opinions and criticisms of it, they can even stretch these as far as they will go to their effects on black culture if they want. Its just, all of that criticism is going to be secondary to a black person commenting on black culture and its effect on the black community. Its all subjective, the black criticism isnt more objective hut there is a presumption of higher value in the criticism comibg from a community insider than an outsider. Its more like an order of operations thing, not a superior inferior hierarchy kind of thing.","title":"CMV: Validity of opinion is based on content not demographic"},{"text":"Could all of these pessimistic articles be psyop/FUD from corporate America to try to get people to give up and never vote again? ??","title":"Donald Trump's 2024 election the death knell for experiment.

However, voter participation in the region is less than it was in 2020 (77.31 percent), suggesting Helene may have had some effect on the vote totals. Those in the region who voted for Trump accounted for about 11 percent of all voters statewide and 21 percent of the states Trump voters.Im not surprised. That region of NC was founded with a fierce independent Scottish spirit that remains there today, Jay DeLancy, executive director of Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, told The Federalist.

For a tariff to be successful, there needs to be a domestically produced alternative. If there isn't one, then the tariff essentially will just increase the price of the product for no good reason until domestic production can be started.If there is a domestically produced alternative, then the tariff can protect it from competition from foreign companies. A foreign company can drive prices down until a domestic company goes out of business. This is not inherently a bad thing because having production advantages are what drives our global market. But it becomes a problem if the foreign company (and foreign government) controls something important like micro chips for defense purposes. This essentially gives them leverage in a potential conflict. It's also a problem if the foreign company chooses to increase prices after driving domestic options out of business. I think of that as the bait and switch. You think you're getting a cheaper product at first, then they take your shirt.Tariffs can potentially lead to more domestic jobs being created over time. It can lead to domestic production being the same or cheaper than the foreign alternative. Elon musk built a Tesla factory in China to avoid import tariffs. Essentially, the same kind of thing could happen here.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"Democracy is alive and well, it just elected Trump.

Late in the timeline of the race they also showed their unfavorable hand containing the polling data with the vile vitriol and pathetic lies with which they also came for Jill Stein. Fact is the bump to Trumps polling numbers after Kennedy joined his campaign was so big they couldnt entirely leave it unaccounted for in their reprehensible misrepresentations and that alone is enough of a tell to know that the herding of the Kennedy vote to him was crucial in his election win. Team Trump is definitely providing itself reliable internal polling data as well and these told them they needed the Kennedy vote to win. So they cut him a deal. The Dems for their part chose to rather lose to Trump than win with Kennedy. Because they cant fucking do anything against the wish list of their donors, least of all embrace any truth for once.

Or whther one on one someone should win a debate based on who they are (like in a attrourney vs prosecutor use case).So I want to offer some rebuttance to you from two angels:First. What I learned is that in various public forums certain opinions get drowned because of who the speakers vs their opponents are. Often the demarkation lines align with demographics. And if you happen to be the of the winning demographics it is easy to fall into groupthinking. If women speak about their problems (perceived or real) in male dominated spheres, they are laughted over or otherwise shunned. They naturally get sick of not being taken seriously so naturally they want to create spaces where women promoted to speak and they try to defend their spaces by not letting being overrun (aka if you are a man your opinion doesn't matter). Is it right or wrong is another subject. I don't think that it is the most productive strategy in the grand scheme of things but I also see why people want to be heard about THEIR issues. It also results in groupthinking and echo chambers and bubbles but you need to see where this is comming from.The second angle is that depth of issues can often be perceived if you experience that. So if someone saying whether something is a big deal or not often depends whether that has happened to you or can happen to you. Sexual assualt is the prime example. Growing up I had very biased and uninformed opinon on the extend of this issue, since I was never remotely a target. I have seen men posting on Twitter shit like \\"oh what's the big deal if you *had to have* sex, just take a shower and move on with your life\\" (and other rape agologia). Like of course women and some other folks don't want this bs to be heard as a serious argument. People rightfully don't want to have equal platforms with it. So for them it is easier to shut someone based on who they are then even engage in the argument. It goes btw both ways, I have seen women online devalue absolutely legitimate grievences the man have. Another issue is racism, it is really a big difference on which end of it you are (\\"haha just a joke bro, I am not really racist bro\\" vs being the butt of jokes your whole life).","title":"CMV: Validity of opinion is based on content not demographic"},{"text":"And if you dont vote our way, then you are a ___ist and a ____ic and you need to be cast out of society for good.","title":"What do you think is the biggest reasons that the Democrats lost the election?"},{"text":"it's valid to a degree because you can't be an expert in their experience if you never been treated like xyz","title":"CMV: Validity of opinion is based on content not demographic"},{"text":"I mean a good chunk of them are going to have to die eventually anyway.

They had a historically low turnout because while political activists behave and vote strategically normal people only turn up to vote if it's exciting and self actualizing. They don't read policy papers and make detailed and informed decisions to pick the lesser of two evils, they get excited or they don't. They're never going to pick up a newspaper, and the Democrats are going to have to adapt to that.And that means understanding that they cannot run on their opponents being worse than them, or on ideas that half the party sees as literally genocide. It's not enough that the informed turn out on election day. To be effective as activists we need to excite people who aren't going to read or watch anything. When they come in to the proverbial lunch room and see one table arguing with defeated looks and sunken eyes that it's necessary to back even a genocide to stop Trump, and the other talking about all the things they'll buy when Trump makes everyone rich, that's the table that they're going to join.

I care less about some double PhD Londoner in London having critical opinions about the USs domestic politics. And so on.

I am appalled to see so-called libertarians oppose trading tariffs for eliminating the income tax. Tariffs are sales taxes on imports, and libertarians historically have almost universally agreed that sales taxes are preferable to income taxes. Not coincidentally, the founders of the USA made sales taxes the only tax allowable by the Constitution.  \\n  \\nIf tariffs were equivalently bad, they would still be preferable (for a state) because they force a greater variety of goods to be produced within the border, which can be a critical national defense imperative. Letting foreign, opposition powers be our sole source for many critical goods can easily be fatal to a nation (and, not just the nation, but also its people). Because goods that were being imported cheaper than they can be made domestically will now be purchased domestically, the prices of those goods will necessarily increase. However, this also means that those purchases circulate money within the economy instead of exporting it, and that results in an increase in the income of the producers of those goods, so it's not a total loss for the economy. Determining how much the tariffs affect the economy is an equation which subtracts the increased cost of import and adding the increased domestic productivity and income- this is not necessarily a negative equation across the board. Income taxes are unavoidably negative across the board, they only increase income for the least productive sector of the economy: government bureaucracy.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"Biden was dementia-ridden since day one of his presidency.

Her unwillingness, or inability, to give coherent interview answerswhich led to her staff keeping her in bubble wrap until the final monthled to some embarrassing moments, such as her strange decision to refuse to distance herself from Biden on The View and elsewhere. Though the campaign released a series of policy proposals about the care economy, Harris never developed an economic vision that registered with a sufficient number of Americans. Its hard to think of a Democratic Presidential campaign in the postwar era that felt more constrained in its messaging, or more reactionary in its focus on the (admittedly myriad) flaws of its opponent. When the subject turned to foreign policywhether in Ukraine or GazaHarris could do little better than mumble platitudes.Imagine, then, Kamala Harris in a contested primary: someone who is not good in interview settings, who has few well-communicated policy ideas (something that appears to matter more these days to Democratic primary voters than to the general electorate), and who is unlikely to be seen as electable because she is tethered toindeed part ofan unpopular incumbent Administration. Harris would have had certain advantages in terms of name recognition, and perhaps fund-raising, but very little of what we saw during these past few months should make anyone think a primary campaign would have gone better for her than it did in 2020, when she flamed out months before the first primary votes were even cast.I wonder when it will become apparent that most of the funding, Democratic support and media adulation Harris received was only because she was the alternate to Trump, and not on her own merits as a candidate.

An average wage at about this time was $65 a year in the 1790s, with food and lodging perhaps, which works out to a bit more than $2000 today; so a press cost a few years' wages, comparable to buying a house. In other words, the publisher was a small businessman, requiring a large capital investment to get started, but one within the reach of many average people.Furthermore, a paper seldom reached readers far beyond the limits of the town or city it was based in.

Kennedy remarked, after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and defeat is an orphan. The failure of the Democratic Party to prevent Donald Trumps re?lection is a catastrophe of yet to be known proportions, and Kennedys remark is a reminder that everyone involved will try to shirk the blame when confronted with the wreckage. Morally, that blame must of course begin with the estimated eighty million people who voted for Trump. They have chosen to return to office a man who has already tried to throw out the votes of their fellow-citizens once, and who would surely have tried to throw them out again if he had lost on Tuesday. Kamala Harris must take a certain amount of responsibility for her truncated, insufficient campaign. But, among Democrats, the blame for Trumps victory overwhelmingly lies with one person: Joe Biden. Indeed, Trumps triumph will be Bidens real Presidential legacy. Little of the rest of what he accomplished is likely to survive another Trump term.The single biggest reason this defeat should fall on Bidens shoulders is that his stubbornness in refusing to step aside as the Democratic nominee until July short-circuited the possibility of staging a primary, and left Harris as the only real choice to replace him. Enough has been written about Biden wheezing through campaign appearances before eventually dragging out his farewell for weeks after the calamitous summer debate. But Bidens arrogance remains astonishing to behold: well before 2024, he was quite simply too old to ask people, in good faith, to keep him in office through 2028. He did so anyway, insuring that his age became the biggest political story of the first half of the year. The result depressed Democrats across the country and allowed the Trump campaign to attack its opponent in a manner it hadnt been able to since 2016.Harris began her campaign with a burst of excitementshe raised almost half a billion dollars in the first monthwhich suggested that Democratic voters were desperate for any candidate who was not Biden, or perhaps just any candidate born after D Day. As her race against Trump got under way, Harris had some fine moments, such as her debate performance. She evinced an ability to feed off the energy at large, boisterous rallies, and she spoke about the best two issues the Democrats had this cycleabortion and January 6thwith real passion.Still, this was far from a perfectly executed campaign, and she was far from an ideal candidate. Her unwillingness, or inability, to give coherent interview answerswhich led to her staff keeping her in bubble wrap until the final monthled to some embarrassing moments, such as her strange decision to refuse to distance herself from Biden on The View and elsewhere. Though the campaign released a series of policy proposals about the care economy, Harris never developed an economic vision that registered with a sufficient number of Americans. Its hard to think of a Democratic Presidential campaign in the postwar era that felt more constrained in its messaging, or more reactionary in its focus on the (admittedly myriad) flaws of its opponent. When the subject turned to foreign policywhether in Ukraine or GazaHarris could do little better than mumble platitudes.Imagine, then, Kamala Harris in a contested primary: someone who is not good in interview settings, who has few well-communicated policy ideas (something that appears to matter more these days to Democratic primary voters than to the general electorate), and who is unlikely to be seen as electable because she is tethered toindeed part ofan unpopular incumbent Administration. Harris would have had certain advantages in terms of name recognition, and perhaps fund-raising, but very little of what we saw during these past few months should make anyone think a primary campaign would have gone better for her than it did in 2020, when she flamed out months before the first primary votes were even cast.One could argue that a bruising primary this year might have left the Democrats with a nominee even weaker than Harris. That was always possible, but the Party is relatively stacked with popular swing-state governors and senators, many of whom ran ahead of Harris last night. (Why Harris did not choose one of them as her Vice-Presidential running mate is another question.) At the very least, a non-Harris nominee would likely have been someone without her baggage from the 2020 primaryher brief support for Medicare for All and for looser immigration restrictions were a centerpiece of the Trump campaigns attack adsand someone who had shown an ability to win an election in a battleground state.But the most crucial attribute that another candidate would have had? Not being the sitting Vice-President of the most unpopular Administration since George W. Bushs second term. Its perfectly reasonable to argue that the Democrats central weakness was having presided over a worldwide inflationary period that has already wounded incumbent political parties of varying ideologies, from the United Kingdom to Japanin a word, that this was the Republicans election to win, no matter the candidates. Yet this should have been another reason to pick a nominee with at least some distance from the current Administration.Meanwhile, the entirely unhelpful role that Biden played after Harris became the nominee, with his fumbles and missteps on the stump, only served to remind people how much they disliked the incumbent. (The most infamous of these was Biden seeming to call Trump supporters garbage, recalling Hilary Clintons deplorables comments from 2016.) We may never know why Harris did not break more fully with Biden, and why, in the course of multiple interviews, she declined to throw him under the metaphorical bus, but given the Presidents touchiness and self-regard its possible that at a personal level this was a hard thing for Harris to do. Perhaps this is a point in her favor as a colleague and as a friend, but it certainly hurt her campaign.Many of Bidens defenders will argue that, however gruesome these months have beencapped off by this weeks disasterhe leaves behind a legacy of policy achievements that rivals Lyndon Johnsons and Franklin Roosevelts. Biden oversaw an economic recovery that was remarkable by international standards, and passed an enormous climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. He embarked on a new era of antitrust enforcement and closeness to the labor movement, and started the process of bringing important manufacturing sectors back to the United States. He has made numerous strong appointments, from the federal judiciary to the Federal Reserve. And he has helped to keep Ukraine from being fully annexed by Russia.But Trump is expected to try to roll back or repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, and to overturn all of the Biden Administrations actions to regulate climate change. There is no reason to think he will have trouble doing so, especially with Republicans confident about holding the House after already capturing the Senate. As for Ukraine, and whether it will even exist in several months or a year, the less said the better. The one area of continuityother than aspects of China policy, the wisdom of which remains to be seenis probably going to be with regard to Israel and Gaza, where Bidens policies have been alternately inert and disgraceful. The legacy Biden leaves behind, then, is now quite likely to be paltry.Perhaps its best to judge Biden by the standard he set for himself. Five years ago, he announced that the impetus for his 2020 campaign was to defeat Donald Trump, and all that he represented, which in Bidens mind was (understandably) captured by Trumps handling of the 2017 white-supremacist march in Charlottesville. In that moment, Biden said, in the video that kicked off his campaign, referencing Trumps infamous both sides remark, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any Id ever seen in my lifetime. He continued by insisting that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation, and that, if Trump could be kept to only four years in office, history would look back on those years as aberrant. But, Biden continued, if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. Its in no small measure thanks to Joe Biden that all we can do now is hope he was wrong. ?","title":"Donald Trumps Second Term Is Joe Bidens Real Legacy"},{"text":"The main stumbling block to that is that they are unable to learn lessons that contradict their chosen funding source.","title":"Progressive Democrats push to take over party leadership"},{"text":"I'd suggest looking at a county by county map of where Democrats won before getting to rambunctious.

And she said \\"that passed congress 99 to 1!\\"And Sanders came in and said, \\"Yeah - I WAS THE ONE!\\"I mean that says it all. We all know the Iraq war was fucked. And Democrats were right fucking there with the rest of them. We watched them fail to prevent this horrible clusterfuck, never apologize or reconcile with it, and prop up a candidate who lead the charge as their nominee. And then sideline and turn their propaganda apparatus around on the singular voice who was nearly always on the right side of history.While Bernie didn't generate enough enthusiasm to win the primary, he represented a significant chunk of party enthusiasm especially among younger voters who were tired of hearing their grandparents' party refuse to change its messaging. Joe Rogan began a hard-right drift around the same time the party egregiously mishandled its influx of new, interested voters. Now, nine years later, those people have watched politics descend into a clusterfucking clown show, and they have watched Democrats run *exclusively* on \\"stopping Trump\\" without articulating what they're goig to do once he's gone that isn't simply *milder* tax cuts for the wealthy and more war in the Middle East.Harris was extended an invite to speak on Joe Rogan, and declined. Now, personally *I* think Rogan is a useless fucking meathead, but you know who doesn't? Tens of millions of voters. These are not the \\"abortion is the devil\\" people. These are mostly younger people who feel disillusioend with politics and are so desperate for companionship and humna contact in a world we have fucking broken, that they want to listen to this guy prattle on about nonsense like every conspiracy theorist gym rat. Harris should have taken that. But she's not good at three-hour talk sessions that will require a deviation from her messaging - *and that's what people don't like*. Harris knows the genocide in Gaza is wrong. But she can't say that, because the DNC is trying to appeal to people who think genocide is bad, while still taking all the donations and funds from people who are A-OK with it. Now clearly a vote for Trump is far worse for people living in Gaza. That's basic logical fact. But people do not make decisions on logic. They make it on emotions, and you cna't be a mature political party and pretend otherwise.Do you know what emotion is proven to be the *most* painful, the most difficult to endure for a human being? Betrayal. And listen to me. People. Make. Decisions. Based. On. Emotion. They just fucking do. So when Harris speaks out of both sides of her mouth on Gaza, her *supporters* are going to feel that lie. They're going to feel it, and be hurt by it. And they're going to want to hurt back. By not voting. You can scream all you'd like that they're just making things worse for Gazans by installing Trump - but people don't fucking work like that. If Democrats' entire messaging is about how horrible and monstrous Donald Trump is - and people feel betrayed by Democrats - what do you think they're going to try and do to hurt the people they feel betrayed them? This is all so painfully obvious and it is a lesson that Democrats have failed and failed and failed and failed to ever learn.","title":"To correct course, Democrats need to listen and change the way they talk to voters"},{"text":"She was the sitting vice president and apart of the administration Americans were so fed up with.","title":"Kamala Harris is just the latest victim of global trend to oust incumbents"},{"text":"Cookhttps://preview.redd.it/q3w1oufnrb0e1.jpeg?width=1070&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e0d693e8c5ddc47dc8ae670f9ccd37f2624b55!ping FIVEY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Now tell us where there is any empirical evidence suggesting this topic was on the minds of even a sliver of the electorate.

Yet each and every time they find these crafty ass ways around these specifically.  Indicating they are in bed with their elite donors, not any of us. Trump just orients propaganda around some of these 70%-favored policies with no intention of them ever seeing the light of day - but it's crystal clear that the inclusion, real or not, is noticed by voters.So, dems would need a seismic shift away from their faux-bread-and-butter, but the propaganda arms of the DNC are currently suggesting moving more to the right \\"bc it's what wins\\" and casting blame on their own voter base groups - signaling they wont budge, that actually they are considering being more like trump.

And make sure you visibly take credit for them (put your name on the checks!) then people will give you credit.The issue is that these policies may be extremely popular with the public (polling on caps on credit card interest and mandating employer coverage are big winners) but are extremely unpopular with economists and educated media types, so you'd take a big hit with massively negative media coverage.

When you?[join the Labour Party](https://labour.org.uk/about-us/why-you-should-join-the-labour-party/)?in Britain, you get mailed a welcome packet, complete with a membership card and information about how to get more involved. The Democratic Party could learn from this: It should mean something to?*join*?the Democrats. We should track how our membership is doing year-over-year. Local chairs who are successful at increasing membership should be celebrated and invited to help languishing chairs. Fundraising should be done primarily through annual membership dues. Our web infrastructure should drive people toward not just ad hoc volunteer events but sustained membership in their local Democratic committee.Second,?**Maps**. There should be an accountable Democratic captain for every neighborhood in the country. Captains should be known by their neighbors, because they are so visible organizing for the party all year long (not just during election season). The most persuasive canvassers during a campaign, of course, are the neighbors who already know you and your community.Third,?**Meeting Halls**. Monthly meetings should be designed with utmost care.?[Best practices](https://scholars.org/contribution/how-revitalize-americas-local-political)?for making meetings, working groups, and annual calendars warm and engaging should be gathered and disseminated. Formal rules and procedures should not be fetishized at the expense of engaging new members. Meetings should be welcoming enough that new members should be unconcerned with telling those they run into around town, Hope to see you at our next Democratic meeting! Eventually, each local party should work toward building physical Democratic meeting halls in their district, which can become lively community centers not just for party activities, but also for the partys?[broader local coalition](https://scholars.org/contribution/local-political-parties-guide)?of unions and progressive groups. (This could even be a useful place for the partys donor class to chip in; they could siphon off some of the billions they are pouring into election campaigns into the building of meeting halls instead.)Finally,?**Mutual Aid.**?The party should directly care for members and for the broader community. Democrats should do disaster relief, take on homeless-shelter shifts, cook food when members have a baby, welcome new immigrants to town, and host block parties throughout the year. Effective and inspiring community engagement should be celebrated statewideand turned into multi-chapter efforts. This is especially important in red districts: Trust is earned not through perfectly targeted messaging in the short run but through in-person care over the long run.","title":"The US Is a Civic Desert.

There wasn't anything fancy, we got married in a library, filed the paperwork, and then went to go get lunch at a german restaurant. I personally think that you don't NEED justification to want/not want people at your wedding.However I do see a couple issues with your justification of not wanting to invite these people:1. You are potentially inviting these people but telling them not to show up depending on how they voted. You're putting the action on them not to show up instead of yourself to not invite them. That seems very dirty and most people are going to see it as that. You have no way to enforce this so it just seems preformative. Anyone who wants to go but voted red can just show up anyways. Are you going to lead a witchhunt?2. You are also setting a standard that you may have issue with in the future. Uncle Bob having a cookout? Well sorry but y'all aren't invited due to potentially voting blue. Turns out he's a firm believer in the 2nd amendment and you voted for the party that platforms on taking away those rights. Are you ready for them to play the same game with you?3. Your fiance has stated that this will cause him a lot of drama. If you both were on the same page this would be easy but you're not. It really depends on what you're willing to put him through vs what you're willing to put yourself through. It sucks sure, but that's life. If this is that important that you absolutely need to stand your ground then he should understand, but at the same time you should understand that this can cause him social, emotional, and family drama that can for quite a while. Also depending on how close he is to his family, that drama may be doubled by how much it hurts him to do something like that.\\n \\nDespite my earlier statement, I'm on your fiance's side. It's easy to make this decision when you're not the one paying the higher price, especially if he is super close with his family. It seems to me like he would be paying for your decision with a lifetime of drama and hurt family feelings while you would be paying for one night where if you were actually excited to get married you really wouldn't think about anything else.But hey, if it really is that rough y'all can always elope.

Worse still many of those promises will undermine Republicans and Centrist districts more then they will harm liberal districts.So now this is the last Presidential term before we lead into the ever important redistricting period in 2030 which will be incredibly difficult for Republicans to control the process if the lose the swing states and impossible to control if the economy tanks and they open up even more swing states and districts.In reality Republicans barely won the election with a very slim majority in about 80 house seats and if we are looking at the senate about 20 of the current Senate seats could be lost by 2032. There is always another election and Republicans have been seeing a general downward trend line of support for decades now. They really can't afford another economic fuck up like 2008 and yet Trumps policy agenda is likely to cause just that and likely before midterm elections.Worse still for Republicans is that Trump has sucked all the oxygen out of the party leaving very little in terms of rising stars for the next Presidential election. This is bad news given that in all likelihood Trump is going to face a Financial crisis and banking crisis, a social crisis, a political crisis, a constitutional crisis and a geopolitical crisis in his term most of it of Trumps own making. So Republicans will have an awful lot of explaining to do and all those swing voters that move towards the GOP they are going to swing back to the Democrats come mid terms and beyond depending on how badly Trump fucks everything up and with the ambitious goals Trump has the fuck is likely to be monumental.Reality is the GOP if they don't grow a pair and learn to tell Trump to fuck right off they will see their party collapse especially if we end up in another 1930s style depression.

I am also gay with conservative family that continues to vote Republican, in spite of loving me and my now wife. It is a struggle to know they have   and will continue to vote in ways that put my marriage and human rights at risk.And yet. Having my family at my wedding was one of the most affirming experiences for me - to see my family truly see me. They were in a room full of gay people, maybe for the first time. They got to see how much love there was, between me and my wife, but also in the people who showed up to support us. My parents were face to face with the community that their news sources tell them to fear, and all they saw was love and support and beauty. And I got to see them, see that. In some ways, it helped with the anger because I got to say (not out loud but in my heart) See?? This is who we are!! We all laughed and cried and danced together. Its a memory I will cherish and I am so grateful I got to have.It sounds like your family may be similar, if they are wanting to attend your wedding. I think that because of the recency of the election, you may be feeling especially hurt and angry about their choices and actions. I get it. I am angry too.But if those relationships have any value to you, I think you will be hurting yourself as much as them by explicitly uninviting them to your wedding. You deserve to feel the love and support of your family on your wedding day. Seeing you and your husband on that day may impact the way they vote in the future, and it might not. But if you truly wish to get through to them, lashing out might feel good in the short term, but it will only push them further away. Finally, your future husband deserves to have the family he wants to have at his wedding. Pushing what you want onto how he treats his family is hurtful. It is as much his wedding as yours. Do you want to start your married life with a family in fracture? And potentially resentment from your future husband for the changes in his familial relationships?

Public sector wages are often lacking but if they were competitive in every sector then private sector companies would raise wages. The federal government and stage governments could also remove all subsidies for companies who give fat salaries and bonuses to executives or spokesmen but poor salaries to workers. Example: AT&amp;T would be ineligible for any government funding or tax breaks because their $30m CEO and just above minimum wage retail workers (like $20 in CA). In the recent past the CEO made like $2m and retail workers made good wage (like $50k in 2005). Tons of companies spend a lot of money on wages and compensation for executives and spokesmen while skimping on wages for employees. We could also pull funding for companies who outsource and even charge an outsourcing penalty/tax, similar to a tariff.

These transfers of wealth make them poorer and us richer.Special interests in the U.S. don't want foreign governments to send consumers free or cheap stuff, because they want to be able to sell us more expensive stuff. The case for tariffs is yet another case of special interest groups lobbying for government policies that use violence to enforce polices that enrich them at our expense.The U.S. has many core reasons why it can't compete globally, and most of them are due to overly burdensome government policies and taxes. The true path to wealth is for government to fix those problems by removing those regulations and lowering taxes. Raising tariffs is a step in precisely the wrong direction.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"We havent had a proper primary since 2008.

In his concurring opinion on the Dobbs case in 2022, Clarence Thomas stated that the court, \\"should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell\\" - with Obergefell being the case that required the entire nation to recognize and perform same-sex marriages.This isn't an argument against birth control (Griswold), legalized gay sex (Lawrence), and government-recognized same-sex marriage per se. There's a line of case law that takes the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments (\\"No person shall [...] be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\") and finds protection for unenumerated rights there (\\"substantive due process\\" or \\"SDP\\"). Judges have done this because the Supreme Court basically cut the Privileges or Immunities clause (\\"P&amp;I\\") of the 14th Amendment  (\\"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\\") in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873). The reasoning in that case makes no sense to anyone.Thomas thinks the Supreme Court was wrong in 1873 and wrong with the more recent substantive due process in reaction to the Slaughter-House Cases. He is advocating throwing all that convoluted case law out in favor of a much simpler revived Privileges and Immunities clause. This is an issue that nobody else on the Supreme Court cares about, including the three Trump appointees. The thinking from the other judges is probably along the lines of while Slaughter-House was obviously wrong, going with a P&amp;I regime isn't going to give meaningfully different results than an SDP regime, so why bother throwing out 150 years of precedent?","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"What does the bible say about sex-segregated bathrooms?","title":"Centrist Dems turn on far left after the election: 'Identity politics' is 'absolutely killing us'"},{"text":"I just found this lying around so Im going to drop it here.

Trump doesnt care and hands the Ukraine portfolio to a sub cabinet official like Undersecretary of Defense. They will manage the conflict just as Biden has, ensuring money keeps flowing to US defense manufacturers, but otherwise no meaningful change to Ukraines outlook. 2. Trump fast forwards the coarse Biden put them on and forces Ukraine to officially cede the territory they have lost and cannot hope to regain militarily. If they are lucky they might get security guarantees from NATO, or maybe just the US. 3. Abandonment. Trump gives Ukraine up to encourage Russia to pull away from Chinas sphere of influence.

I mean, what led to this, people couldn't vote...? How is what got us here going to get us out? When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. After all, repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result is the very definition of insanity. Out of all the hundreds of millions of Americans, who really thinks these were the best two candidates...? Is it a wise tribe that does not send its best warriors to fight? You see, your masters will never give you the tools to dismantle their houses... The Republic of America has a so-called \\"representative democracy.\\" How can that be true when the \\"representatives\\" are wealthy while the \\"represented\\" are not? American two party politics is like the cartoon Tom and Jerry. Tom doesn't really want to catch Jerry because then he'd be out of a job, and Jerry doesn't want Tom replaced with a cat that will actually eat him. So they act like they hate one another and put on a show for the masses while continuing business as usual in the back room. For example, insider trading laws do not apply to any members of Congress, either side. What's it called when those who make the rules don't have to live by them? Furthermore, when the punishment for a crime is only a fine, it does not apply to the wealthy. Sure, they can say they let us \\"vote\\", and therefore the outcome is our choice, but with all the lobbying and money in American politics, America is as much a democracy as would be two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for dinner or asking a child if they would like to go to bed at 7:59 or 8:01. In America, the wealthy have won every \\"election,\\" and the only thing to trickle down in the economy has been their generational wealth. This is why, in a true democracy as the ancient Greeks understood it, people got their representatives the same way we would get a jury. America is not a democracy. \\"Only those who do not seek power are qualified to hold it.\\" PlatoAnd please remember what we are actually celebrating on the 4th. A cabal of stolen land entitled elite, slave owning aristocrats, found a way to get out of paying their taxes. Only thirty percent of the colonists supported the \\"revolution\\" with the rest saying, \\"Why trade one tyrant a thousand miles away for a thousand tyrants one mile away...?\\" System isn't broken it's functioning exactly as intended.

He scolded a group of black male voters during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state. Obama told them it was not acceptable not to vote in the election and accused them of not feeling the idea of having a woman as president while ignoring all the policy failures under the Biden-Harris administration, from high inflations to rising crime rates.A few days later, it was Michele Obamas turn to admonish male voters, warning that their voting choices could put womens lives in danger. She claimed without evidence that, if elected, Trump would ban abortion nationwide (Trump never endorsed a national abortion ban). She chastised the male voters by painting a very dark picture: I am asking you, from the core of my being, to take our lives seriously.  Let me tell you all, to think that the men that we love could be either unaware or indifferent to our plight is simply heartbreaking.  So fellas, before you cast your vote, ask yourselves: What side of history do you want to be on?If the Obamas thought they could condemn and insult American men into submission, they had a rude awakening on Election Day. As The Wall Street Journal reported, exit polls show that Trump won 18- to 29-year-old men by 13 percentage points, securing 55% of that group compared with 42% for Kamala Harris.
