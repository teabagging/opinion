Christians view the world through a really dumbed down paradigm where anything not Christian is considered evil/satanic. Its a phenomenon that started centuries ago when the church went around killing off gnostics and ironically claiming the pagans were evil, while simultaneously burning them alive. But the intelligence communities do use Hollywood/media to influence the populace, push propaganda, and form narratives. Thats been like an open secret for decades. But its not like rappers are getting their lyrics handed to them by some spook in the shadows. Have you ever heard the expression sex sells? If someone wants to sell a record, sex is the way to go. It always has been. The younger generations are partying and having sex much less than the generations before them. Media is definitely influential. But one of the strongest influences to a human is fear. This is why the church trys and scares people with a made up explanation of hell. Younger kids live in alot more fear of the generations before them. Fear of climate change, economic collapse, STDs, and addiction. You see that reflected in data regarding gen z and gen alpha. I do think the overwhelming amount of satanic imagery in rap music these days is odd though. I get that its edgy and whatnot. But it seems excessive in 2024. I dont think it helps sell records/tickets all that much either.You used some Bangerz from like 10 years ago as examples lol. I remember when these songs dropped.

I'm sure you have internally consistent definitions of those words, but (without resorting to an omnipotent god to impose objective meaning) everyone else has just as much of a right to believe in their own definitions.What's interesting is how self-interested, rational individuals are motivated to believe in some definitions and not others-- are motivated to assimilate their definitions to those defined by some group or ideology.

It's a legal date for ballot application processing. Virtually every county I know of doesn't plan on sending VBM out until the end of Sept/early Oct, let alone get initial returns.https://x.com/blockedfreq/status/1834300776425939352In regards to the VBM to ED turnout ratio:  In 2022, and 2023 around 25% of voters voted by mail, plus Q-Pac who asks it's responders how they will vote, also got a 75/25 result.  Using this, by the time the mail ins are in we can get a pretty good estimate of overall turnout.  Though not as accurate we can also look at the number of ballot requests, around 80% of ballot requested are filled out and sent in. Joshua Smithley who has been looking at early mail in ballot requests in strong, and strongly trending Dem counties sees early good signs for turnout.  If that continues as he expects, Trump's path ain't going to be easy.  Trump is really going to want high, 2020 level rural turnout, with an increase in margins there for it to stay competitive.  I'll have to do the math on this later to get the rough numbers, but I'd imagine if it is near 2020 level turnout across the state he's going to need a couple things still: - Increase his margins in the rurals, and Philly.  - Hope the big blue trending area's, mainly Allegheny, Cumberland, and the burb counties around Philly have blue shifts that are minimal to none. Finally, there should be a good quality in state PA poll or two this upcoming week.  Most of the recent PA polls have been from pretty poor pollsters, so it will be nice to finally get some good ones, who really know the state. If you want to keep up to date on the happenings in PA, I highly recommend following Joshua Smithley, where I'm getting most my info from. Eventually, he'll post on the mail in ballot to ED firewall roughly needed for Harris to win.  That is the number of mail in ballots Harris wants to lead by going into election day.  In 2023, his firewall numbers on the supreme court race showed Mccaffery getting more than he needed, and the additional percent over that number ended up nearly matching the final margin of the race.

But the ways in which it promotes those things are gender neutral-- anything a man can be proud of doing, a woman can be proud of doing too. In theory, the  same in true in reverse, but in practice there are some things men aren't *as* lauded for, and there are some things the vast majority of men simply aren't biologically capable of. Conservativism, on the other hand, supplies examples of things men can do or be that they have a comparative advantage in.There are costs to that, obviously. If a man wants to be a doctor, it makes some sense for him to hang out with a conservative crowd that will provide him a boosted social status from his choice in profession. But consistently sorting men into being doctors and women into being nurses purely on the basis of their gender leads to a world with with fewer, and worse, medical practitioners.

Watch PBS....it's a great example of how journalism DID and should work. If a journalist covers something you shouldn't be able to see their opinion of the story they're producing. I watched the debate on PBS and the coverage before the event, all of the journalists interviewed both sides, and let the people speak. There wasn't any smiling, laughing, or prodding for the statements they want to get to push a story they want to make. All media is headed the same direction of barely being able to call themselves news now. Look at Fox, they can't even call themselves a news network legally. So instead of fixing the problem, it seems most conservative thinkers decided \\"okay, let's just get more of the bad\\". It does nothing to address or fix the issue by allowing any social media influencer that wants to pretend to be a journalist free rein to mislead and falsely report anything they want. We do have fact checks on a lot of stuff, that is usually self imposed by the entity itself, but there's no real oversight, and people tend to just get super bent out of shape over it, especially if something gets flagged improperly. Having a group of journalistic oversight and accountability wouldn't be that difficult. I'm not a politician, journalist, or lawyer, so I don't really know the best way to tackle it, but I think we were kind of on the right track prior to Musks acquisition of Twitter. If someone continuously lies, and causes civil unrest or other negative consequences of their posting, they should have that privilege taken away.

It also gives options for higher pay if you are able to work for yourself, which may have the added effect of corporations and bigger companies having to raise wages to attract workers. This potential for higher wage will help catch up with the inflation from COVID supply chain issues and the stimulus checks (from Trump and Biden, in case people still want to blame inflation on the president instead of the situation)2) higher supply of houses will lower housing cost. And the down payment assistance will help new homeowners afford the down payment, lowering the barrier for homeownership.

They all won, but Kamala has the benefit of seeing how things played out. Sure, Hillary won but it reinforced the idea that shes a bitch or whatever. She focused too much on not coming off as soft and ended up playing into the idea that shes this ruthless, arrogant individual. Now we have those debates to study regarding how the public double standards for women work. Kamala managed to be tough to Trump while still being more human and vulnerable to us. She also showed Trump a lot of decency before getting tough on him. That introduction was a masterstroke. Hillary coming out and immediately calling him Donald may have rattled him, but it made her look like an asshole when Trump was making a big deal of how to correctly address her in return. Then of course with Biden 2020 it just came across as two old men yelling at each other, which worked because Biden seemed like the less out of touch of the two. He got the benefit of getting away with will you shut up, man which I dont think the public would take very well from a woman. Hopefully when Kamala becomes President we wont have to deal with so many ridiculous expectations for future female candidates. But for now, she really nailed the perfect balance.

However, a vast majority of Trump's net value is currently tied up in Truth Social (or rather it's parent company).  At it's height, he had about 4 Billion on paper in stock, but he wasn't allowed to touch this, but the stock has dropped *a lot* since then, notably going down about 15% on Wednesday.  In real terms, this is about a 200 million dollar loss for Trump, so his current worth is probably about 3.5 Billion.It's still an impressive number, but the amount that is built on a scam company (Truth Social's fundamentals are **horrible),** is troubling.  Given the shear amount of stock he owns, he'll probably still come out with a nice windfall, but it could still be a lot less than it is even now if the other larger investors decided to dump stock before he can.Finally, note that the Forbes numbers also don't cover his legal liabilities, since those are under appeal.  However, if all judgements stand, that a loss of another 1/2 billion.","title":"Donald Trump Trolls Taylor Swift for Endorsing Kamala Harris, Says He Likes Brittany Mahomes Better and Swift Will Pay a Price for It in the Marketplace"},{"text":"No doubt about it.

To be effective, ideologies need to present some sort of idea of what the \\"good life\\" is.To women, liberalism suggests liberation from conservative gender norms, the ability to decline to carry a pregnancy to term, better career and educational opportunities, and a network of mutual support. To men, liberalism offers... what? Equality of opportunity? If so, it's an empty promise that conservative ideologies outbid at every turn. Liberals aren't exactly trying very hard to increase the acceptance of male kindergarten teachers. And again, that's understandable-- liberals intentionally focus on *marginalized* groups. If all liberalism has to offer men is, \\"you're basically a woman except you're more likely to be a criminal and also you can't bear children,\\" it's naturally going to have a recruiting shortfall compared to an ideology that lauds men for their strength and aggression-- that promotes those traits as being desirable and special-- that offers social and physical capital in return for their employment in the ideology's service.","title":"Exploring Young Women's Leftward Expansion.

He keeps things interesting but only because of the way he speaks. He's entertaining (and frightening), shows self-confidence (arrogance), was seen as a 'change from the status quo,' and uses simple language, which is actually a good thing when speaking to the general public. As disgusting a person he is, he still appealed to people.Hillary had some charisma, but she was still part of the 'old ways' pre-Obama political campaign methods that a lot of politicians used. Attempts to pander to young voters was hit-or-miss. Many still remembered what her husband did and we can't deny that soured her name for a few people. And the \\"they go low, we go high\\" idea, the 'stay classy' rhetoric just didn't take off.Biden was a familiar face, a good taste of sanity compared to Trump. He had a better track record, appealed to people in government who still had some sensibility, and leaned closer towards the \\"Christian family man\\" image. But weird behavior, poorly-landing jokes and a little bit of his own rambling and age did result in some loss of charisma. His blows were often too soft, even if he did have his moments (\\"Will you shut up, man?\\").And then comes in Kamala. The \\"same old white person\\" argument is now dismembered. Feminism, all the way. She spoke clearly, she spoke with fire, she aimed straight for the young voters, and she acknowledged not only does she hear the people's grievances, she's lived them. She has the aggressive progressiveness we'd been starving for. She stays focused, she stands her ground, and when she enters the room, she attracts respect and owns the space. When she swings, she swings hard and she doesn't miss.Hillary's debate was frustrating, but expected. Biden's first debate (2020) was a welcome change but not phenomenal. Biden's second debate was so awful, we didn't think we'd recover. Kamala's debate was so vicious, the schadenfreude was so gratifying, that even the other side is impressed.Let's be honest, American politics has become a soap opera. It's been like that for a while -- voters pick who is the most attractive, but not just that, who speaks the best.

Number one, she said she'll go back to congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 --essentially 50-50 in both senate and the house. She's not going to get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. The student loans -- and then her I think probably her boss, if you call him a boss, he spends all his time on the beach, but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the supreme court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about -- this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost. To the millions and millions of people that had to pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free.

Because your running mate JD Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.\\"His response:\\n\\"Well, I didn't discuss it with JD In all fairness. JD -- And I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get -- they didn't even come close to getting student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved.

He had no hard evidence to warrant either of those.Finally, another unacceptable flaw was shown later in the debate when the moderator asked him about January 6th, and he claimed he had nothing to do with it.

Even if you want to prepare for every other contingency like war with Japan and the EU, you need to acknowledge the opportunity cost that would take away from preparation for war with China.Steel manufacturing is massively overblown for the war that needs to be fought. The type of steel needed, the amount of steel needed, and the cost to provide that steel through specifically domestic manufacture is all out of whack. I guarantee you that every dollar spent protecting the steel industry would have ten times greater effect if spent on manufacturing some of the critical components of precision guided missiles, some of which have critical points of failure and a *single* manufacturer. Steel protectionism has literally gotten Americans killed, due to the added complexity in upamouring MRAPs in the Iraq war causing delays, where they could have just used steel made literally anywhere. Someone with your precise mentality in the 1990s and 2000s got soldiers killed, and for what benefit? Japan is still an ally twenty years later: was the \\"just in case\\" worth the actual deaths?But this case is even worse, because we aren't even talking about steel protection *really*. We are talking about one of America's closest allies *bailing out a failing and inefficient steel mill that is likely on track for closure.* If America wants to defend Taiwan and contain China (with triple the population of the States!) it is going to need 1) assistant from allies, 2) an efficient economy. America *cannot afford* to thumb it's nose at allies and inefficiently subsidise failing industries every single time someone sneezes out the words \\"national security.\\"If you actually care about national security, get every single dollar you want to give to a steel worker who is producing steel for everything from kitchen appliances to office buildings to steel capped boots, and pour that into buying HE pouring kettles and turbofan engine manufacture in joint ventures with Japan, Taiwan, Australia and NATO. If America needed to surge building aircraft carriers, it can supply all the steel needs for a decades worth of steel import through a single month's imports from Canada alone.

In that same time, the US's federal budget has been (roughly) $6 trillion per year. That's about $15 trillion since the war has started, meaning that the $175 billion of aid accounts for 1.17% of the federal budget, an entirely insignificant amount when it comes to inflation. Also, the US isn't sending money directly to Ukraine. It's sending supplies, meaning that money goes to American companies and American jobs.Also, illegal immigrants pay taxes (https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/), and 94% of illegal households have at least one worker, compared to 73% of US-born households. They're no more of a drain on social services than other lower class workers.And again, how does Trump solve these? Stop any aid to Ukraine and let Putin bulldoze the country? Mobilize the US military and go \\"door to door\\" (something he agreed with) to deport illegal immigrants?

Donald Trump is spreading these insane false rumors, when the people of Springfield are facing real problems that have nothing to do with this crazy racist conspiracy theory.  Legal Haitian immigrants are not eating people's pets, but they are disproportionately moving to Springfield because of jobs and wanting to move to a place where there are other Hattians, and that is causing a housing shortage there.  The intent of the Haitian refugee relief program was never to overburden any one small town with legal immigrants, but because offering relief to that town needs to be an act of congress, the executive branch can't help.  Worse, Republicans are currently using the residents of Springfield like pawns:  they refuse to address these issues because Trump wants the problems to persist in order to flame the fires of anger that help him get elected!  Trump causes the problem to persist when it doesn't need to!  For instance, I supported a comprehensive border bill, but Trump .... yada yada ....  When I am president and we have a democrat house and democratic senate, our party will pass legislation to bring temporary, and then permanent housing relief to the residents of Springfield.  We will bring real relief, and not just more racial discord.\\"And it would have been game over for Trump.  But instead, she only addressed the farce that Trump created without addressing the real issues that people are upset about.The influx of legal Haitian refugees has caused them to become something like 30% (?) of the population of Springfield, if the report I saw and my memory is accurate.

If the turnout is different than usual trends, the polls will be wrong. They dont simply call 1000 people and report 520 said Harris and 480 said Trump.

But the point is the liberals want to give abortion choice to the federal government over the peoples choice in the state and when you do that, things get blurry. I personally find the whole abortion topic as a smoke and mirror tactic. It shouldnt be a frontline, decision breaking issue. I think women should be able to move to the state that allows it and live happily ever after.

One of the things they call out is:\\nHarriss plan was to take ICEs enforcement funds and  grant them to non-governmental organizations  specifically so that services for illegal aliens could be provided by a social worker, employed by a nonprofit entity . In other words, Harriss plan was to take money Congress gave to ICE for enforcement purposes and funnel it to immigration attorneys and immigrant right groups, which undoubtedly would have benefited many virulent anti-border, anti-ICE activists.That's smart policy. The border has plenty of enforcement, the issue is that the courts have giant logjams requiring people wait, sometimes years, for their case to be heard. More immigration lawyers has to be priority #1 at the border, its the core issue. They call out this bill:\\nAnd in 2019, Harris was an original co-sponsor of S. 326, demanding that no funds appropriated or otherwise made available prior to the date of the enactment of this Act may be used for the construction of barriers, land acquisition, or any other associated activities on the southern border without specific statutory authorization from CongressBut don't mention that at the time Trump was actively trying to find ways to fund the wall through other sources. Democrats were never against border walls/fences as a concept, they were against Trump's insane plan to try and wall the entire border. Then they get mad at her for preferring ankle bracelets instead of locking up migrants waiting hearings:\\nIf an individual is not eligible for release from custody, [DHS] shall consider the alien for placement in secure alternatives that maintain custody over the alien, including the use of electronic ankle devices. [DHS] may use secure alternatives programs to maintain custody over any alien detained under this Act except for aliens detained under section 236A [regarding alien terrorists and the Alien Terrorist Removal Court] . The term secure alternatives program means any custodial or noncustodial program under which an individual is screened and provided with appearance assistance services or placed in supervision programs, as needed, to ensure that the individual appears at all immigration interviews, appointments, and removal or deportation hearings.Even though stats show the overwhelming majority of those people show up for their hearing. Additionally all of those people have not yet had their cases heard, we don't yet know if they are legitimate cases or not, so its makes perfect sense to avoid putting them in a cell.This entire article could be summarized as \\"Kamala Harris understand the actual issues at the border and seeks compassionate solutions instead of just building a big dumb useless wall\\"","title":"Sen.

It was among the most one-sided debates I have ever watched. History may settle on September 10 as the turning point in the 2024 election and therefore as Trumps real Waterloo (hes had a few false ones). I sincerely hope so. In the meantime, Harris has an election to win. Nothing about Americas cognitive polarisation gives me confidence that her victory would be anything other than close. Which means that the health of the US economy, and voter perceptions of Harriss grasp of it, remains just as critical to the outcome as before. Economics is Harriss Achilles heel. She is as halting in discussing kitchen-table economics as she is fluent on Trumps unfitness to be president, or the righteousness of Ukraines cause. Thankfully for Harris, Trump failed to bring that out in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Her skill at messing with Trumps head brought her a reprieve. But she will need repeatedly to check that economic box in the next 52 days. Can she do it??    \\n  \\nBefore answering, let me clear up one easy misperception. Whatever the weaknesses in Harriss economic pitch, nothing she has proposed would come close to the damage Trumps plans would wreak. His Trump tariff agenda would push up US inflation, hit middle-class incomes, and cost potentially millions of jobs  not to mention the geopolitical fall out from full speed ahead deglobalisation. Then there are his plans to deport more than 10mn undocumented immigrants, as well as his loathing of the US Federal Reserves independence. Cumulatively, Trumps misguided missiles could tip the US into recession in 2025. Nothing Harris is floating would come close to the damage of Trump 2.0. But she still needs to make the sale.    \\n  \\nI have observed Harriss various economic announcements with some puzzlement. A few of her proposals, such as renewing the child tax credit, make both political and economic sense. Some, such as her plans to tackle price gouging in the supermarket industry, could make political sense but are terrible economic ideas. The same applies to her opposition (via Joe Biden) to Nippon Steels acquisition of US Steel. Bidens veto puts a bomb under the whole concept of friendshoring without doing anything for US employment. But it has doubtless helped cement Harriss various union endorsements. Others, such as her proposal for a wealth tax on those worth more than $100mn, depend very much on the details. Wealth taxes are notoriously hard to administer but fit in with most peoples sense of social equity (including mine). It made political sense for Harris to propose a lower increase in the capital gains tax on the highest earners, setting it at 28 per cent compared to Bidens 39.6 per cent. Given that Trump is trying to paint Kamala as a Kalifornia Kommunist, she needs to signal centrism.?    \\n  \\nWhat I am missing in all of this is a coherent overarching message. It is not enough to talk about rebooting the opportunity economy and backing the dreams of the American people, as Harris did in her opening answer on Tuesday night. These sentiments are fine but she needs to make her case more tangibly than that. To be sure, she is handicapped by her inability to distance herself too much from Bidenomics, which remains unpopular even though its track record is pretty good. Harris cannot repudiate her boss without bringing her own role as vice-president into question. Nor, given the polling numbers, which remain good for Trump on the economy, can she embrace continuity. Hers is a difficult needle to thread. She may get some help next week when the Fed cuts interest rates  although given the stubbornness of core inflation, probably by only a quarter of a percentage point. But she also needs to help herself. Right now, all I see is a confusing jumble of populist gimmicks, centrist reassurances, soothing rhetoric and a lot of shape-shifting. Economics is the part of Harriss game that requires the most work.","title":"Its still the economy, stupid, for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Hence the smiley.

And I'm not even talking about CCP subsidies so Chinese businesses can run roughshod over foreign business competition, which is absolutely happening as well... They are essentially being subsidized by the US government via the de minimis loophole this article is about.\\n \\nAs the person above says, whether you buy your consumerist garbage from Amazon or Temu, its all coming from the same Chinese factories, so it doesn't make much sense to pay 50% more for it from Amazon. Well most of that markup from Amazon isn't for their share of the profit, its from needing to pay import tariffs. While Temu doesn't need to pay those tariffs due to this loophole.\\n \\nBecause when Amazon buys an entire shipping container of junk from China, that counts as one thing for importation purposes and obviously far exceeds the de minimis threshold, so they pay normal import tariffs. But Temu will sell that same shipping container full of junk, but instead of it counting as one thing, each individual item inside counts as its own separate thing because they have sold them all separately, each one far below the de minimis threshold, so they don't pay import tariffs on any of it.\\n \\nAnd then there is even more subsidization on top of that... China retaining its status as a developing nation means they also get shipping subsidies from the west... So it cost them far less to ship that same example container than it costs the likes of Amazon. This is why you can pay a few bucks for something on those Chinese sites and get free shipping to the US, but trying to return it to them costs you like ten times as much as you paid for it, assuming they would even take it back at all...

So, for example, if you go by the economy, take a look at the jobs numbers since Reagan.  Trump is one of two presidents to lose jobs, him and Hoover.  You can look at the fact that every Republican since Reagan started a recession and each following Democrat fixed it and then some.  Clinton balanced the budget, we had a debt that was going down until Bush fought two wars and passed tax cuts for the rich without raising any revenue.  Then Trump had what 5 trillion in tax cuts for rich.  The rich's cuts are permanent and the middle class smaller ones expire.If you are pro-choice, do I have to explain at this point?  Republicans and Trump want to control women's bodies, ban books, spread hate about immigrants.He had 4 years to do something at the border, and he never did.  The border that he visits was built by Obama.  Biden/Harris almost got a big border bill done that would have helped speed up the asylum cases by a lot, so they wouldn't have to let them in while they wait for their court case to happen. But you know now that Trump called Republicans in congress to kill it.  The bill had nothing for \\"Dreamers\\" or paths to citizenship.  It was all conservative items like more funding for border patrol, etc.Do you support equality, men and women, LGBTQ+.  Is it one of those my freedom ends where your nose begins things?

They have plans to gut public education in this country.He did nothing when a US journalist was dismembered in a Saudi embassy, in fact Jared got billions for giving the now king of Saudi Arabia intel on who opposed his ascension to the crown so he could kidnap / torture those who opposed him so he could be King.It's worth looking with fresh eyes at the Mueller report, part 1 is all the contacts with Russia and part 2 is obstruction of justice instances (which is why part 1 didn't result in any charges).The insurrection on Jan 6 2021 should also be looked at.  We know from congressional testimony by his own administration that when the Secret Service denied his request that they drive him to the capital, that he literally lunged at the steering wheel to try to make them agree to it.  We heard that his staff knew of these plans to try to go to the capital to lead the mob in.  Had he made it to the capital that day, the crowd might have actually succeeded in killing members of congress.  A lot of other coups in history that were successful have that in common.  The strongman's presence put them over the top.We also know that the intelligence services, when briefing Trump, would hold back things they thought would be damaging should they get out to the world or Russia, because they had gotten burned early in the administration.  Just before he left, the intel services put out worldwide bulletins stating that all undercover agents were at risk, a huge amount disappeared during that time.  We all know he took a huge amount of classified documents to mira lago, which was already full of foreign agents.So pick some issues and see where you land.

From 5000 years or so of accessible human history the obvious conclusion is that people are imperfect and so any system they devise to overcome that imperfection and create a perfect government will be, duh, imperfect. But to really demolish your argument:After the great depression and three years of virtual inaction by conservatives in government, America elected the most liberal government in its history. \\\\~ That government handled the depression at least as well, if not better, than any other nation on earth and it did so without creating fertile ground either for fascism or communism. \\\\~ It put industry back on its feet so that when the war broke out it was in a position to completely out-perform the rest of the world combined. \\\\~ It prepared the nation for a war it was going to have to fight while isolationists and fascists sympathizers at home worked tirelessly to thwart those preparations. \\\\~ It defeated fascism on two fronts while supplying arms and food to all of our allies. \\\\~ After the war it helped rebuild the economies of both our allies and our former enemies.\\\\~ In doing so it created an entirely new economic model and a Pax Americana under which the world has thrived. \\\\~ In the process it created the largest, healthiest, best fed, most upwardly mobile middle class in history.\\\\~ In the process it created the finest schools, industry, hospitals, transportation infrastructure, military the world had ever seen. \\\\~ It slowly but systematically dismantled the institutionally sanctioned racism the nation had been born with. It did all this so well that after FDR's election to the presidency a conservative couldn't get elected to the white house for 36 years. And after we started electing conservatives again and started incorporating conservative policies and practices back into our government and economy, wages have flattened, teachers have to buy crayons for their kids from their own inadequate salaries, families can't afford college, the infrastructure our liberal forefathers built is falling apart, our allies have been betrayed and dismayed, we laid waste to democracy in central America, created a pack of failed states in our back yard whose populations are desperate to escape across our borders and instead of universal health care we have between 700 and 800 billionaires, none of whom pay close to the tax rate that a teacher pays. Democracy isn't the problem. Conservatives constantly undercutting democracy is the problem.","title":"CMV: Democracy is an inefficient form of government and serves citizens poorly"},{"text":"Today [September 6th], the U.S. Department of Transportations Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced $1.9 billion for 519 grants in 48 states, Guam, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, in its fifth announcement under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP).

Republicans are not the only people concerned with border control or inflation. The reason they dont know why anyone would vote for Donald Trump is because he will objectively make those things worse.As an example, looking at the economy, he keeps talking about adding more tariffs. And saying other countries are going to pay, but he simply does not understand how tariffs work. Tariffs are like the US saying if you want to bring your foreign goods into our country, you have to pay a tax. The idea is to promote domestic industry, but it does so by making foreign industry more expensive. The problem is, a *lot* of the goods that we use are foreign. Even if the final product is assembled in the US, it may very well contain parts that were imported. For example, there are no *purely* American cars. The NHTSA measures what percentage of auto parts are domestic or imported and even the *most* domestic cars only have 70% of their parts made in the US or Canada. The same goes for many other types of goods. And the companies that sell those goods arent just going to let that extra cost slide. So, the prices of both foreign *and* domestic goods rise. Meaning, with Trumps tariffs, it is going to be even harder to provide for your family.So, the reason it is hard to believe why someone would vote for Trump isnt because Democrats dont understand the struggles and dont understand how Trumps rhetoric appeals to people with those struggles. The reason is because with just a *tiny* bit of fact-checking, it is obvious that he isnt going to be the one to fix those problems.","title":"CMV: Democracy is an inefficient form of government and serves citizens poorly"},{"text":"x","title":"CMV: Democracy is an inefficient form of government and serves citizens poorly"},{"text":"I don't think you understand how Amazon works.","title":"Biden targets Shein, Temu with new rules to curb alleged 'abuse' of U.S. trade loophole"},{"text":"People who voted for Trump did so because an elite told them to.","title":"Dems Capitalize on Taylor Swift Support With Ad Touting Kamala Era"},{"text":"He clearly refused to do any debate prep, faced the consequences for being unprepared and is trying to deflect it by saying it was all rigged.

Most of the time the MSM won't allow that so journalists are forced to go to so-called right-wing outlets where there's a little wiggle room in censorship.There is no right or left anymore. There's no ideology. There's only the billionaire oligarchy which is driven by greed. Therefore, these journalists' beliefs have not moved anywhere.

Historical and Structural Factors\\nDestruction of the Authentic Left: The American Left has faced significant suppression and fragmentation since the 1960s, including government actions against prominent figures and movements. This historical context has contributed to the weakening of a genuine Leftist presence in American politics.None of this has anything to due with recent (1990's onward, or 2010's onward), rapid changes in \\"culture war\\" type issues, international companies expanding, or with the problems of international trading agreements.Hell for that matter he ignores the \\"Freak Left\\" (Weather undeground, etc) that started undermining the \\"legit left\\" in the 1960's, and paints all the undermining of the left as a sort of publicly visible clampdown by the FBI. The FBI had plenty of much, much more alarming \\"subversions\\", including \\"Black socialists\\" (I forget the name, the people with the Kwanza holiday who followed Karenga) who infiltrated Black Panthers, started infighting, started killing the legit ones, that the FBI did not deny were their own. NYtimes article from 1976 [on FBI created infighting that led to plenty of killings](https://www.nytimes.com/1976/01/05/archives/fbi-accused-of-69-bid-to-exploit-blacks-feud.html)*\\"WASHINGTON, Jan. 4The Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to capitalize on the violent and sometimes fatal battling between two West Coast black militant groups in 1969, according to memorandums in the files of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\\"*Counterpunch article on some of the [culture war back and forth](https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/03/09/acidhead-on-the-run/) with the \\"freak left\\" undermining and concerning \\"legit left\\" in the 60's/70's. Back to OP article; Co-optation by Corporate Democrats: As you noted, the mainstream Democratic Party has adopted some progressive rhetoric while often maintaining the status quo of corporate interests and wealth inequality. This has led to a perception among some critics that the Democrats are merely performative progressives.'2. Disillusionment and Reactionary Shifts\\nDisillusionment with Liberal Establishment: Figures like Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi have expressed deep frustration with the liberal establishment, which they view as hypocritical and corrupt. This disillusionment can lead to an embrace of more radical or contrarian positions, including support for elements of the Right.Rejection of Woke Culture: Some of these figures have expressed skepticism or outright rejection of aspects of contemporary social justice movements, which they see as stifling free speech or being excessively punitive. This rejection can push them into alignment with Right-wing critiques of cancel culture and identity politics.'3. Influence of External Actors\\nRussian Influence: The role of Russian operatives and their financial support to Right-wing influencers and media is a significant factor. Russias efforts to sow discord and undermine American institutions have played a role in amplifying extreme viewpoints and destabilizing the political landscape.Funding and Platform Support: The availability of funding from Right-wing sources and the support of platforms that are more lenient towards controversial figures provide an environment where these individuals can thrive and find new audiences.'4. Media and Platform Dynamics\\nPlatform Manipulation: Social media platforms and other digital spaces have become crucial in shaping political narratives. The manipulation and exploitation of these platforms by various actors, including Elon Musk, have contributed to the polarization and distortion of political discourse.Yes, evil right-wing extremist divider Elon Musk, by removing the power of big [MSM/NGO's as seen in the case of Japanese Twitter](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1f9qvfk/this_scumbag_claims_hes_always_had_workers_backs/llpk7hf/), is responsible for letting the \\"dumb proles\\" run wild. Economic Incentives: The economic incentives for media personalities to embrace controversial or polarizing viewpoints can drive some to align with Right-wing narratives, as these often attract larger audiences and more financial support.I'm gonna disagree with this. It's much harder to get access to large media platforms the more controversial you get. Only a figure like Tucker Carlson can rise up after getting \\"cancelled\\", smaller ones can't. Case in point, how many \\"advertiser boycotts\\" and other boycotts have targeted and cancelled \\"left wing\\" figures, outside of maybe the Israel issue? '5. The Role of Ideology and Personal Beliefs\\nPersonal Beliefs and Ideology: Some individuals, such as Russell Brand and RFK Jr., may have genuine ideological shifts or personal beliefs that align more closely with Right-wing perspectives. Their journeys reflect a complex interplay of personal convictions and broader political trends.Captain fucking obvious figures out that people change their mind on some topics. But the big sin of omission here is he ignores the fact these people generally retain heterodox views. RFK is bringing in his conservation and eco-protectionism to the GOP, not the other way around. '6. Symbiotic Relationship Between Political Extremes\\nPolitical Polarization: The symbiotic relationship between centrist Democrats and extreme Right-wing figures creates a binary political landscape where moderate views are marginalized, and extreme positions gain prominence. This dynamic can drive individuals who are disillusioned with the center to explore more radical options.\\nHe's saying the Democrats need to 1- be better at performances with more token concessions to their progressive wing  2- be better at censorship. Twitter becoming a wild west is a big problem  3- more effectively demonize Russia and Russiagate targets. Part of this involves demonizing Wikileaks for their 2016 work4- they need to keep a closer watch on their fringes and pre-emptively \\"bring the radicals to heel\\" before they turn into legit dissidents (as Kyle Kulinski has been thinking)5- they need to be more aggressive labelling people \\"right wing grifters\\", and keep the brand monopoly on \\"true left wing\\" 6- Dems need to also discredit people with heterodox views as crazy, weird, and ostracize/shame them on that basis, rather than acknowledge any concerns they haveThe author pushes some legitimately dangerous ideas, including dismissing all problems with the Democrats current culture as just poor brand management, and tries to hide behind a sort of neutral and academic qualification. This guy unironically implies that Wikileaks in 2016 was a crypto fascist organization that coordinated with Trump's campaign. Coincidentally he doesn't bring up that the Russian state considered Wikileaks a \\"CIA Asset\\" for their role in the Syrian/Assad leaks a few years prior, but I digress.I really love that Chatgpt helps me summarize the fluff in incredibly short amounts of time, so I don't have to commit research-paper levels of effort into debunking nonsense that some pseudo-intellectual pro-establishment extremist pumps out.","title":"Pinchbeck et al: Why do Left-ish journalists and influencers - Matt Taibbi, Russell Brand, Glenn Greenwald, Joe Rogan, RFK - end up supporting, tacitly or explicitly, the Trump-ian Right?"},{"text":"Are we getting broad online retailer legislation or just Shein/Wish/Temu targeted law?","title":"Biden targets Shein, Temu with new rules to curb alleged 'abuse' of U.S. trade loophole"},{"text":"Voodoo is indeed real and it's a very misunderstood and maligned belief system.
