Republicans were once war hawks who would have salivated at Ukraine. How did this change? Why would the Republicans become anti-interventionist? From my point of view, Europe and the left have reaped what it has sown, and that letting Ukraine bleed is the only way anyone will learn. This is not good for Ukraine but good for the US and the west as a whole.The USA is endlessly criticized for its military industrial complex and it's world police status. For years Republicans have been called monsters for intervening in the middle east and funding our war machine while remaining dead silent on Korea or Yugoslavia where we did a good thing. Conversely leftists have denounced our military industrial complex and want it untethered from our economy since it is war profiteering. It is those same people who denounced the republicans for defending the military industrial complex and interventionist polices begging for both those things. Sadly, they got what they wanted. Less intervention and a disdain to the military industrial complex. Then we have the issue of NATO members refusing to pay 2%. After the Soviets fell NATO members cut their militaries, and the right wing of America saw our allies dissolve their militaries essentially. The German military was so underfunded they had to spend a year shouting BANG to simulate gunfire. Even Obama said NATO should fund their militaries, and was met with silence. When Trump threatened to leave NATO, Europe still refused. Now we have Ukraine and they realize that the Americans had a point. Now before you say the American military gear is perfect and they are not needed, look at Ukraine. We sent them M1 Abrams tanks, but the Ukrainians can't use them. Our tech is too high end and requires years of training. Instead, the Ukrainians use German tanks since they are simpler and easier logistically. Sadly, Germans don't have many tanks. If Europe had done as the US requested, perhaps we would have less deaths in Ukraine. Perhaps if the people of Europe listened 10 years ago, they would have more tanks. Perhaps if they did as we asked, this war would have ended. We will never know.Then there are things like Nordstream 2. The people of Europe decided to rely on Russian gas. The US had explicitly warned them not to do that and to diversify, and we have videos of politicians laughing at the thought of Russia being an enemy. The right wing was called paranoid and that the era of war was over. There was an energy crisis in Europe as a result of this over reliance. Nobody in Europe is laughing.Only the right wing is laughing.Hypothetically, if the US were to step in, fund everything, and curbstomp Russia, then Europe has no incentive to be introspective. They would double down their past actions and buy more Russian gas, dissolve their militaries because they know the Americans will defend them, and in the same breath criticize the Americans for being world police. The people of Europe would not learn their lesson, and they would repeat it because they have not suffered for their actions. They would continue to grow closer to China and Russia knowing that the US will protect them when the money they send to enemies is used to shoot them. Conversely, if the US is consistently on the verge of just letting Europe go alone, they have to ask themselves hard questions. Are the Americans really worse than the Russians or Chinese? Should we cut funding to our military when the Ukraine conflict ends or should we maintain it knowing that the last time we cut funding, Americans were angry? When the Americans warn us of a critical strategic flaw, should we maybe at least think about strengthening our economy's resilience instead of saying the era of war has ended and laughing? The left will also be forced to ask questions.Should we really be trying to attack the right wing's militaristic culture if that same militaristic culture keeps the Russians back and disincentives war? Should we stop speaking ill of our military industrial complex if it can help Ukraine? With countries like Russia, is it really so bad the US intervenes in foreign conflicts on a regular basis?Ukraine might bleed if we leave, but having Europe and the left learn a lesson that the era of war never ended is an investment for future conflicts, since it would keep the left and Europe from trying to dissolve the military or the US military industrial complex.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Or you could gut the welfare state &amp; adjust your economic policies and tax policies to a median non-growth non-decline population.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"We'll get whatever unqualified and corrupt fuckhead trump wants as AG.","title":"Biden calls on Americans not to forget Jan 6 attack"},{"text":"No shit Sherlock","title":"Liberals Warned Me About MAGAs Racism.

And Tesla makes up the biggest chunk of US EV cars on the road.[https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/percentage-of-electric-cars-in-us.html#num1](https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/percentage-of-electric-cars-in-us.html#num1)That's the bizarre aspect of all this. The Democratic party has actively empowered a Nazi-sympathizer who believes Jews are replacing whites with non-whites, who in turn was the biggest contributor to Trump's campaign in 2024. Meanwhile, the EV market that arguably the Democratic party created with its government subsidies, is unaffordable for most Americans.  This is the multicultural party of the working class?It's ridiculous to continue this approach when the Democrats are saying climate change is an existential threat.Now, if the democrats want to somehow put low-cost American-made EVs on the road, that'd be awesome. But for whatever reason, this isn't happening. My guess is that Americans are stupidly unwilling to buy EVs unless they have a \\"cool\\" and \\"powerful\\" status symbol effect attached to them, which keeps the prices high.So it really looks like the Democrats have fucked this up majorly. The only companies willing to make EV ownership a mass market thing are Chinese. All the American companies only make and sell \\"cool, expensive toy\\" EVs for white males. And thus the whole purpose of the Democrats' EV credit, to fight climate change, has been repurposed towards luxury status symbol nonsense.","title":"CMV: Democrats should repeal Biden's 100% tariff on Chinese EVs to help fight climate change"},{"text":"LETS GOOOOOOO I knew you had it in youwhat's your NFL team now?

We're talking fighting with sticks versus fighting with swords.","title":"Biden says it is awful that Trump is seeking to do away with US birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Republicans have been desperately trying to whitewash January 6th while claiming that the subsequent investigation was \\"politicized.\\"What Republicans won't mention is that they voted *against* a bipartisan commission to investigate the events of January 6th, and have since continued to make baseless claims accusing the Jan 6th inquiry of being some deep state, fraudulent \\"witch hunt\\" against Trump. Some Republicans, including GOP leaders themselves, have threatened to abuse their power to investigate and jail those involved. And for all of their crying about the \\"weaponization of the justice system.\\"We all know this is yet another retaliation from the MAGA crowd that's trying desperately to discredit and demonize Trump's opponents while attempting to absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. Once again showing us that their obedience to Donald Trump puts party over country.They have, time and time again, showcased their allegiance to the Trump brand and image, and so much so, that they not only fail to hold him responsible for his crimes and misconduct, but also try frantically to make him out to be the victim of all circumstances.Here's the simple fact, if you take Trump out of the equation, January 6th never happens, it really is that simple.For months leading up to the election, and since thereafter, Trump has promoted election denying propaganda, lies, misinformation and conspiracy theories. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, his lies, his denial, his fruitless legal battles, his violence inciting language, and his invitation to his supporters helped facilitate the events of January 6th. He is predominantly responsible for what transpired on that fateful day.And this is just one aspect of the January 6th investigation's findings.The investigation showed that many Trump supporters did indeed bring weapons with them to the Capitol. However, the magnetometers in place prevented hundreds from bringing those weapons with them into the grounds and rally area.Testimony revealed that Donald Trump knew about these weapons. Trump reportedly claimed that his supporters weren't \\"here to hurt him,\\" and that they should \\"take the fucking mags away,\\" he continued, \\"let my people in, they can march to the capital from here. Let the people in, take the fucking mags away.\\"The investigation also revealed Trump's inaction as events were unfolding. It was reported that for 187 minutes, Trump refused to take any public action to stop the violence.During this time, Trump was watching the events unfold on television from his private dining room next to the oval office. It was concluded that Trump could have stopped the violence but chose not to.Before I continue, let's address the right wing narrative that accuses Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for what happened.Loudermilk's recent report conveniently blames Nancy Pelosi for everything that transpired.Nevermind the fact that those truly responsible are the people who incited the violence, and facilitated the Capitol riot, as well as those that took action that day to clash with police and storm the Capitol.These claims that accuse Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for January 6th are not supported by the facts. Indeed, Pelosi did not have the authority to activate the National Guard, this power lies with the president, The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the army.In fact, records show that Pelosi approved a previous request for National Guard support, and continued pushing for their deployment when delays occurred.Yet still, the MAGA movement has continued to scapegoat Democrats and so called \\"radical leftist\\" groups, while whitewashing and downplaying the events of that day and promoting January 6th conspiracy theories.  Fox contributor Monica Crowley posted on social media last January, 3 years ago today, the System manufactured a riot at the Capitol to crush the powerful America First movement, frame President @realDonaldTrump and prevent him from winning again.Instead of holding Trump accountable, the recent report targets members of the January 6th investigation, Liz Cheney in particular: What caused the third-highest-ranking member of the House Republican Conference, a woman on track to be House Speaker or perhaps more, to turn against an honest and true man like Donald Trump and commit terrible crimes against MAGA? What exactly happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that exposed the security failures?These rhetorical questions serve only to direct blame away from Trump and reinforce far right conspiracy theories.The Wyoming GOP censured Cheney for her participation in the investigation and later made a statement promoting some of these false theories. In its February 2021 complaint against Cheney, the Wyoming state GOP noted that ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.Republicans also claim that Hutchinson was a tampered witness and her claims were unsubstantiated because she refused to take counsel from her MAGA-funded lawyer.Trump called Hutchinson a \\"total phony\\" and \\"leaker\\" because she spoke out against him. The entirety of their case against Hutchinson is based purely on Republicans simply not liking what she had to say.The January 6 investigation also revealed the following: - Donald Trump conspired to overturn the election, took actions to \\"defraud the United States\\" and disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans.  \\n- He also attempted to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, including Jeffrey Clark, who would support his unfounded claims of election fraud and try to use the power of the justice department to overturn the election results. Justice officials threatened to resign if Clark was given the position. \\n- Trump also pressured state officials to change the outcome of the election in their states.  \\n- Trump and his allies attempted a fake elector scheme designed to generate and submit slates of fake electors In several key states to replace the legitimate electors certified by those states.  \\n- He also pressured and intimidated Mike Pence to reject the certified electoral votes in Congress.  And at the risk of repeating myself, Trump and his defenders often focus on a couple of lines delivered by Trump on January 6th during his rally outside the Capitol. They claim that moments taken from this one speech absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. But this is disingenuous and absurd.Months leading up to the election, Donald Trump made excessive speeches, posted a slew of emotional tirades on social media, and repeated over and over again false claims about a stolen election. His rhetoric was incendiary, he spread countless lies and droves of misinformation, he promoted propaganda and conspiracy theories, and invited his supporters to the Capitol. All of these actions and more incited his supporters to violence, mobilized organized extremist groups, and set the stage for January 6th. To think otherwise is beyond ignorant.And to have the audacity to place blame at the feet of anyone else, can only be contributed to fanatical behavior and extreme narrow-mindedness.","title":"Biden calls on Americans not to forget Jan 6 attack"},{"text":"Define evil.

Ukraine was not aggressive, that was Russia. Russia has made a habit of inserting itself into, not just Ukraine, though that is obviously the dominating example, but the entire world, in some form or another, maliciously - from political intervention to outright sabotage. As a result of what amounts to a proxy war, it is the entitlement of the affected parties to, at the very least, intervene in some manner. Unfounded aggression needs to be met with equilateral response.Per the attitude of many Americans who claim to be patriots, we are - supposedly - \\"the greatest country in the world.\\" Think about your neighbors. Would you ever say that your neighbor who never comes outside, keeps to themselves, and doesn't do anything to hurt nor help is the greatest neighbor on the block? No. You wouldn't talk about them at all. And so as antagonistic an idea as American exceptionalism is to most rational people, the very people clamoring it are, themselves, the ones opposing Ukrainian aid. But why? Isn't the most American thing we can possibly do, being the best neighbor in the block? Helping and doing whatever we can to preserve the freedom and sovereignty of another nation against what is, to anyone paying attention, a common enemy, albeit one who has attacked both nations in vastly different ways?You can't have it both ways. People don't want us to be \\"world police\\" but in a world where we, by both our own hands as well as the cooperation of the world, have put ourselves in a position of serious world power, it's not only our responsibility but our prerogative. Our money, our seats of power, the position our ancestors have set us up with have given us, perhaps, undue influence over world affairs, but we, yet, have that influence. We not only should be helping to stabilize the world, but it should be treated as if it is our job to do so, and not because we are better or worse at it than anyone else, but because we have set ourselves up to do so. Our military and funding were set up to do this very thing, reasons notwithstanding. We have the numbers. We have the reach. We have things that most of the world simply does not. The only point of contention is what wars we \\"enter,\\" and why we enter them. Imperialism is not okay. Defense, particularly of another nation, is.There is no more important conflict on this planet right now, than the one being fought in Ukraine and Russia. That isn't to say that the other conflicts are not, themselves, important, particularly for those involved - but because of the nature and the parties, none stand to shape the world more, and faster, than the ones involving the largest countries, both in size and influence, period. And because of this importance, I say funnel Ukraine anything they need.If Russia is simply allowed to walk over them, at any point, it sets a stage that the world is not ready to face, particularly with the unbelievable rise of far-right powers in a significant portion of it.It is a very fundamental problem, yet one that is very fundamentally simple to answer, and almost shouldn't require a discussion.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Didnt have to because my point is that life can be awful in many ways even now.

In the long run, this means the local market will shrink so if anything happens to restrict or cut off access to the foreign supplier, you wont be able to get them anymore which given how car dependent most countries are, would not be a good situation.?Right now, many countries are not happy with the Chinese government but it can be really hard to do something about it if they can cut you off from critical goods.?","title":"CMV: Democrats should repeal Biden's 100% tariff on Chinese EVs to help fight climate change"},{"text":"Pump some of those resources into the country before the DOGE steals it all.

India welcomes all refugees from its neighboring countries so long as they as not Muslim. The Bhagavad Gita is more nuanced than that. I suggest you read a translation and digest it as a whole instead of focusing one sentence.What he actually says to the Prince is to follow his duty or Dharma as a warrior and fight for the good. His cousins and kinsmen on the other side represents evil. There is also a bit where the soul is immortal even if the body dies and those who are dead are simply on a new adventure now. There is also a bit about how the end justifies the means which I find hard to digest. While the Bhagavad Gita can be interpreted differently, any interpretation that allows for prejudice and bigotry is not the right one. We also have to remember India was ruled and exploited by the British leaving people with very few resources. This, in my opinion, has led to a kind of selfishness where people put themselves and their families before anything else. I think this is a response of a survivor. There are a lot of Indian immigrants who would like to close the door behind them. This isnt unique to Indians. Remember the Cubans in Florida.","title":"Liberals Warned Me About MAGAs Racism.

By giving Russia the opportunity to fight against NATO weapons at a pace that they are able to dictate, what is actually happening on the ground is that the US is creating a far more capable adversary. Their electronic and drone warfare has come along in leaps and bounds as well as their tactics against NATO doctrine. New weapons like the Oreshnik (I've seen people argue that the tech isn't really new, but the design is) represent Russia's ability to innovate and escalate and through so called military Keynesianism and their deepening relationships with China and India they have been able to weather the intense sanctions imposed on them by the West without too much difficulty. I don't think the average Russian is hurting very much... Ukraine is losing land at an increasing rate, and more importantly, they are losing more and more men. I don't believe any of the casualty numbers, I don't see how anyone can at this point given the propaganda value for both sides to claim low casualties sustained and high casualties inflicted, but they must acknowledge Russia had a massive manpower advantage from the start. The US has been pressuring Ukraine to start to draft 18-24 year olds, and I think that is probably a good indication that they are starting to really hurt there.Russia had the strategic advantage from the start, with the West only ever willing to go so far. European dependence on Russian energy has left them crippled economically and beset by considerable domestic political instability which is only growing, and the US faces similar problems at home.

Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary all have histories of Russian imperialist subjugation and joined in 1999. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia joined in 2004, shortly after Russia leveled Grozny in the Second Chechen War. Albania and Croatia joined in 2009 after the Russo-Georgian War. Montenegro joined in 2017 and North Macedonia joined in 2020, after the Russian annexation of Crimea and Russian-backed war in Donbas (no, rebels dont spontaneously acquire tons of Russian heavy military equipment without Russian involvement). And most notably, Finland and Sweden joined in direct response to the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Its worth noting that Putins worldview has not been static in the 25 years he has ruled Russia and that it is likely he has been radicalised during his rule (looking at you, Nikolai Patrushev), however he has already engaged in two wars of conquest against internationally recognised nations prior to Ukraine (the Russo-Georgian War and the 2014-2022 phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War). I would also like to add that Ukraine was a constitutionally neutral state prior to the Russian annexation of Crimea.To address a related point, NATO expansion to the Russian border poses zero risk to Russias territorial integrity. Arguments citing Napoleon and Hitler as evidence that NATO is preparing to invade Russia ignore the fact that mutually assured destruction has rendered any comparable invasion of Russia suicidal ever since the Soviet Union acquired nuclear weapons. The only way NATO expansion threatens Putin is if you believe in a Mearsheimer-type concept that Russia has a right to a sphere of influence, which is barely disguised imperialism.2. Valid point, but I will note that the US has used Ukraine as an expendable tool to weaken Russia rather than committing to a Ukrainian victory. Instead they drip-fed Ukraine aid and enabled the Russian military to get its shit together and start slowly advancing.3. Russia denied any intention of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine until a few days before they did it. Russia was under no threat whatsoever if it did not invade Ukraine, and its economy would be in far better shape if it had not invaded. Russia could have just not invaded Ukraine in 2022. Russia, as the aggressor, could theoretically end the war tomorrow if it withdrew from Ukraine immediately. And if Putin had no intention of seizing Ukrainian territory, he wouldnt have seized Ukrainian territory in the process of preventing them from joining NATO.4. The Putin regime hasnt been very subtle about its genocidal intentions and has already committed numerous indiscriminate massacres of Ukrainians.Russia violated all three treaties it has signed with Ukraine since 1991. The Putin regime is NOT willing to negotiate in good faith, and mark my words, Putin will violate any ceasefire that ends the current Russo-Ukrainian War within a few years.I am half-Russian and have family in Russia, I have read the first-hand Russian justifications for the war and I can confirm they are imperialist horseshit.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Not according to the COVID Select Subcommittee.

Also, due to those governors shuttering the economies of their states with no price gouging EOs in place it allowed rampant inflation during the recovery, which created record profits for companies making the economy look stronger than it actually was. Biden's economy was built in the backs of struggling Americans who have been told things are great.

For the security of the public at large, though, it's important to have guaranteed-outs like pensions and Social Security, along with a more comprehensive social safety net, to reduce (or ideally eliminate) poverty among the elderly due to inability to work.","title":"Biden signs bill to increase Social Security benefits for millions of public workers"},{"text":"Right-wing media has won the media war, convincingly, any raise in prices will be blamed on the democrats, and, seeing as dems have no answer to republicans controlling the narrative, the electorate will believe in it.Right-wing media couldn't save Trump from the COVID-19 pandemic.","title":"Virginia special elections are early test of Democratic enthusiasm after Trump victory"},{"text":"Nixon, for as shit of a person as he was, was also very learned in foreign policy. \\nStill a total racist, but he also knew a lot about how foreign governments operated and how the US sphere of influence reverberated globally.","title":"New bill in NY Senate, \\"New York state antisemitism vandalism Act,\\" would create a special Class A misdemeanor for the crime of vandalizing \\"pro-Israel print.\\""},{"text":"He did, he didn't become a teacher until he was in his 30s. and had multiple periods of having a 2nd job","title":"Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people from bill that Biden signed"},{"text":"Sadly the average American voter has voted to destroy the department of education, to dramatically raise cost of living, and just generally choose wrong in every possible aspect of leadership","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Only took 45 years.","title":"Biden signs bill to increase Social Security benefits for millions of public workers"},{"text":"Remember back when they were called \\"freedom fries\\" instead of French Fries.

Recent polls indicate a stark decline in his popularity, with the Liberals trailing far behind the Conservatives in voter support. Posts on X and multiple web sources suggest that members of his own caucus have been calling for his resignation, especially after several high-profile Cabinet resignations, including that of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland over policy disagreements.[](https://www.csis.org/analysis/after-surprise-resignation-what-comes-next-canada)[](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-pm-trudeau-announce-resignation-early-monday-globe-mail-reports-2025-01-06/)[](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-trudeau-faces-increasing-pressure-his-own-mps-quit-2024-12-23/)[](https://x.com/EricLDaugh/status/1868728845798719660)- **Policy Disagreements and Leadership Style**: The disagreement with Freeland over how to handle potential U.S. tariffs under a new Trump administration was a significant catalyst. This situation highlighted discord within the government on critical economic policy, suggesting a broader dissatisfaction with Trudeau's leadership style and decision-making process.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-finance-minister-resigns-2024-12-16/)- **Electoral Timing**: With an election scheduled to occur by late October 2025, Trudeau's possible resignation might be seen as a strategic move to allow the Liberal Party to select a new leader who could potentially fare better against the Conservatives. The timing could be aimed at refreshing the party's image before the election.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/what-options-does-pm-trudeau-face-canadas-leadership-crisis-2024-12-17/)- **Scandal and Public Sentiment**: While no new major scandal directly linked to Trudeau's resignation has been explicitly mentioned in the sources, the cumulative effect of various controversies, including his handling of economic issues like inflation and housing, have contributed to his declining public support. The government's response to international relations, particularly with the U.S., has also been scrutinized, contributing to the perception of ineffective leadership.[](https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-resign-freeland-trump-f346160f062846bbbaac73dbdd597941)- **Term Length**: Trudeau has been in office since November 2015, nearing the end of what would be his third term if re-elected in 2025. His current term was supposed to continue until the next scheduled election, but the political landscape has shifted, prompting this potential early exit.**Bigger Picture:**- **Political Strategy**: Trudeau's resignation could be a tactical withdrawal to reshape the Liberal Party's strategy for the upcoming election. By stepping down, he allows for a leadership contest that might rejuvenate the party's appeal to voters who are currently dissatisfied.- **Impact on Canadian Politics**: This move could significantly alter the dynamics of Canadian politics. A new leader might shift policy directions or at least present a fresh face to the electorate. However, it also risks further destabilizing the party if the transition is not smooth or if the new leader does not resonate with voters.- **International Relations**: With Donald Trump's impending presidency and his history of challenging Canadian policies, a change in leadership in Canada could either stabilize or further complicate bilateral relations, depending on the new leader's approach to U.S. relations.In summary, Trudeau's potential resignation seems driven by a mix of internal party pressure, public disillusionment, strategic political maneuvering, and an attempt to mitigate the impact of upcoming elections. While he's not resigning due to a single scandal, the cumulative effect of various criticisms and policy missteps has led to this juncture.","title":"Reuters reporting Prime Minister Trudeau to announce resignation as early as Monday."},{"text":"Any time.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 5, 2025"},{"text":"And Republicans are shown to once again defy the constitution and look bad skirting the law for their orange leader.","title":"Donald Trump critics push plan to block him from taking power in DC protest (it only takes 40% of Congressional Dems to sign onto this!)"},{"text":"I would love to see a rabbi jailed for antisemitism.

Productive work, self-esteem, friendship, love, beauty. Freedom is good because its necessary for you act for your life, the right to life. Whats better for your life involves respecting that the good for other people is to pursue whats factually necessary for their lives. And it also involves respecting their freedom as well. Whats evil is whats against your life, whether thats stealing, murdering, enslaving, raping etc. But also sacrificing yourself for others, turning the other cheek. Sacrificing yourself for others doesnt include risking your life to save someone valuable to your life like your wife. Or risking your life to defend your way of life in a war of self-defense.  how easy it is for someone to take power and remove peoples civil liberties by making them afraid of some invisible enemy. Yeah, as long as the people dont support whats good. Or, they are persuaded they are victims and then can use their status as victims to pursue what they mistakenly believe is in their self-interest the name of altruism. And they might actually be victims, just that theyve identified the wrong enemies. the only people who win are the ones who prioritize power for themselves above all else.That only happens when people are confused about good and evil. What happens is the people who want the power to violate the freedom of others can only justify being given it in the name of taking away the freedom of the evil people. Or, if there is a mistaken idealist who believes that them getting the power to violate freedom is good (regardless of whether they believe that power violates the freedom of others), then once the government gets that power that attracts the thugs, the power lusters like Putin. And the thugs will win out over the mistaken idealists all the time.  The only times that people advocating for freedom and democratic values have ever won has been through bloodshed and brutality (see: the French Revolution, the American Civil War). The only way to achieve good ends seems to be through evil means. Killing people in a war of self-defense is good, not evil. Its completely mistaken to call that evil, as if killing in self-defense and murder were both evil.And, what about womans suffrage or womans right to vote? What about the Civl Rights Movement? What about gay marriage? There are examples of wins for freedom without killing.","title":"cmv: Evil (cruelty, selfishness, tyranny) is more powerful than good (compassion, altruism, freedom)"},{"text":"Dude enough with that.

Look at the Soviet Union - it seemed invincible until it wasn't. Meanwhile, movements built on genuine human connection and shared values persist even under oppression. The more that tyrants crack down, the more people resist.I see incredible momentum in progressive organizing today - mutual aid networks, community defense groups, labor unions having their biggest growth in decades. That's real power being built from the ground up, based on compassion and solidarity rather than domination.The people who seem powerful today are terrified of losing control.

That's the question you're asking.The global order, established post WWII, has been fantastically beneficial for the US. Allowing authoritarian regimes to destabilize that would risk our prosperity. Concretely this means free trade, shipping routes etc. It means iPhones and TVs and food and general material and non-material wealth that Americans enjoy.Russia is one of biggest adversaries on the world stage, and one of the biggest threats to American prosperity. The reason we spend untold billions on F35s and other military programs is because of Russia (and China). If we can send military equipment, and largely equipment we would have to write off and mothball or destroy anyway, to Ukraine and *directly* reduce Russia's ability to harm us, then that's far more efficient use of money than anything else we do with military spending. So if you want to argue that we should drop a few billions from tanks or figther jets or whatever in order to afford the aid we can send to Ukraine, fine, that's a reasonble argument. But in terms of value for money, sending aid to Ukraine basically a black Friday sale in terms of military spending. Nothing else we could spend money on gets us as much for the dollar.If the outcome of this is that Russia loses its ability or will to threaten the liberal world order for a few decades, then that's one of our two main adversaries taken off the board pennies on the dollar. Tens of billions on terms of real value, maybe a hundred long term. Compared to two trillion dollar spent on the F35 program which hasn't achieved anything remotely like that.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Treason doth never prosper; what's the reason? \\nFor if it prosper, none dare call it treason.\\n- John Harington","title":"Reminders of Jan. 6 attack fade in the Capitol as Trump retakes power | Democrat (who led the House Admin Cmte when a law was passed to install a plaque to honor officers who defended the Capitol) wrote to GOP Speaker Johnson in May to ask why the plaque hadn't been installed, but \\"never heard back\\""},{"text":" They are way behind on cost of living increases, something had to be done.

Firstly, opinions on economic policy are always deeply colored by the party in power. With that in mind, more people favored the TCJA in 2018 compared to people who opposed as per [this Pew Survey.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/01/24/public-has-mixed-expectations-for-new-tax-law/)Secondly, [currently 90% of Americans oppose repealing the TCJA](https://americansforprosperity.org/press-release/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-support-renewing-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/). Compare that to the [public that actually supports student loan forgiveness](https://apnorc.org/projects/views-toward-student-loan-relief-are-tied-to-partisanship-and-experience-with-debt/) and you'll be blown out of the water. Here's another interesting finding from the same source:Experience with student debt relates to attitudes toward forgiveness. Those who are currently paying student loans (54%) are more likely than respondents who have paid off loans (31%)People who are literally paying student loans only favor forgiveness by a *slim majority*. This is not the hill to die on, Bidenista. You think if inflation was 5-6% in 2022 vs. 8% No, I'm claiming that Dems could've done a lot better if inflation was back down to 2-3% in mid-2023 instead of late-2024. ARP and BBB were incorrect fiscal policies for the time. Also, what kind of reasoning is this? They havent managed to build anything thus far means that they never will?Spare me the BS lol. JCPOA has several sunset clauses that would be null after 10-years, i.e. the coming July. So, in effect, the JCPOA objectives are met without the deal in place. Speaking of Israel, you do know that they [have always opposed the deal](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/23/israelis-u-s-iran-nuclear-deal-00053363) right?

You made up a weak argument and applied it to me and then defeated it on your own, even if they are arguments you believe to be most commonly held. There are dozens of statements I made that could require further clarification/expansion of my opinion in that post. You just picked one. Trump should have been easy. 0) we beat him once already.1) the vast majority of the nation has no idea about all the actions Trump took to change the results of the election. Things like the false electors scheme, Trump pressuring his AGs to lie to states that they had found  significant fraud when they had not, and Trump pressuring state investigators themselves. This would have shifted votes.2) people barely know about the Dominion lawsuits against Fox where Fox brought on people to lie over and over to the public unchallenged with multiple stories that even the hosts knew were lies. Taking any steam out of the Fox machine pushing for Trump would have had an impact. 3) the Democratic leadership taking no clear stance on Israel/Palestine and just giving empty wishy-washy statements just pissed off everyone, and losing all sides of the conflict. This would have had at the least a positive impact by having any clarity of a plan here.4) dragging their feet on some of the most important issues. Whether it was Biden dropping out last minute or garland intentionally waiting to being an investigation into Trump. Trump should have been in a court room just like Clinton. This would have had an impact. 5) for the entirety of Bidens presidency the democrats couldn't/didn't celebrate wins. This is a failure of the entire party. And instead the party was lifting up leftist voices who in the end were Anti-democrat. 6) when Kamala finally came into fight, she still wouldn't give a clear stance on issues like Transgender issues so Republicans pulled out a singular out of context statement from years ago and just ran with that. 7) Trump needed to be bullied. He can't handle the push back. Calling his crowds small, made him lash out. Democrats needed to keep on the attack. 8) Trump had NO real agenda other than tarrifs and  He just made things up as he went. His whole campaign was vibes. What's he going to do \\"make everything the best thing ever\\" 9) the final debate between Trump and Biden was tactically a huge mistake. Biden trying to list off dozens of facts and numbers was not compelling and in his state, added significantly to his terrible performance. But if you read the transcript of the debate, Trump sounds like the incoherent rambler. The strategy was all wrong.In all we didn't attack - never held Trump to account, even in the public square. We didn't attack him like we needed to. We didn't support ourselves -We didn't reward ourselves for our wins so it looked like we did nothing. We dragged our feet on key issues and we waited way to long for to decide Biden to drop out or stay in.","title":"CMV: For those of you who are Democrats that voted for Harris, yet are blaming the Dems to why Trump won, you're basically saying that the Democrats are the ones responsible for the end of our democracy."},{"text":"This only effects about 1% of SS recipients.

The AG can start with the both of them.Edit: this article explains the legal process:https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5055171-constitution-insurrection-trump-disqualification/amp/Disqualification is based on insurrection against the Constitution and not the government. The evidence of Donald Trumps engaging in such insurrection is overwhelming. The matter has been decided in three separate forums, two of which were fully contested with the active participation of Trumps counsel.  The first fully contested proceeding was Trumps second impeachment trial. On Jan. 13, 2021, then-President Trump was impeached for incitement of insurrection. At the trial in the Senate, seven Republicans joined all Democrats to provide a majority for conviction but failed to reach the two-thirds vote required for removal from office. Inciting insurrection encompasses engaging in insurrection against the Constitution or giving aid and comfort to the enemies thereof, the grounds for disqualification specified in Section 3.  The second contested proceeding was the Colorado five-day judicial due process hearing where the court found by clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used in Section Three. The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed. On further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the court held that states lack power to disqualify candidates for federal office and that federal legislation was required to enforce Section 3. The court did not address the finding that Trump had engaged in insurrection. Finally, there is the bipartisan inquiry of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. More than half of the witnesses whose testimony was displayed at its nine public hearings were Republicans, including members of the Trump administration. The inescapable conclusion of this evidence is that Trump engaged in insurrection against the Constitution. In particular, Trump unlawfully demanded that his vice president, Mike Pence, throw out votes in the Electoral College for political opponent Joe Biden, a power he did not have. While the riot was in progress, Trump used Pences rejection of his demand to further enflame the crowd and cause them to chant Hang Mike Pence! Some will argue that the Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case, Trump v. Anderson, precludes Congress from rejecting electoral votes when they convene on Jan. 6, on the basis of 14th Amendment disqualification. This view lacks merit for three reasons. First the majoritys suggestion that there must be new implementing federal legislation passed pursuant to the enforcement power specified in the 14th Amendment is what lawyers call dicta. Dicta are the musings of an opinion that are not required to decide the case. The holding that Section 3 is not self-executing may be an alternate holding, but thoughts about the kind of implementing statute required are plain dicta. Dicta are not precedential. The four dissenters strenuously objected to this part of the opinion as overreach to decide a question not presented. This overreach is a power grab which Congress is not required to credit. Second, counting the Electoral College votes is a matter uniquely assigned to Congress by the Constitution. Under well-settled law this fact deprives the Supreme Court of a voice in the matter, because the rejection of the vote on constitutionally specified grounds is a nonreviewable political question.  Third, specific legislation designed for this situation already exists. The Electoral Count Act was first enacted in 1887 and later amended and restated in 2022. That statute provides a detailed mechanism for resolving disputes as to the validity of Electoral College votes.   The act specifies two grounds for objection to an electoral vote: If the electors from a state were not lawfully certified or if the vote of one or more electors was not regularly given. A vote for a candidate disqualified by the Constitution is plainly in accordance with the normal use of words not regularly given. Disqualification for engaging in insurrection is no different from disqualification based on other constitutional requirements such as age, citizenship from birth and 14 years residency in the United States.  To make an objection under the Count Act requires a petition signed by 20 percent of the members of each House. If the objection is sustained by majority vote in each house, the vote is not counted and the number of votes required to be elected is reduced by the number of disqualified votes. If all votes for Trump were not counted, Kamala Harris would be elected president.","title":"Biden says it is awful that Trump is seeking to do away with US birthright citizenship"},{"text":"For all mankind's sake, I pray his life is a short one.

The way it worked is he would normally get a Social Security check for say $1200. But because he is getting a pension from the city, Social Security cuts his checks to around $700.

It does nothing but make the claim of nato expansion east but doesnt acknowledge this is caused by russian aggression and occupation. The premise is based on realism which might as well be called neo colonialism as it claims that there are \\"spheres of influence\\" where superpowers have the right to dictate what happens to smaller countries within these spheres. It completely disregards the democratic will of a nation or people. Whether in georgia, ukraine, moldova or belarus russia has no moral reasoning to engage in war because those countries or people seek protection within nato from their historical occupier or closer economic ties with the west through the EU. The ukraine war has seen two new members join nato because the ultimate driving force of countries democratically seeking to join nato is russian agression. It is the reason for all of these countries joining from the eastern block. The claim of the 2022 invasion being to stop joining nato is dishonest. Ukraine was never going to be a nato member because of its territorial dispute post 2014. It was not on the table. Russia even had its own agreement with ukraine on the table to not join nato as reported by reuters. This deal was ignored by putin who favored invasion because this is ultimately a war to regain previous russian/soviet land as well as valuable resources. Hes made it very clear he wants to depose the ukrainian government and occupy the country in order to \\"denazify\\" whoch is laughable considering zelensky's jewish. Russia also has its own military industrial complex that behaves on the same way as it does in the west. Russias strategy for preventing NATO expansion pre 2022 in moldova, georgia and ukraine has been some annexation of land to prevent those \\nCountries from joining NATO as you cannot join when having territorial disputes. You cannot claim that the invasion was to prevent NATO expansion because it had already been prevented. \\n You also forgot to mention in that deal was for nato to pull out of nato countries which they could and would never do as it is a massive security risk and defeats the principle of nato. Thats a few things wrong with your typical alt right pro putin conspiracy narrative. There will never be peace ukraine until whatever part of it is unoccupied joins nato.

I do not believe the drafters intended to create a worldwide dragnet clause.While some other nations have birthright citizenship, or a highly restricted version, many more nations do not have birthright citizenship.In any event, regardless of your position on this issue, I think it would require a subsequent Constitutional amendment to change in a significant way birthright citizenship in the United States, for obvious reasons.

On Ukraine in NATO, you talk as if Ukrainian ascension to NATO was imminent, this was not the case. Ukrainian society itself was deeply split on NATO membership pre-2014, and both before and after 2014 there was next to no appetite in the west to add Ukraine to NATO. Russia created this hostility on their own because Putin is a Russian nationalist. He has wrote essays and given several speeches on his view of the illegitimacy of Ukrainian statehood. After Crimea, do you think there was any chance of Ukrainian accession to NATO ever, as long as they had disputed territory? He had won, Ukraine would be outside of NATO forever, but he had always wanted a bigger piece of the pie. The whole pie in fact. Because he is a rabid nationalist and revanchist. Also inherent in this line of argument is the assumption that NATO would ever launch an offensive, conventional attack into Russia, which sounds insane just typing it. Despite decades of very favourable treatment in business and diplomacy, Europe DESPERATE for partnership with Russia, Russia has acted with unthinkable hostility again and again. Theyve given the west every excuse, but this drip feed of old equipment to barely keep Ukraines frontline stable is apparently the grand culmination of the Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to topple Russia once and for all. Putin is obviously aware NATO is a defensive alliance. The people who spent decades sucking his gas up in exchange for billions were planning to attack him eventually? Give me a break. He opposes NATO expansion because his goal is to restore old Russian borders and spheres of influence. Thats why so much of Eastern Europe spent the 90s and 00s desperately seeking NATO membership as fast as they could.

A dozen replied to say they had had not contact with Carney and the rest had yet to reply as of early Sunday evening.The MP who did speak to Carney, though, said several others had received calls from Carney and the MP said some were supportive of his leadership aspirations, while some were still on the fence.Oliphant, reached on Sunday, said he has not spoken to Carney but his caution  that politics is a serious business for seasoned professionals  remains, for him, a valid one.Being a politician takes some very specific skills, Oliphant said on Sunday.This would apply to anyone, including Mark Carney, with whom I have not spoken but for whom I have great respect.Oliphant, who has publicly called for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to step down, did not identify a preferred successor but among those Liberals who did voice a preference, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Fran?ois-Philippe Champagne were frequently mentioned, as was former BC premier Christy Clark.Most Liberal MPs contacted by Global News provided their thoughts on the prospect of a Carney candidacy on condition they not be identified: each for different reasons, but many out of respect for Carneys attempt to see if politics can, indeed, be his next career.All of those MPs spoke admiringly of Carneys accomplishments and of his business savvy and experience.However, many were skeptical that he could be a successful enough retail politician to turn around Liberal fortunes.Im not yet convinced on Mark Carney, said one MP who, like many others, believes the party would be best served by a new leader with broad experience in the business sector and who has political experience and who would also move the Liberals to the centre of the political spectrum.Almost all of the MPs Global News spoke to believe Trudeau has moved the party too far to the left and that shift has played a key role in the decline of the Liberals.","title":"Mark Carney makes his leadership pitch to a skeptical Liberal caucus - National | Globalnews.ca"},{"text":"Much like his tax package from 2016-2020.

It makes a weak attempt to depict this Final Solution for Gazans as something other than what it is by pretending there will be humanitarian evacuation.

By using that exact argument, the US would also be justified in invading Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil and Venezuela. Besides, no one is forcing these countries to join NATO.

I mean, I guess the US has an interest in keeping the war going but I'd say that the much larger benefit would be a decisive Russian military defeat. On top of that, the more prevalent interest of the US so far has been to balance escalation with support for Ukraine, which is basically the reason why the US and other NATO allies were always so reluctant to enlarge their support to more and other weapon systems like MBTs, ATACMS and other long-range missiles or planes. 3. RUSSIA FUCKING INVADED. They could have just not invaded Ukraine is they didn't want the war. Are you fucking insane? There was zero chance in hell Ukraine would have gotten Crimea or the LPR+DPR back if Russia didn't invade. Instead, Russia chose to start an illegal invasion to subjugate Ukraine at first and secure their land bridge to Crimea later. Like, even if Ukraine did join NATO (which, imo, was unlikely before the invasion due to their entanglements in Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea), it would not justify an invasion (see point 1.)4.

Putin has not exactly been shy that he's believed Ukraine is part of Russia culturally and he's been slow-burning a conquest of the Donbas since 2013. If he didn't want this, why did he militarily annex Crimea a decade ago?NATO expanded the instant he invaded. Sweden and Finland broke decades of neutrality to join, completely encasing his Baltic ports in hostile NATO nations and adding two militaries with track records of beating Russians in a land war *in winter*. Big players like France are firing up factories. He gambled that this would scare NATO and it invigorated it.I wouldn't characterize Ukraine as losing. A massive army is hammering down on them for extremely marginal gains *and some losses,* primarily having added some scraps beyond provinces in the Donbas already *de facto* conquered. They've pushed Russia to the desperation of finding high tech allies in...North Korea. Things like finding sawdust rations, dead bodies with AKs from the 1950s, airsoft kit \\"body armor\\" and golf carts as APVs have made sure that Russia is not going to be looked at as a formidable army for decades to come. Their *whole deal* is that: Big parades and lots of boasting so no one checks if they can back it up. Now they've admitted they cant. Russia is getting screwed selling on less-than-at-cost oil to China because they need shells that badly. And this is what Ukraine has done with slow, limited support.And they're *much* more likely to recover economically afterwards than Russia which is going to be sanctioned to hell and back until our grandkids are old.I think a fairly likely outcome is a negotiated peace with borders similiar to the current battle lines, easing of sanctions in exchange for reparations to rebuild, and Ukraine not able to join NATO for X years, which they promptly do at X+1.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Spot on!","title":"Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people from bill that Biden is signing"},{"text":"Thats cost of living adjustment.","title":"Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people from bill that Biden is signing"},{"text":"Brother, pretending the Biden's brain isn't soup is gaslighting everyone who saw the debate.

I think it also makes the potential arguments of morally bad secessionists into essential truth: we cant live with x ethnic group, so let us secede because we would be happy to not be with these people. Even if the people leaving are great, amazing people with an amazingly fantastic reason, what country that suddenly halved is going to be doing great? Or even necessarily be functional? Do countries everywhere suddenly start splitting into smaller and smaller units, less and less able to fend off exploitation, or more likely to be swayed by strongmen and conquest? I dont see countries splitting or anything as a battered housewife because *countries are not people*. Their functions are complex, their policy is numerous, etc. Its just not that simple. I guess thats what I hate so much about the populist ideology thats emerging that paints the world as really simple moral points (elites steal from you, people should breakaway from their country, etc) because the world doesnt work that way.

Weimar Germany is a good example of this, where the leaders just got worse and worse until they got the worst leader in history.South Korea had a dictatorship for decades, so did Taiwan and both did very well. South Korea has fared rather badly under democracy with the chaebols having a stranglehold, a 0.72 fertility rate, 27.3 suicides per 100,000.

Google 'species problem'.That also assumes the species can sexually reproduce, which isn't the case with most organisms. What about two bacteria that are almost genetically identical, but not quite? [Here's a paper from a microbiologist arguing that the concept of species is pretty invalid](https://wpsites.ucalgary.ca/marc-ereshefsky/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2019/11/Microbiology-and-Species.pdf)But even if you ignore organisms that can't sexually reproduce (and don't have much horizontal gene transfer) you still run into problems.You can get the vague outlines based on evolutionary/cladistic lineage, as in two organisms are clearly different species if they don't share a recent enough common ancestor - I am very clearly a member of a different species from a cat, for example. But that isn't very helpful for stuff in the same genus, and also poses the question of what 'recent enough' means.The boundaries around what constitutes a species is often quite fuzzy and can be somewhat arbitrary. In practice it's based on a significant enough level of genetic differences and often some level of reproductive isolation, because there are things generally recognized as different species can produce fertile hybrids. The one I'm most familiar with is pit vipers in the United States (there are a lot of rattlesnake and copperhead hybrids), but it's pretty common in general.There are also situations where there's gradual genetic variation over location so the organisms at each end of the range don't interbreed in the wild and are genetically distinct, but there's a genetic gradient in the middle where most or all organisms share traits of both. Or the existence of species complexes where there there are a lot of similar looking organisms that often can and do hybridize, but also have genetic differences. Or hybrid species, organisms that are quite clearly a distinct species genetically, but seem to have originally came into existence as hybrids of two different (sometimes still-existing) species and were reproductively isolated from them after hybridization somehow.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yes this has always been the case.

The intrinsic value is zero, it can essentially be copied indefinitely (just fork the chain and make a variant from a new starting point) and most are useless as currencies as they are so hard to trade and fluctuate too much in value. The only value is that which the users attribute to it.Because it is obviously a stupid idea to invest in something like that, most smart people won't, which means you have a huge advantage over that compared to other investments which have hordes of brilliant people writing algorithms to trade at a profit.

Anyone saying \\"democracy is no more\\" is has just lost it. It's completely the wrong mentality. Trump won the election because of numerous failures within the Democratic party, not just during the election, but for the better part of a decade. If you compare the last few years of republican messaging vs Democrat messaging only one party is Hyper focused and entirely aligned in supporting Trump. One party has been spreading their influence through online channels far better and that's the Republicans. If you look at non-traditional media, Republicans have rooted themselves deep. And in online spaces we have far more anti-democrat messaging pro leftist messaging that further harms the democrats. Next, Let's completely drop any idea of \\"victim blaming\\" in a failed race. Not only is it a completely inappropriate use of the term and its simply hiding from reasons of why we lost. The party and the voters aren't \\"victims\\". Third, defeating Trump should have been easy. It's the failure of the Democrats to rally behind Party leadership and instead give far too much of a voice to groups who were leftists but anti-democrat. Fourth, Biden (and the Democratic party) choosing Garland who didn't pursue Trump aggressive enough to being a case is insane and a massive failure. As for SCOTUS I believe the entire immunity decision is insane and they have their own blame. But that is a lesser issue than the election. Democrats need to stop the degree of in fighting they currently have and start building a more clear message to stand behind. Trump can only have 1 term left and as we've seen, Republicans have had a hard time replacing him with anyone else. The next 4-6 years are key. The democrats must find a way to get better messaging across and support each other rather than support voices that are destructive to the party. They have a chance to run against a non-trump candidate and that might be a crumbling point of the whole Maga nonsense.And if Democrats Do get control again, they need to not revert back to infighting. They need to hold control and focus on the incremental changes to improve our nation.","title":"CMV: For those of you who are Democrats that voted for Harris, yet are blaming the Dems to why Trump won, you're basically saying that the Democrats are the ones responsible for the end of our democracy."},{"text":"He said hes going to close down their DC building day one.

They, not the shareholders, are liable for corporate acts that cause harm. While the individual shareholders may act separately, they should not be able to use the corporate resources to influence politics. Political decisions should be made based on what is best for the people, not for some separate legal entity like a corporation. Oil companies and their pollution is an example where the interests of the people conflict with those of corporate oil. What is good for oil companies may not be good for the people. Similarly, cigarettes are generally bad for people, a fact that puts the interests of corporate cigarette companies in conflict with the interest of people. Cigarette companies should not be able to promote its interests using its vast resources  regardless of the effects on people.Again, corporations are not people, and politics should only be influenced by people.","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

Just by coincidence. But then Nashville and Chattanooga Dems might feel that their reps, even though they'd have representative as roughly 1 in 3 voters are Dems, aren't representing their regions which ultimately is what governance should be.So maybe there'd have to be some order in how the list is constructed, so that each party balances the locality, the ideology (not every NY Dem should be a upstate Blue Dog or a Queens-progressive), and the race/sex/background of the candidates. But ultimately that'd be decided by the party.And again, this is the Vote Dem sub but I truly believe that viable third parties (such as we saw in NE-Sen or UT-Sen in the past) are helping at breaking the GOP stranglehold on certain states. A proportional system like this could see 1 or 2 Indies elected in a place like Alaska or Kansas because they got 5% of the vote. And then that could eat into GOP margins, or at least make them hesitate if votes aren't all or nothing on the conservative candidate.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 5, 2025"},{"text":"Reformat of the events for better readability, I am not the OP, just doing a small public service.Country | Disarmed | Murdered | Dates of Murders\\n-|-:|-|-:\\nTurkey | 1911 | 1.5 million Armenians | 1915 C 1917\\nRussia | 1929 | 20 million Russians | 1929 C 1953 \\nChina | 1935 | 20 million Chinese | 1948 C 1952\\nGermany | 1938 | 16 million Jews | 1939 C 1945\\nCambodia | 1956 | 1 million Educated people | 1975 C 1977\\nGuatamala | 1964 | 100,000 Mayan Indians | 1964 C 1981\\nUganda | 1970 | 300,000 Christians | 1971 C 1979  \\n|| Total: | 58,900,000 |","title":"For the rather misguided dude that posted a silly argument against the Second Amendment."},{"text":"Gonna look sweet sitting next to those little soccer trophies.","title":"Watch: Election Denier, Two-Time Failed Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Receives Presidential Medal of Freedom"},{"text":"Ahh America where democracy dies.","title":"Harris called Trump a danger to democracy.

We paid for this war 25 years ago when we authorized the production of this equipment.The reason we need to keep giving aid to Ukraine is because Russia is a geopolitical adversary. Weve spent 60 billion dollars and in return have functionally crippled the Russian economy and set back their military industrial complex several decades at least. The amount of attrition theyve suffered in this war has de-toothed their entire fighting force for the foreseeable future.

Adam Schiff says the New Orleans attack shows Kash Patel shouldnt lead the FBI"},{"text":"The difficult thing about a \\"ban on gerrymandering\\" is that any system of apportionment based on districts/geometry can't be entirely fair. It's all subjective. Some maps are definitely fairer than others. Independent districting commissions help but in a world where they get adopted more, I could easily see their \\"independent members\\" going one way or another. So you say, make each party have a hand in the maps, but then what if that locks out other parties or ideological wings of parties.Some states used to do a proportional apportionment system by popular vote, where say a state votes 60%-40% for the Democrat \\"ticket\\" and then that state's 5 reps are split 3D-2R. I think that was made illegal at the federal level as a Civil Rights measure, since Jim Crow states were abusing At Large Reps in a state where their candidates would usually safely win the statewide sum.But in a system where we have a *lot* more reps per state, that could maybe work. So in a state like MD (population 6.2M, 8 Reps = 780k per Rep, 7D-1R for a [63%-35% popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Maryland), you'd go to 24 or 25 reps split 15D-8R or 15D-9R. Sucks for heavily Dem delegation states, but blue gerrymanders are far less common than red ones and not is this fairer but it helps us in red and swing states to boot.Look at a state like Texas (population 31.3M, 38 Reps = 820k per Rep, 13D-25R for a [58%-40% popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Texas), you'd go to 125 reps split 50D-73R. Note the totals mean that 3rd parties have a better chance here too.Now there are kinks to work out- it'd be harder for Congresspeople to get to know and to work with more colleagues. It'd be hard to know which candidate you're voting for exactly, so a scandal could hurt an entire party moreso than before.

That isn't how that works.Firstly, fission isn't needed to make someone radioactive. Uranium ore is radioactive. In the grand scheme of things it isn't extremely radioactive, but it is. You are right that fission will increase the radioactivity as the fairly stable Uranium atoms are split into less stable isotopes which decay faster. It is not required to make something radioactive. Also, the fusion reaction in a modern reactive is closed cycle. Unless something goes catastrophically wrong, a fission plant isn't going to make a river radioactive.Secondly, most of the Uranium ore is underground and the radiation is not an issue. It becomes can become an issue when it is brought above ground to where humans are. A single rock with uranium in it isn't really a threat to a human unless they breathe in its dust. Uranium is not concentrated in rocks like a vein of iron. It is dispersed throughout it. The rocks need to be crushed for the refinement process which makes a lot of dust. This is a problem as it can be breathed in and accumulate in the lungs. This turns something with low levels of radiation into a health hazard.Next, the ore doesn't remain unconcentrated. You refine it down to a purer version before you ship it off site. This drastically increases the radioactivity of the product. Something like 99.8% of rock mined for Uranium is waste and the rest in concentrated into a yellow powder. The yellow cake isn't really an issue because it is very valuable and isn't going to be purposefully released into the environment. It is also the most obviously radioactive part of this whole process.However, all that left over rock isn't benign. Where you find Uranium you usually find other radioactive elements like Thorium and Radium which can be in quite high concentrations in tailings. The tailings are generally stored in ponds. The water shields the radiation, but more importantly, prevents it from becoming a dust that is inhaled. These ponds need to be properly managed to ensure that the tailings and the contaminated water doesn't leak. Typically this is how rivers become \\"radioactive\\".This is before we talk about the large volume of sulfuric acid needed to separate the Uranium from the ore. This too can become a toxic mess if not handled properly.Decently article here about the process: [https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/waste/uranium-mines-and-millswaste/](https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/waste/uranium-mines-and-millswaste/)","title":"Canada aims to become worlds biggest uranium producer as demand soars"},{"text":"What's to stop Pfizer conducting gain of function research, create a super virus, \\"have a lab leak \\" and turn around and make millions selling the shots?","title":"Australia's Stolen Viruses Theory"},{"text":"Thank you for letting me know.

I believe point 2 is broadly correct, though I disagree on some of your sub points.\\n4 is true, but a surprising amount of Materiel the US (and the rest of NATO) has given to ukraine has been equipment near the end kf its service life that needed to be disposed of. The US is basically just using it as an excuse to refresh its inventory as it shifts to China as its primary near-peer threatPoint 1: At best this is a self fulfilling prophecy. \\nCountries have joined NATO in recent history because they have a neighbor they do not trust to respect their sovereignty and did not believe they could deter aggression without NATO membership. The baltic states without NATO would be entirely unable to resist a russian invasion. This fear is entirely founded, first by russia's actions in chechnya, then by Georgia. Russia could demonstrate a lack of need for NATO by not invading its neighbors in response to smaller states it could conquer (and has in the past) joining NATO. Taking crimea in 2014 further demonstrated russia's willingness to act with military aggression.Point 3: If russia didn't want to go to war the simplest solution would have been NOT to occupy pats of sovereign countries that it shared a border with because that country was tired of russia propping up petty dictators and wanted free and fair elections. And then trying to fully invade and topple the government of one of those countries. Ans alsp declaring the full annexation of some of those countries territories.Putin's russia invaded ukraine because they thought they could win, they are still fighting because they still believe that doing so is worth it.To condense that: IF RUSSIA DIDN'T WANT WAR, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED ONE. The EU was increasing its reliance on russian imports, the USA was slowly increasing its trade with russia despite strategic and cultural distrust.Russia had an incredible opportunity to become a valuable trade partner to europe and the united states, with support for NATO among european member states, and the US slowly shrinking. And then russia occupied parts of two of its neighbors.

Like it or not, when governments adopt Bitcoin, *you will be wrong*.Your point about stable coins has not really been fleshed out or thought through. The number of units of a stable coin can expand *and* contract in response to supply and demand. The same thing happens with Bitcoin ETFs and any open-ended mutual fund. Thats actually *how* a stable value is achieved. If too many people want Tether, the value of one coin could exceed the par value of one coin, so more coins are issued for dollars until the price falls to par. If there is too little demand little demand and the price starts to fall below par value, the organization can buy coins with dollars and shrink the supply until the value of a coin increases to par. Theres nothing nefarious about it. The federal reserve has massively expanded M2 money supply: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL, and has an explicit target of 2% inflation. If the federal government continues to run unsustainable deficits, the treasury will become increasingly dependent on the Fed to buy its bond issuances. Eventually, the fed will be under increasing pressure to abandon its 2% inflation target. The US has already abandoned its monetary policies under economic pressure many times over its history: during the civil war, during the depression, under Nixon. It will happen again. In contrast, the supply of Bitcoin increases according to a fixed schedule and the number of new coins issued will be negligible in the 2030s. Its an investment and generating excess returns because it is in the process of being internationally adopted and institutionalized. Eventually, its price growth will converge to some function of world GDP growth, expressed in nominal terms. It will perform a role similar to gold, but better, due to slower and predictable supply growth and its ease of storage and transportation. No ones saying that you have to invest all of your money in Bitcoin, but its justifiable to have some long term exposure. It must kill people like American Scream to know that that MSTR is part of the Nasdaq and that most people are already indirectly invested in Bitcoin.","title":"CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment."},{"text":"Well letting the idiots know it hurts your ego only encourages them to do more of the same","title":"Trump Says Dems Are Giddy About American Flag Being Flown At Half-Staff During Inauguration"},{"text":"And then turned back around and blamed Biden for the checks and inflation.

In the strictest literal sense, both these moves would be reactionary but leaving out the wildly disproportionate nature of the reaction paints an incomplete picture. Like, sure, its understandable that Putin isnt fond of Ukraine joining NATO, but you make it sound like that move essentially forced him to invade Ukraine, and thats a logical leap I cant get behind. He had literally every other option in the world that didnt involve invading a sovereign neighbor, but he chose invasion. That is, IMO, entirely on him. If Ukraine had invaded first, or even just fired some missiles or whatever, I could see an argument that Putins actions are reactionary, in a way that doesnt destroy the meaning of the word, but the facts just dont support it. He was 1000% the aggressor here, and the fact that he was so quick to launch a war shows that Ukraine wanting to join NATO was in fact a prudent and wise decision on their part since their eastern neighbor is so quickly bellicose.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Nobody will be able to take credit as the system may not last long","title":"Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people from bill that Biden is signing"},{"text":"I can relate as a woman.

It's a very toxic aspect of modern masculinity that men feel their value is linked to their produce. And on the other hand, women \\"voluntarily\\" opt for more caregiving occupations because society projects that on to them. Women are socialised with the ideas that their value is in their beauty and ability to attract a partner and build a family, this also lends to a toxic trait of society. I'd have to do some digging but there's been some studies that hint that it's not really a \\"willful choice\\" that women tend to go into fields like nursing and teaching as much as it is gender role pressures dictated by society and culture over the last few centuries. These are not biological, they are societal pressures that create these drives. If it were so nature driven why would women's suffrage have even been an issue? Why would any woman forgo her \\"natural\\" drive toward motherhood to become a CEO of a company? Why would a man become a teacher or stay-at-home-father? These would seem like biological anomalies, but really they're more natural to the drive of both sexes to care for their family and provide realised in different ways. They are actually examples of people breaking from societal expectations of gender roles instituted in only the most recent breath of human existence. People did not always function this way and it wasn't our \\"natural\\" state for women to stay at home and men to work. our natural state is for survival in whatever way is possible, which necessitates participation from all in as many tasks as possible and the only natural role segregation is pregnancy and nursing truly.

What is the end purpose? Weapons are a means to achieve a goal but what is that goal? To hold the front lines? To push the Russians back? To cause the fall of Putin's Russia? Each of them requires vastly different levels of commitment by the US and perhaps more importantly very different 2nd order effects.For example, if the goal is regime change in Russia, is the US ready for what comes next? There is absolutely no guarantee that a Putin-free Russia will be any better (it could be far worse). Or a civil war in Russia with thousands of nukes unaccounted for. Just look at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The US funded the rebels, but also directly lead to the rise of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. These 2nd order effects matter a lot and not thinking about them is foolish.2. Foreign Policy goes beyond one region. The world is ever more interconnected and there are implications beyond Ukraine. The US does not infinite amount of weapons/resources and the war in Ukraine has highlighted short comings (like Artillery shells or Javelin Missiles for example). The US has reached the stage where the US is moving weapons away from allies to give to Ukraine. For example, Artillery shells intended for South Korea or Taiwan are heading to Ukraine. Is that what the US wants?The less weapons than US has in Asia the more China benefits. To rephrase your last point, sure the conflict weakens Russia but in a way it also strengthens China. Is that a tradeoff the US wants to make?These are serious geopolitical questions that goes beyond Ukraine/Russia","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"I get it, but we can tone down the fear-mongering a wee bit.","title":"X.com (Twitter) will now implement user points for approved behavior."},{"text":"Turns out democracy is a pretty stupid system when the average voter is dumber than dog shit.

We pour billions of dollars into elections, but  most people dont believe that elections are delivering actual democracy  government by and for the people  and theyre right. In many countries, 2024 elections were merely tools of oppression. Freedom House, a Washington D.C., non-profit, found 22 contests in which incumbents attempted to jail or disqualify opponents. In at least 16 elections, Freedom House found, voters had no real choices at the ballot box because of electoral manipulation.  And violence was a major factor in 26 of the 62 elections that Freedom House monitored; election workers faced violent attacks in 12 contests. [...] Elections are fundamentally disempowering, says Leonora Camner, executive director of the global nonprofit Democracy Without Elections. Theyre about dividing people with slogans and stoking fears. Camner suggests that the logical response is to refocus on building democratic processes that empower people to govern themselves. But there are few signs of a shift. Why? Because powerful people and interests control elections.

You stated it was ingrained into people and I suggested two reasons why that isn't the case and why women choose not to have a traditional relationship, and why men accept not having a traditional lifestyle. You state people should have freedom of choice without judgement or pressure from society, that means you don't recognise your original point in the post of it being human nature, you contradict yourself by mentioning choice. Generally you're unlikely to go against human nature, so it's unlikely that you would have the freedom of choice if thats the case.Besides, for a lot of women who make the choice to take a traditional role, they are in a position of privilege as they aren't living in poverty. If their partner was to end up losing their household income then like I said, that privilege disappears and they will either have to find work or live in poverty until their partner has a stable income again, which you can't guarantee will be a short time frame. People don't want to live in poverty so this is where even traditional women will choose to go and work. Women in poverty are more likely to suffer economic abuse, so like I said a woman who has experienced this previously won't risk that again even if she prefers traditional roles.","title":"CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future.

If you preemptively make it so that Ukraine won't get additional aid regardless following a negotiation, what incentive does Russia have to sit down at the negotiating table?

This will likely only lead to greater embrace of MAGA, as they keep seeing mostly rewards from their behavior, at least during general election years.As for why the GOP's become more diverse, I think that there are two main issues at play.Until recently, racial / ethnic minorities in the US have largely voted for Dems despite being fairly conservative, socially if not economically. As the goodwill that Dems bought themselves from stuff like the Civil Rights Movement wears off with each generation, more and more minority voters will go with their actual political lean when deciding whom to vote for.There is the often trumpeted idea that Dems must ditch identity politics / \\"wokeness\\" to appeal to the working class. While this may have had some merit in the past (Hillary Clinton's campaign slogan isn't exactly subtle), from looking at actual 2024 campaigns, I don't think that that it accurately reflects party elected officials anymore. Harris palling around with Liz Cheney on multiple occasions and explicitly referencing her firearms usage in debates doesn't exactly sound like \\"wokeness.\\"Unfortunately, right wing media is very good, loud, and incessant at painting Dems as overly \\"woke\\" (and thus more concerned with Ivy League student protestors rather than \\"real\\" working-class Americans) based on heavily cherry-picked quotes from otherwise unimportant, usually left-wing, people on social media (and apparently dating apps now as well).

As I recall Russia was even invited to NATO. As I understand it they have also been expansionist before now, but that isn't even actually relevant. Germany also wasn't expanding in the mid-20th century... up until it was. It starts somewhere, so the argument that it isn't part of an existing pattern is invalid regardless of its veracity.2) \\"also, NATO expansion\\" - NATO has no mechanism for declaring an offensive war. Further, there is no coherent reason to pick a fight with nuclear-armed Russia; the risks outweigh any potential upside, even within your dubious framing of NATO. Assuming the US and all other parties would benefit from war, they would benefit *more* from almost any other adversary.3) \\"Russia doesn't want this\\" - Then don't invade? They seized Crimea and thought the sequel would be just as easy, so the argument about the economic impact is moot. No one planned for that. As for the \\"prior offer\\" to avoid it, if anything that's evidence of their commitment to war; if NATO agrees not to let Ukraine in, then they can invade at their leisure without NATO response and catch defenders off-guard. If NATO does not agree, they can point to this \\"attempt\\" as justification and have people like you defend them. It's a political no-brainer.4) \\"It doesn't benefit people\\" - Neither does a ceasefire. The people of Ukraine deserve the right to self-determination, and the cost of a buildup of defenses and capabilities against a victorious Russia would be immense.Let's not pretend here. The war could end tomorrow if Putin pulled out and let Ukraine be Ukraine. His nukes deter any NATO fuckery (and since you like bringing up patterns, there haven't been any cases of NATO challenging Russia's integrity, so we have no reason to expect it).

The Senate may have always been 2 seats per state, though they became elected instead of appointed only around the early 20th century, I believe.The House was capped at 435 seats in 1929 because they literally didn't want to bother expanding the Capitol building (yes really), so now the number is based off the Census...in 1910. One solution to this could be the [Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule), where one seat's constituent population is equivalent to the least populous state's at-large seat's constituent population, presently Wyoming.This would lower each district's population by about 200k, but that's still 500k people per district (for perspective, each seat in Iceland's parliament represents about 2k people). I think the half-Wyoming rule, or dividing Wyoming's population in half for each seat, would be ideal nowadays. Just stack all of the seats on top of each other. It'll be fine.And one last thing: unicameralism. Nebraska is the only state to have a unicameral legislature, that is, only one chamber instead of an upper and lower one. I prefer this system given how A) either pointless it can be if both chambers are elected in the same manner, or B) how unfair it can be if the upper chamber has some odd representation rule in its elections or is appointed (i.e. two seats per state regardless of population). So my solution is half-Wyoming Rule or 250k people per seat, and unicameral with only the House of Representatives.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 5, 2025"},{"text":"This court decision removed century-old restrictions on campaign finance that limited corporate spending.?You made it sound like it would be too complicated to implement restrictions when that was the default before citizens united.?","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

However, Id like to add to clarify somethingWhile societal developments like agriculture, modern medicine, and technology have reduced the need for rigid roles, biology still shapes certain tendencies and preferences. For example, studies show women, even in egalitarian societies, tend to gravitate more toward caregiving roles, while men lean toward provider roles. This isnt to say these roles are fixed, but biology does influence human behavior in ways that society builds upon. Additionally, while ancient societies may have shared responsibilities, its likely these shared roles reflected complementary strengths. Men, being physically stronger on average, often took on riskier and more resource-heavy tasks like big-game hunting, while women balanced foraging with childcare. These dynamics may have set evolutionary preferences that persist today, even if modern advancements allow for greater flexibility. I also believe societal expectations reinforce biological tendencies rather than contradict them. For example, the fact that many women today voluntarily choose to focus on nurturing roles, or that many men feel an innate responsibility to provide, suggests that traditional roles arent purely imposed but resonate with something deeper.However, Your reply helped me to better refine my idea and thanks for that","title":"CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future.

The nuclear family, while a more modern development, reflects these dynamics in a different form. Also I would say that while larger kin groups provided resilience in ancient times, the nuclear family offers emotional intimacy and a practical structure for modern societies.

The taliban taking over again was like yeah duh, Afghanistan is super religious, tribalistic, and relatively isolated; the taliban is quite possibly the only org that CAN unite and govern the place with any semblence of unified govt as ?is.The *kabul* govt + military was propped up by the US, entirely paid for and subsidized by the US (both directly and via massive endemic corruption at all levels), and to the point that the country cant / couldnt even fully feed itself given pop growth while the US was there.Where the biden admin DID fuck up was in evacs (or lack thereof) and not handing out asylum en masse to the locals who helped us, and to the point of actively facilitating a (note: properly vetted) afghani exodus a la the vietnamese to the US.That, and ofc any high level military assessment that the aghani govt + military werent all corrupt sacks of shit that would fold immediately. And for what shouldve been really, really obvious reasons, like no pay and nit wanting to continue to fight a civil war (for no pay), as we incidentally also just saw with the collapse of assads military in syria.Overall if you want to blame anyone for the clusterfuck and gross waste of US tax dollars and US and above all afghani lives (note: *future* tax and/or inflation dollars, TYVM national debt / federal deficit spending) that was the Bush/Cheney GWOT clusterf- in afghanistan.Then 2) blame the sunk cost fallacy + US electorate / electoral politics.3) The Bush/Cheney foreign policy goal of *invading Iraq and using 9/11 as the casus-belli-for-total-morons-aka-the-US-public* (ergo winning quickly is a problem, ergo we remained bogged down in afghanistan for 20 years with no sane + actionable strategy in service of actual US interests b/c invading iraq in 03 required massively escalating vs afghanistan / al qaeda in fall 01 and then stalling indefinitely in 02)And above all 1) Cheney / Bush / Bushs cabinets decisions w/r all of the above.And above all eg Cheneys decision to bin all of the *suggested* ops to get bin laden (CIA just throws several briefcases full of cash + US backing at rhe talibans 2nd in command, in exchange for an internal coup and Bin Laden + Al Qaedas heads on a plate. And/or a US special forces op to capture the dude + rest of al qaeda leadership, via intel we had from predator drones loitering above the dudes house). And instead chose 3) the most ludicrous, aggressive, and stupid option (invade the entire country using a CSG + amphib group), *and then escalated massively from there*.If we wanted actual political (and budgetary, *and direct lies + subterfuge to the US public and core allies*) accountability in the US, we quite frankly shouldve taken a page from south korea and/or singapore, and found and/or invented reasons to throw the former president and most of his cabinet cabinet in prison for 20+ years. And/or just sign treaties and send them to the f-ing hague.

It only became the dominant family form largely during the post WW2 economic boom. For example, in the 1950s the sociologist Talcott Parsons wrote about how the nuclear family was best suited for the workforce of industrial capitalism at that time. But today, regardless of one's ideology, it is no longer feasible for most families to live off of a single breadwinner. That's why more families now are dual-earners in which both partners are breadwinners. Jobs just don't pay as much and have the same long-term security and benefits like they used to. No family form is truly universal.

The truth is every population of human contains some mix of monogamists, polygamists, and every other -gamist under the sun.

You obviously provided basic intelligence benchmarks, but you don't even seem to have given us a clear, yet vague, understanding of what sorts of questions your system would ask to determine whether or not someone should be disenfranchised or if they're mentally fit. More importantly, how do you avoid disenfranchising older voters and people with disabilities? It's a fucking disaster of an idea to give them a special voting system that lets them have their equal representation, but that means that they get a disproportionately large say in electing those representatives. The alternative, though, is effectively calling for states to (finally) ignore the ADA and require old people and people with disabilities to identify themselves either at the polls or to a federal/ state agency that would then send a marker for for poll workers to disenfranchise people.There's an absolutely massive fraud risk right there, because an initial disenfranchisement in error could lead to LOOOTS of old people and disabled people being temporarily disenfranchised. There's the fact that you'd likely be having these disenfranchisement hearings in conjunction with get out the vote operations because it would have to be done in person. The ADA makes it very difficult to distinguish disabled people from non-disabled people. I'm a disabled person myself. This is an absolutely critical component of what has allowed me to actually exist in public and not have my entire community know my medical diagnosis as the basis of determining whether or not I should be eligible for enfranchisement.If an election poll worker disenfranchised me in error, due to the fact that course accommodations requirements would be similar/ identical for people with disabilities, I would essentially be forced in front of a judge to have my mental health history accessed so my eligibility *to have the eligibility to vote* could be determined and ultimately decided. This would make it public information to any random poll worker or canvasser in my area.Would an average citizen even have the capacity to navigate the complex system of disenfranchisement and disability accommodations for public hearings? The fact that you haven't considered the ADA and how tremendously your proposal overshadows and absolutely violates that law can only demonstrate how ridiculously inept you are at understanding the practicalities of your own theory.

I am sure that you also respect women decisions to choose what they want to be since it is not up to us to define what family dynamic men or women are seeking. My main idea is that men and women are free to choose what kind of family they want. However, men are more restrained I would say from fulfilling the role of provider, leaders and I am not complaining since Its understandable due to historical and biological context. It is unlikely that a man inherently seeks for being a stay home father saying that he wants a woman to be the protector or leader, resource provider. This is very rare So, what is the takeaway from that? as well as there could be different family dynamics, the traditional family will always remain the same.

If you actually compare the genders you'll see far more differences within the genders than between the two. I'm certain whatever \\"nurturing feeling\\" women feel are probably felt the same by men. The \\"innate pressure\\" men feel to be providers is probably felt by women too. Just because something was done a lot in the past doesn't mean it's an innate part of human nature. Women were prevented from working. You can't claim women naturally want to stay at home when historically they actually didn't have a choice. Now we're slowly lifting these barriers and going through a transition period. Your argument is kind of like an Aristotelian argument for a natural slave. Because the history supports the status quo then the status quo must be natural. You're right that there aren't a lot of stay at home fathers, but how many men actually feel fulfilled being purely a provider rather than a nurturer? Pursuing careers isn't the same as not wanting to nurture. Careers aren't 24/7. People only have careers to finance their families. How many fathers feel sad watching their children grow up? How many fathers had lives that revolved around their children? How many fathers wish they could spend more time with their kids? The stereotype that fathers only care about providing while the mothers solely care about nurturing is going away because fathers *are* nurturing creatures.

There was no such thing as the male bread winner while women took care of the household. Both men and women in hunter gatherer tribes who could fulfill the role of hunting hunted. Both men and women who could not capability hunt in a hunter gatherer tribe focused on gathering as a group. And these societies cared for the sickly/elderly and child rearing as a community effort. Just think about it. There are some women who can definitely hunt. Just because there are men who are naturally stronger and better doesn't mean they can't use an additional hand with a spear or weapon trying to hunt a potentially large game as a unit. After all, humanity didn't survive/conquer the world due to strength or because men were better hunters. We survived/conquered because we collaborated, documented knowledge/history, and passed on knowledge in ways no animals could which none of them has anything exclusively specific to hunting or conforming to the traditional dynamic family that conservatives picture. Life was harder in the old days. If you were physically able, you did the manual labor. This idea that women stayed home to raise kids is silly. Elderly who was less physically capable stayed home to raise family. It was a multigenerational family dynamic. Elderly who could still hunt hunted.The idea of the man being the breadwinner and individual responsibility to society (at least for western societies) massively increased as a culture during the Renaissance and the massive spread of Catholicism in Europe.In the inherent BASE of our raw instinct, it is likely that we are territorial animals and we may have been more like kangaroos where the most dominant get the breeding rights and all other males essentially fight to take over. But once agricultural civilization set in, the natural \\"role\\" to our dynamic family units changed massively from whatever it was before to be more static like today. Within a civilized community, there has to be some sort of promise for sustainability and self preservation and part of that was the promise that everyone had the right to our base desires. If you were to apply the Hierarchy of Needs, it would most likely be the first 2-3 parts of that ladder.For example, most apex predators are not apex predators as a result of being individually powerful/strong hunters/etc. Most apex predators known today typically work in packs, have high social intelligence, and apply strategies/techniques that would impress modern humans. Like how orca's form waves and crashing them onto ice where seals are resting or how wolves and lion hunt in packs. The apex predators that hunt alone are almost all endangered or dying out.","title":"CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future.

This has not been the idea of a traditional family for human societies until relatively recently.  The provider myth:  For most of human history, where humans were hunter-gatherers, women strapped kids on their backs and worked along side the men.  They also hunted and gathered as you can see by looking at traditional societies today.  Women would control reproduction or kill infants if they were born too close together in order to be able to migrate, work and provide for the family.  The average child spacing was 3-4 years apart.  Do you consider that nurturing?What you are talking about is the effect that moving to an agrarian society had on family structures.  Since people were able to grow food and stay in one spot, women could have more children, and those children were a net benefit to society because they could help farm.  Women started spending more time caring for those children while the men and older children worked the fields.  But women still worked.  Domestic labor was grueling and required to keep everyone clothed and fed.  Since we live in a world where mens increased physical labor is becoming less valuable, and women and men can do many of the same tasks, it makes sense that ideas of gender roles and also family structures can change, particularly if many men and women are unhappy in those roles, which they are.  Are you suggesting we force people who are unhappy in those roles to perform them?Saying we should have only one family structure, that is a fairly recent human construct, seems illogical.  It also seems, as we can see by the declining birth rates across the planet, that this traditional family structure is not really working to promote human flourishing.","title":"CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future.

However, for men, the same flexibility is not as prevalent. The notion of a man choosing to be a stay-at-home father while his wife takes on the role of breadwinner is still relatively uncommon, and I think it is an exception rather than the norm.You're right it is the exception but not because of any innate reason. There's a whole movement that helped women gain this flexibility and new roles. No such movement has happened for men, at least not on a scale to change things dramatically.

For example, the idea that men are providers and women are homemakers. In considering pregnancy and a small familial unit, there are times where it is necessary in an ancient world for men to be a provider. For 9 ish months a woman was more vulnerable to predators, required more energy to sustain hers and the growing life, and was physically brought down in capability due to the pregnancy. Thus it was important that the male partner step up to care. However, in an ancient world, non-pregnant women were very capable and very needed in hunting and foraging and there is nothing inherently male or female about those roles. In fact, some suggestion that women made for better hunters in some instances and often provided for their unit/tribe.?\\nSecondly for a homemaker, post birth, a baby is more dependent on a mother than father for nutrition for the first period of their life, further necessitating support from her unit. So there is some biological, as you note, reasoning behind \\"traditional\\" roles. However, in the timeline of a person's life, these are relatively short periods where this is necessary for survival in an undeveloped, pre-agriculture world.?\\nOnce we developed things like society, agriculture, farming, animal husbandry, modern medicine, etc etc--all things that resemble our current ways of life, these roles are much less needed. There may be an animalistic instinct to nurture your young and familial unit, but it is much more a societal expectation than an innate quality of male and female to engage in certain occupations. Both, throughout much of human history have engaged in all types of roles and the only real reason child rearing falls more strongly on women is pregnancy and nursing, aside from those there's no reason men can't and no evidence that they haven't, been just as involved in the home nor that women weren't involved outside of the home except in societies that prevented their application outside the home such as, as you said, prominently in the last millenium-ish.?\\nThough there's an element of nature involved, it is far more the product of societal pressure/expectation on both genders that created what were calling traditional roles and then upheld them as well","title":"CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future.

If you want to make a biological argument you must go to pre-history times to find if there is an inherent role of nurturer vs breadwinner.This is not the case, the family unit of ancient humans were massive and does not fit in with the conservative world view of the nuclear family. And lets be clear here, you are talking about a nuclear family of one earner adult and one dependent adult and at least 2 children. All research in the area points to a family structure that has both parents provided, and both parents nurtured, along with uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents.This is the progressive model of family, which is resilient to disaster compared to your rather fragile traditional nuclear family model. If a family unit loses its men the women can be breadwinners, if a family loses its women the men can be nurturers. If a family needs extra help it can adopt a non-related adult or child into the kin-band.The nuclear family structure is unnatural for the very reason that it cannot survive in nature, it can only survive in a human society. A man can only be a breadwinner if he earns money to win bread, and a woman can only be a nurturer if she has no responsibilities to take in the corn and cereals. If both women and men need to work to bring in food they are both bread winners, and therefore they do not fall into the traditional model of family.","title":"CMV: The essence of traditional family or traditional roles will never disappear no matter how much progressive our society is or intend to be in the future.

Look at Russia and China for example. They couldnt be more different ideologically and yet theyve increased cooperation to unprecedented levels because it benefits them both. Why cant we cooperate with others based on mutual benefit without concerning ourselves with their ideology?2) I get that western propaganda has instilled this image of Putin as some mad dictator invading foreign countries for irrational reasons, but do you want to know why he still has so much support in Russia? Its because from Russias perspective, NATO expansion right up to their border is quite literally the same as the Cuban missile crisis was for the US. Hypothetically, if there existed a military alliance with the US as its declared primary enemy, do you think wed just allow that alliance to acquire countries on our border like Mexico or Canada and potentially station nukes in those countries which could hit any US city in a matter of minutes? Of course not! Wed launch a preemptive strike the same way Putin did to defend our border.To sum up, literally nobody benefits from US support to Ukraine except defense contractors and NATO personnel.

Your focus seems to be on outcomes. And when it comes to governance I think that's quite a natural place to think to begin. But to steal a quote, solutions that are the first think you think of, look sensible, and are easy to implement are often terrible, ineffective solutions that will cause suffering. And boy howdy is that the case here.The primary issue is, once you give someone complete authority it can't be taken back. You've pointed out some successes (and not all of theses examples are ones I'd actually consider successes but there are a few so I didn't want to quibble) but you don't get to know how someone is going to be as a dictator until they're a dictator. The communist revolution in Russia was all about giving power to the people, right up until they won and it turned out that the power was actually for the new leadership, which resulted in Stalin coming into power and... I mean I didn't see Stalin listed here so I'm going to assume I don't need to list off all his atrocities and failures. Arguing in favor of an authoritarian regime is basically saying \\"Give this one guy all power forever and hope he's not lying about the kind of guy he is and also never changes.\\" I know people who say they wouldn't do that with Superman, if he were real. And he's not, he's a fictional character designed to be the perfect paragon of good and they still don't trust him.Which is where I pause to let you know; I think in an ideal world the best form of government is indeed a benevolent dictatorship. Which is to say, a government run by a dictator who has no self interest and will only do what is good for his citizens. So I'm actually not one of the people who would reject Superman. If I knew it was in fact the real Superman, and he actually was willing to take the position, I'd be all for installing him as God Emperor of Mankind. But, you see all those caveats? We do not live in an ideal world. There are so many things that stand in the way of that actually being possible. Even if you could find someone as selfless as the fictional Superman, there's no guarantee he'll stay that way. It's a spherical cow scenario. Can be useful to think about, but don't go acting as if it's true. You'll probably destroy a bunch of stuff.Of course, you already seem aware of this problem because of point H. While you praise the majority of Roman dictators, you also point out that flawed succession can result in bad people getting to be in charge. And then you're stuck with them. Unless you're willing to kill them. Which, the great personal risk of that aside, is actually going to result in more turmoil for the nation in the short term. It's bad for the country either way.So ultimately, if you advocate for a shift from democracy to dictatorship, you're asking people to roll the dice. Which, you might say we already do with our leaders. But the upshot is, if they turn out bad, we only have to ride it out in the short term. You want us to roll one time and we're stuck with that result for, likely, the rest of our lives. That seems like a downgrade, not an upgrade.One final note I didn't have a good segue into because it didn't have anything to do with my main point but actually be the better point is: obvious confirmation bias. I already mentioned how you have listed out some successes of dictatorships. However, you handwave or completely fail to mention it's mountains of failures. There have been a lot of dictatorships over the history of humanity and precious few democracies by comparison. I'm willing to bet that if I buckled down and got to it, I could find a list of overall positive outcome dictators that is longer than the number of democracies that have existed. Not because dictatorships are inherently better than democracies, but because there's a huge sample size to pull from. Pulling out the ones who have succeeded and saying, dictators are good actually, is pretty disingenuous.","title":"CMV: Democracy is not always a better system than dictatorship in any given country"},{"text":"well I meant it was unknown to the Chinese at the time the British were negotiating the first treaty.

You would need to show that voting behavior is not significantly better if the voter's mental capacities are better. They might be better individually, but would be worse in the aggregate.When scientists gather data, they don't try to get a small amount of 'good' data, because whatever makes the data 'good' data might also introduce a systematic bias. Instead they gather huge amounts of random data and average it to together, and this will tend to cancel out the random noise and return the actual number they are trying to capture.Same thing here. Low-capacity voters might vote close to randomly, but it's not *completely* random - each is influenced by lots of real things, plus random nonsense.  When you average a hundred million of them together, the random stuff tends to cancel out and the real stuff can be measured.Whereas if you choose a select population to be the ones to vote, they are also affected by random and real things, but those things are more likely to be correlated because of the way you chose them.  Maybe they tend to come from cities and suddenly your farm policy sucks. Maybe they tend to be college educated and suddenly your country is trying to force everyone into college even for jobs that don't need it.  Maybe they tend to be well-off financially and suddenly life gets much worse for poor people.  Maybe a podcast that smart people listen to is hyping up a new educational reform that the host believes in but which actually does suck, but they all trust this podcast and vote for it. Etc.Letting everyone vote means we get all the data from real factors and important concerns affecting everyone in the population, and also a lot of random noise.   Restricting the vote means less random noise but also more real things getting missed.  The noise tends to cancel out when averaging over enough voters, but real things that are missed are gone forever.","title":"CMV: People should be accorded democratic civil rights to the degree that they demonstrate the mental capacity to \\"properly\\" participate."},{"text":"Russia invaded parts of Ukraine in 2014, far before NATO was even discussed.

When Adam Walsh was abducted in 1981, it set the stage for a pendulum swing to overparenting that has had a devastating impact on children.[[The Adam Walsh case](https://time.com/4437205/adam-walsh-murder/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#)] created a nation of petrified kids and paranoid parents, says Richard Moran, criminologist at Mount Holyoke College. Kids used to be able to go out and organize a stickball game, and now all playdates and the social lives of children are arranged and controlled by the parents. Over time, as parents started feeling anxious and wanting to keep their children in their line of sight at all times, they naturally began to see their children doing risky things - and concerned for child safety, started intervening to prevent them from fighting with a sibling or friend, climbing and jumping from places that they might get hurt, etc. The seeds of overparenting were sewn. And today, [we need researchers to give parents permission to allow kids to engage in risky play](https://www.excelledschools.com/risky-play/) - *which had been the human default since the dawn of time*.So in sum, the emotional crisis we see in younger generations isnt the result of a generation of narcissist parents emotionally abandoning their children. Its in fact the opposite: that driven by fear of losing their children, or seeing them harmed, a generation of parents pulled their children into their homes, out of a perceived (not real) dangerous world outside, which led to changes in parenting style that inadvertently stripped children of the emotional resilience all humans need and all past generations naturally developed - and can still be seen in other cultures, from Asia to Africa to Europe to South America.A final note: Narcissism has a genetic/inherited component, while resilience is purely a function of upbringing. Its not immutable. And that should be hopeful for everyone. 2/2 END","title":"CMV: Narcissistic Boomer Parents are the reason so many Gen X and Millennials are traumatized and have attachment issues."},{"text":"BTW way I am not disagreeing with you that it was one of their tools ....

We grew up shopping at a mix of thrift stores, KMart, and Sears. I started babysitting for money at 11, had a summer job at 15, worked weekends at retail my unit and senior years and full time in summer, and worked two part time jobs through college because my parents had saved money for us for school but it wasnt enough to pay tuition. We took one vacation per year for 2 weeks to go fishing at the beach (in a motel with no tv or phone in the room). We ate out once a month, at Sizzler. My position: Social media thrives on controversy, polarization, hyperbole, and anger. The algorithms are ruthless, feeding you more and more of what you click and comment - which has no relationship to the frequency of occurrence in the real world. The distortion of social media can make people think their experience is the experience of the majority of people. In the real world, I have exactly one friend with narcissist Boomer parents, and one narcissistic family member - but on social media my feed is absolutely *full* of content about Narcissism and I find it very strange.Parents of my friends are/were on a spectrum from something like distant and tough but fair, to the neighborhoods mom and dad, with one parent of a friend of my sister being messed up and looking back probably am alcoholic, but not a narcissist.First, we have to differentiate narcissistic *traits* from actual narcissism. Objectively, .[5-5% of the population](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9742-narcissistic-personality-disorder) are believed to have Narcissistic Personality Disorder. So the definition of *clinical* Narcissism doesnt fit the average person born between 1946 and 1964, let alone a majority, because it doesnt actually fit the average person of *any* generation:[Narcissistic personality disorder](https://www.google.com/search?q=clinical+definition+of+narcissism&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari) (NPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.NPD is different from having narcissistic tendencies, which are normal when they occur occasionally. NPD symptoms are more severe, occur across different situations and environments, and can make relationships challenging*. The fact that narcissism can make relationships more difficult doesnt mean that all difficult relationships *are due to* narcissism.(Analogy: just because sugarcane makes food sweet doesnt mean all sweet foods contain cane sugar.)So what could be the cause of all these messed up people in younger generations? Why do so many Millennials and GenZ seem to have mental health issues? Again, you need to be cautious what the algorithm is telling you. Im seeing in your argument a lot of tropes and stereotypes about latchkey kids, for example. Youve got influencers who are funny and provocative shaping your view, along with people who were raised by parents who align with that view, which makes it seem like it was a majority. GenX are feral, they had to ask our parents if they knew where we were at the end of the evening news makes good content - but everyone in my friend circle experienced a very normal upbringing where we had freedom, our parents trusted us to be able to handle situations without them intervening in every decision, where we had to resolve conflicts ourselves, and we had the time and space to explore, fail, be bored, and most importantly, to learn that we could take care of ourselves. We learned, in short, that we could rely on ourselves and trust ourselves, instead of needing a parent always there to step in and save us. Researchers call that resilience. And I would argue the emotional trauma youre observing is actually the result of *overparenting* - not narcissistic boomers.(A \\"lack of resilience in young adults\\" refers to an inability to bounce back from challenges or setbacks, often characterized by an overreaction to stress, difficulty coping with negative emotions, and a tendency to feel overwhelmed by problems, which can stem from factors like overprotective parenting, increased societal pressure, and a lack of experience navigating adversity in life.)Human minds were not designed and optimized to live in a warm, cozy, cocoon where you experience no conflict or stress or discomfort or boredom. What researchers have found is that when children arent allowed to experience what you might call hardships, they dont develop into calm, happy, well-adjusted adults - they turn into depressed, anxious ones. You are saying you wish research is done. It has been. It just doesnt show what you may think it would. And its not just in the US that this has been studied.[Article from KQED](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60624/young-adults-are-struggling-with-their-mental-health-is-more-childhood-independence-the-answer) | [Article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/04/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/) | [Article in Neuroscience News](https://neurosciencenews.com/parental-overprotection-anxiety-22988/) | [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+so+many+young+people+lack+emotional+resilience&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari) The point is, depression and anxiety in post-Boomer generations actually stems from [a *lack of resilience*](https://www.verywellmind.com/characteristics-of-resilience-2795062) - not a generation of narcissistic parents/grandparents.  A lack of resilience *isnt* due to neglect or narcissism, but from children not being allowed to experience conflict, adversity, Independence, and life skills. The emotional impact of a lack of resilience can make someone feel abandoned/unsupported by parents when they reach adulthood, because the over-protection evaporates but the adult-child hasnt developed emotional resilience.So what changed? What created this sudden shift from The Greatest Generation and Boomers who had emotional resilience and celebrated independence and freedom they had as children, to two generations of young people who are anxious and depressed?  1/2(See reply to this post for remainder of comment)","title":"CMV: Narcissistic Boomer Parents are the reason so many Gen X and Millennials are traumatized and have attachment issues."},{"text":"I think so many cmv posts about \\"blame\\" just feel kind of confused.

He knew he would be too old to run in 2024. https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129 But there didnt seem to be any plan to prepare a candidate for 2024, and he ended up running and dropping out late in the race. This left no time to have a proper primary, and while I think Kamala was a good candidate, she didnt do enough to beat Trump. Maybe someone else would have.On top of this, Trump has been found guilty of many crimes since leaving office, but Merrick Garland declined to prosecute him federally. Its very possible that a conviction on treason charges for the January 6th insurrection would have made Trump ineligible to run again. Even if the Supreme Court stepped in and protected Trump, I think just presenting all of the evidence against him publicly could have swayed voters. And the Democrats dont just have to lie down and accept that a conservative court will prevent them from taking any action against Trump. They could have taken measures to expand the court, or impeach Clarence Thomas who is not reporting gifts that could cause conflicts of interest. https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crowWhen one political party is not engaging in democracy in good faith, the other party must use every tool available to protect our system.

They are just too out of touch.","title":"CMV: For those of you who are Democrats that voted for Harris, yet are blaming the Dems to why Trump won, you're basically saying that the Democrats are the ones responsible for the end of our democracy."},{"text":"While the actual death tolls from this conflict are hard to lock down while the war is still ongoing the total number of casualties at this point when including both sides is likely in the hundreds of thousands. Western think tanks have estimated that for Russia to seize control of disputed Ukrainian regions that it claims as its own at the war's current pace it will likely take approximately 5 years. Neither side wins in this war. Ukraine will lose territory and citizens through a slow war of attrition with or without western aid (unless the west dramatically steps up its aid). Russia loses billions on military spending through this conflict, hundreds of thousands of able bodied working age men in the hope of extending its natural resources and sphere of influence, and receives a black eye on its military ableness in the region. All the US loses is money. Thats why international powers love proxy wars. If I were Ukrainian would I want to cede my country to Russia, especially after multiple years of conflict? No. If I were Russian would I want to admit defeat to a US proxy state, as well as show weakness on the world stage, especially after multiple years of fighting for meager gains? No. All of this having been stated, it is likely that this conflict would end sooner rather than later if military funding to Ukraine were stopped. Is that the right thing to do, bearing in mind that Russia was the aggressor in this conflict? Thats hard to say, as it should be.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":":( I wish it wasn't this way.
