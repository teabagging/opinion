Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon were members of this elite billionaire-funded Christian nationalist group well before Trump descended his golden escalator.[Council for National Policy Membership Directory 2014 (Redacted)](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf)It is best to think of Trump as a vote-getting machine and his backers as the ones crafting policy and staffing his administration with folks who will execute the plan. Back when Trump suddenly appeared on the political scene, his eventual backers were caught unprepared during his first term, but the network has been hard at work since then to maximize the advancement of their agenda in a second Trump administration.If you climb up the food chain of deeply conservative Christian nationalist and libertarian organizations vying for control of the country, youll find the Council for National Policy, which serves as an umbrella organization for its member groups. The Heritage Foundation is their most prominent think tank. Awareness of the Heritage Foundation is important to discuss because Project 2025 is in the news, but it can be hard to connect the dots until you are familiar with the CNP.Back in 2016, the Council for National Policy was pushing for Ted Cruz, but they were unable to stop Trump from winning the primary. Trump did not have an administrative team or any policies to speak of at the time because he ran on a narcissistic whim for self-promotion, not expecting to win.After winning the primary, he gained the support of the Council for National Policy by promising, for example, to give them their justice picks and use extremists from the CNP in key positions within his administration. The CNP never had so much wide-ranging, direct access before so they enthusiastically adopted Trump as their imperfect vessel and directed their member groups to fall in line and support him.New Republic - [A Rare Peek Inside the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy](https://newrepublic.com/article/167002/council-national-policy-documents-right-wing-conspiracy)The Heritage Foundation, a meeting sponsor, has been a core partner of the Council for National Policy from the start, and Heritage president Kevin Roberts is on the CNP board of governors.Together, the organizations would serve as a three-legged stool for the right, with Heritage [Foundation] as the think tank; [American Legislative Exchange Council] as a state-level bill mill; and the [Council for National Policy] as a coordinating body for donors, media, and activists.Washington Post - [God, Trump and the Closed-Door World of a Major Conservative Group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/10/25/god-trump-closed-door-world-council-national-policy/)In October 2015, Donald Trump was still a laugh line for right-wing Christian activists. By their lights he was a failed casino owner and thrice-married playboy. He had no apparent principles, no policy blueprint and no grasp of the Bible. He didnt even understand free-market theory, something they consider to be a fountainhead of American liberty. Yet here he was in a conference room at the Ritz-Carlton in McLean, Va., soliciting support from a closed-door group of conservative leaders called the Council for National Policy.For months after the event, Dannenfelser and some other CNP members were determined to stop Trump. While he solidified his lead as GOP front-runner, they denounced him as a charlatan in the conservative magazine National Review, blasted his prior support of abortion rights and implored Republican voters to choose another candidate.Then came a great swerve that would upend politics in America: Millions of conservatives  Dannenfelser and other CNP members among them  got firmly behind Trump.McGahn thought Trump could benefit by releasing a list of nominees to replace Scalia, an unusual move that would reassure religious and social conservatives who wanted an anti-abortion jurist. Trump expressed support for one of Leos long-cherished goals: a federal court system dominated by judges who would interpret the Constitution in ways that favored business and conservative views.In the summer of 2016, Trump made another strategic move that would seal the deal with Dannenfelser, the anti-abortion activist, and other CNP members. He pledged to oppose abortion and put the promises onto paper in September. Dear Pro-Life Leader, Trumps letter began. I am writing to invite you to join my campaigns Pro-Life Coalition, which is being spearheaded by longtime leader Marjorie Dannenfelser. Trump said he would nominate pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, defund Planned Parenthood and take other measures that the anti-abortion activists had demanded.Dannenfelser was thrilled. Before that we were still stomping our feet, she said last year at a CNP meeting, according to one of the internal videos. Little did we know that this man, who was a performer and can incite audiences in ways we never even thought could be, would galvanize audiences in battleground states all over the country and put life at the center of the project. The CNP crowd whooped and hollered at her remarks.In Reeds book, he writes that Dannenfelser told him: Trump was my last choice until he was my first.Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policys] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP.In 2016, the CNP put its partners money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep himand themselvesin power.Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the Trump brand. In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.Ultimate realization of the CNPs agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November. With another four years, it could enshrine its socially regressive policies on the federal level, further blur the line between church and state, and consolidate huge windfalls for corporations and wealthy individuals.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy wants to start DOGE cuts by eliminating funding for unauthorized programs - including veteran healthcare"},{"text":"Trump is Putin's Puppet, along with many of the people he'll be appointing.

My mother loved teaching and being around kids but the countless teaching plans and lack of discipline of kids made her retire.

My mom used to be pretty moderate liberal, but all of the Trump bs, combined with her boyfriend moving her across the country,  helped to turn her into a right-wing conspiracy person. Instead of spending time doing normal things with her friends and family, she was isolated and dove into Facebook and alternative news like Infowars. I would have long conversations with her that would eventually lead her to see how Trump was lying, or how his ideas were not good for her and the country, but a week later she'd be sharing the same memes because she wanted those likes and that approval from the other chronically online people she knew. By 2019, she was screaming that all libs care about are facts and sources, and I'm not allowed to talk about politics with her.  Once covid hit, I couldn't hold a phone convo with her without it devolving into rants about the jab and Fauci. In 2021 I had to leave FB because she posted her crazy memes so much I couldn't get away from them without blocking her, and she actually did block me for challenging her belief that Trump hadn't won. She also lost her best friend as her racism, or her inability to hide it,  ramped up in 2020. I just spoke with her for the first time in months because it was my birthday, and she spent most of that call complaining about Biden's useless post office, since I hadn't gotten her card yet, but she doesn't want to hear that Trump is the one who appointed Dejoy to postmaster general. We've fought over the dumbest things, like me getting my hair cut short because that means I've been indoctrinated into becoming a boy at 40, me asking for a recipe becoming a rant about Biden coming to steal our stoves, and the time my nephew and I were in her truck and she got so upset at the thought of Biden coming to take it from her that even my little nephew was scared of her yelling and driving. It doesn't matter what logic I use to explain these are not things that are happening, what sources I show her, or how I try to walk her through the scenarios to show how they wouldn't happen, she just feeds off this fear and anger, then runs to FB to have her friends tell her she is right to be scared.

That goes against the idea of state's rights on one level, and it obviously undermines herd immunity.But, even if we ignore some of the more obvious anti-vax actions and statements and take a more measured one from RFK, he says that \\"no vaccine is fully safe and effective\\". If someone feels that way, how can we expect them not to take further measures to undermine vaccines?  For example, he could remove vaccine mandates and say \\"I'm just giving you a choice\\" and then turn around and have the FDA remove approval for many vaccines because \\"we need to study it more first\\" and then never re-grant it.  He's still giving you a choice.  Just a choice over basically no options.  His history makes it hard to expect reasonable decision-making.  I'm not sure what him wanting more transparency from scientists is supposed to mean.  Science, by its nature, is already highly transparent.  That's why journals publish detailed research papers.  And the fact that the science is so widely available only further highlights how flawed many of his views are because they reject widely held scientific consensus with huge amounts of data and seems to replace it with his pseudoscience feelings.If he actually means that private companies that create health products should be more transparent, then that is a totally different topic and more related to regulation of business.  There's a valid argument that more regulation is needed there, but it's going to be a tough road within his own party since the GOP is vehemently anti-regulation and Musk/Trump seem set on further gutting regulations.","title":"Trump picks RFK Jr. , anti-vaccine activist, for Health and Human Services secretary"},{"text":"Its not just efficiency.it also needs to only be doing things that have broad consensus.

First, the Articles of Confederation proved to be ineffective as a governing doctrine. The leaders subsequently created the Constitution, and established a formidable central government. Second, the southern states seceded and a Civil War ensued. The seceding states lost the war and the centralized government enacted laws to end racial slavery and forced states to comply. (in some ways, we're still reconciling this reformation.) Third, free enterprise ran amok causing the Great Depression. The (central) Federal government stabilized the country with various programs and even WW2 helped to bring us out of the Depression. Fourth, the September 11th attacks were used to enact the Patriot Act, which has so far led to us attacking ourselves from the inside.This is is total oversimplification, but I think it's important to note that most of the time, the Federal Government served as a source of strength for our country. Yes, there is some authoritarianism to this, but that isn't inherently bad, just as states governing themselves 50 different ways isn't inherently good.Lincoln censored some parts of the Press &amp; Media, and forced the compliance of half the country. Teddy Roosevelt breaking up monopolies was authoritarian, but it was necessary. FDR's tenure was followed by the country winning a global war and leading to an incredible run of prosperity. It also coincided with a great deal of social change that improved so many Americans' lives.

I assume FRA is a typo for FDA? I am not trying to argue that they did not fail to comply with their reporting requirements. They clearly did not have the documentation there were supposed to submit. HOWEVER, the failure to submit reports does not imply the absence of safety testing or rigorous evaluation of vaccines.\\nWhile failing to file these reports is absolutely a procedural violation, it does not constitute evidence that safety protocols or studies were bypassed. Agencies occasionally fail in documentation and reporting, but these administrative lapses are separate from the scientific protocols involved in vaccine development. This is what I meant by this lawsuit is being spun to promote a false narrative that the safety testing was never done. 2. Vaccines are tested in rigorous trials, though not always through double-blind placebo-controlled studies, for ethical reasons. Some vaccine trials do involve placebo groups, but ethical considerations can limit the use of true placebos when effective vaccines already exist. This is not unique to vaccines; it's a standard approach in clinical research when withholding effective treatment would cause harm. For example, when testing new antibiotics for severe infections, patients with life-threatening infections cannot ethically be given a placebo when effective antibiotics exist. Trials compare new antibiotics to standard treatments rather than a placebo. Denying antibiotics in such cases would lead to preventable deaths or severe complications.This applies to your example of cancer drugs. The analogy to cancer drugs is flawed, as when testing new cancer treatments, placebo groups can be used because patients still receive the standard of care, not no care. For vaccines, withholding a known protective vaccine to test a new one raises significant ethical concerns. In situations like these, the process is extremely nuanced and requires ethics, efficacy, and existing treatments to be carefully balanced. 3. Regarding vaccine approval processes, the FDA requires extensive testing for all vaccines, including phase I, II, and III trials that assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in large populations. Claims that vaccines are less rigorously tested than other drugs are misleading just because of the lack of requirement for double-blind studies, due to the above ethical considerations I stated above and the examples I listed.4. I recognize that vaccines are subject to an exceptional level of scrutiny due to their wide use in healthy populations like children. The justification for expedited vaccine approval processes where applicable  is due to decades of data showing vaccines are one of the safest and most effective public health measures. Unlike cancer medications, vaccines protect healthy individuals from becoming ill in the first place, which carries different ethical and logistical considerations.Edit: formatting","title":"President elect Trump announces that Robert F Kennedy Jr will be the Secretary of HHS"},{"text":"There's crazy people on both sides folks","title":"Is Trump the Second Coming of Christ?"},{"text":"Thanks for not answering my question.

That's where the conspiracy is, I think - Did Raniere cause the overthrow in Libya because he got his jollies by controlling people and making them do crazy shit, or was he encouraged to do it by intelligence agencies/MIC and other deep state scum who had a LOT to gain by getting Gaddafi out of the way?","title":"NXIVM sex slave cult directly tied to overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya"},{"text":"Youre talking to partisan hacks.

Epstein](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/richard-epstein)?and Policy Fellow?[Tom Church](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/tom-church)?discuss the names advanced by president-elect Trump so far as he shapes a cabinet. They dwell on Trumps unconventional choices for secretary of defense, director of national intelligence, and attorney general. They also discuss the possibility Trump will use recess appointments to fill these roles.The duo also consider the elevation of South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who is being put up to head the Department of Homeland Security.\\\\ Richard A. Epstein: That's an awfully big job, and it's a job that I think should not go to somebody who's been a governor. Whether or not she killed the dog, I don't care about that. It's a huge branch of operation. She comes from a very small state. She doesn't have any foreign policy experience or dealing with this.So essentially, I think she's an able woman, but I am very skeptical that she is gonna be able to run this thing in the method in which it goes. And the reason it's extremely important is that whole operation has been a complete mess under Biden. And I think you have a better shot of getting it under control by having somebody who's been engaged in that particular area and can work better with it.So this is not an appointment that I would have made. There may be another place for her in the administration. It's not something which I'm gonna gnash my teeth about. But if I were asked whether or not I'd vote to confirm it, I'd have to think long and hard before I would say yes.And at the very least would wanna hear a fair amount about her to make sure that she can do it right.

Matt Gaetz pleaded guilty Monday to six federal charges and **agreed to cooperate with prosecutors** as part of a plea deal. Joel Greenberg, a longtime associate of Gaetzs, appeared in federal court in Orlando. He pleaded guilty to six of the nearly three dozen charges he faced, including sex trafficking of a minor, and he admitted that he had paid at least one underage girl to have sex with him and other men. Gaetz was not mentioned in the plea agreement or during the court hearing. But Greenbergs cooperation  as a key figure in the investigation and a close ally of Gaetzs  may escalate the potential legal and political liability that the firebrand Republican congressman is facing.That was 3 and a half years ago. Failure to cooperate means revoking the plea deal and more prison time.

Here is a breakdown:1. The Lawsuit Focused on Reporting Requirements, Not Vaccine Safety Testing. Key Quote:\\n\\"WHEREAS, on August 25, 2017, Informed Consent Action Network ('ICAN') submitted a Freedom of Information Act request... that sought the following records: Any and all reports transmitted to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate by the Secretary of HHS pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300aa-27(c).\\"\\nExplanation: The lawsuit sought records related to biennial reports required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. It did not challenge or allege the absence of safety data or testing of vaccines.2. The Absence of Reports Does Not Imply Absence of Safety Testing.\\nKey Quote:\\n\\"The Departments searches for records did not locate any records responsive to your request.\\"\\nExplanation: The absence of these reports does not mean vaccines lack rigorous safety testing. These reports were administrative requirements intended to summarize actions taken to ensure vaccine safety, not to replace or document actual safety testing.\\n3. Voluntary Dismissal and No Judgment on Vaccine Safety\\nKey Quote:\\n\\"That the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice... each side to bear its own costs, attorney fees, and expenses.\\"\\nExplanation: The case was voluntarily dismissed without a ruling on the underlying claims. There was no judicial finding against vaccine safety or testing.My main point: The lawsuit does not argue that vaccines are unsafe or untested; it simply highlights that HHS did not comply with the statutory requirement to report their vaccine safety actions to Congress.Additionally this suit was not \\"won\\" or \\"against Fauci\\" as you had mentioned in your original comment.

It's a made up restriction and in reality would be unworkable if actual Medicare for All became a thing, or at least would have dramatically less consequences than someone trying to throw a cultural spanner in the works might want.Simply put, a country with the apparatus to have Medicare cover all healthcare for its residents doesn't have a reliable mechanism to tease out singular, specific treatments out of spite.  Some doctors will pull that stunt, sure, but you will in all likelihood be able to find a doctor who can prescribe hormones or surgery piecemeal for comorbidities, and they're not trying to deal with the occult rituals required to get insurance to pay for something anymore.  Also, this would now be a country where people aren't being robbed of a great chunk of their paycheck just to have 'insurance' with a deductible running into the thousands of dollars every year.  On average, people would be healthier, wealthier and better catered to, diminishing the risk of certain things being inaccessible to them.

Canning that presidents do have the power to make recess appointments, but that they cannot do so during short Senate breaks or when the Senate holds pro forma sessions.

It is that ~~she~~ he was appointed *instead of someone much worse*. Those sorts of people are readily available within the repub orbit. A Bolton, or a Bannon, or a Nuland, or even a Cotton or a Scott, for example. He could have seriously **laid waste** with this appointment, if he truly let his inner nehilist run wild.One would think that the dems would understand this, since they don't believe in change at all, other than perhaps the tiniest possible incremental change, in the smallest possible baby steps. ~~She~~ He is incrementally better than many of the choices that I personally had feared, and brings some actual real-world competencies to the task. Therefore, I'm cautiously optimistic.Trump may be taking this time through more seriously than his first outing. Some, though not all, of his appointments do show a better use of *someone's* judgment, within the repub hall of horrors.I think that he's keeping his powder dry, to focus on getting his chosen chainsaw/blunt object in place as AG.

Lots of ding ding ding, bells a whistles and WARNINGS and constantly telling you things you should be afraid of.  You should watch Fox News with that mindset sometime, its 100% true.  It triggers the most fundamental core of the brain that doesn't get rational or logical thought.  It keeps the viewers in a constant state of fight or flight.  It stimulates the part of the brain where addictions live, and basic human functions, like breathing and shelter, eating food and is easily hijacked with the right combination of bells, whistles and fear. But also tries to make the viewer feel special for getting the inside information that nobody else has... exactly like a BONUS on a slot machine.My moms husband is kind of a moron.  A combination of strokes and old age has him at about a 50-60 IQ.  Barely able to tie his shoes type of moron. He doesn't realize that when he turns the TV on to find \\"the news\\", flips until he sees Fox News in the corner of the screen and stops, because it says \\"News\\", it must be news... 20 minutes later, he is absolutely furious about \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, and he has no idea how he got there.  Watching it unfold is truly sad.If you are always afraid of (whatever the fear topic of the day is) like schools having pediatric surgery centers in the nurses offices to give sex changes to children without parental consent... which is completely illogical and insane, but if you never use your frontal cortex where you get logic, reasoning and critical thinking, you get absolutely furious that they are hurting these children! and make all your decisions without rational thought.It's exactly how you get fucking Pizzagate, where a guy actually showed up to a pizza joint in Washington DC loaded to the teeth with guns to \\"free the children locked in cages in the basement getting their adrenochrome harvested by democrats\\" in a pizza joint that didn't even have a basement.Switch to like NPR or PBS, where they more methodically walk you through the issues, conclusions and facts surrounding the issues.

However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VAs direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization. Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap significant cost savings.The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nations administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy wants to start DOGE cuts by eliminating funding for unauthorized programs - including veteran healthcare"},{"text":"This is something I noticed, toothe guy with infamously bad health takes is the new Health and Human Services secretary, an infamously unhinged war hawk is the new Secretary of State, etc. It would almost be funny if this wasnt the new reality.","title":"Trump expected to select Robert F.

The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.\\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp)","title":"Trump blows through transition deadlines, sparking security concerns"},{"text":"How dare you assume he identifies as \\"HE\\".?","title":"What to know about Robert F.

Thats a bit of a surprise, since 2025 will be a major year for Americas tax system C in fact, the fate of the most significant tax reform in three decades hangs in the balance.**That would be the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Congress passed during President-elect Donald Trumps first term in office in 2017. If lawmakers dont take action, the whole package is set to expire at the end of next year. Western Governors University School of Business tax expert Jim Franklin explains what might be in store for the act, and for taxpayers.* [...]**Whats next for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act?** Currently, the act is set to expire at the end of 2025, but Trump and Republicans favor renewing many of its provisions. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in May 2024 estimated that extending the act would cost the government US$4.6 trillion, and theres a split within the party, with one bloc of congressional Republicans calling for a full extension and another asking for the balancing of tax policy and annual federal deficits. Republicans are likely to fight to keep key components in place, including the higher standard deduction, reduced corporate tax rates, individual rate cuts and an increased estate tax exemption. Theres even talk of lowering the corporate tax rate further, possibly to 15% for domestic production, which would be a significant move.**What other tax measures are Republicans considering?** Trump mentioned a variety of tax relief ideas on the campaign trail, including exempting tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay from income taxes, and creating an itemized deduction for auto loan interest. However, Republicans arent entirely unified on tax policy. Some deficit hawks are concerned about revenue losses, so there could be internal pushback on all these points. The real question is whether there will be enough opposition within the party to alter or block certain proposals. But I expect many parts of the act to be renewed, and we may see some additions. For example, theres been a lot of pressure around increasing the state and local tax deduction cap, also known as SALT, which has bipartisan support in states with higher state income taxes like New York, California and Illinois. It will be interesting to see if that gains any traction. Theres a lot of pressure among representatives, both Republicans and Democrats, to gain some relief in that area.**Where will they find revenue?** Good question. Observers are indicating that Republicans are likely to look at cutting green energy subsidies from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. These could be eliminated to help balance out the cost of their new tax proposals. Another area to watch is tariffs. Theres talk of raising tariffs on Chinese goods  potentially up to 60%  and even imposing a universal tariff on all U.S. imports at a 20% rate. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. Will it be more targeted? For example, will there be continued tariffs on select imports such as automotive imports from China to protect the U.S. electric vehicle market?**What will you be watching between now and Tax Day?** One factor will be Trumps cabinet appointments. Whoever he nominates for Treasury secretary, for instance, could have a big influence. They can help shape what the tax bill looks like. Another key factor will be who ends up on the congressional tax committees. The composition of key committees will affect the direction of policy and the specific details.**What do you think will happen with tariffs?** Tariffs are unpredictable: They could be applied broadly, or more selectively. It could be similar to the way that Trump and his first administration placed some tariffs on steel, aluminum and solar panels. Interestingly, many of the tariffs were retained by the Biden administration. Blanket tariffs could slow down the economy, so there is always a risk. Tariffs impact inflation because they affect the cost of imported goods, which would likely reduce consumers purchasing power. Domestic political pressure will play a role, as higher tariffs could raise prices on many goods that are imported, including essential products like medications.**Do you have advice for people struggling to keep up with the latest tax news?** Observers often take every policy suggestion on the campaign trail literally  exempting tips, Social Security benefits, overtime pay, etc.  as if all these proposals will pass exactly as stated. But the details matter, and policies are rarely implemented without adjustments.

Here are some common points of contention that are cited by his critics:1. Influence on Politics and Social Movements: Soros has contributed billions to various causes and organizations, particularly through his Open Society Foundations, which support initiatives related to human rights, social justice, and democratic governance. Many of these organizations have funded movements and politicians that are perceived by critics as left-leaning or progressive. For example, his support for liberal or progressive candidates in countries like the U.S., as well as movements like Black Lives Matter, has led to a perception among some that he is promoting a radical political agenda.\\n2. Market Speculation and Financial Crises: Soros made a substantial profit by shorting the British pound in 1992, contributing to what became known as \\"Black Wednesday.\\" His actions were seen by some as causing economic distress in the UK, leading to lasting criticism of his financial practices. Similar critiques are aimed at his other speculative activities, as he has occasionally invested against currencies or economies, which some argue destabilizes nations for personal gain.\\n3. Globalization and National Sovereignty: Soros advocates for open societies and opposes nationalism, which puts him at odds with groups that favor strong national sovereignty. His support for immigration, refugees, and globalized policies has made him a target for populist and nationalist groups who claim he is working to dilute national borders and undermine traditional values.\\n4. Conspiracy Theories and Anti-Semitism: Some of the criticism aimed at Soros is rooted in anti-Semitic stereotypes, especially theories that characterize him as a \\"puppet master\\" controlling global politics or as someone financing a \\"globalist agenda.\\" These ideas are often unsupported by credible evidence, but they continue to circulate on certain media outlets and online communities.\\n5. Funding of Controversial Organizations: Soros has been accused of backing organizations that promote social change in ways that are divisive. For instance, hes been accused of funding district attorneys in the U.S. who support criminal justice reforms that some opponents claim lead to increases in crime. These actions fuel concerns among critics that he is destabilizing societies under the guise of reform.Many accusations against Soros rely heavily on interpretations of his actions and motivations, as well as broader social and political disagreements. While some critiques focus on specific instances of his political involvement or financial activity, others lack credible evidence and can fall into conspiracy theory territory.\\"","title":"Musk admits to being the \\"George Soros of the right\\""},{"text":"is he going to be deported by Agenda47? and did I just get tricked into the racist indoctrination where I say things like \\"is he going to be deported\\"?

Trump settled without admitting wrongdoing.  \\n\\t?\\t1989: Central Park Five\\nTrump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty against five Black and Latino teenagers accused of assault in Central Park. They were later exonerated by DNA evidence, but Trump continued to maintain their guilt.  \\n\\t?\\t1991: Bankruptcy Filings\\nOver the years, Trumps businesses declared bankruptcy six times, primarily related to his casinos, starting in 1991. Critics claimed these filings allowed him to avoid debts without personal financial impact.  \\n\\t?\\t2005: Trump University\\nTrump University, a for-profit business that purportedly taught real estate investing, led to multiple lawsuits and a $25 million settlement in 2016, resolving fraud claims.  \\n\\t?\\t2005: Access Hollywood Tape\\nIn a tape released in 2016, Trump was heard making crude comments about women, claiming that he could grab them by the [genitals] due to his fame. The release led to significant public outcry.  2. 2016 Presidential Campaign Scandals. \\t?\\t2015: Comments on Mexican Immigrants\\nDuring his campaign announcement, Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, sparking widespread criticism.  \\n\\t?\\t2016: Trump Foundation The Trump Foundation, Trumps charitable organization, faced accusations of self-dealing and using funds for personal expenses. It was dissolved in 2018, and Trump agreed to pay $2 million in damages.  \\n\\t?\\t2016: Russian Interference U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia attempted to interfere in the election in Trumps favor. This led to investigations into his campaigns possible collusion with Russia, though Muellers report did not find conclusive evidence of criminal conspiracy.  \\n\\t?\\t2016: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal Payments Allegations surfaced that Trump directed his then-attorney Michael Cohen to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to prevent stories about alleged affairs from surfacing. Cohen later went to prison for campaign finance violations.  3. Presidency (2017C2021). \\t?\\t2017: Muslim Ban\\nTrumps executive order banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries was criticized as discriminatory and faced legal challenges. Eventually, a revised version was upheld by the Supreme Court.  \\n\\t?\\t2017: Charlottesville Remarks\\nFollowing a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump stated there were very fine people on both sides, which was widely condemned as equivocal on white supremacy.  \\n\\t?\\t2017: Comey Firing and Obstruction Allegations\\nTrump fired FBI Director James Comey, leading to accusations of obstruction of justice amid investigations into Russian election interference.  \\n\\t?\\t2018: Family Separation Policy\\nUnder Trumps zero tolerance immigration policy, thousands of migrant children were separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The policy drew strong criticism both domestically and internationally.  \\n\\t?\\t2019: Ukraine Call and First Impeachment\\nTrumps 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky led to an impeachment inquiry. Trump was accused of pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for military aid. The House impeached him, but he was acquitted by the Senate.  \\n\\t?\\t2020: COVID-19 Response\\nTrump faced widespread criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, downplaying the virus, and making statements contradicting health experts. He was criticized for minimizing the threat even as cases surged in the U.S.  \\n\\t?\\t2020: Lafayette Square Incident\\nIn June 2020, law enforcement forcibly cleared peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House, allowing Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo-op, which was widely criticized.  4. Post-2020 Election Scandals. \\t?\\t2020: Election Fraud Claims\\nFollowing the 2020 election, Trump claimed widespread fraud, leading to numerous lawsuits, all of which failed to overturn the results. His rhetoric fueled mistrust and led to the January 6 attack.  \\n\\t?\\t2021: January 6 Capitol Riot and Second Impeachment Trumps rhetoric about election fraud was seen as contributing to the violent attack on the Capitol by his supporters. The House impeached him for incitement of insurrection, but the Senate again acquitted him.  5. Post-Presidency (2021-Present).   \\t?\\t2021-2022: Mar-a-Lago Classified Documents\\nThe FBI recovered classified documents from Trumps Mar-a-Lago residence. He faced accusations of mishandling sensitive information, leading to investigations that continue.  \\n\\t?\\t2023: New York Criminal Charges\\nIn 2023, Trump was indicted on multiple charges, including alleged campaign finance violations related to hush-money payments. This marked the first time a former U.S. president faced criminal charges.  \\n\\t?\\t2023: Classified Documents and Federal Charges Trump faced additional federal charges for alleged mishandling of classified documents and obstruction. These are part of ongoing investigations and may lead to further legal consequences.  This is a high-level overview of many of the most prominent issues; there are additional accusations, controversies, and lawsuits throughout Trumps career, especially surrounding his businesses and post-presidential actions.","title":"Trump still hasnt signed ethics agreement required for presidential transition"},{"text":"No kidding.

Um, hello? You voted for this guy. We all went on and on for years about what he does and how he does things, and you all want to believe that we had some kind of \\"derangement syndrome\\". And frankly, for me, that's all I'm going to keep saying. Economy crashes? You voted for this guy. Your rights are being taken away? You voted for this guy. Things are a crazy mess? You voted for this guy. I won't say it to somebody that didn't vote for him, but also if I hear somebody tell me they decided to stay home that day, I'm just going to tell them that they voted for this guy, and they especially have no right to complain. There's no derangement syndrome here. Just a lot of people that are living in denial who so badly want the '50s or the '80s back that they are willing to sell their souls. I'm giving no sympathy to all of those people that voted for this guy and all the people that stayed home when their lives become worse in 4 years. And I'm not waxing hyperbole. We saw what he did in his previous 4 years, and anybody with real understanding of economics knows what he's going to bring, and it's not going to be cheaper gas, lower grocery prices, and high paying jobs aplenty. The only thing I have to tell to the opposition that had the brains not to vote for him is to spend the next 4 years not getting easily triggered by every stupid thing this guy says. Every time he says something controversial, that's when the Republican Congress tries to pass something that we will especially hate.

Once that fire started, they would be consumed along with him.But what does he care about not lighting matches to protect the existing order? Those people hate him and have tormented him for about a decade now, in just about every way conceivable.Investigations, along with the results of which he can then use to denounce and deep-six even AIPAC, along with it's people who've been foisted upon him if he so chooses, would undo them all utterly and probably for many decades to come, if preventative measures are put in place thereafter, which the public would not likely allow to go undone.It would also likely cause a monumental tsunami of retirements and resignations, because the jig would be up for such people.Again, anything they say or do after that, is sour grapes and bitterness, which will only further prove nefarious intent to the people.

Which is why most countries move away from presidential systems after their first dictatorship. Yeah, you read that correctly. Almost all countries with a presidential system, have fallen into a dictatorship.This is why the prime minister + parliament model is so popular among functional democracies. Most presidential democracies didn't survive into the 20th, let alone 21st century; without falling into a dictatorship at least once,  and indeed, besides the USA, pretty much all current extant presidential democracies are less than 120 years old with the exception of the USA.America is the oldest presidential democracy in history, and it looks like not even it will survive the rule that presidential democracies always fall into dictatorship eventually. Just so we all understand what I mean by  this ... \\"presidential system\\" is what the USA has, we are literally the *defining example* as the first government to ever even have a presidential system of government; so to be clear \\"presidential system\\" is like what we have currently in the USA, its a system of how we delegate power to the head of state. There are countries that have \\"presidents\\" as their official title but they do not operate under a \\"presidential system\\" of power distribution.There are also countries where they have a president where the role is a ceremonial , or has limited procedural powers and they are basically meant to act in the same role as a US vice president; or where the powers we think of as \\"presidential\\" are divided between the president and the prime minster.","title":"Trump still hasnt signed ethics agreement required for presidential transition"},{"text":"[Gaetz, who represents a mostly conservative district in Floridas panhandle, is known as a strident defender of former president Donald Trump.

Because of Trumps record. The years he hasnt been on the ballot the folks he endorses tend to do pretty badly, even if the Republican who beats them in a primary doesn't do as badly.The one thing he's never been able to do is deliver voters to Republicans in general.Even this year, Trump was on the ballot, and it's not clear how useful his voters were to Republicans.In the 7 swing states Trump won, 5 of them also had a senate seat on the line. 4 of those were won by Democrats.That's 100s of thousands of Trump for President voters that did fuck all for the Republicans in general.And even the one swing state senate seat Republicans won was by just 25,000 votes.The 4 seats the Republicans picked up were all in red states to start with.Republicans are obviously happy to ride his coat tails to power, but since he can't deliver those same voters when he's not on the ballot, they no longer have need for him.You have to find four Senate Republicans for whom thats trueCollins, Murkowski and newly elected Senator Curtis opposed Trump in 2024.  Mitch McConnell no longer seems like a huge fan either.

This may be why much of the internet is now controlled by commercial enterprises owned by the ruling classes.  This may also be why there are employees, and other various tools, used to propagate ideas favorable to the ruling classes via the internet and these commercial enterprises, while censoring ideas that are unfavorable to the ruling classes.Until we working class masses find a way to overcome this problem, the ideas of us working class masses will, to a large extent, continue to favor a ruling class minority, and therefore, to some extent, there will continue to be ill relations formed among us working classes; we will continue to see ourselves fragmented into different parts and pieces, resting on differing and opposing sides, rather than seeing our differing ideas, and different ways of doing things, all unfavorable to the ruling classes, as one of our greatest advantages.","title":"The Problem With Teaming Up With The Other Side Is That They Will Attempt To Use You To Advance Their Agenda"},{"text":"Islamophobic Trump claims making a comeback baby!","title":"Trump to universities: Stamp out antisemitism or lose accreditation"},{"text":"We wont have to pull out of NATO.

What could do all that? It'd have to be worse than aliens.

It would just be war, like the day after 9/11 we switched to freedom fries and rolled our sleeves up and rebuilt and sent Seal team 6. Aliens are like any other threat in that regard, they are over there and that place is in range. It would have to be so much worse than a simple threat or lie or existential horror like a planet zoo or farm or something. So it has to be downright nefarious. But also dangerous. I still believe that top officials are Americans and play for this team whoever it was that created this situation. So that implies it may have been for our own good. For example, maybe we are stalling the aliens while we reverse engineer tech, and it's not hidden from us per se, but from *them*, while we build an advantage. Then we literally couldn't have everyone on the internet discussing headlines about alien tech lmao. It would be a global security disaster that would cause global societal upheaval (since the aliens would be alerted and probably attack before we were ready, or something). In a nutshell, it must be pretty bad.

One is that they feel that they had better rideshare income in 2016 to 2020.  Well, part of that is just shifts in consumer behavior due to the pandemic inflation, which Trump owns helping create and Biden has helped fix.  And part of that is Uber trending towards lower rates for drivers rather than higher, which is beyond a POTUS but does highlight how the GOP's push for deregulation has really hurt contract workers like rideshare drivers.  For them not to recognize that shows a lack of critical thinking or connection to factual reality vs. feelings.The second is a general trend: these are likely lower info voters.  So much of their thoughts were borderline drivel and seemed more based in the same old misinformation about the economy as all the other low info voters.  Only one really touched on a culture war topic.So, yes, this proves yet again that voters who fell for misinformation and lacked critical thinking were a big part of the problem.  That doesn't tell us why Trump won on any policy level.  It tells us why the modern right-wing propaganda campaigns combined with populist demagoguery, even when composed of the most easily debunked lies, works on voters: they are not very smart and not well informed.","title":"Want to understand why Trump won in 2024?
