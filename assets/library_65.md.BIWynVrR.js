The only real power the federal government has in cases like this is withholding funding that the state relies on. For instance drinking age minimums are tied to highway budget for states. So if you lower your drinking age you lose out on billions of dollars. But for other things that are federally illegal like marijuana there is no federal promises tied to it so states can just ignore it. So if the Fed said \\"You can't give out free cookies anymore\\" but didn't tie any money to it, then the states could just ignore it. So basically the Fed would need to both pass the law that says \\"you can't give healthcare out\\" and then also tie to a rule of  \\"If you do you lose federal funding for something\\". In which case States could still mandate healthcare coverage at the state level, unless they could get all the states to agree to tie healthcare coverage restrictions to some funding, which is a tougher sell, because in red states it is unpopular to give power to the fed while in blue states it would be unpopular to ban healthcare.","title":"Blue states unite to resist federal pressure under Trump"},{"text":"Senate republicans: Hold my beer.","title":"Republicans keep control of the House of Representatives, NBC News projects"},{"text":"Fucking putting a RUSSIAN ASSET as the Director of National Intelligence.

In an interview with?7News, Tom Homan was asked about instances of people walking across the border from Canada, and how that compares to the situation at the southern border.\\nHoman responded by stating that after the current administration reallocated resources to deal with those coming in from Mexico, the agents left at the Canada-U.S. border are \\"overwhelmed,\\" and \\"overrun.\\" [...] According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), nearly 24,000 encounters with migrants were recorded between posts on the Canada-U.S. border between October 2023 and September 2024, which is a significant surge compared to 916 encounters during that same period in 2021. U.S. border officials refer to an encounter as someone who is inadmissible to the U.S., or when border patrol officers find someone who has illegally crossed the border into the U.S. between border posts.# Canada concerned over U.S. asylum surge Miller and Homan's comments come as Canada is bracing for a potential new surge of asylum claims coming from the U.S. to Canada, as a result of Trump's vow to send millions of undocumented immigrants back to \\"their country of origin.\\" Within days Trump's re-election, the RCMP confirmed it was \\"on high alert\\" and prepared contingency plans for all outcomes, including a potential huge influx of asylum seekers crossing the border ahead of Trump's inauguration. The plan includes deploying?more RCMP officers along the border, buying or renting space to temporarily hold migrants, purchasing more police vehicles, and leaning on resources from other provinces as they did following the 2016 election. Though, this planning comes amid understaffing concerns from the union representing front-line customs and immigration officers at Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\\nThe Customs and Immigration Union (CIU) has said it would need between 2,000 and 3,000 additional officers in order to effectively do their job. [...] During Trump's first term a wave of asylum seekers began entering Canada illegally, utilizing a loophole in the Safe Third Country Agreement that required people to claim asylum in whichever country they came to first. At the time, Trudeau publicly declared that those \\"fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war,\\" would be welcome in Canada. However, in recent years the Canadian government has begun taking a more restrictive approach to immigration. Last year, in conjunction with U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Canada, the two administrations modified the Safe Third Country Agreement and closed what had been a much-used?crossing at Roxham Road in Quebec. ? This fall, Trudeau announced a major cut to?Canada's immigration targets.? Miller said he expects the U.S. to continue to abide by the Safe Third Country Agreement to manage the flow of migrants. \\"It is in the national interest of both countries to make sure that that we have managed flows of migration,\\" Miller said. \\"And it's something we have to constantly, continuously strive to make, and get right.\\"!ping Can&amp;Immigration","title":"The Canadian border is an 'extreme vulnerability,' says Trump's pick; Miller predicts 'tough' talks"},{"text":"Id put the chances of confirmation hearings even happening solidly below 50%.","title":"Trump taps Rep.

Large tariffs, reckless spending on tax cuts and deportations, likely cuts to the safety net and potentially healthcare... hard to say exactly what's coming policy-wise but it doesn't look good for the economy.","title":"Biden leaves Trump a booming economy, with almost no unemployment and inflation under control"},{"text":"No I enjoyed how she destroyed Kamala in the 2019 debate","title":"Trump taps Tulsi Gabbard to head national intelligence; GOP retains House"},{"text":"That was the implication.","title":"Brandon Herrera For Director of The ATF."},{"text":"On June 23, 2021, Gaetz tweeted that the FBI should be defunded while it is investigating him for alleged sex trafficking and having sex with a minor.

I am not asking about a theoretical interpretation of the law and what's illegal and what's not. Ok, so Trump establishes some weird \\"war council\\" of retired senior military members who have authority to make recommendations on relieving generals of command who don't demonstrate leadership or whatever.   Like I said, I'm not pretending it doesn't move the needle. The next time Trump wants to call up the military to suppress a major protest, maybe they don't refuse and you end up with soldiers in the Street. The last time that happened was 1992, but it could happen.   The Normal ROE for soldiers is WAY more restrictive than cops, but maybe even he tells them to shoot and no one stands up to them and we end up with a Kent State incident where protesters are shot by the US military.    That alone would echo for months. OP is positing something that is a whole order of magnitude different.  That Trump is simply going to order the military to go to the California governor's mansion, arrest Gavin Newsom, and take over the government of the state of California simply because he doesn't like Gavin Newsom. I stand by my prediction that's not going to happen.  If he did issue that order, it would probably be ignored.  If he forced the issue, it would probably involve relieving a whole chain of command until he got to someone who would do it, and it would split the US military right down the middle. Unless there's a huge backstory for justification and we've been in a constitutional crisis for months,  It would be a fort sumpter moment signaling the beginning of a shooting war.Sitting here today, that's a fantasy.","title":"Democratic Governors Form a Group to Oppose the Trump Administration"},{"text":"Even a femtometer","title":"BREAKING: John Thune picked as new Senate majority leader"},{"text":"Of course he did","title":"Donald Trumps push to veto Starmers Chagos Islands deal"},{"text":"We are clearly not getting the full story.","title":"Republican John Thune of South Dakota is elected the next Senate majority leader"},{"text":"It really sucks that the R(enegade) majority congress won't grow a backbone when Trump goes really off the rails and impeach him.

Not even most people who voted for Trump are MAGA loons. They're Republicans. And even a few Rubios and Thunes in the right places could serve as potential bulwarks against some true lunacy. As will public approval ratings, as those Trump-voting Republicans continue to Google, \\"How can I change my vote?\\"\\n* Republican legislative majorities don't tend to get a lot done, as a rule.

This has, in fact, been a clear and enumerated role of the Federal Government since Reconstruction. You merely call out Federal protection of the 2nd Amendment as a Big Government regulatory regime, and a violation of Federalism.But under Federalism, the Federal Government has certain roles, and this is one. If you want to go back to the Articles of Confederation, you can make that argument. But you didn't. It's also worth noting that the Bill of Rights was a product of the Antifederalists who demanded that these rights be enumerated in order to consider the Federal system. In light of the status quo in which we live, you are merely calling out gun rights as not really rights in the way that those other rights are.

There were three pillars of the ACA originally. The mandate, the subsidies, and the protections. You need all three to have a functioning system at an affordable cost. The mandate got killed. We have been living with a somewhat maimed ACA since then that is better than the prior system, but has the weakness of being exposed to a death spiral if subsidies are not sufficient to keep the risk pool large enough. If the subsidies are removed then a blue state trying to enforce the protections alone is not going to be able to maintain a healthy system. Here is how those protections worked in blue states before the ACA. The protections raise the cost of insurance, which means less people buy insurance each year. The people leaving are the healthy ones. The remaining people are those that need the protections and have high medical expenses. This makes costs increase even more, causing fewer healthy people to buy insurance next year. This is the death spiral. That is why more states didnt do it themselves. They would need to recreate the subsidies and/or mandate to do it properly, and it is much harder for a single state to manage that.","title":"Blue states unite to resist federal pressure under Trump"},{"text":"When the republicans can't get enough votes to do something they'll come to the Dems to assist, then blame them.","title":"Republicans win the House, NBC News projects, as Trump's party takes full control of Washington"},{"text":"Thoughts and prayers","title":"Mike Pence is literally praying that Trump doesnt pardon the Jan 6 rioters | The Independent"},{"text":"Its already started?

Rather, he articulated that they are setting up this group to create policies to protect their states prerogatives and remain vigilant.The Insurrection act allows military to be called up for law enforcement duties in times of extreme civil disorder. Eisenhower did it during some civil rights protests. George HW Bush did it during the Rodney King riots in southern california. George W bush considered it in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina but declined because the Louisiana governor had not requested it. Trump wanted to do it during the George Floyd protests in Washington DC but the military refused stating they could not do so unless requested by the DC government.  I can see that guardrail being gone and the military going along with it if he wants to call them up to quell a protest. I have a lot more difficulty concocting any circumstances where the president could possibly call up the military and tell them to Simply subjugate a state for failing to follow his policies. If that happens, basically all bets are off because we are on the verge of a shooting civil war.","title":"Democratic Governors Form a Group to Oppose the Trump Administration"},{"text":"Yeah, we don't talk about Bruno","title":"Left-wing conspiracy theorists are saying Trump stole the election with help from Elon's Starlink satellites"},{"text":"Perfect choice,  since they intend to shut down unnecessary agencies why not go out with a bang.","title":"Hogan among top picks to head Department of Education, says source close to Trump Admin"},{"text":"They do not understand economics otherwise they wouldnt vote for someone that has one plan for economy- tariffs ahahahahaha","title":"\\"Trump will stop inflation!\\""},{"text":"Damn.

One of your links cites Stephen Spoonamore's \\"Statement About Hacking Voting Machines\\". It opens with this statement,  \\n  \\nThe Tabulation Systems at the County level were hacked far in advance of the election. The hack was **probably** written into the code even before the code was installed.  \\n  \\nElsewhere he states,  \\n**Perhaps** 300-500 tabulators\\".    \\n  \\nUsing words like \\"probably\\" and \\"perhaps\\" indicate the author just doesn't know, he is guessing. Same type of language used by the lunatics Kari Lake and Trump. If Spoonamore had actual facts, his statements would be definitive. Such as, \\"Firmware version 3.1.7.941a, dated 2023/07/24 behaves in this manner\\" etc.  \\n  \\nThe author does not cite specific machines. If he had actual evidence, he'd make definitive statements like, \\"Smartmatic Model X79i does this suspicious thing, and that thing is repeatable when run between these dates\\".  \\n  \\nFurther analyzing his language, using this sentence,  \\n  \\nprobably written into the code^1 even before the code^2 was installed.  \\n  \\nThe above sentence tells me he is clueless. If he knew what he was talking about, he would know the code^1 most definitely *would have had to be written* and compiled before installation. Second, he would not have used the term code^2, he would have used the correct term *Firmware*. I design complex software systems for a living. Been doing it since the 1970s and still work 40 hours a week at it. So I have a little expertise in this matter. Here are a few more clues this guy is off base.  \\n  \\nSoftware used to run machines will be written as firmware. Firmware is mostly written in C or C++, which have no \`IF/THEN \` functions. Instead, C languages use \`if/else\` functions, all lower case not upper. He also tells us this hack uses a \`WHEN\` function. There is no such function in C or C++ used for timing nor branching logic. Other than sql query language, I've never seen a \`WHEN\` function in a Firmware language.  \\n  \\nThird, and this is the biggest tell this guy is nonsense, the results of elections are audited: including up to a full audit at the county boundaries if required. In PA as in most other states, it is actually written into law audits must be done. So until Gov Shapiro states otherwise, I'll trust the 2024 election was secure rather than a bunch of randos; randos who don't even understand computer languages they claim to master, to describe a hack that never existed.","title":"Top Pick To Be Trump's National Intelligence Director Is Former Democrat: Report"},{"text":"Im really sorry.

Consequently, there is a shipping problem in America. That has driven up transport costs and added snags and delays to internal manufacturing and commercial supply lines, making American commerce and industry less efficient - a drag on the economy as a whole. Trump as promised to increase these tariffs and others on items critical for building out manufacturing capacity of which America has a shortage. Should be fun to watch.

Thats especially difficult in Silicon Valley, where startup stocks are illiquid and sometimes prohibit secondary market sales.And venture capital funds, where many of Trumps tech backers work, usually include provisions that require key partners to remain involved in the funds work or risk triggering provisions that put major limits on its operations.Those complications have pushed some tech luminaries toward advisory roles that operate outside the government, but can have less power.Last week, the venture capital world was buzzing about Trae Stephens, a partner at the Founders Fund and chairman of defense tech firm Anduril Industries, being considered for a senior role at the Defense Department, according to three people familiar with the matter.But earlier this week, it appeared less likely that Stephens would serve inside the government, and might instead be added to a civilian advisory board that counsels the Secretary of Defense.Its unclear why Stephens potential position changed, but one person familiar with the matter cited his investments as a factor. Through a spokesperson, Stephens declined to comment.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/11/13/2024/ethics-rules-pose-obstacles-to-trumps-silicon-valley-backers-joining-government?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Ethics rules pose obstacles to Trumps Silicon Valley backers joining government"},{"text":"it's incredibly processed food, which is generally not good to have too much of for a variety of reasons","title":"R.F.K.
