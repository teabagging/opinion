After the riot over 1,000 people have been arrested as a result of the riot. But I can't find a single instance of a police officer being hospitalized while carrying out a January 6th arrest.

It goes back to the conversation on masculine fragility.  Guys get told that having sex is how you 'become a man', and when that doesn't happen, they feel inadequate...and they feel the need to show their masculinity in other, toxic ways.  There's a lot I could say on why these guys aren't having success, but if they're getting deep into the right-wing hole, I don't think that's helping their chances with women.  Women generally like to feel respected by their partners.There are politicians who fill all the masculine molds you could ask - we've got guys like Fetterman if you want an example of the traditional manly-man vibe, we've got Tim Walz if you want tough but tender, there's Maxwell Alejandro Frost who's a great example of how young men can make a difference, there's Andy Kim if you like the nerdy vibe...point is, we've got lots of great male role models.  For men of all types.  If you go beyond politics into the larger culture, there's lots more.To me, the big question is why those guys don't get held up as the example of masculinity, and we have to hear about how Harris should have gone on Joe Rogan instead.  That's the question we've got to answer.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 1, 2024"},{"text":"The party of law and order my ass.","title":"GOP Sen.

This case originated in North Carolina (where I live, the poster child for gerrymandering) and was over the legitimacy of the Independent State Legislature Theory (or ISL). In many states, the state legislature cannot redraw district lines without oversight from the state Supreme Court (checks and balances). This was a problem for North Carolina Republicans since they had the votes in the state assembly to redraw districts *but* the state's Supreme Court was evenly split R to D - so the SC kept rejecting the proposed, gerrymandered maps.To give the US Supreme Court some credit, they rejected the ISL 6-3 and stated that the Elections Clause did not give state legislatures unchecked authority over federal elections. This was great news for NC and other states dealing with gerrymandering.The problem is that two dem NC SC justices were up for re-election the previous year during the 2022 midterms and NC voted to replace them with Republicans (a popular vote!). With the new majority in the state court, they approved the gerrymandered maps. This is a great reason to motivate people to vote during midterms Most of these redistricting laws are decided at the state level.The US SC could indeed pass *federal* protections to prevent gerrymandering, but they at least decided against the ISL, which would have made gerrymandering a lot worse.","title":"How Republicans held the House: It's the gerrymander, stupid"},{"text":"History is great reference but that feels like a pretty big leap.

There's no easy way to deport tens of millions of people in such a divided country in just 4 years.

Implying that you could wake up one day and see soldiers collecting your family is scary enough to make at least some illegal aliens decide that it's not worth it and decide to move out of the US before that happens. 2) Military involvement doesn't necessarily mean having soldiers go door-to-door. It might imply a few different things. For instance, maybe the military having soldiers guard the US border (which to me, makes more sense than guarding the borders of other countries) would free up existing government immigration resources to deport criminals, process legitimate asylum claims faster, and speed up the process for people doing things legally. Also, the military has access to lots of resources and can assist by ensuring that any people being transported or held awaiting legal proceedings, can have full access to food, water, shelter, security, and medical care.","title":"CMV: The Incoming Trump Administration Does Not Have the Resources To Implement Mass Deportations."},{"text":"Bill Clinton never got a majority of the popular vote either.

We saw having nothing, giving things up, sacrificing, and suffering as virtuous.

Just look to Hungary. Soft fascism and kleptocracy is the US's future.The similarities between the American and Hungarian leaders are hard to miss. Trump, like Orbn, is personally disdainful of constraints on his power and the free press. Trump, like Orbn, has built his political career around anti-immigrant populism. Trump, like Orbn, has bent the powers of state toward personal enrichment  and allowed his top officials to do the same.When Hungarians found out I was American, many of them almost immediately pointed out the similarities between the two men. Several Hungarians told me, with an air of quiet sympathy, that they understood what we in the United States are currently going through.Trump and Orbn are lovely guys, Istvn Jnos Tth, the director of Budapests Corruption Research Center, said sarcastically. They [both] try to destroy the rule of law and institutions and the certainty of their citizens.Yet I cant shake the memory of that meeting with Zsuzsanna Szelnyi, the just-retired legislator. This is a woman who got her start in politics challenging an openly authoritarian regime, risking arrest and imprisonment in the name of democracy. She spent years afterward working to make the transition to democracy function, to turn the vision she had risked her freedom for into a reality. And now shes giving up her perch in government because, in her words, it doesnt really matter what you do in the legislature.Her trajectory tells the story of how a true believer in democracy can be defeated not by force of law but through exhaustion: a collapse of any faith in working through the system after years of fruitless struggle.Hungary is not the only country where people  even the best ones, like Szelnyi  can be ground down like this. If this new kind of fascism continues its march, it may require a new movement, a new generation of activists, to take up the fight.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trumpThe US is entering a stage of two to three decades of authoritarianism.

Tatiana was a daughter of Czar Nicholas, the last of the Monarchy in Russia. He abdicated his thrown in the early 1900s due to Bolshevik rebellion. After which, he and his family were killed in Bolshevik captivity. The Bolsheviks were responsible for Soviet Union/Russian communism through the 20th century. So, if one of the children (Tatiana) was not actually killed on that day that everyone was murdered, then her descendant would be the true last Romanov and royal bloodline descendant. Melania and Barron both. In a meeting with Putin few years ago he gives Trump a soccer ball. Weird gift right? Do Putin or Trump particularly like soccer? Putin said \\"The ball is now in your court\\". Even weirder, when Trump gets the ball he says he's going to give it to Melania and tosses it to her as she's in the crowd. Why would Melania want a soccer ball from Russia? Of note, a soccer ball is also a futbol. In the US, the nuke codes are stored in the \\"nuclear football\\".

It's an important conversation to have, but it's not entirely the most SFW one.   \\n  \\nYoung lonely men aren't getting laid. Unless they hire someone, there's no quick and easy solution to the problem and certainly none with guaranteed success. As such, they gravitate toward those who give them easy answers and blame others for their issues. Some of them will always want to choose the easy answer that avoids responsibility. Those tend to just end up hurting their chances even more by becoming insufferable. Even for those not in that camp, there still isn't an easy way out for them. Tim Miller from the Bulwark suggested Zelensky as a male role model, but unfortunately, it's just easier to jump on the hate train for people like him. Less thinking involved, more rage at everyone else. I'd offer Fetterman and  Ruben Gallego as other potential male role models (skipping Walz cause he looks a bit too old to appeal to younger dudes). However, the key issue remains. It's just way easier to not think, rage, and blame others. We should still try to offer healthier male role models, but it's always going to be an uphill battle against our (or at least men's) base instincts.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 1, 2024"},{"text":"Okay?

Anyways, just doing that would very clearly violate due process. Unless they do go full suspend the constitution mode, this shit aint happening.Edited response to a now deleted question: why doesnt mexico keep the illegal immigrants if theyre so good: First off, the immigrants arent fleeing to get to Mexico, any that do would already be staying there Secondly, do you think the situation in Mexico is the same as it is here? Mexico has no place for them economically. The US does. Our current unemployment rate is arguably too low, and the jobs these immigrants occupy largely wouldnt even exist if they werent here to fill them. Anyone saying we should literally infinitely open the border (though I cant ever find any of these people) is obviously a moron, but anyone saying we have a serious issue with the current number of immigrants in the country is either propagandizing or has been on the receiving end of too much propaganda. What we need right now is increased resourcing so we can enforce immigration policy properly to curb the flow of abuse of our asylum process which is over capacity. A bill was put together to help with that issue and start getting asylum applications processed by increasing the resourcing available, but Donald Trump killed that so he could run on the issue politically. We dont need mass deportations, we need control of our borders again. At present, the only real immigration issue we actually face is the capacity of the asylum process and/or asylum reform so we can get immigration under control again. A wall literally does nothing here. But Donald Trump only wanted to run on bullshit fear-mongering so he blocked any attempt to actually try and address the real issue so he could keep pretending the issue was something else.","title":"CMV: The Incoming Trump Administration Does Not Have the Resources To Implement Mass Deportations."},{"text":"Trump is pure trash.

I'm talking about this from a story standpoint. Because no story can go on forever, eventually it has to end. And the story of the back and forth between Trump, Biden, Trump doesn't make sense. The pendulum swinging needs to stop to finish the storyThe one important thing about conspiracy theories is the end goal, not just what the globalists do in pattern while the events happenSo what would be the end goal of staging a Trump defeat only to have a Trump victory after?Arguably the Democrats and the leftist policies and culture, in hindsight, would have been in a much better position had they not cheated for Biden to win, because all this did was create a momentum for serious backlash and a hard-right push in politics and culture. Had they let Trump have his consecutive 2nd term, I feel they would have had time to field better candidates for 2028 and take back everything in a massive wave, and initiate the one world government plans in earnestThe pendulum eventually needs to stop swinging, as the globalists/illuminati need to eventually get their plan for one world government into action.

We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, wrote Justice Stephen Breyer. But five justices  the four liberals, and Justice Anthony Kennedy  decided to reject those broader challenges to the presidents recess appointment power, and affirm recent historical practice as constitutional. The Constitution empowers the President to fill any existing vacancy during any recess, Breyer wrote, of sufficient length.Yet four conservative justices  John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Sam Alito  wrote that they would have gone much further, and sided with both of the above critiques. Scalias writes that its clear from the Constitutions text and structure that recess appointments were only meant to be used to fill vacancies that just open up between two formal sessions of Congress. In his view, the hundreds of recent recess appointments filling preexisting vacancies in the middle of a Congressional session were all unconstitutional. The majority casts aside the plain, original meaning of the constitutional text in deference to late-arising historical practices that are ambiguous at best, he wrote. Breyer responded that Justice Scalia would render illegitimate thousands of recess appointments reaching all the way back to the founding era, and that he himself was hesitant to disturb centuries of history.But we all know that there are different rules applied when it's a Republican president.","title":"Why does the Senate confirm Trumps picks for key posts  and how?

More than likely, also blurring the lines of love and sex being the same thing which they are not. Robin Thicke has not aged like fine wine and \\"Blurred Lines\\" is potentially the 2010s own version of \\"Baby it's Cold Outside.\\"Me Too began as a justice reform. It was a reaction to the culture of harassment, date rape and abuse suffered by women throughout the 20th and 21st century. Me Too is likely one of the main sources of the breakdown of modern romance or at least the sensationalism of it. The love story ends, and confusion sets in. Distorted romance and narcissism can result in dangerous consequences for people who can not and refuse to accept rejection. I believe life sometimes imitates art instead of the other way around. For the majority of people who were born and grew up in the 20th and early 21st century, romance was an ideal. A woman playing hard to get was a challenge, not a rejection.For Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Diddy and I'd throw Trump in the same category. Romance doesn't exist. Women are a prize for their success, an extension of their narcissism. The idea that they could even be rejected is impossible.What further complicates Me Too is the usefulness of its ability to be misused and potentially weaponized. Some men can be taken down effortlessly with allegations alone while others may be permanently immune and perhaps even gain more power and influence if they can successfully run a campaign of denying any such misconduct ever occurring. The justice reform of the Me Too movement is far from perfect and those criticisms may run the risk of further dividing gender conflicts.","title":"How Our Messed-Up Dating Culture Leads to Loneliness, Anger and Donald Trump"},{"text":"Nah underqualified.

Second, Trump is promising to declare a national emergency on day 1, and activate/federalize the National Guard. That pretty much eliminates the Posse Comatatus Act, allowing federal troops to enforce the law. And there's quite a few states that are absolutely willing to do just that. Will it be well organized? Of course not. Trump doesn't tend to think two steps down the road, let alone about logistics on a scale like this. But, based on the previous policy stripping children from parents and locking them in warehouses on concrete floors without beds or toilets behind chain link fences, all without record-keeping of any kind, that's the expectation. They don't *care* what happens. They want the show.Will people flock to the secret police? Not a lot, but enough to cause havoc. Will there be bloodshed? In all honesty, that's probably what the Magats **WANT.** They are probably hoping for a high profile arrest of an official and/or shooting into a crowd. Remember, Trump *wanted* the military to open fire on George Floyd protesters. He WANTED American soldiers to open fire on peaceful protesters. Now, with SCOTUS giving him blanket immunity for \\"official acts,\\" there's no guardrails on him at all. This is about terror and intimidation as much as it's about deporting immigrants. And, in all likelihood, the sweeps are going to catch a lot of citizens and documented immigrants. But, due to the lack of organization and due process, they'll all be put in the same place, without legal recourse. Because State of Emergency and presidential immunity.

Heres what they hope he delivers."},{"text":"Here are several examples of actions taken by Donald Trump and his administration that were seen as challenging or bypassing traditional norms, processes, or constitutional interpretations in the United States:1. Ignoring Congressional OversightImpeachment Refusal: During the impeachment investigations, the Trump administration refused to comply with subpoenas, withheld documents, and blocked witnesses from testifying, challenging Congress's oversight authority.Emergency Declarations for Wall Funding: Declared a national emergency to redirect military funds for border wall construction after Congress explicitly refused to allocate sufficient funds.\\n2. Pardons and CommutationsPolitically Motivated Pardons: Used the pardon power in ways perceived as circumventing justice norms, such as pardoning allies like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort. These actions were criticized as undermining the judicial system and potentially obstructing investigations into Trump's own actions.\\n3. Undermining Electoral ProcessesPressuring State Officials: Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election included pressuring Georgia officials to \\"find\\" votes and encouraging state legislatures to appoint alternate electors, challenging constitutional norms for the peaceful transfer of power.January 6th Insurrection: Critics argue that Trump's rhetoric and actions before and during the Capitol riot incited an attack on the constitutional process of certifying the electoral college results.\\n4. Challenging Judicial IndependencePublic Attacks on Judges: Trump repeatedly attacked judges who ruled against him, undermining judicial independence by questioning their legitimacy based on ethnicity, perceived bias, or political decisions.Defying Court Orders: In some cases, the administration delayed or outright defied court orders, particularly in immigration-related cases.\\n5. Using the Presidency for Personal GainEmoluments Clause Violations: Critics argue Trump profited from the presidency by allowing foreign and domestic officials to stay at his properties, which may have violated the Constitutions Emoluments Clause.Redirecting Official Business: Pushed to host the G7 Summit at his Doral property, a decision reversed after public outcry.\\n6. Weaponization of Federal AgenciesDOJ Interference: Critics allege Trump attempted to use the Department of Justice as his personal legal team, such as directing the DOJ to protect his interests in lawsuits or to investigate political opponents.Firing Inspectors General: Removed several independent inspectors general without clear justification, undermining accountability mechanisms.\\n7. Treating Executive Orders as Legislative ActsLegislating Through Executive Orders: Trump frequently used executive orders to enact policies when Congress did not act, such as changes to immigration policy (e.g., the \\"Muslim ban\\"), which courts partially blocked for exceeding executive authority.\\n8. Manipulating the CensusCitizenship Question: Pushed to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, which was blocked by the Supreme Court for being improperly justified. Critics argued it was designed to suppress minority representation.\\n9. Withholding Aid for Political ReasonsUkraine Scandal: Withheld congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine to pressure its government into announcing an investigation into Joe Biden, which became the basis for Trumps first impeachment.\\n10. Ignoring Established Ethical StandardsNepotism and Conflicts of Interest: Appointed family members (Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner) to senior advisory roles, a practice traditionally avoided due to nepotism laws and conflict-of-interest concerns.Refusing to Divest Businesses: Maintained control of his business empire, breaking with the practice of placing assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest.\\nConstitutional ContextWhile the Constitution sets limits, it relies on enforcement through checks and balances, public accountability, and norms. Actions like refusing subpoenas, undermining oversight, or pressuring state officials often exploit gray areas where explicit prohibitions or enforcement mechanisms are absent.This demonstrates that while there may not be a formal \\"process\\" to bypass the Constitution, there are numerous examples of pushing its boundaries when checks (like Congress or courts) fail to act effectively or when political will isn't strong enough to enforce accountability.","title":"Recess appointments could put Trump at odds with conservatives on the Supreme Court"},{"text":"First case makes it in front of the Supreme Court, they rule he is the President and can do whatever he wants as it is an official act and it is on Congress to stop him.

Some states like MA are impossible to give Republicans more seats because of their low numbers and sparse distribution anyway, but at least in theory they get a fair shot. You go north to New Hampshire and you see how Republicans hold a narrow majority thanks to their State Court allowing partisan gerrymanders and the large size of their State House for such a sparsely populated state lets them draw convoluted maps where they literally drew lines around a couple houses on on a few streets here and there and that was enough to change the partisan makeup. I'd personally prefer proportional representation. X percent of votes equals roughly X percent of the seats. Especially since it's a load of bullshit that you can represent any district without even having to live in it as long as you live in that state. Republicans don't play fair. States like UT and OK are overwhelmingly safe bets for Republicans but they still carved up Salt Lake City into each district and OK somehow got OKC and most of Tulsa into each of their districts. A more proportional system along with expanding the House (which is long overdue) would give us proper representation.","title":"How Republicans held the House: It's the gerrymander, stupid"},{"text":"Biden will 100% go down as the worst president in US history","title":"Biden exits at all-time low, Trump in with highest approval"},{"text":"You are correct.

They went for Trump because they have reason to be scared for their own personal saftey, not because they have all suddenly turned into facist assholes.

Human trafficking is now the worlds larges criminal enterprise, we quit dissing our rural population, and help them do something about their failing communities. Otherwise, the democratic party will continue to lose, and the rural populations will vote for anyone willing to help, including someone like Trump, because it beats selling your daughters to the traffickers.It's going to take more than rural broadband and improved infrastructure.

This was a few years after the last partition, when Russia, Prussia and Austria divided the remains of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth among themselves, effectively liquidating the state. It was fortunate that these 3 monarchies were Napoleon's enemies. Later, during the great conquests of the then Emperor Bonaparte, he granted the Poles an autonomous state called the Duchy of Warsaw. Eventually, as we know, Napoleon lost and the Poles were again subjugated by the three partitioners, and the remnants of Napoleon's Polish troops ended up in Haiti to help put down the slave uprising there (which emerged victorious). Poland had to wait another hundred years for independence, until the Great War of 1914-1918 overthrew the old monarchies. Liberalism and leftism in the world today are in a huge crisis, but one must continue to resist and, above all, not let the ideas die. Ultimately, the new right wing in the style of Putin or Orban wants to kill liberalism and the left (which they openly talk about and which is almost succeeding in Russia), so that there is no alternative to aggressive conservatism. And just as the Poles resisted attempts at depolonisation in the 19th century, the idea of human rights, freedom and non-discrimination must now be resisted and defended. One day the new right-wing order will cease to be new, it too will be exhausted, and then this void will have to be filled.Difficult times lie ahead, but better times may follow....","title":"Were still in this fight: the resistance to Trump considers its options after bruising election defeat"},{"text":"You called it correctly. https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/politics/video/donald-trump-kash-patel-fbi-director-retributions-digvid?cid=ios_app","title":"Trump Names Loyalist Kash Patel To Serve As FBI Director"},{"text":"They misspelled \\"crazy people\\".","title":"Trump picks anti-deep state crusader Kash Patel to lead FBI"},{"text":"This is why he is tanking the economy so Americans try to move to Mexico for the socialized medicine, affordable rent and factory jobs so Mexico builds the wall to keep Americans out and he can finally say they paid for it.","title":"What happened to Trumps border wall?

The book of Jubilees claims that when these hybrids died their souls had nowhere to go as they were an abomination, so their spirits remained on earth and tormented mankind (demons).

Biden no longer needed MSM after SC and was free to swing to policies more popular than what MSM would have everyone believe.Biden did the same thing the first half of Jan. 2021. Once Trump had been swatted down Biden was free to swing left again. WaPo was furious Biden had played them like a Vegas poker chip.

They provide a framework for laws, economy, and social services that benefit all citizens, regardless of their background. Dismissing borders entirely could lead to chaos and undermine the very systems that protect and support diverse communities today. Acknowledging the contributions of black slaves, their descendants, and other marginalized groups is crucial but the country is now a melting pot of various cultures and ethnicities, and modern governance should strive to represent and protect all its citizens fairly. Regarding political resistance, its essential for leaders to use lawful and democratic means to oppose policies they disagree with. Resorting to unlawful methods could undermine their legitimacy and the democratic principles they aim to uphold.

Liberals just got pigheaded and assumed they were a supermajority when they were only 51%. For all the talk of compromise, liberals never compromised with the left even once. And no the ACA is not a compromise. Medicare for all was the compromise. The left position is full nationalization of healthcare and destruction of the health insurance industrial complex. Medicare for all public option was the compromise and neolibs nuked it.It's the same story over and over. We as a country have an issue, liberals offer a conservative solution and leftists *already have a radical solution they've wanted for years*. So leftists in good faith offer a compromise between the two. Then liberals at the finish-line nuke the compromise and do the conservative option anyways. Of course the left was going to abandon the party. Liberals never work with the left in good faith.","title":"Were still in this fight: the resistance to Trump considers its options after bruising election defeat"},{"text":"You have to be a bit careful with comparing popular votes to seats when gerrymandering is involved, as gerrymandering often results in uneven voter turnouts.For example, \\"packing\\" is one of the key methods of gerrymandering; say you have a region that is a 3/2 split between parties A and B, and want to split it into 5 districts. You take two of the three A groups and give them their own district each, and split the remaining 1 of A evenly between the remaining 3 districts. A wins districts 1 and 2 with 90% of the vote, you win the remaining 3 with 60% of the vote. Giving you a 60% of seats on 40% of the vote.Because you know you're not going to win those two seats anyway, you don't even bother standing candidates there (not worth the money or effort). Because you're not standing a candidate, the other side doesn't need to campaign much either, so voter turnout ends up being really low (because the result is a foregone conclusion).So overall, because of the low turnout in the districts you are simply conceding, you end up with ~50% of the vote instead of 40%, which makes your gerrymandering look less excessive.Disclaimer: I don't know how this works out in the House elections (looking down the list, there are some places Republicans didn't run, notably in Massachusetts, but I don't know how that works out overall). I do know this has been a factor in some state-wide elections that were heavily gerrymandered.","title":"How Republicans held the House: It's the gerrymander, stupid"},{"text":"Yes, you absolutely can blame the voters.

NAFTA was already quite effective at creating a North American mutually beneficial ecosystem and USMCA destroyed some of the free trade benefits between partners. Trumps renegotiation of NAFTA into USMCA strengthened U.S.-Mexico ties but also introduced stricter rules, like higher regional content requirements and labor provisions, which increased costs for businesses across North America. While these changes aimed to protect U.S. jobs, they created inefficiencies that hurt all three economies, undermining the integrated supply chains critical for competitiveness. US access to Canadian dairy market is damaging and involves unfair trade practices.Geopolitically, Russias isolation due to sanctions and Chinas cautious distancing from Russian banks highlight the fragility of authoritarian alliances. India, balancing strained ties with China and partnerships with the U.S., is unlikely to align with Beijing, preserving its strategic autonomy.To stay on point, Trumps tariff policies and protectionist stance risk alienating key trade partners like Mexico, whose economy is deeply tied to the U.S. Further tensions could destabilize the region, disrupt supply chains, and weaken collective economic resilience.I don't really see the link with democratic systems and dictatorships, Trump did mention he was going to turn the US into a dictatorship but I don't believe it's relevant to the economic problems he's creating now.","title":"Trump threatens 100% tariffs on BRICS if they move away from the dollar"},{"text":"Which is why I'm shocked that government agencies haven't been watching him like a hawk while he was in office and afterwards. \\nHe's been planning on overturning the government, with the help of Putin, The Heritage Foundation and Musk (others as well).

At any point in a year, as a result, by making a recess appointment during an intrasession recess, a President could fill a position not just for the rest of that year, but until near the end of the following year. In practice, this has meant that a recess appointment could last for almost two years.Page 8: [https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS21308](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS21308)The previous pages (6/7) also goes into the length of recess required for recess appointments to be made as longer than 10 days, though that limit was an opinion by the Supreme Court - so that's not especially far fetched to see that being overturned by the current bench.","title":"Recess appointments could put Trump at odds with conservatives on the Supreme Court"},{"text":"Sometimes the best humor is honesty.","title":"Rogan says the 'greatest media psy-op in history' was waged against Trump: 'They've distorted who he is'"},{"text":"The fell behind is nonsense too.More men have degrees than ever before.

Mexico is already backing off from Trumps tariff commitment because they know how much is to lose for the Mexican economy if Trump doesnt get his way. No country is bold enough or stupid enough to back the ruble or yen in todays geopolitics. India wont back trade from US to maybe create a tighter alliance with say China who are experiencing border conflicts. China is backing off banks from Russian companies because of insolvency due to lack of liquidity of yen in the Russian banks and no good way to get Yen into Russia due to the ban on swift. I think its a good time to cut that alliance by getting Brazil and India not to commit.

You are literally paying another person to be an incubator for a year and risk all the complications of pregnancy.  $300,000 is a number I've heard once, since you also have to pay all their medical expenses, living expenses, and such for a year.Adoption is also hella expensive. Perfect healthy infants are rare and if you are white and want a white baby, you could be waiting for years.  If you're not racist and will take any baby, it's much faster, but still costs about $50K-$75K for all the paperwork.  We don't run Magdalene laundries or their equivalents any more for women who get pregnant in wedlock; there is no stork.In my personal case, I was born with a malformed uterus, and couldn't get pregnant under normal means.

The same goes for journalists, election workers, scientists, doctors, and first responders.

From Shakespeare, Walt Disney, The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Whitney Houston's behemoth cover of Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and Adam Sandler comedies.The concepts of romance have evolved, and many of the old models are not only dated but frowned upon. Take for example the main protagonist in the 1989 movie Say Anything with John Cusack. He's a young man graduating high school and has no idea what he wants to do with his life. He falls in love with a high achieving classmate. She has a very bright future with scholarships and straight A's. At night he even blasts a boom box from outside her bedroom window playing the song \\"In Your Eyes\\" by Peter Gabriel. For pop culture of the time this was considered romantic. This is now considered at the very least harassment and possibly even stalking depending on consent. At the time of release. It was a hallmark of \\"romance.\\" Another example, Marlon Brando's character in 1954's  \\"On the Waterfront\\". The main protagonist Terry Bogard is a washed up boxer in his mid 30s who never \\"made it\\" and now works as a union dock worker moving freight containers. He falls in love with the sister of a man who was tossed off the roof of his building for being a \\"rat\\" to the union boss. Terry has sympathy for her but doesn't tell her he was there the night her brother was tossed off the roof. In one dramatic scene, after she tells him she doesn't want to see him, he shows up at her apartment and breaks the door down, demanding she say that she loves him and they embrace each other. This was also deemed \\"romantic\\" during its time. No doubt this is considered stalking, potentially burglary, and emotional abuse.Men and women both grew up with a fantasy of sensationalized romance and idealism.Many young girls of today idolize Taylor Swift who is a mid 30s billionaire who constantly sings about shitty ex boyfriends. Young men of today are left with billionaires like Elon Musk and Trump who have children with many wives and amassed their obscene wealth through crimes and lies. There is no romance in the role models of today. Just the obsession of money, power and status. There is a common theme though. Men and women look up to billionaires. They just choose different ones to evaluate \\"success.\\"\\"Romance\\" has been thrown against the wall as a transactional relationship not always by choice but as a result of the 2008 financial crisis where young men and women lived in an era of desperation and survival in crowded professional industries. Millenials for instance graduated college and it took years to even be considered at companies within the fields of their studies. I haven't even mentioned the Me Too era, which is a whole other valley to walk through.","title":"How Our Messed-Up Dating Culture Leads to Loneliness, Anger and Donald Trump"},{"text":"What about women that voted for him ?","title":"Rogan says the 'greatest media psy-op in history' was waged against Trump: 'They've distorted who he is'"},{"text":"I don't know how you read that and didn't conclude they think the article is fabricating problems where there are none.","title":"How Our Messed-Up Dating Culture Leads to Loneliness, Anger and Donald Trump"},{"text":"The Gold Standard, or anything like it, would be a fine idea, in theory.

Could for example the US border patrol and ICE work more closely with the Mexican police and form a coalition and strengthen their position and their operations? And the same goes for Canada ( I honestly didn't even realize Canada was a problem). So I guess not understanding what the actual problem is makes it difficult to try to know what other options are available. I mean I agree tariffs are very powerful incentive, and although there is general agreement that something has to be done to fix immigration, there's going to be a lot of public pushback on the deportation.

There were bomb threats in the largest blue population centers of several swing states: Phoenix, Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta.  How many people who were planning on voting Kamala decided to take the better safe than sorry path and stay home on Election Day directly because of those threats?  Democratic voters tend to be apathetic to begin with, so when you add a safety concern to that apathy, I can see quite a lot of voters saying nevermind, Im staying home.  Note further that this would affect the decisions of substantially more than just the voters at the specific polling locations that received threats.  If a person is able to be dissuaded from voting by a bomb threat at their own polling location, I think they would be just as easily dissuaded by bomb threats at some other nearby polling locations.  And how many additional voters werent scared off by the bomb threats, but were just unable to vote due to temporary polling location closures messing up their schedule?

Presumably how single fathers fits into this dynamic is the presumption men can just replace women... like an appliance, which is why they(single fathers) don't make much of an explicit appearance in the document.What I am basically trying to say is...when they tear apart these families, they are going to offer little to no assistance to the parent that is either here legally or an American citizen.

Conservatively, we could put 1.5 million people at the border to resist. I cant see any nation committing 9 million citizens to an invasion (it takes six persons on offense to overrun one person on defense, militarily speaking). The Mexican border is mostly desert, so keeping troops watered would be difficult at best. Its flat, open terrain and the US would have total air superiority. Good luck to anyone stupid enough to try it. To put things in perspective, the D-Day invasion of Normandy was a 100 mile trip from a very large island used as a staging base and took 18 months to complete.

The YPG is a third party there, the two primary factions are the Assad regime, allied with Russia and Iran, and a loose coalition of opposition forces. The west and the gulf states used to back the opposition but have largely withdrawn their support. The Free Syrian Army is the largest opposition faction and is basically operating on behalf of Turkey. The other major opposition faction is Tahrir al-Sham, which was founded by ex al-Qaeda members. They're not as extreme as their parent organization, but they're still radical Islamists. Historically, they didn't have a great relationship with Turkey and the FSA, but they seem to be mending some fences there.The Syrian Democratic Forces (which includes the YPG) is largely doing their own thing in the east, the US saw them as their most reliable allies against ISIL so was backing them for a while until Trump just decided to stop doing that (although US troops are still there to \\"guard\\" the oil fields, funny how that goes). The US didn't help them against Assad though, its focus was ISIL. Then, after the US withdrawl, Turkey invaded and the SDF cut a deal with Assad and Russia to allow their troops in to stop the Turkish invasion and to recognize Assad as the legitimate president of Syria in exchange for keeping their autonomy.So if you're trying to simplify things into two sides of a proxy war, it's Turkey vs Russia, and the SDF lean towards Russia. That's oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but Turkey is not pro-Assad or buddies with Russia (there's a whole power game there in the Middle East and Caucasus, although Turkey doesn't really care about Ukraine, that's probably where you got Turkey and Russia being allied from).The US isn't really a relevant player in this stage of the war, there's some US bases there but it hasn't engaged in any combat since ISIL collapsed.Israel is mostly just anti-Iran and anti-Hezbollah, they don't really support anyone they just bomb things they consider threats.","title":"CMV: Most people don't understand the conflict in Syria because it's not a bipolar war"},{"text":"well america first is america first. why would he care abotu other countries ? hed make everyone in the world poor as fuck but so america could strive, and israel ofcourse","title":"Trump threatening economic war against BRICS, directly challenging Putin's ambitions"},{"text":"Who would have figured that Trump would have chosen the guy who aims to turn the FBI into the equivalent of Hitler's SS.

That's how pretty much every other democracy works, the government is formed of members of the parliament who are given ministerial positions. This is altogether proper, the people elect those representatives, elect the party to rule, and the bureaucracy should be under political control, within the bounds of the law.People are concerned about Kash Patel not necessarily because he lacks qualifications, but because the qualification that matters here is his loyalty to Trump. A President has the right to expect loyalty from his appointees, and someone like Buttigieg offered that to Biden. He was always ready to defend his boss, even on conservative platforms like FoxNews. Yet Buttigieg's success in his position was tied to how well he did the job of Secretary of Transportation. Certainly his opponents were quick to blame him for anything bad that happened that was related to roads, bridges, or rails. And in that the system works: the party the people elected is generally in control, the President can operate the executive branch effectively, and Buttigieg is incentivized to run his Department well, because success in running the Department translates to success for the Administration and for him personally.Can we really say the same of Kash Patel? Will we judge his Directorship (if he is confirmed) by how well he ran the FBI? Is that what Trump expects from him? Is that what Patel is in the position to do?

If I can simply arrest opposing party members or Generals or Supreme Court Justices and control the media narrative of my actions, there is no longer any need for the Constitution.","title":"Trump says he'll fire FBI Director Christopher Wray, replace him with longtime ally Kash Patel"},{"text":"I mean maybe -- and hear me out -- maybe the guy who has been supposedly fighting oligarchs for 34 years in Congress/Senate and not only has made no progress, but has lost significant ground, shouldn't be the one to be trying to tell us how to do this.","title":"Sanders Says There Is No Choice: 'We Must Defeat the Oligarchs' | \\nThe U.S. Senator from Vermont is asking big questions about how to achieveeven in the face of Trump's returnan \\"economy and government that works for all, not just the few.\\""},{"text":"Loving all these DEI hires.

The only thing that made Harris message different from a late-night conversation with a very drunk friend was that at no point did Harris actually say I love you guys and then burst out weeping.Kamala Harris is now a raging alcoholic apparently. Never mind the increasing amount of examples of Donald Trump slurring his words without the help of booze. Not to mention his declining mental health and physical condition, along with his frequently temperamental and incoherent tirades in public and on Truthsocial,  They are currently working out how to kill off the citizenry with euthanasia.That's not an outlandish, unwarranted and hysterical claim at all... By contrast, President-elect Don-ald Trump has already surrounded himself with a remarkable group of people who are at the forefront of the issues of our time.What!? How can you genuinely believe something like this? All of his appointments so far amount to a textbook example of rampant cronyism. People who are either dangerously unqualified or corrupt, but all of whom received their positions in exchange for their unconditional loyalty, and in some cases, whatever they could contribute to Trump's campaign and any future attempts to consolidate power.  Some of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s ideas may be a bit cranky. But nobody could say he isnt onto something with his wish to make it easier for Americans to eat healthily.The guy is, in large part, responsible for the deaths of some 83 people in Samoa, most of them children... He's also pathological. Make sure to tune into behind the bastards recent four part series on him, it's eye opening. The guy is a nutcase with an unfathomably privilege upbringing who has exploited his last name his entire life. He's also a massive hypocrite considering his affinity for heroin and Bushmeat. Oh, and he's also a psychotically abusive person too. And if there was another pandemic, I would want Bhattacharya to be in charge over almost anyone elseAre you kidding me? The guy who is discredited by the medical community? The dangerously irresponsible \\"fringe epidemiologist?\\"The guy who refused to acknowledge the dangers of COVID itself, encouraged people to avoid getting vaccinated, told people to get COVID in favor of \\"herd immunity,\\" despite the virus being highly infectious, transmissible and rapidly mutating.The guy who politicized the pandemic, encouraged people to listen to unqualified and deranged contrarians over medical experts, and claimed that vaccines, masks, covid treatments, and \\"lockdowns\\" that weren't anywhere near as strict as they were in other developed countries, were far more deadly and dangerous than COVID. And who belonged to a group of quacks that contributed a rise in excess mortality to everything *but* COVID.  Then, of course, there is the Elon effect. Thanks to the prominence of the first buddy in the Trump team, other tech geniuses are also suddenly flocking to Mar-a-Lago. Mark Zuckerberg joined Trump for dinner this weekWhat!? All of a sudden being in \\"cahoots\\" with big tech is acceptable? And tech geniuses? Are you kidding? Musk purchased an overvalued Twitter, which has since tanked in value, he then fired thousands of workers, which led to a number of different issues for the platform, and then he altered the algorithms to direct traffic to him and any right-wing troll or caricature willing to pay for the privilege. He's also an overgrown child whose companies are subsidized to the teeth while he incessantly complains about \\"government waste.\\"Not to mention, much like Trump, he's had the obscene amount of wealth and privilege to fail over and over again until something appears to work, or until the sunk cost fallacy kicks in. While us poor fucking schmos will never have the same privilege. Oh yah, real \\"populists\\" and \\"outsiders\\" who connect with the working class.And these are both people mind you, who have been described as narcissists and extremely difficult to work with by former colleagues, staff. In the days when you could still mention Christopher Columbus without causing a woke meltdown, Ira Gershwin wrote: They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round.Oh, of course we get a nod to \\"wokeism.\\" The big bad boogeyman and scapegoat for conservatives. And some desperate appeal to \\"patriots\\" everywhere whose knowledge of history is so poor that they probably couldn't even pass a citizenship testNevermind the fact that people like this just gloss over or memory hole Trump's disastrous foreign and economic policy record, who dismiss and downplay his unconstitutional threats, his autocratic whims and his inflammatory, anti-democratic rhetoric.
