Fear of encroachment upon the liberties and opportunities of the individual. Fear of the subjection of labor to capital. Fear of monopoly. Fear that the absorption of capital by corporations, and their perpetual life, might bring evils similar to those which attended mortmain [immortality].

I remember this from a 2020 fraud analysis because those 1 vote ballots look odd, and the guy writing the article was checking to see if the numbers worked out. His main point, though, was disproving \\"big city fraud\\". House districts all have about the same number of people. The urban districts he analyzed were normal for turn out and for Presidential and House votes. Example being something like: Urban district 60% turn out (normal for Presidential election). 70% Biden with 250,000 votes. 70% for D Representative with 240,000 votes. 10,000 people just voted for Biden and left. Meanwhile:\\nSuburban to Rural district. 60% turn out. 55% Biden with 250,000 votes. 55 % R Representative with 240,000 votes. Same rough numbers, but there were abnormally high numbers of ticket splitting in the non urban districts because people liked their Republican Representative but didn't like Trump. This was a good way to disprove voter fraud and ballot dumping because: 1. The numbers worked out and were normal2. If someone was going to rig the election for Democrats, then there was no way they were going to waste the effort by not getting the Democrat House candidate elected too.","title":"How is PA, MI, WI, NV and AZ leaning Democrat for the Senate, but they are a toss-up for president?

The laws around this should be tightened up to close this loophole) and perpetrators should be arrested and charged immediately.It's fairly easy to go from a democratic nation to a fascist one.

I think it mischaracterizes what people are really calling forRacial blindness isnt meant to be an excuse for ignorance. Its not supposed to be shutting your eyes and pretending things in history didnt happen. The whole point is just to look past that though, and to see people not as a demographic, but as individuals Because everyone has their own story. There are white people who have eaten shit their whole lives, and there are black people who were born to rich parents and coasted all their lives. Is this the norm? Definitely not. But does it happen more often than people would like to admit, especially nowadays? Yes. People should be evaluated on their character, their actions, and their story. Not their race. Are some people of the same race gonna have very similar stories? Undoubtedly and they should have the chance to tell their stories. But race shouldnt define people. Personally I think the hyper-fixating on race is weird anyways. Its like the first thing you notice about someone when they walk into the room isnt them its just the color of their skin. Oh look, another black person, u must be disadvantaged. I just find it so odd how people *insist* this is the mindset we must have. Its not enough to be not racist. You have to be openly antiracist and use all your power to help lift people up but only people with certain skin color. Like how do people not realize how gross this attitude is? The fact of the matter is has your approach even made anything better?  Your approach is currently the most popular one, and despite the insistence that its necessary to combat all these issues, has it really made anything better? Black people still deal with poverty and mass incarceration. Race relations have kinda stagnated, and many racists are even more inflamed nowadays because of stuff like reparations and affirmative action.Sure, racial blindness may not be an immediate solution that magically fixes everything in record time. But I think if we brought up the next generation to just not focus on race altogether, in the long run it would make everything better. Hyperfixating on race is never going to make racism go away.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

Your individual vote in general has literally zero power, it's not your individual vote that candidates try to win over, it's blocs of voters. That's why American candidates market towards the \\"centrists\\", \\"centrists\\" form a voter bloc that isn't guaranteed to vote for either the Democratic or Republican parties.\\"Left-wingers\\" also form a voting bloc, the problem is that they consistently vote Democratic Party and so the bloc is meaningless for campaigning and policy positions. The bloc is safe, but imagine if it wasn't. It doesn't even need to be in swing states to show something. If leftists in solid blue or red states start to vote third-party then it shows to the Democratic Party that the once-safe bloc is becoming less and less safe, they're gonna have to do some policy changing.And there is historical precedent in the US to this working. In the 1968 US election, Republican candidate Richard Nixon campaigned as a centrist to try to win over more moderate Democrats. However, Southern right-wing racists voted for George Wallace of the American Independent Party, a staunch segregationist as a result of Nixon's moderate platform, giving him 13.5% of the national popular vote.Nixon still won that election, but it showed that the bloc of \\"Southern right-wing racists\\" wasn't safe, which led the Republican Party to intensifying the \\"Southern Strategy\\", a strategy of using dogwhistles to win over Southern racists while not alienating non-racists.*the exception being swing states*And I find a leftward shift in the Democratic Party platform to be absolutely necessary in the fight against fascism.Right now, the Democratic Party [has](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/11/1135878576/the-democrats-strategy-of-boosting-far-right-candidates-seems-to-have-worked) [been](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/07/democrats-spend-millions-on-republican-primaries/) [supporting](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/03/the-democrats-are-purposely-boosting-far-right-republicans-this-will-backfire) [far-right](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/democrats-republican-primaries.html) [Republican](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/ohio-senate-race-democrats-supporting-trump-endorsed-bernie-moreno.html) candidates in many races, because they see them as easier to defeat than a moderate Republican candidate. They are actively enabling the rise of American fascism for their own short-term gain, because they don't actually care about it right now. They want the Republican Party to stay far-right extremists because then they can just campaign on being the \\"lesser of two evils\\" forever without actually changing much in society.If we want American fascism to actually be defeated then we must pressure the Democratic Party into moving leftward and actually doing something about this issue, instead of enabling the rise of fascism in the Republican Party.","title":"CMV: Liberals/Leftists should vote for Kamala, despite her support of Israel."},{"text":"Jill Stein will cost Harris the election as much as she cost Hil the election in 2016.

Don't know what else to tell you.Yes, there are issues with voting processes all over the USA.

Yes, there are people who may try to do some suppressive bullshit at the polls, but by and large, even in rural Texas, unless you show up wearing Harris/Trump gear, no one knows who you are voting for.I was standing in line next to all colors of people, including an Indian family. No one had any issues at all.

I know some of those states are doing some shady shit and are trying to throw out registrations (Texas did the same). Again, once you move to a full-ID system, there are significantly fewer issues with voting. You can track a ballot back to the person (information is still protected), but the ballot number is tied to you so you can track your own ballot if you want to. If you see something wrong with your ballot, then you can send a complaint to the Secretary of State that your ballot was wrong.It is a system that does work, even in Texas.","title":"The Ridiculousness of Demanding ID or Proof of Citizenship"},{"text":"Theyre not mutually exclusive.

My gut tells me that the reason why much of the right has harped on her for not doing interviews and releasing policy info early on was that they were looking for attack vectors, I don't believe the majority really wanted a policy discussion or you would have also begged that from your own side.

Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare as a war crime contrary to article 8(2)(b)(xxv) of the Statute;\\n    ? Wilfully causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or health contrary to article 8(2)(a)(iii), or cruel treatment as a war crime contrary to article 8(2)(c)(i);\\n    ? Wilful killing contrary to article 8(2)(a)(i), or Murder as a war crime contrary to article 8(2)(c)(i);\\n    ? Intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population as a war crime contrary to articles 8(2)(b)(i), or 8(2)(e)(i);\\n    ? Extermination and/or murder contrary to articles 7(1)(b) and 7(1)(a), including in the context of deaths caused by starvation, as a crime against humanity;\\n    ? Persecution as a crime against humanity contrary to article 7(1)(h);\\n    ? Other inhumane acts as crimes against humanity contrary to article 7(1)(k). My Office submits that the war crimes alleged in these applications were committed in the context of an international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine, and a non-international armed conflict between Israel and Hamas (together with other Palestinian Armed Groups) running in parallel. We submit that the crimes against humanity charged were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Palestinian civilian population pursuant to State policy. These crimes, in our assessment, continue to this day.My Office submits that the evidence we have collected, including interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, authenticated video, photo and audio material, satellite imagery and statements from the alleged perpetrator group, shows that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all parts of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. This occurred through the imposition of a total siege over Gaza that involved completely closing the three border crossing points, Rafah, Kerem Shalom and Erez, from 8 October 2023 for extended periods and then by arbitrarily restricting the transfer of essential supplies C including food and medicine C through the border crossings after they were reopened. The siege also included cutting off cross-border water pipelines from Israel to Gaza C Gazans principal source of clean water C for a prolonged period beginning 9 October 2023, and cutting off and hindering electricity supplies from at least 8 October 2023 until today. This took place alongside other attacks on civilians, including those queuing for food; obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian agencies; and attacks on and killing of aid workers, which forced many agencies to cease or limit their operations in Gaza. My Office submits that these acts were committed as part of a common plan to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of violence against the Gazan civilian population as a means to (i) eliminate Hamas; (ii) secure the return of the hostages which Hamas has abducted, and (iii) collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceived as a threat to Israel. The effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known, and have been confirmed by multiple witnesses interviewed by my Office, including local and international medical doctors. They include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women. Famine is present in some areas of Gaza and is imminent in other areas. As UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres warned more than two months ago, 1.1 million people in Gaza are facing catastrophic hunger C the highest number of people ever recorded C anywhere, anytime as a result of an entirely manmade disaster. Today, my Office seeks to charge two of those most responsible, NETANYAHU and GALLANT, both as co-perpetrators and as superiors pursuant to Articles 25 and 28 of the Rome Statute. Israel, like all States, has a right to take action to defend its population. That right, however, does not absolve Israel or any State of its obligation to comply with international humanitarian law. Notwithstanding any military goals they may have, the means Israel chose to achieve them in Gaza C namely, intentionally causing death, starvation, great suffering, and serious injury to body or health of the civilian population C are criminal.   Since last year, in Ramallah, in Cairo, in Israel and in Rafah, I have consistently emphasised that international humanitarian law demands that Israel take urgent action to immediately allow access to humanitarian aid in Gaza at scale. I specifically underlined that starvation as a method of war and the denial of humanitarian relief constitute Rome Statute offences. I could not have been clearer.  As I also repeatedly underlined in my public statements, those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my Office takes action. That day has come.The primary assertion is not that Israel is committed to mass physical destruction of Gazans (i.e. Killing members of the group.), but has deliberately and systemically used starvation as a tool of warfare, constituting \\"Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\\"Israel has enforced a blockade on Gaza which has led to a [mere 17%](https://www.nrc.no/news/2024/september/israels-siege-now-blocks-83-of-food-aid-reaching-gaza-new-data-reveals/) of needed food actually reaching Gaza.

As a leftist, whos consistently voted with the Democrats, I feel like the Harris campaign really made a shitty misstep to the middle. Not even for the (perfectly fair) reasons of shes moving away from what I want! but because Harris and Walz leaning a little left was actually working right he came on board. Remember when he was announced, many progressives and leftists (who still entertain voting Democratic) were like okay, not bad.Then his moment with Jake Tapper was great:**When confronted about the backlash, in an interview on CNNs State of the Union, and being asked whether his history would fuel attacks and accusations that he is a government liberal, Walz replied sarcastically: What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn, and women are making their own healthcare decisions.*Theyre gonna label whatever theyre gonna label. [Donald Trump] is gonna roll it out, mispronounce names, try [to] make the case. The fact of the matter is that if you look at the policies that vice-president Harris was involved in making  quality of life is higher, the economies are better, all of those things.*If thats what they want to label me, Im more than happy to take the label.**Then they turned away from blowing off the too liberal attacks to try and get some votes from republicans who would never even give the time of day. The GOP has moved the Overton window SO far right, and the Democrats have never put up a solid fight to bring it back. The only thing keeping these progressive povs in the conversation is the youth moving far left as a rejection of what they see and experience as the failure of capitalism. I would just love to have a Democratic Party that follows through on the positions they claim to fight for. Yes, they are a better choice than the republicans, but we deserve much more from them. We dont have the time for slow incremental change right now. Centrists call the left too radical for wanting extreme action with the Green New Deal. I would argue that watching the world burn, melt, shake, and get torn apart by storms while we slowly legislate plans that wont take effect in time to help us is the real radical position. And finally, yes, I know the GOP (and too many Dems) stand in the way all the time, but the DNC needs to get better messaging. Who cares if your ideas are better for people, if your messaging lacks a connective simplicity. They are the worst at that.

Her husband depends on her, and she never lets him down. She is good to him every day of her life, and with her own hands she gladly makes clothes. She is like a sailing ship that brings food from across the sea. She gets up before daylight to prepare food for her family and for her servants. She knows how to buy land and how to plant a vineyard, and she always works hard. She knows when to buy or sell, and she stays busy until late at night. She spins her own cloth, and she helps the poor and the needy. Her family has warm clothing, and so she doesnt worry when it snows. She does her own sewing, and everything she wears is beautiful. Her husband is a well-known and respected leader in the city. She makes clothes to sell to the shop owners. She is strong and graceful, as well as cheerful about the future. Her words are sensible, and her advice is thoughtful. She takes good care of her family and is never lazy. Her children praise her, and with great pride her husband says, There are many good women, but you are the best!

His son in law talked about why would anyone want to return to Gaza, they should move them (the Displaced Gazans) nd then Raze the Gaza Strip and build hotels because it is a loss of beautiful beachfront. They dont give a fuck about Gaza. I realize that we are doing exceedingly little to help Gaza now under Biden and wont see much more under Harris, which is some bullshit, but I think if we see a Trump re-election, what we are going to see occur in Gaza will make whats happened to date there seem like childs play. And beyond that, what we will see happen to our rights here will also be unimaginable. Try to imagine it anyway. We Americans are arrogant- we think fascism and an autocratic leader cant happen here. And that is dead wrong. All the conditions are in place. His team have a solid plan. Not seeing that is fucking naive. There will be no adults to temper him, no coming re-election campaign win needed that might check his worst impulses. Hes ready and hes said what he intends to do. Believe him. Read about how it happened in Hungary, Turkey, Russia.. you cant fight for anyone else, Gaza or otherwise, if you yourself are now having to face and fight authoritarian style rule. Skipping the vote is foolish and performative in this instance. Youre doing no favors to anyone in Gaza by doing so.

In general, it seems like Kamala is unwilling to fight for the things that Most americans and definitely most democrats want. So if she isn't willing to fight for those things, and is willing to go out of her way to do things that actively harm Americans, then that isn't a good leader even if there is another person who is worse. That isn't someone who can be trusted... in that sole aspect, as far as being a leader that represents their core base, technically (and I swear to god I'm just going to block anyone who tries not to interact with this nuance) Donald Trump *is* better. There are a lot of reasons as to why we can't trust Donald Trump, clearly he's the worse option, but that doesn't mean there are no other options.If you, and I, and everyone willing to have this conversation about needing to vote for Kamala chose not to vote for Kamala, we *would* have a third party president. The only reason that idea isn't feasible is because you're not willing to engage with the idea that there is always time to make a better option. It's a radical idea simply because you have to be radicalized to believe it.The whole \\"we'll do this for now and then change later\\" bit has been pushed by essentially every powerful group in the US to maintain their grip on power for as long as possible. We know cigarettes are bad, why there's an age limit... even though a bunch of cigarette companies now own vape companies and highschool teachers are confiscating more vapes than cell phones? It's the kind of thing where oil companies say that you should watch your carbon footprint and recycle, while they make less effort than any reasonably concerned climate activist to invest the massive amounts of resources they have into a non-oil future. I guess what I'm saying is  Kamala Harris is moving further to the right than any democrat you personally know wants, so if she's doing this despite America's best interests instead of fighting for one of the many popular choices, that just means she doesn't have your best interests in mind. Kamala Harris isn't even fighting as hard as you, OP, are fighting to get the leftist vote. Even if I was talking about Israel and not one of the many right of center policies she signed off on under Biden, what specifically do you think would be \\"too far\\" for Kamala? What would she or Biden or any other future democratic president who is very centrist and definitely not going to champion progressive causes primarily have to do in order to change your mind on whether or not she's a fascist?

Now, i know that you will say that Biden wasn't going far enough. But what you cannot deny is that there is a clear difference between the two. One is unequivocally worse for the Palestinians. The status quo is bad, but it could get a whole lot worse.If Trump wins, that's tens of thousands of additional Palestinians dead. If Trump wins, that's it with a \\"two state solution\\".

Too often, discussions around passing the power risk collapsing into essentialismreducing complex social dynamics to caricatures of good and bad identities. And yet, theres a vital layer of complexity thats often overlooked: namely, that redistributing power from one historically dominant group (yes, straight white men) to a broader array of voices isnt merely about symbolism or revenge politics. Its about instrumentally disrupting entrenched systems of advantage, which, like stubborn garden weeds, arent rooted in who holds power *personally* but rather in *how* that power has been consolidated over time to serve particular agendas. By dismantling that consolidation, were not punishing a group but opening space for more progressive, inclusive decision-making.Lets talk instrumentalization, then. For all its rhetoric, this isnt about essentializing any demographic as morally inferior or more oppressive by nature; its about recognizing that people whove historically enjoyed unchecked access to power often unconsciously support the status quo because it serves their interests. What happens when we shift power dynamics in a way that *doesnt* reinforce those interests? Well, if we start building leadership structures that account for a wider range of lived experiences, priorities shift naturally. When voices whove lived at the sharp end of policy decisionswhove felt the inequities, exclusions, and restrictions first-handstep into power, we see policies that challenge privilege and exclusivity and seek solutions for entire communities rather than reinforcing the status quo.And no, this doesnt imply that any one identity group holds a monopoly on progressive ideals. But lets not ignore that the perspectives of marginalized groupsIndigenous activists, Black feminists, queer leadershave always called for equitable policies, not only for their groups but for society at large. Its no coincidence that movements for accessible healthcare, gender equality, and environmental reform have historically been led by those *outside* the halls of privilege. These are precisely the perspectives our current systems overlook or instrumentalize only when convenient. So, advocating for a redistribution of power isnt just anti-essentialist; its actively progressive, in the most literal sense of seeking policies that evolve past narrow self-interest toward collective welfare.The counterpoint you raisedthat oppressive policies exist across various global culturescertainly holds. But this is no proof that removing one dominant group from power in a particular context wont have progressive effects; rather, it shows that, globally, power thrives on systems, not identities, and systems are built to favor those who wield it. When we change who sits at the decision-making table, the structure of the table changes. So while reducing straight white male dominance alone wont guarantee utopia, it does make room for a more diverse chorus of voices and visions, each bringing insights and priorities that widen the scope of policy beyond the historic blind spots of that singular identity.In short, the argument isnt that straight white men are intrinsically oppressive or unfit for leadership; its that the homogeneous concentration of power inevitably yields policies that maintain that concentration. When power is more evenly distributed, it disrupts the self-reinforcing systems that define progress according to one groups interests, opening a path toward genuinely equitable policy-making.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

Trump got more votes in California than he did in Texas. And that's with Republicans going into that election knowing their votes didn't matter for president. In some cases, it didn't matter at all since no Republican won any state-wide race. So if they lived in a blue district, they were batting 0.000 in terms of their votes going to winners. So, if a Republican in that situation stayed home because their \\"vote doesn't matter\\", it's hard to argue against that. Because, it honestly didn't. Trump could have won way more votes in California under a popular vote system, because that 1 vote would be worth something, encouraging California Republicans to cast their ballot instead of staying home.

That has been the traditional understanding of the term...I don't think that is true, and I think it is absurd on its face. Before the modern time people were required to engaged in things like hunting, gathering, and farming in order to avoid starvation. Were they \\"slaves\\"? Who exactly enslaved them? Across history people needed to work for a living, but doing so and being paid a wage was very different from being a slave.Needing to exert effort to survive is not slavery. To redefine the term in that way is to render it meaningless. Furthermore you are misrepresenting the situation the low wage workers are in; they are not doing that job vs. starvation, they are doing that job because it earns more than other jobs to support themselves in the country. They *could* go back to their farm or do any of the other menial jobs in the country, but they *choose* to work producing the products for foreign markets because it is a better deal for them.That is a major difference between slavery and normal work: Choice. A slave doesn't get a choice about what job they do, they don't get to choose their employer, they can't just leave if they feel like it even if they have no plan for survival elsewhere. A slave is *owned* by someone, and that is not equivalent to working a low paying job.","title":"CMV: The West should not be credited with ending slavery as our economies are based on it."},{"text":"And many Dems will vote for trump.

We can take turns, if we dont, then its not a free country, difference is learning whats healthy and whats not, so with all these levels of health, its a GREAT time to collect study and see whats beneficial Long-term Social impact: its America, its been forced anyway, only problem is the genetic prejudice and misunderstands of health, people can stop whining about it and LEARNComplexities of Identity and health: the world governments have known that pollution would affect us, so if we fight about it right now when we have the time to help each other learn, I fully agree with martial law, but as always, if that happens, its because we arent fully aware :O plus marital law would be bad, considering most government, active service or veterans people are probably Christian and follow the there is no true good or bad so that makes them liable to killing whoever just because they are told, WAR CRIMES :D","title":"Whats DEI?"},{"text":"Its naive to think codifying the standards from Roe and Casey is enough.

So if we take your example and say 10 people are deciding who to hire, they'll pick the name they're familiar with. And then when that guy eventually gets into power, what will he do? Pick the name he's familiar with. And so on. The idea is that, if power is more proportional, then results will be more proportional.

However, if I may-  \\\\In case you weren't able to detect it, the article you shared from the Mirror is using a rhetorical technique called hyperbole to make an argument.With respect, I am aware of the practice of hyperbole, and appreciate it has been used (perhaps even over-laboured) in this article to make a point. However, the article doesn't seem (at least, to my mind) to be making the argument you claim as\\\\This is what you have done with the argument regarding the need for White men to share political and cultural power in western, English speaking countries.Rather, it seemed to be specifically arguing that straight white men are specifically a problem group, not only for Western countries - but for the entirely world in general,  and that this has something to do with their intrinsic \\"straight while maleness\\". They are, after all, according to the article, \\"idiots\\", who need to be less so, and listen to the (presumably not so stupid) non white men - this, to my mind, isn't an argument merely saying \\"white men should share political and cultural power in the West\\". But even if it was; and I will take your interpritation of the author's argument in good faith here! Would that necessarily country my own belief; that such sharing would inevitably lead to better outcomes? There are many cultural practices which are much more widely practiced among non-white communities (such as FGM) which may lead to even worse outcomes for many than we currently have in our societies; ought we share our culture with this kind of belief? I am aware, as I have expressed in other responses, aware of the issues of in-group hegemony (though I would question the extent to which \\"straight white men\\" count as an ingroup, when there are so many subdivisions within them) - and I am not against more diverse politics; I merely question whether this will inevitably lead to the sorts of progressivism those in favour of it believe that it will. As for the second part of your argument: \\\\In short, the two examples that you provide from non-western countries are the result of white men meddling in other countries. They fail to prove your thesis and, instead, strengthen the argument that the problem is white men in power.Here, unfortunately I must protest! You specifically point at me using India and Afghanistan; true, but I also mentioned Thailand (which, noticably, was never colonised) and many examples from China long before it ever fell under European influence during the later 19th century - such as foot binding, female infanticide, and the Dzungar Genocide of the 18th century, all of which were practiced by the Chinese long before \\"straight white men\\" had any influence over their politics. Moreover; the argument you make regarding British divide and rule politics in India has been questioned by a number of historians - Roderick Matthews in \\"Peace, Poverty and Betrayal\\" makes a particularly convincing case against the existence of a strict divide and rule policy by British authorities. Moreover, while some of the origins of Hindu nationalism may lie with British colonialism, it is (as are all things) a complex phenomenon taking a range of inspirations from many places - and given that the British have not ruled India for nigh on 70 years now, do the Indians themselves have no agency in the matter?Likewise, with your assertion that \\"straight white men\\" funded the Taliban - well, if I may, [Pakistan also played a significant role here](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghan2/Afghan0701-02.htm). Does this not suggest that \\"straight white men\\" are far from the only players in this arena; and that other groups are just as willing to fund terror organisations to propel their own geo-strategic ambitions? This also opens up something I have christened; \\"The Manchu Paradox\\". This refers back to my earlier point about the Dzungar Genocide , which happened entirely independently of straight white male influence. The orchestrator of this genocide was a Manchu - the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. Did he order the genocide because he was Manchu, or did other factors play a much more significant role? Likewise; do straight white men meddle in the affairs of other countries because they are straight white men?I would say, as I would say to the Manchu paradox, no. Thus, I do not believe that straight white men are the problem; imperialism, yes, but straight white men do not do imperialism because they are straight and white, any more than the Manchus commit genocide (or indeed, do imperialism, the Qing being an empire and all which routinely meddled in the affairs of other countries) because they are Manchu. Therefore, I believe even in these cases, my argument still holds water. The problem is not white men - because white men are no more, or less, likely to engage in problematic behaviours than other groups. And thus, simply removing white men from the equation is no guarantee of progressive politics; indeed, we see Afghan politicians engaging [in genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazara_genocide_(19th_century)) entirely of their own merits, with no need for the white man's encouragement at all.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

By highlighting differences, it may create or deepen lines that people then feel they need to choose sides on, which can make uniting under shared values harder.Equity and Merit: The equity component of DEI focuses on ensuring everyone has fair access to resources and opportunities, sometimes by adjusting outcomes rather than leveling the starting point. Some people argue that this can overlook merit or experience and potentially create a system that doesnt necessarily reward hard work or excellence, which could affect performance and motivation in fields like education or business.Inclusion vs. Free Expression: Inclusion means accepting everyone, even when different beliefs conflict, which can create tension. Theres concern that some DEI initiatives might pressure individuals to suppress or silence beliefs that dont align with the majority or with particular DEI frameworks. This can, paradoxically, limit free expression for fear of offending others.Long-Term Social Impact: The concept of DEI is relatively new, so theres uncertainty about the long-term social effects of these practices. Some critics wonder whether constantly adjusting policies and programs to prioritize diversity and inclusion will lead to unintended consequences, like creating environments that dont foster self-reliance or accountability.Complexities of Identity and Health: As you mentioned, theres an intricate link between environment, health, and even potentially thoughts or beliefs that affect well-being. A holistic approach to DEI might need to address these factors beyond just surface-level diversity, with more focus on mutual respect and understanding of various health and lifestyle factors.","title":"Whats DEI?"},{"text":"Trumps plan of mass deportation is literally the same thing Hitler was doing to the Jews.

They were intended to be a check on the popular will.But the EC members have never operated in this way even in the early elections. They cast their EC votes in the way that aligned with the vote total in their respective state and its been the norm ever since.So IMO if you tried to pitch people on the concept of the EC as if it were a new thing - that an unelected panel of people can decide the outcome of the presidential election - people would scoff at the concept. Its an old vestige from an experimental period of American democracy written by people who had much less experience than most Americans Alice today of living and participating in a democracy.The EC, in practice, functions today as just an arbitrary distortion of the popular vote. Like you can envision it like a math equation turned into a diagram where the popular vote goes into the machine, and a different result might come out of the other side. And thats it. Individual members of the EC rarely exercise autonomy, and instead of being a check against the popular will but instead it just abets a minoritarian rule. Like in no way do Republicans right now even presume that they are winning the popular vote.

Texas? Florida? Even if they win those by 5-10%, a proportional allocation hurts them, massively. They would lose more seats there than they gain in New York or California. Democratic voters are, in terms of the EC, spread out incredibly ineffectively. Biden won California **almost two-to-one** and New York by more than 20 points, while Trump won Texas 52-46 and Florida 51-47. In other words, Republicans would have an **extremely** narrow win in the number of seats for those states, while Democratic states would be a blowout. The extra weight on the scale that is the two Senate seats won't matter compared to the fact that Democrats get absolute blowouts in Blue states. Not to mention that all the swing states effectively become a wash. And frankly, there is a lot more evidence of untapped Democratic potential in Red states (see the huge 20-40% black population in the deep south) than that the untapped reserves of Republican voters would dramatically change the landscape in California. They especially have no reason because if there was reform, they would probably want to nationalize the Nebraska/Maine system, which would allow them to gerrymander the fuck out of their own presidential elections while Democratic states are far more fair.","title":"The electoral college sucks"},{"text":"Yes, but he more than makes up for it physically.

During the presidential election run up to 1980 and Reagan, Republicans made the choice to drop supporting the ERA and women, preferring to instead support men only.Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. **Republicans cant win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.**https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdfRemember though that was the decision the Republican party chose.","title":"'Take Our Lives Seriously,' Michelle Obama Pleads As She Rallies For Kamala Harris In Michigan - The former first lady described the assault on abortion rights as the harbinger of dangerous limitations on healthcare for women."},{"text":"\\"Don't have to pay off my student loans when I'm trapped in my house, with no electricity, slowly dying from starvation and minor wounds\\" - Your sister, probably.","title":"Bernie Sanders to voters skipping presidential election over Israel: Trump is even worse"},{"text":"Must mean it's absolutely 100 percent...True then","title":"Love trolling these liberal idiots"},{"text":"4x her subscribers.

Whether its the UK or US, racial/ethnic minority groups are routinely more likely to vote for liberal/progressive parties vs conservative parties. In the UK, even at its peak of minority support, the Tories under David Cameron still only received about 30% approval from ethnic minorities. Under Rishi Sunak, an ethnic minority himself, that number dropped to as low as 16%. Labour received 68% of the ethnic minority vote now compare that to the ratio of White Britons who supported Labour vs Conservative. https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/ipsos-analysis-shows-conservative-support-amongst-ethnic-minorities-has-remained-low-since-rishi-sunak-became-pmSame in the US. In the US we regularly collect racial demographics, so its even easier to see this reality. Just being White in the US, not even accounting for differences in education, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, you are more likely to be a registered Republican (i.e. Conservative) than a registered Democrat (Liberal). White Republicans outnumber White Democrats by 15%. Republicans win the White electorate in EVERY election cycle. Meanwhile, Asians and Hispanics only have about a 1/3 chance of being a registered Republican (33-36%), and Just under 90% of all Black voters are registered Democrats. https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/In both countries, the White population is where conservative/reactionary politics hold the most sway.

It's not a difficult read and it's very interesting. The reason I bring it up is that this Holocaust survivor is (1) providing cover for a fascist (i.e., being a useful idiot) and (2) failing to understand the nature of the beast.  When people are calling Trump a fascist they don't mean that he's exactly like Hitler or Mussolini.  We're saying he demonstrates multiple features of fascism and therefore qualifies as a fascist. One really interesting part the Ur-Fascism is a table about half way down.  It has 2 rows and 4 columns.  In the top row there are the numbers 1 through 4 in sequence (1, 2, 3, 4). In the bottom row there are three letter sequences (ABC, BCD, CDE, DEF).  When you first look at the table it doesn't make sense.  But when you read an explanation it makes you go \\"holy shit\\" (or at least it made me say that). The explanation is this:ABC is the original form of fascism.  BCD is similar to the original because it contains B and C.  CDE has a similarity to the original because it shares C.  DEF is related to ABC because it is the next in the sequence. Why did that make me say \\"holy shit\\"?It's because the author is laying out how fascism can take many forms including forms that are distinct from the original but still  ultimately derived from the original. This is what's happening with Trump.  They're saying \\"no, no, no, Trump/MAGA aren't the same as Mussolini/Italian Fascists because Mussolini is ABC and Trump is DEF\\"  but what they're missing is that THAT is EXACTLY what Ur-Fascism means.  The title of fascist isnt meant to apply JUST to Italian Fascists.   The Falangists, the NAZIS, the various fascist movements in places like Slovakia they are all fascist even though they differ from each other. I really encourage everyone to read the full Ur-Fascism piece.  It's doable in an hour and it really helps to frame what we're experiencing.","title":"Holocaust survivor condemns Harris labeling Trump a fascist"},{"text":"I dont believe it, I think its luck..

To ensure investments reach communities that need them the most, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law mandates that a majority of the funding announced today must be provided to disadvantaged communities in the form of grants or loans that do not have to be repaid.  \\n...  \\nThese Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds will flow through the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (CWSRF and DWSRF), a long-standing federal-state water investment partnership. This multibillion-dollar investment will fund state-run, low-interest loan programs that address key challenges in financing water infrastructure. Todays announcement includes allotments for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Clean Water General Supplemental funds ($2.6 billion) and Emerging Contaminant funds ($225 million), and $800 million under the Drinking Water Emerging Contaminant Fund.EPA is changing the odds for communities that have faced barriers to planning and accessing federal funding through its Water Technical Assistance program, which helps disadvantaged communities identify water challenges, develop infrastructure upgrade plans, and apply for funding. Communities seeking Water Technical Assistance can request support by completing the WaterTA request form. These efforts also advance the Biden-Harris Administrations Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.To read stories about how unprecedented investments in water from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are transforming communities across the country, visit EPAs Investing in Americas Water Infrastructure Storymap. To read more about additional projects, see EPAs recently released Quarterly Report on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Funded Clean Water and Drinking Water SRF projects.For more information, including the state-by-state allocation of 2025 funding (pdf) and a breakdown of EPA SRF funding available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, please visit the Clean Water State Revolving Fund website and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund website. Additionally, the SRF Public Portal allows users to access data from both the Drinking Water and Clean Water SRF programs through interactive reports, dashboards, and maps.The State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs have been the foundation of water infrastructure investments for more than 30 years, providing low-cost financing for local projects across America. SRF programs are critically important programs for investing in the nations water infrastructure. They are designed to generate significant and sustainable water quality and public health benefits across the country. Their impact is amplified by the growth inherent in a revolving loan structure, in which payments of principal and interest on loans become available to address future needs.Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:Water keeps us healthy, sustains vibrant communities and dynamic ecosystems, and supports economic opportunity. When our water infrastructure fails, it threatens peoples health, peace of mind, and the environment, said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Laws historic investment in water, EPA is working with states and local partners to upgrade infrastructure and address local challengesfrom lead in drinking water, to PFAS, to water main breaks, to sewer overflows and climate resilience. Together, we are creating good-paying jobs while ensuring that all people can rely on clean and safe water.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $3.6 Billion for Water Infrastructure Through Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"So you are just making stuff up, got it.

BTW we owe almost 40% of our debt to the federal reserve.No, the Federal Reserve owns about 17% of the federal debt. By the way, the Federal Reserve gives almost all of its profits to the government and the greater the percentage of the debt the Fed owns, the **less** the government pays in interest. The danger of the Fed buying federal debt is inflation, not more interest. For every dollar that is printed, the US government then must pay interest on the dollarThis is just factually wrong. The government pays interest on Treasury securities, not on currency. 1\\\\. person's income value - at any point, if the government decides to print more money, YOUR money becomes less and less valuable. In addition, jobs have to pay more for upkeep, which raises prices for everyone. But even though the prices of everything rise, your income stays the same, just less valuable than before.You just contradicted yourself. You said \\"jobs have to pay more for upkeep\\" and you also said \\"your income stays the same\\". Of course, income tends to go up the same as prices. 2\\\\. Societal norms - for example, a big reason why many young people can't move out of their parent's house or find meaningful income can be traced to the dollar's lowering value.No, prices of housing relative to income is high in the U.S. right now because there is a shortage of housing, mostly because we haven't built enough houses in the last 15 years. That doesn't have anything to do with the value of the dollar. The dollar has been losing value for more than a hundred years, but the percentage of people owning homes has either stayed the same or gone up almost every decade.*Don't confuse the value of a dollar with the the value of people's income.* The value of the dollar has gone down almost every single year, but most years the people's income goes up more than prices!Back when the Federal Reserve was created, more than 40% of Americans' income went to pay for food! Now it's about 15%. The value of the dollar went down, but the value of income relative to food went up.\\n 3\\\\. Quality of food/goods 4\\\\.

This was super common discourse in academic circles circa 2020, and it dates back beyond that. The basic idea is that white culture is so inherently racist that the culture largely needs to be thrown out and replaced with people who aren't inherently racist. It is a problem identified, typically, as exclusive to white people, but can be shared with anyone perceived as a \\"colonizer\\" regardless of race. I've heard one person say it was genetic but it is usually considered a deeply entrenched cultural problem (I'm a biologist so genetic claims weren't exactly entertained in my circles).It derives from Marxist ideas of the intrinsic purity of the oppressed and intrinsic evil of those in power. If you look into \\"whiteness\\" discourse from that era you can find some interesting vitriol. I wasn't exposed to it on the Internet, I was exposed to it in real life conversations with scientists in academia. It's largely why I distanced myself from leftists in academia, the watershed moment being when a committee I served on didn't invite a scientist to speak in 2021 who studied molecular mechanisms of immunity to pandemic diseases because *he* was *white*. We then looked at the race and sex of other potential speakers people had identified before making a decision, and that was the last time I served on that committee. The committee was all people with or pursuing PhDs in STEM, mostly some field of biology.I definitely don't hear about whiteness as some evil entity as much as I used to.

Given first the difficulty of getting people to answer land lines (skew towards olds) or phones in general from unknown numbers (skew towards olds, maybe lonely people), and understanding online polls are hot garbage, where can they get reliable data from?Even their takes (and most, IMO) on the betting sites get it wrong.  Sports betting isn't about Vegas knowing the odds of what's going to happen.  They make money on the spread, not getting it right.  They're predicting what the crowd will bet.  They simply set the line initially, then the market will dictate what the line moves to.

You describe people as alternately viewing White men as inherently evil and as being disposed to oppression within our society. But these are very different ideas. The basic reality is that, within America, White men wield forms of hegemonic power, and people outside that group get oppressed in a variety of ways. Being at the top of a society's power structure is liable to give you a different perspective, on both the world and politics, than being at the bottom. It's not just some wild coincidence that the people supporting things like school segregation or Black voter disenfranchisement have historically been White.?the article even says \\"It's not God-fearing Muslims that are the threat here\\"I think you're taking this a bit out of context. The article talks throughout about various forms of fearmongering about Muslims. Stuff about Muslim migrants doing crime, witch hunts surrounding \\"Muslim grooming gangs\\", that kind of thing. The point being made is that Muslims living in England are not the problem, not that Muslims are magically free of issue. Because, as the article points out, White people form the power structures within England.At the risk of being a little unfair to them, I'd wager that you're being perhaps far too charitable to the author of the article I postedLooking closer at the article, my reading seems like a pretty fair one. The article does talk a bit imprecisely when it speaks of worldwide structures, but it follows that up by speaking exclusively about English society and politics. It talks extensively about ways that White men are in power, and how the centralization of that power has caused problems. I don't see much if anything within the article about how White men are some kind of doomed people, cursed to forever be at the ass end of any political structure that could theoretically exist.Honestly, from the way they (and others) write, I don't think they'd believe POC could ever support someone like ModiI'm not really all that sure why. Especially because such an assessment would demand this author be totally ignorant of basic facts within the world. In particular, that Modi sees substantial popular support.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

That article indicates that women are just as interested in politics up to high school, but that there are not as encouraged to partake in that carreer as the time goes by, by their families and society. It is also interesting that you dont correlate the \\"much higher rates of volunteering in women\\" - which is unpaid political work - to the interest to bettering society. On the contrary: what better indicator that someone has a high interest in doing something, like  politics, if they'll do it even for FREE?That data also doesnt prove that thats an inherigted female trait by any means; in fact, it is unscientific to assume so. Considering women's history, the only thing it does is that it begs the question of whether this is a nature or nurture issue. And that article itself have demonstrated that it is probably more so nurture.Also, there is research that shows that women - and many other minorities - are also more likely to participate in high ranking job positions if the due process is focused solely on them, like some sort of affirmative action. Im not making a case about how elections should be; I am demonstrating that it is not quite a lack of interest that hinders women from running for office, but probably the belief that if they do, it will be a waste of time.Also, forget women, if this was just about menhood, then men of different races and etnicities would also be, proportionally to their amount in society, just as likely to be able to run for office. But thats not the case.

However, if I may just say a few things-!\\\\I'm skeptical that anyone views straight White men as some inherently harmful category, as if these qualities create a genetic predisposition to being oppressive assholes.?Unfortunately, it seems as if you don't have to go very far on the internet (especially social media) at all to find a vast number of people who do view white men as inherently evil - or, at least, more disposed to oppression than other groups of people, with their comments sometimes fetching approving 'likes' in the hundreds of thousands.Now, I am aware that using social media comments is hardly a scientific (least of all academic!) approach to the situation - but this attitude is certainly out there, though I appreciate it is just one of many crank philosophies that have exploded alongside the reach of the internet in general.\\\\If you asked the writer of the article, I'm sure they'd tell you the same thingOn this point I'm less certain. I don't know the author personally, and I don't want to assume they believe straight white men are genetically predisposed to oppressive behaviour, but they do certainly seem to have an extremely low opinion of straight white men in general, and believe they're more likely to be \\"a problem\\" than other groups of people - the article even says \\"It's not God-fearing Muslims that are the threat here\\", before going out of its way to tell you how white straight white men are the cause of numerous problems in our society, and concluding they're the demographic you need to be afraid of. Whether that's because of their genetics, the author probably doesn't think this, but they do seem to take the stance that the white man is the root of most evil, and that the white man \\"Being less idiotic\\" would lead to less evil - on which grounds I can only protest:\\\\- Why do we think the white man is idiotic in the first place?\\\\- Is there proof other demographics would be less prone to the kind of idiocy the author rails against?I chose this article merely because it best illustrates the kind of attitude I disparage in my OP; but there are several others of a similar bent out there.However, as for the rest of your comment:\\\\\\"In our society, there is a group which is empowered in a political sense, and treated as the norm in a cultural sense. This group being in possession of that hegemonic power lends itself to some bad outcomes. We should distribute that power more equitably, both because power being distributed equitably is a positive thing in and of itself, but also because power spread more evenly is liable to lead to better outcomes in some fashion.\\"While I'd still caution against group thinking, as it still carries the risk of generalisation at best (one might ask which \\"straight white men\\" count as culturally normal/have power?), and essentialism at worst (does everyone in the hegemonic group believe the same thing?), I DO believe you have made a much fairer and stronger argument on this position than many others I have seen. At the risk of being a little unfair to them, I'd wager that you're being perhaps too charitable to the author of the article I posted -I'm not entirely sure they'd phrase the true meaning of their writing anywhere near as eloquently as you did! However, \\"in group hegemony\\" is indeed a real issue, which can lead to negative outcomes for those in the out group, as you say. Any number of post colonial African states can attest the truth of that!It's strange; the way you personally have phrased the argument, is one I don't necessarily disagree with, even if I still have some caution in approaching it. So yes, I would say my mind is changed on this front;  that in group hegemony can be problematic, I just don't necessarily believe that phrasing that problem as a specifically \\"white men vs everyone else\\" (as this, and other articles, do) is helpful, and causes more problems than it solves.\\\\And the article's authors probably aren't actually cool with Modi supporters.Honestly, from the way they (and others) write, I don't think they'd believe POC could ever support someone like Modi - which leads to a whole  other discussion about the prevalence of \\"noble savage\\" ideology among certain liberals, but I am willing to concede that a criticism of \\"straight white men\\" (flawed as that may be) does not necessarily lead to a condoning of oppressive behaviours from other groups.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

I agree with your endgoal. I disagree with your path. Also i both disagree and agree about your view on past and present.

Ignoring the reality of discrimination those people have to endure is some kind of soft racism. As someone who was almost never the target of racism i understood that my egalitarian view won't erase the experiences of discrimination of the other people.  THere is path path to acknowledge that discrimination still exists without being apologetic. THere is a way to show compassion without pity. There is a way of reducing racism without erasing the past. What i learned from the passt generation is that this race blindness does not work. I was also seduced by this simple focus of moving past race and gender. But fact is that its not something i can change drastically over night.  Simply not being racist ist not enough. I am activly anti racist, so that racism is activly reduced. I understand how you think that now race and gende ris more important that ever. But please bear in mind that for example in germany there was a media analysis of who speaks about the topic of gendering. And it came out that the afd, the right wing talked about it like 70% of the time. ANd what they said was mostly:\\"the green left always talks about gendering our language!

Look, I recognise that by this point I have probably been deemed a Nazi, and most people will have downvoted before reading the rest, if they even read the rest.But the reality, and this is a reality that Jews often speak of positively, is that there is a disproportionate amount of Jews running the media, and intelligentsia.4 of the 5 'Big 5' media corporations have Jewish executives. Same with the Big 5 tech platforms, as well as social media.Jews are presidents (please correct me if I've recalled anything wrong) of 7 of the 8 top Ivy League universities. This is up from 4 of 8 after 3 non Jewish presidents were ousted for 'antisemitism'.I actually *disagree* that 'Jews own everything'. They don't. But they have a disproportionate amount of control.Now, why is it that even pointing this out, let alone the consequences, makes one a Nazi, when the very same media and intelligentsia have convinced us that it is actually *whites* who have disproportionate control. Why do Jews often claim to be white when it comes to criticism of their control, but then suddenly stop being white when it comes to setting up an Israeli ethnostate?Now, I want to actually say something of substance. I really don't want to be one of those 'DA JOOOOS' people, and even if I am deemed as such, at the very least I want to provide a perspective that is nuanced and not just hateful rambling.Jews have historically been ethnically cleansed by European whites. Arab Muslims too, but European whites have historically held far more global power.Immediately then, we can start to reason and not just shout 'DA JOOS because DA JOOS'. If Jews have historically been subject to genocides, pogroms, and expulsions by religious, nationalist whites with strong, cohesive identities, what could Jews do to make sure that never happens again?They could use their control of the media and intelligentsia to engage in longitudinal reeducation of the populace at a generational level. They could make 'whiteness' something to be ashamed of. They could make 'the whites' appear as though they are the only group to have engaged in ruthless empire building and genocidal atrocities. And while most people understand they aren't, and may have certain understandings at a logical level, they could emotionally prime us to feel a certain way. And emotions are more powerful than logic.We all know this. Ask anyone and they'll say logically that whites and blacks should be treated the same. But we all know that writing a book called 'The problem with white people' is rarely controversial, whereas writing a book called 'The problem with black people' would be career suicide.What could they do to neutralise the threat of Christian nationalism? They could firstly use the media and intelligentsia to break down Christian values, and spread liberalism. For those who remain passionately Christian, they could instead subvert it, convincing evangelical Christians that Israel is America's ally and that the Jews are God's chosen people.Now the best way to analyse a correlation is to see if it holds in changing scenarios. That's not a very valid epistemology in such a complex and nuanced area as human society, but I'd just like to share one observation we could all agree on.Ever since the Israel Palestine flareup since last October, has anyone else noticed that liberalism and leftism has been toned down on the quiet? Suddenly DEI and critical race theory is not talked about as much. Biden has been thrown under the bus in lieu of Kamala who is more relatable, but less divisive and 'virtue signalling', or at the very least, can authentically talk about identity politics as opposed to an 80 year old member of the silent generation who has no connection to current issues.And has anyone noticed similarly that Trump is not what he used to be? Yes, people hate Trump for things he's said and done, but look at him *now* .He is becoming more of a 'politician', and less of a loose cannon. He has come out and essentially implied women's rights to choose would be protected. He has become more conciliatory regarding the transgender issue. And more importantly, he cares far more about Israel than America.Why are all these changes happening? Could it be because the liberal mindsets that protected Jews from Christian nationalist backlash, has now backfired as those liberals now see what Israel is doing to Palestine as an example of 'white man bad'.And due to this, could Jews have realised that liberalism has gone too far, ousted 'antisemitic' liberal college presidents, and begun to swing the pendulum back the other way? And could Jewish billionaires who used to hate Trump publicly now be donating him (you can check who donates to him most) to secure control of Trump and in doing so, ensure the MAGA cult who worship Trump can never pose a threat to Jewry? It's important to be able to talk about these things, without there being a binary between one side calling the other Nazis, and then actual Nazis going round talking about 'DA JOOS'.Jews are people. They are not evil. They are not rubbing their hands together plotting and scheming. They are, like any other nation, interested in not being ethnically cleansed, and they, from their perspective, have a valid reason to fear a white Christian collective.So can we not then analyse this in a non emotional way? Can we not see how regardless of the ostensible ideas and motives of left and right wing organisations, it is reasonable to see that they serve the self preservation of the Jewish people? And if I was a Jew, I sure as hell would want to do all I can to ensure the safety of my people.I know I'm not going to avoid downvotes, but I hope at least I've been able to provide a rational view that isn't just hateful rambling.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

In addition to Citizens United and Harambe, I think a big part of the madness was the Clintons being back in the spotlight. As much as we all loved Hillarys bonafides as a diplomat and administrative wonk, *Why Nations Fail* enthusiasts only make up a small niche of the voter pool. Her background and competence didnt really matter to a population that had been marinaded in decades of conspiracy theories about the Clinton family. She so repulsed a broad swathe of voters that they were uniquely susceptible to a menagerie of populists on the left and right fringes. For better or worse, the old accusations against Bill Clinton probably helped neutralize the many, many accusations of sexual impropriety leveled against Trump and his followers. I care more about what Bill did than what Trump said, was everywhere after the Access Hollywood tape dropped. Looking back, I think that was the first major threshold of cognitive dissonance for them. Loathing the Clintons made it an easier sell at the time, and immunized them to other credible accusations against Trump.Without an easy deflection, I cant really picture a 2016 with Biden as the nominee where Trump remains as competitive after the Access Hollywood tape. Similarly, Trumps bullshit with Humayan Khan would have hit a lot harder if Biden had been able to drawn comparisons to Beaus own military service. I genuinely cant imagine a scenario where Bidens the 2016 nominee where Sanders gets any traction either, let alone lingers to the point of harming the Dem ticket. Without the Bernie was cheated conspiracy theories to solidify a following, the Dirtbag Left remains a disconnected crowd of loudmouths. QAnon couldnt have caught on without the Clinton Body Count, and Epstein would have actively harmed Trump significantly more than any active Dems. Gaming out this alt timeline a bit further, my hunch is that the Tea Party movement morphs into something a bit more vicious under Trump and Steve Bannon. Trump gets a primetime show on Fox or starts his own network, but establishment Rs widely blame him for tanking winning candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. President Biden and [CDC Director Frieden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Frieden) do an admirable job in the early days of COVID. However, the credible accusations of sexual assault and harassment leveled against Dr Frieden derails the early momentum Bidens version of Operation Warp Speed. Frieden resigns, but the country is forced to endure months of insufferable believe women, penetrative vaccines are rape! memes from antivaxers.

You didn't seem to take issue with the claim that Lilly Allen has fewer accomplishments than \\"Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's pet goldfish\\" which is obviously false according to most measures. \\"[Hyperbole ](https://literarydevices.net/hyperbole/#:~:text=Hyperbole%20is%20a%20figure%20of%20speech%20and%20literary,often%20used%20for%20serious%2C%20comic%2C%20or%20ironic%20effects)is often a boldly overstated or exaggerated claim or statement that adds emphasis without the intention of being literally true.\\"To take statements which are clearly intended to address the political environment in a particular English-speaking, western country and argue that they are false, literally, because of counter examples in other countries is a violation of the basic expectations of communication. We could consider it silly if, in response to someone exclaiming on a sunny day, \\"Wow, the whole sky is blue!\\", someone started arguing \\"actually, half the sky is dark right now on the other side of the world. And the sky isn't actually blue, you just perceive it to be blue due to refraction.\\" While, in a sense, such a pedantic response is not factually incorrect, it fails to respond to the intention and meaning of the original words. This is what you have done with the argument regarding the need for White men to share political and cultural power in western, English speaking countries.Your examples of non-white dominance and hegemony are fallacious since many historians argue that British Colonial policies led to the rise of Hindu Nationalism and Modi, and western policies of interference produced the Taliban and enabled them to gain power. Obviously, all interpretations of history are contested, but it is impossible to consider India's national politics or the Taliban's influence without considering the role that western colonialism played. The Indian Councils Act from the early 1900's as well as policies like divide and rule and partitioning Bengal contributed to internal divisions and growing Hindu nationalism in India. The US and Soviet Union were manipulating Afghan politics in the 1950's and actively arming jihadists in the 1980's. The Taliban emerged from the mujahideen groups who had been equipped offered training by the US.   Although the CIA denies it, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and US Congressman Rand Paul have asserted that Osama bin Laden was armed and trained by the US in the 1980's.In short, the two examples that you provide from non-western countries are the result of white men meddling in other countries.

However most of it is private laborso domestic labor like cooking, cleaning, and childcare and/or through things like forced marriage. Youre right that most consumer goods are made using grossly exploitative labor practices, but chattel slavery and sweat shops are very different things. Even though both are based on radically underpaying workers for their labor, chattel slavery was a much more totalizing system. Garment workers who make 5 cents an hour are being horrifically exploited. And thats not even mentioning the physical and sexual abuse that many sweatshop laborers face. And the fact that they often dont get paid on time or work in safe conditions. But sweatshop workers can quit. They can move. If they have a baby their boss doesnt own their baby and get to sell it to another factory owner.There are weird gray areas where employers will hold an employees passport or id cards or whatever and wont give them back until they pay back wildly inflated fees to encourage them to not quit. Thats much closer to slavery, but again, we cant ignore the fact that for actual slaves there was no quit and lose my passport or stay for a chance to get it back choice.

America would literally not exist without it. Thats why its part of our Constitution.And its not going anywhere because it will always benefit one party or another electorally, though which one may shift, and that party will always benefit opposed to changing the Constitution to elect the President by popular vote.So, thems the rules of the game and Democrats need to accept them if they want power. Make DC and PR states if you want it to work for you. Now, that said, it really isnt really that bad. This structure moves liberal presidential candidates to the right marginally on policy to attract voters to in swing states rather than trying to just run up the numbers amongst the base in large blue states. We still get candidates that represent the overall preferences of the two parties, and Democrats that are more centrist than they would otherwise be. Problems like gerrymandering, for example, are MUCH larger problems for democracy because it can result in a legislative body that doesnt at all represent the preferences of the voters. To your specific points:1) the electoral college empowers a specific kind of disaffected low-education white male voter who is not representative of the country as a whole.This misunderstands the demographics of swing states. The states with high concentrations of these voters are solidly Republican. They are not swing states. Swing states have that kind of demographic diversity that leads to party preferences being much more even. They look more like the country than populace states like Texas or California that always go to one party.2) The electoral college distorts policy, for example discouraging free trade that Americans like.You should look at polling on this. You like free trade. Your elite neoliberal friends like free trade. The American people think weve had too much and want less. Our politicians have heard that, and a new consensus has emerged. Thats democracy working.3) the electoral college makes margins in specific counties or cities nationally decisive.This is simply wrong no matter how many people write stories about Bucks County. Every vote in a state counts exactly the same. Parties are running statewide campaigns and every vote counts the same.4) the electoral college makes it easier for foreign actors to interfere with our elections. There is zero evidence foreign actors are capable of hacking election systems and changing outcomes. To the extent these actors are trying to meddle, their goal is broad disaffection and cynicism that undermines our institutions and pressures politicians to disengage internationally. This requires a broad-based campaign to influence public opinion, which is not at all about how we elect a president.","title":"The electoral college sucks"},{"text":"I only get paid minimum wage at a job for about a month or so.

The article you cite investigates the reason women are less likely to run for office as the outcome of several factors including self-doubt about their fitness for office, lack of encouragement from family/friends/social network (compared to men), candidate recruiting practices, and more. These are all heavily informed by cultural attitudes around gender.The article also does not support your statement that \\"women don't feel the same obligation to society to run for public office\\" to the extent it implies that men's greater inclination to run for office stems from them feeling some greater obligation to society. Rather, the researcher asked men and women, \\"If you wanted to make your community or country a better place, which path would you be most likely to pursue?\\" and had them choose from different options. Women overwhelmingly selected \\"Work for a charity\\" (40%) vs. \\"Run for office\\" (15%), while men had a fairly even split slightly favoring running for office (27%/28%). Additionally, 10% more women than men stated that volunteering to improve their communities was important or very important. So what the article actually states is that women feel a greater sense of obligation to their communities but do not see running for office as a likely path to serve those communities. This is consistent with women feeling that running for office is not a viable path.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

A simple and often overlooked example in the US is the fact that legally, women couldn't conduct banking business until the 1960's without male co-signers, and until the 1970's bank were still permitted to refuse service to women without male cosigners.The problem is not simply that power is concentrated in a few people (1/10th in your example) but that the power is leveraged to benefit people who are part of those people's in-group. Laws preventing 50.5% of the population from freely conducting business wouldn't have been enacted if that part of the population exercised 50.5% of the political power and it is silly to pretend otherwise.You are also failing to acknowledge that most who advocate for equitable distribution of power are not just advocating for a change in the demographic make-up of those at the top, but are also advocating for less concentration of power through things like ranked choice voting, stronger labor organization, expansion of voting rights, increased regulation of campaign contributions, etc.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

There were two plans, the New Jersey Plan and the Virginia Plan (no New Jersey Compromise, there was a Connecticut Compromise).\\n2. The New Jersey Plan supported equal representation of all states regardless of size. It had no provision for weighted congressional representation, because all congressional representation would be equal. At the time, people were worried that:\\n   * a) Big states like New York would be able to override the will of small states like **New Jersey**, not slave states like Virginia\\n   * b) Slave states were growing quickly, so there was a worry that a population base approach would grant them more power\\n3. The 3/5ths compromise was a way to curb the power of slave states, despite comments here snidely claiming otherwise. Slave states wanted slaves to be counted as a full person for the sake of congressional representation(they still wouldn't be allowed to vote).  This would allow them to be overrepresented in a unicameral legislature that was elected by popular vote.\\n4. Slave states were not particularly rural, at least not as how we think about it now.  Yes, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston were dominant, but there were a lot of very rural northern states (hence the New Jersey Plan was supported by states like Delaware). Slavery was not the only issue rural states were worried about. The most populous state minus slaves, according to the first Census, was **Virginia.** Followed by Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York, and then **North Carolina, Maryland.** Bolded the prominent slave states.\\n5.

[As Adolph Reed Jr. and Walter Benn Michaels put it:](https://nonsite.org/the-trouble-with-disparity/) It is well known by now that whites have more net wealth than blacks at every income level, and the overall racial difference in wealth is massive. Why cant antiracism solve this problem? Because, as Robert Manduca has shown, the fact that blacks were overrepresented among the poor at the beginning of a period in which low income workers of all races have been hurt by the changes in American economic life has meant that they have borne the brunt of those changes.^1 The lack of progress in overcoming the white/black wealth gap has been a function of the increase in the rich/poor wealth gap. In fact, if you look at how white and black wealth are distributed in the U.S., you see right away that the very idea of racial wealth is an empty one. The top 10 percent of white people have 75 percent of white wealth; the top 20 percent have virtually all of it. And the same is true for black wealth. The top 10 percent of black households hold 75 percent of black wealth. That means, as Matt Bruenig of the Peoples Policy Project recently noted, the overall racial wealth disparity is driven almost entirely by the disparity between the wealthiest 10 percent of white people and the wealthiest 10 percent of black people. While Bruenig is clear that a discernible wealth gap exists across class levels, he explored the impact of eliminating the gap between the bottom 90 percent of each group and found that after doing so 77.5 percent of the overall gap would remain. He then examined the effect of eliminating the wealth gap between the bottom 50 percentthe median pointof each population and found that doing so would eliminate only 3 percent of the racial gap. So, 97 percent of the racial wealth gap exists among the wealthiest half of each population. And, more tellingly, more than three-fourths of it is concentrated in the top 10 percent of each. If you say to those white people in the bottom 50 percent (people who have basically no wealth at all) that the basic inequality in the U.S. is between black and white, they know you are wrong. More tellingly, if you say the same thing to the black people in the bottom 50 percent (people who have even less than no wealth at all), they also know you are wrong. Its not all the white people who have the money; its the top ten percent of (mainly) whites, and some blacks and some Asians. The wealth gap among all but the wealthiest blacks and whites is dwarfed by the class gap, the difference between the wealthiest and everyone else across the board. [...] Even as a program for addressing racial disparities, antiracism is not much of a remedy for inequality. If the racial wealth gap were somehow eliminated up and down the distribution, 90 percent of black people would still have only 25 percent of total wealth, and the top 10 percent of blacks would still hold 75 percent. And this is only to be expected because in a society with sharp and increasing overall inequality, eliminating racial gaps in the distribution of advantages and disadvantages by definition does not affect the larger, and more fundamental, pattern of inequality. That inadequacy becomes clearer when we consider the argumentative sleight-of-hand that drives disparity discourse. What were actually saying every time we insist that the basic inequality is between blacks and whites is that the only inequalities we care about are those produced by some form of discriminationthat inequality itself isnt the problem, its only the inequalities produced by racism and sexism, etc. What disparity discourse tells us is that, if you have an economy thats getting more and more unequal, thats mainly generating jobs that dont even pay a living wage, the problem we need to solve is not how to reduce that inequality and not how to make those jobs better but how to make sure that they arent disproportionately held by black and brown people. Its true, as political scientist Preston H. Smith II has shown, that in the form of what he calls racial democracy, some black people have championed the ideal of a hierarchical ladder on which blacks and other nonwhites would be represented on every rung in rough proportion to their representation in the general population.^2 But the fact that some black people have desired it doesnt make racial democracy desirable. As we have noted, separately, together, and repeatedly, the implication of proportionality as the metric of social justice is that the society would be just if 1 percent of the population controlled 90 percent of the resources so long as 13 percent of the 1 percent were black, 14 percent were Hispanic, half were women, etc. Complaints about disproportionality are liberal math. And a politics centered on challenging disproportionality comes with the imprimatur of no less a Doctor of the Church of Left Neoliberalism than economist Paul Krugman, who asserted in his role as ideologist for the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign that horizontal inequality, i.e., inequalities measured between racially or culturally defined groups, is whats really important in America and dismissed Sen. Bernie Sanders elaborate program for social-democratic redistribution as a pipe dream.^3 Its the fixation on disproportionality that tells us the increasing wealth of the one percent would be OK if only there more black, brown, and LGBTQIA+ billionaires. And the fact that antiracism and antidiscrimination of all kinds would validate rather than undermine the stratification of wealth in American society is completely visible to those who currently possess that wealthall the rich people eager to embark on a course of moral purification (antiracist training) but with no interest whatsoever in a politics (social-democratic redistribution) that would alter the material conditions that make them rich. By contrast, the strain in black politics that converged around what Smith calls the social- (rather than racial-)democratic ideal proceeded from the understanding that, because most black Americans are in the working classand disproportionately so, partly because of the same effects of past and current racism we allude to aboveblack people would also benefit disproportionately from redistributive agendas that expand social wage policies and enhance the living standards and security of working people universally. The tension between those two ideals of social justice, as Smith indicates, was, and is, a tension arising from differences in perception and values rooted in different class positions. Thus the fact that, over the last half century (as American society has reached new heights of inequality and as Democrats have done very little more than Republicans to combat it), the racial-democratic principle in black politics, and in the society in general, has displaced the social-democratic one, has been a victory for the classblack and whitethat has supported it. In its insistence that proportionality is the only defensible norm and metric of social justice, antiracist politics rejects universal programs of social-democratic redistribution in favor of what is ultimately a racial trickle-down approach according to which making more black people rich and rich black people richer is a benefit to all black people. [...] We can see how this works in a recent report from the National Womens Law Center, which, in the context of the current health crisis, found not only that Black women are disproportionately represented in front-line jobs providing essential public services but also that the black women doing these jobs are typically paid just 89 cents for every dollar typically paid to white, non-Hispanic men in the same roles.^4 For example,the median hourly wage for white, non-Hispanic personal care aides, home health aides and nursing assistants (at the very front of the front lines) is $14.42; the median hourly wage for black women doing the same job is $12.84. When the authors of the survey say that This difference in wages results in an annual loss that can be devastating for Black women and their families that were already struggling to make ends meet before the public health critics, they are right. And this is precisely the kind of injustice that the battle against disparity is meant to address. But it is also precisely the kind of injustice that reveals the class character of that battle. The white men are making $14.42! Disparity tells us the problem to solve is the $1.58 an hour difference between the black women and the white men. Reality tells us that the extra $1.58 wont rescue those women from precarity. The men are also being paid starvation wages! In fact, everyone receiving an hourly wage of less than $20 an hour is in a precarious economic position. And the problem here is not just that this report makes no reference to the need to raise the wages of all the workers in front-line occupational categories. Every time we cast the objectionable inequality in terms of disparity we make the fundamental injusticethe difference between what front-line workers make and what their bosses and the shareholders in the corporations their bosses work for makeeither invisible, or worse. Because if your idea of social justice is making wages for underpaid black women equal to those of slightly less underpaid white men, you either cant see the class structure or you have accepted the class structure. The extent to which even nominal leftists ignore this reality is an expression of the extent of neoliberalisms ideological victory over the last four decades. Indeed, if we remember Margaret Thatchers dictum, Economics are the method: the object is to change the soul, the weaponizing of antiracism to deploy liberal morality as the solution to capitalisms injustices makes it clear its the soul of the left she had in mind.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

Theyve been told that theyre the special ones who will get into Heaven while the outsiders will suffer.  And they prefer taking a God did it/Gods will approach that allows them not to actually think critically about complicated or tough subjects, or hold themselves and others accountable. They look at some silver-tongued con-man who gets up and speaks to them on a national level, and theyre already comfortable with this kind of person and this kind of talk because thats the sort of person who runs their congregation.

The sliver of land is not the main issue. That would be the hundreds of thousands of Arabs killed and expelled over the years, even before the current genocide.2. If Jews want to use 2,000 year old sovereignty as an excuse not only to reconquer the land, but engage in the atrocities mentioned, then pretty much the entire world has a green light to begin killing eachother using the same criterion.Of course we all know Jews realise this is illogical. Jews just want a reason to attribute to their atrocities, to give the impression they aren't committed purely out of group narcissism and bloodlust for collective punishment. The total disregard for basic humanity displayed by Jews over the last year in particular is driving an exponential increase in hatred of Jewry, globally.And while most Jews are not directly complicit, and indeed many of them speak out against it, Jews as a group, due to tacit approval if not direct support, are being increasingly hated.Do you not think it's time for some introspection? Jews have been thrown out of hundreds of countries, not because all Jews were bad, but because influential Jews engaged in the same type of selfish, narcissist, exploitative, manipulative, and subversive behaviour as seen In Palestine today, and the vast majority of the remaining Jews either approved, or simply did not speak out.And each time they are thrown out, they arrive in some other country begging to save them from persecution, and each time, they go back to their old ways.Humans are not spontaneous, they are efficient, and they recognise patterns. Jews haven't repeatedly been expelled because of spontaneous eruption of Xenophobia. They simply see *some* Jews engaging in harmful behaviour, see *most* Jews supporting it or keeping quiet, and realise that the only efficient solution is to eject them all from the country.Remember that people back then didn't have concepts of liberalism and protected characteristics. They didn't think 'Hmmm most Jews are engaging in or supporting this behaviour, but hey I can't discriminate based on race so better not expel them because surely not all Jews are bad l!' They didn't care.Even if you disagree with everything I've said, or think I'm some kind of racist or fascist for highlighting the human condition, then at least, thinking purely selfishly and from a place of self preservation, could Jews start to accept, recognise, and apologise for the actions of their group, just as Europeans are expected to do so now? Might that set a path where Jews are more likely to be trusted, and that breaks those long held stereotypes about Jews due to millenia of inductive reasoning? Could this lead to a more prosperous and peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs, and indeed all gentiles?","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"All of these organizations that normally endorse a candidate but refuse to do so this year.

It seems like everyone here is arguing about how to make our current class system equitable on every other metric, which I suppose is a fine goal for the short term because if we solve that it allows us to focus on the bigger problem. However, as long as class is a driving force in our society, we won't be able to fully solve all the other issues because race, gender, sexual orientation, and other identities will be weaponized by the upper class to keep the lower class from rising up.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

At the time of the EC's creation, the states were effectively self-sufficient countries and the smaller or less populous ones, like the slaves states, were genuinely fearful of joining a union where they were at a permanent electoral disadvantage; they were afraid that a large state like New York could just muscle its way into always winning the presidency and enacting policies that favored New York over the weaker members, like outlawing slavery which the South depended on for their economic survival. (before anyone says the South should have changed their economic way of life to be less evil, that's with the benefit of over a century of hindsight, industrialization and social/racial progress that the Founders didn't have and as \\"independent\\" states they were focused purely on self-interest and realpolitik which in geopolitics is always cold and brutal)The EU has a similar problem currently where as independent states each member is granted a veto on all policy that requires every new rule to have unanimous approval which causes problems when the EU tries to make free-trade deals since the farmers of any state can torpedo any deal they don't like. This veto rule needs to go if the EU is to continue to grow, but the small states have no incentive to agree to a new voting scheme since any system based on popular vote puts them at a permanent disadvantage to France and Germany whose economic mass already gives massive amounts of influence over EU policy. As much as the EC gets hated on this sub, it would actually be beneficial if the EU adopted its own version of the EC where the small states could feel confident that surrendering their sovereignty wouldn't just result in them becoming defacto extensions of France/Germany. Additionally, these conversations about abolishing the EC always pop-up every election and they always go nowhere because there are only two practical ways to remove the EC: civil war or constitutional amendment. The South would never have agreed to the removal of the 3/5's rule at the time without being forced to at gunpoint from a victorious North; the South and other small states will never voluntarily agree to a new system that disadvantages them without having a gun pointed to their heads via a new civil war, so all these discussions over removing the EC are ultimately futile.","title":"The electoral college sucks"},{"text":"And anyway, he always surrounds himself with the best people, so I am sure they can take some of the load","title":"Donald Trump showing 'obvious mental decline', Michelle Obama says"},{"text":"Realistically id expect that.

When we prioritize policies that reduce inequality, support community safety, and provide realistic pathways to citizenship, we create a safer, more equitable society for everyone.And yes, its crucial to vote thoughtfully, but thoughtful voting includes supporting leaders who address these issues directly, not through scapegoating but with genuine policies that build up communities across the board.","title":"Trump Spews Anti-Immigrant Hate Speech; Harris Joined by Obama, Celebs in Final Days of Campaign"},{"text":"We need teen pregnancies to fund up our state corruption. - Missouri Attorney General","title":"Kamala Harris says her first priority as president is to \\"stop this pain\\" resulting from abortion bans"},{"text":"It is about spreading the TYPES of people in charge so that the decisions can take into consideration REAL issues that hit in different demographicsI want former teachers, plumbers, doctors, civil workers, moms of autistic children, religious, non religious, men, women, lgbtq+ , straight, ALL races and backgrounds, poor, middle class, small business owners, physically disabled, mentally disabled, etc etcTheres so many types of people I cant list them all!!

Women in Afghanistan are living under an Islamist theocracy and we are unlikely to end up in that kind of situation short of a massive demographic shift. Even your hardcore maga people arent going to go around slapping burkas on women and banning dancing on television. Its just not going to happen. It wasnt the case in the 1800s, so short of massive Muslim immigration and political change related to that its just not an option. I say that as someone whos very closely acquainted with the Middle East. Id also be careful about saying things like lost the right to decide how their bodies are used. I see why you might say that considering the abortion laws changing, but the more we introduce hyperbole into arguments the less effective they become, because someone looking from the outside (or from the right wing) might say were just being hysterical. For the record, Im very pro abortion. I dont know that I wanted to have to say that, but I feel forced to considering the current political climate. Next, we have to figure out why people are voting for trump, and others who may limit abortion rights. Theyre doing it for *some* reason, and I assure you its not as simple as lets keep those b*tches pregnant. My best conceptualization of it is that theres a large number of majority white people, possibly with traditional values, that are very tired of *something* going on in left wing politics. If I had to put it to words, Id probably say theyre tired of identity politics and anti racist policies that end up being racist policies against whites (see the whole privilege rhetoric, discrimination based on race in universities, etc). Ill add that our depiction of trump voters as toothless hillbillies who like to shoot guns and fuck their cousins while voting for Hitler isnt helping. If I was the democrats, I would aim to tone down the rhetoric immediately. Theyre not toothless hillbillies. Theyre normal people with more conservative values than you and I. Theyre not Nazis. Theyre tired of immigration and want to preserve their culture, an argument we would absolutely allow if they werent white. Theyre not gay hating transgender killers. Theyre people who arent comfortable with the public expression of LGBT related things (think men in assless chaps marching through a religious Jewish or Muslim community, and now consider that some devout Christians may not love it either). Next, we find common ground and compromise. Maybe we are all (or, most of us are) for freedom of sexual orientation in the bedroom, but we dont all agree with princess story time at the library. Ok, either that means that half of us are evil, or that means that we find other ways to support expression of sexual and gender identity that doesnt make it so traditionalists cant take their kids to the library. With regard to abortion rights, I think we could take the stance that abortion can be regulated on a state level, but that the federal government provides and funds accessible abortion services for interested women *somewhere*. Maybe that means free transportation and abortions in California for anyone thats willing to hop on a plane. Maybe its some other middle of the path solution. What we arrive at if we take the more aggressive path of demonizing those we dont agree with and trying to change things by force rather than by compromise is trump.I get that you want to see change happen *now*. I get that at 50 you wonder how much time you have left to leave your daughters with a world they want to live in. But rapid jerky movements create turbulence, and it doesnt serve your interest or mine. We need to walk back the rhetoric. We need to move away from calling people evil for disagreeing with our views. We need to stop throwing Hitler and Nazism around because thats not what this is, even by a long shot. We need to move away from categorizing people by skin colour and sex. We need to stop acting like everyone whos against abortion is saying that because they want to be raping women and tying them up in basements. These things make it nearly impossible to reason with the other side. And if we cant reason, we fight. Lastly social media. Have you seen what things look like these days? The catchy sound bites aimed at virtue signalling by shitting on conservatives and demonizing them? What message does that send out?Reasoned, open debate, free of demonization, and one that includes nuanced views instead of me good you bad oonga boonga nonsense. Tribalism is a danger, not a good thing. Tribalism is what makes the Middle East the war torn shit hole that it is.

This isnt about diminishing any individuals value but about recognizing the historical concentration of power and its impact on diverse representation and policies that reflect the needs of the broader population.Historically, decision-making in much of the Western world has largely been in the hands of a relatively homogenous group. This has resulted in policies that often overlook, or even harm, underrepresented communities. Studies have shown that diverse leadership brings more equitable outcomes. For example, research by McKinsey &amp; Company has demonstrated that companies with diverse boards are more innovative and perform better financially because they benefit from varied perspectives and lived experiences.Furthermore, numerous studies in political science indicate that diverse leadership fosters policies more attuned to public welfare, including healthcare, education, and equal rights. When leadership is more representative, it tends to address issues like gender pay gaps, racial inequality, and social welfare with greater effectiveness. The 116th Congress, the most diverse in U.S. history, saw a significant increase in the introduction of bills related to social justice and equality, reflecting priorities that previous, less diverse Congresses overlooked.The global evidence is also clear. Countries like New Zealand, Finland, and Rwanda, where women and people of diverse backgrounds hold significant leadership roles, have seen progressive policies on climate action, healthcare, and social equality. Rwanda, for instance, boasts one of the worlds highest rates of female parliamentary representation, and it has shown substantial progress in healthcare and educational reforms.Reducing the power imbalance isnt about eliminating a particular demographic from leadership; its about creating space for diverse voices that lead to policies serving the collective good. By broadening the decision-making base, societies are more likely to advance progressive agendas that benefit everyone.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

This was a compromise because several smaller states would not be interested in forming a nation-state that only only favored the populous ones. The slave states were often the most populous states to begin with, because that was where the largest parts of the economy *was* back then. The electoral college comes largely because of the existence of our bicameral branch, which comes from states like Connecticut opposing population representation like the major slave state, Virginia. Connecticut is the reason we broke it up into a bicameral branch.

And, if you asked the writer of the article, I'm sure they'd tell you the same thing. Instead, I think it's more sensible to read this as a more generic claim. Something like, \\"In our society, there is a group which is empowered in a political sense, and treated as the norm in a cultural sense. This group being in possession of that hegemonic power lends itself to some bad outcomes. We should distribute that power more equitably, both because power being distributed equitably is a positive thing in and of itself, but also because power spread more evenly is liable to lead to better outcomes in some fashion.\\"So, basically, the only reason these people are talking about straight White men is because that's the group that has the power. If the group in power were gay Black women, then presumably these articles would change to map to this reality, rather than simply continuing to exalt the leadership capacity of people who are not straight, White, and men. And the article's authors probably aren't actually cool with Modi supporters.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

The claim that Israels actions are equivalent to indiscriminate attacks on civilians disregards the critical differences between defensive operations and outright terrorism. First, international law permits a nation to defend its citizens from active threats; defensive actions that target military installations, even in dense areas, are legal under the Geneva Conventions when proportionality is observed. Theres a stark difference between targeting militants embedded in civilian areas and deliberately aiming to murder civilians.To equate these actions with the October 7th attackswhere civilians were systematically hunted down, killed, and kidnappedis absurd. Hamass violence was explicitly aimed at civilians with the sole intent of terrorizing. Israel, conversely, has the right under international law to neutralize threats against its people, even if these threats hide within civilian infrastructure. Calling this defense a war crime ignores international standards, which explicitly allow self-defense while prohibiting deliberate harm to civilians.Regarding your implication that advocating for military self-defense somehow excuses all war crimes indiscriminately: its a hollow argument. A country defending itself is not a green light for unchecked violence. The IDF, like any military, is bound by international law, which demands proportionality and distinction in military operationsstandards Israel frequently adheres to, unlike Hamas, which explicitly disregards them by embedding its operations among civilians and aiming to maximize civilian casualties.Finally, the idea that we must hold all parties to identical standards of legality is deeply flawed when one side consistently and flagrantly violates every principle of international law. Its not excusing war crimes; its recognizing the reality that Israel, despite challenges, operates with far more legal and moral constraint than Hamas ever has. If you truly cant see the difference between targeted self-defense and terror attacks on civilians, the problem isnt international lawits a profound lack of understanding about justice and self-defense.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"They are voting for her anyway.

She wont win it, but shes made progress. This is significant because 1) Iowa polls tend to be closer to actual results than a lot of states because of its homogenous demographic and 2) that demographic is very similar to the rural parts of Pennsylvania. Harris is going to win the cities in PA, but if she can peel away at the rural vote, Trump has no hope whatsoever. And all indicators are that she is doing exactly that.The public presidential polls in swing states, which are adjusted based on a number of factors at the discretion of each pollster, are drastically missing the overall mood and sentiment of voters in this election. Look to other polls and other indicators (voter registrations; donors and donations; endorsements; favorability measures; polls on the economy, disaster recovery, womens rights, healthcare, etc.) to get a very different story.

In fact, segregation is ultimately what Apartheid *is*. If the white South Africans simply all moved to the same territory so they didn't have to live next to the \\"inferior\\" black south Africans, but could still exploit them for cheap labor, then people would be upset at the white South Africans for intensifying the Apartheid.And inversely, no one praises Israel for \\"ending the apartheid\\" in east Jerusalem by annexing it in the 1980s and offering all the Palestinians there Israeli citizenship (essentially \\"de-segregating\\" Jerusalem). Quite the opposite. In fact, the very same people who accuse Israel of apartheid decry this action as illegal and immoral. So the only logical conclusion here is that they *know* it isn't apartheid.Now, the Apartheid accusation is ridiculous on premise. Firstly, the segregation is along national lines, not racial ones. Secondly, the Israelis aren't exploiting the Palestinians for their labor or resources. Thirdly, not even Israel considers the west bank or Gaza to be Israeli territory. But diagnostic accuracy isn't the point of these accusations. The reality is that the occupation is something entirely different than \\"apartheid\\". Not necessarily better or worse, just different. So if I'm to assume that the people making the accusations are smart, it means they *understand* these inaccuracies, and are simply precipitating a specific \\"solution\\".

Essentially - the Palestinians must prove to the Israelis that Palestinian land will not be used to wage war against Israel. That's the carrot.Furthermore, I don't think the stick of \\"annexation for violence\\" is a particularly smart or effective thing for Israel to enact. And in fact, incentivizes Palestinian violence.

The reality is far more complex. Decades ago, Israel tolerated certain Islamist groups, thinking they might counterbalance the secular Palestinian Authority (PA), which was seen as hostile. This wasnt direct support for Hamas but rather a strategic move to weaken a unified oppositiona gamble with unintended consequences.Yes, some analysts criticize these tactics for inadvertently strengthening Hamas, but this wasnt about helping Hamas. Israeli leaders were dealing with an already fractured Palestinian political scene, attempting to manage it for security purposes. The policies in question, including agreements on humanitarian aid facilitated by Qatar, were about maintaining a precarious stability, not empowerment.The sources you mentioned highlight criticisms of Israels strategic miscalculations, not clear-cut evidence of intentional support for Hamass rise to power.

We dont know if this works. IF the second option I proposed is what is happening (and I said if) then the polls would have always been shown to be close , but the final result on Election Day will be not so close victory for Kamala. (Because Trump was overrepresented in the sample for the beginning ) I think we forget that these polls have always been within 2-4 points of each other even when she was leading. This race ( according to the weighing models found in the polls) is close.

Do the people in the family intentionally or unintentionally feel like they are vying for the attention and approval of the candidate?  Review family interactions...are there any?

More than 1.4 million ballots have already been submitted, representing 20% of registered voters.  Michelle Obama excoriated Donald Trump in strikingly personal terms on Saturday, asking rally-goers in Michigan why Kamala Harris was being held to a higher standard than her opponent, citing his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and his efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election.I hope youll forgive me if Im a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trumps gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn, Michelle Obama said.  It marks a significant change in tack for Obama, who inspired Democrats with the slogan when they go low, we go high when Hillary Clinton was running against Trump.When Harris spoke at the Michigan rally, she promised to be a president who listened to the American people, unlike her opponent, whom she accused of looking in the mirror all the time.

Decades ago, Israel allowed limited Islamist activity to counterbalance the PA, but that was long before Netanyahu and before Hamas evolved into the militant power it is today. Saying he enabled Hamas is a stretch; its more accurate to say certain policies may have unintentionally strengthened Hamass position by sidelining the PA.

A vote isn't a love letter or a certificate if merit or a prize or even an endorsement . It's a strategic choice: Who do you want to deal with to have the best chance for things to get better. In all my life I've very very rarely voted for someone I felt a deep, meaningful ideological affinity to. Sometimes it's possible to feel a different kind of affinity - for example when Obama ran, or right now Mary Peltola in. Alaska, or Buttigieg... how these are people who have something fundamentally important to contribute, and that means I can, hypothetically speaking, wholeheartedly vore for them even though none of them is anywhere close to my political position. Some, hopefully many, Republicans feel like that about Kamala Harris. The strategic choice depends also on the modalities of the vote itself. With RCV the nice thing is that you can always put your preferred candidate at the top, even if they're non-competitive. But with the first-past-the-post system, you have to make a calculation. Murkowski in Alaska gets reelected each  time with Democratic votes . Or take our state house race. The incumbent would normally get reelected easily, but he didn't stand up to the governor when several of our schools were on the chopping block. He also attends anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ  conferences. His opponent is also a Republican. But she's a fire fighter and educator, runs on \\"defend the schools\\" and says nothing about reproductive choice or queer issues. The local Dems threw her a fundraiser. I'm sure there's a ton we don't agree on, but it's a very easy choice here. 7The Democratic presidential candidate choice is also afflicted by this nonsense. People were feeling that Hilary Clinton \\"deserved\\" the nomination. Maybe! But this didn't make her the right choice! Others argues that Bernie Sanders deserved it because the DNC was favoring Clinton and (possibly? probably? I don't really care and am not looking it up) machinated against him in the background. No! It's not *about* deserving it. Both were not great as candidates! Now people were unhappy with the Biden ouster because... you guessed it, he deserved it. I'm 100% convinced that Biden, at least for his domestic policy, will be *very* favorably viewed by history and will be remembered as an underrated president, hampered by the overwhelming task of dealing with a pandemic. But dies this mean he should have received a bonus for the 2024 presidential run?
