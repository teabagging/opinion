An echo chamber circulates existing views without encountering opposing views, potentially resulting in confirmation bias. Echo chambers may increase social and political polarization and extremism.

Direct democracy is impossible given the number of people we have and the amount of legislaiton needed. A direct democracy would require a vote on everything from whether or not to buy a new weapon to the price of stamps. People would be unable to do anything other than vote of matters of the day.But that is only part of why the founding fathers were against it. They based a lot of what we are on Plato's Republic ,and Plato, like our founding fathers (who were well educated elites), regarded most people as idiots. To allow a group of morons to have direct say over every single issue without guidance or education would lead to a non-functional state. Even with our form of indirect democracy (republicanism), it requires an educated populace in order to elect worthy representatives. That's part of why Benjamin Franklin's response to Elizabeth Willing Powel's question: \\"Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\\" was \\"A republic, if you can keep it.\\" He knew that democracy was messy business and that it generally deteriorated, usually into authoritarianism, so it was on the people to remain educated to the state of things and to vote accordingly.Well, by electing Trump, we've just headed further down the path that Franklin and many of the other founding fathers feared that we could eventually travel with a democratic government. We've elected a fear mongering demagog who does nothing but appeal to people's fear and hatred rather than to their higher faculties. And they wouldn't blame it so much on the demagog himself as much as on the self-indulgent, unthinking people who elected him. Or as Jeffereson put it, The government you elect is the government you deserve.  \\nIt's ironic that Trump voters say that they revere the founding fathers and find them to be divinely inspired while knowing basically nothing about them or what they discussed during our formation. They would find Trump voters to be the very kind of people that they thought needed to be kept in check and largely disregarded.","title":"North Carolina G.O.P.

His whole strategy was basically to change his vibe depending on who he was with. He'd go to southern Conservatives and talk about the uppity negro needs to remember his place, and then hold a meeting with MLK to talk about moving America forward. That worked in an era without the internet where you could show a million different quotes of someone about every topic, today he'd be scorned as a two-faced liar and a flip-flopper. He also signed the civil rights act fully knowing it had lost the Democrats the south for multiple generations to come, so the idea that he was just a pure political gamesman isn't entirely accurate anyway.This was Bill Clinton crime bill and sister Souljah moments.Idk what you even took away from my comment that would make you think I'm opposed to Sister Souljah moments, the entire point of the Third Way was to rebrand the Democrats from a wonky Liberal party to a salt of the Earth party for Real Americans and Good Ole Boys. Clinton and his reform to the Dems is an example of what I was saying the Dems should do. It's not like he abandoned liberal policies. He still tried to push for Clinton Care, he was still Pro-choice, he passed an Assault Weapons ban for God's sake as part of the crime bill you brought up.The democrats are seen as out of touch on social issues wether you like it or not it is seen in wide shifts in multiple voting groups we lost in this election it was evident in Hillary and Kamala's, and was only stop gaped by Biden.The two single biggest factor on why people voted for Trump was the economy. It wasn't because the Democrats social policies were too extreme, the majority of voters in this election in exit polling also did not think Kamala was too extreme. it was that they didn't trust them to run the economy.Also, putting Hillary here is funny because Democrats would kill to get her margins with minorities again.When your own voters are telling u to move to the right on immigration, social issues you have to or won't surviveThe majority of voters would say that her views were not too extreme, that's just not the case. Majority of voters did say though that they trust Trump to handle the economy more than Kamala. That's the core issue. If we start throwing trans people under the bus and become border hawks it isn't going to ordain us the presidency.The alternative is a second party like the Whigs or Reform UK propping up meaning only one party, not yours will dominate until another unifying or team up or realignment of partiesgive me a break, there isn't going to be a third party popping up that stops us from winning.

Ill get into it more below when I get it your point on it.Lets also go through your points because I believe there are some things in there that are incorrect.1. Hamas is a terrorist organization, they dont need popular support. You arent going to oust them with a boycott. They may have won an election literally a generation ago due to the short lives of the average Gazan but theyre not actually a government in any real sense.2. Youre acting like the ideas that what Hamas did on Oct 7th was a horrific terrorist attack, and what Israel has done since has been a genocide are incompatible which they arent. No matter how bad an action some people in a society take, it can never be a justification for genocide of an entire people group. Genocide is whats happening, even the ICJ has agreed on that, it is no longer a debate and is a verified fact.Long term:2. At this point were talking about what is a feasible solution. As you point out later, a two-state solution is whats supposed to be there and its done nothing to stop the conflict. If thats failed and were ruling out genocide of one side (which we are), that essentially only leaves a one-state solution. No one whos thought for more than five minutes about it thinks it will be easy but there isnt really another way. If you want more specific details of what Ive heard from experts Id be happy to share them but it would balloon this comments size from absurd to unreadable.4. Does this assertion of the Israeli governments mindset match their actions in your view? We may have ruled out genocide but they sure as hell havent, theyve already been doing apartheid and the more tame genocides like displacement for years. How many times do they have to use starvation on children before we admit that the Netanyahu administration is just intentionally performing a genocide in Gaza. How many times do they have to bomb hospitals and refugee camps. How many mobs need to break serial rapists out of prison before we admit that it even has popular support. Terrorism is one of the worst things in the world, genocide just happens to be worse. To expect a people in the process of being exterminated to denounce the only people fighting for them for a chance that their oppressors back off is a fallacy. The cessation of violence must start from the Israeli side; the side with the power, the recognition, and the ability to do so.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"Im happy he will.

I think if Hamas dissolved that most of those things would happen, though graduallythere are many splinter terror groups which threaten the PAs authority as much as Israels safety, and I think Israel would be involved in removing infrastructure where it exists, but it would be handled in a partnership and sorted out through many weeks of detailed negotiations.

The foundation of society is built entirely on us agreeing to not kill each other. When the system falls apart and fails people, the contract to exist peacefully falls apart too.

A republic IS a form of democracy by definition, for the sweet love of fuck! The word comes from the latin \\"res publica\\", which means public action or undertaking. And the writings of our founding fathers repeatedly refer to us as a democracy. They didn't want a direct democracy where everyone voted on ever single issue, but they also didn't want minority rule, such as where Congress is pretty equally divided despite the Dems representing about 40M more voters.The Republicans always touted America as being special because we were a democracy and a light to the world, now they tell us that we're not a democracy, suppress voters, call any election that they don't win rigged, and strip away the powers of democratically elected representatives who won't blindly follow the Orange God King.","title":"North Carolina G.O.P.

Usually all you'll hear are the loudest politically-motivated voices parroting an idealization of whatever their view is *supposed* to be, and an exaggerated demonization of the other sides to make them look as bad as possible.Abortion is a perfect example.To hear a democrat pundit/influencer describe it, their side wants to make sure that women have complete bodily autonomy and characterizes tiniest notion of any restrictions on abortion as wanting to turn women into sex slave breeding machines.To hear a republican pundit/influencer describe it, their side wants to protect every unborn children and characterize those anyone who is against abortion restrictions as celebrating the wanton murder of babies.Then the wider politically inclined population adopts the talking points of these voices to fit in or to appear intelligent because they don't actually formulate their own opinions, since it's so much easier when you have one premade for them.And while there are examples of all of these extremes on both sides, they don't represent the majority, but both sides will hold up these extremes not because they believe in them, but because they think it will make themselves look virtuous and reasonable while making the other side seem evil and irrational. You can see this everywhere on social media.Realistically, though, most Democrats believe in *some* restriction on abortion, generally late term should be in place, and Republicans believe that *some* elective abortions should be allowed, generally early on in the pregnancy as well as more specifically, exemptions for abuse and medical reasons, but running on these more reasonable middle grounds doesn't emotionally charge people to vote and isn't effective campaign messaging to emotionally charge people to vote.So what do you trust? Well, you can trust that none of these extremes will ever happen because of the very nature of how our government is set up with checks and balances and the shifting back and forth of voters. You can trust that some steps will be taken towards the idealizations, but must do so with the knowledge that at some point, the population will eventually put a stop to it because, again, for almost every idealized characterization of a political extreme, there's an equally easy demonization to make, and as you near it, more people will begin to feel negatively about it.I think you're just having trouble separating campaign messaging and propaganda with the reality of policymaking and just how slow of a process it is.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Yeah... this is one of the guys who worked hard and had the power to create or prevent this dangerous world.

It was the only logical thing to do for a country with anti-Russia interests C once things expand to Poland or another EU country, NATO countries have an obligation to intervene.

First and foremost, this isn't necessarily the good news it sounds like, considering the story we have seen time and again when there is a power vacuum, plus Assad was granted asylum in Russia. It's also not even directly attributable to US intervention (probably precisely planned so because of the US's long history of \\"saving\\" countries from a dictatorship, only to have it blow up in their face)theres a good argument supporting Israel was the pragmatic thing to do, even if domestically unpopularI don't think there's a good argument for it being pragmatic, precisely because it was domestically incredibly unpopular. That was a big contributor to Trump winning, and that's going to have much bigger and immediate domestic ramifications than conflicts in the Middle East, which could have still been kept below a boiling point (from the US perspective) for awhile. The uncommitted movement showed that a significant share of Democratic voters were very much against the support of the genocide. If even a small share of the people who voted uncommitted in the primaries decided not to vote, that cost Harris the election. ofc she's also to blame for that, but this brings back my initial point about his refusal to resign from running for reelection. If she had run that same platform C basically identical to Biden's C in a normal nomination process with competitors, she almost definitely wouldn't have gotten the candidacy to begin with.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"America is a one party state","title":"Manchin and Sinema Screw Biden Yet Again, Give Trump Control of Labor Board"},{"text":"I wish I knew.

Speaking as a substitute teacher who over the past three years has subbed at over a dozen elementary schools in high, medium, and low income neighborhoods, with student bodies of varying racial compositions (ranging from ~20%-90% white; the Twin Cities area is still badly segregated), the students born in 2015 and 2016 are noticeably 'stunted' compared to both the students born in the early 2010s and students born in the late 2010s.Of course within any classroom some students will struggle more than others, but in general, the 2015 &amp; 2016 kids have noticeably less-developed social skills, have greater difficulty understanding and following instructions, and struggle much more with improving their reading and math abilities.For the most part, I do not believe COVID lockdowns were especially excessive. If anything, the high number of both infections and deaths per-capita in America suggests that they needed to be slightly stricter (especially in GOP-dominated states like Florida).

And on the flip side, I'm not willing to say that the base doesn't matter *at all*, especially in relatively low turnout off-cycle elections. Look at UK Labour for the pattern of what can go wrong there. Labour essentially pivoted to close to the Tories' position on trans rights under Starmer, something that certainly didn't help them (the Tories ended up doing a lot better in the last cycle than the polls would have suggested) and arguably would have hurt them. They definitely didn't win the election on being more trans positive than the Tories. The net effect seems to have been little more than a general worsening of the situation for trans people in the UK, for limited to no political gain for Labour in the process. And even setting aside the risk that it'd just shift the Overton window rightward for no real gain, the policy would still have a chilling effect by making it harder for doctors to get malpractice insurance and more risk-averse towards prescribing gender-affirming care specifically. It'd affect everyone in the relevant demographic, not just those erroneously prescribed healthcare, and when there's little to no potential evidence of it actually being politically helpful long term...","title":"Liberals should defend civil rights  not cower based on election results"},{"text":"This remind me of my MAGA neighbors on Nextdoor.\\"We don't need Obamacare!

But, it also had the effect of ripping money out of the economy and basically stopping the erosion of the Dollar. When Reagan came in, he turned on the taps of the government money machine and the economy Boomed like crazy.

First, abnormalities just means that, abnormal. It doesn't mean permanent or damaging. Having a weird period is not where close to the potential harm of covid (which also will likely mess with your periods). Second, this is based on self-reported data specifically for that. It is highly susceptible to culture influences or understanding. Third, just because you get your paper in a peer reviewed journal doesn't make it correct. There are a lot of shitty journals out there. If you think the shot may cause issues, you are far more likely to report it as that (when it could have been another cause) and also more likely to see an issue at all (if you have ever been worried about a health issue before and hence hypervigilant on your body, you will know what I mean). This doesn't mean the effect isn't real or potentially serious, but it also doesn't mean it is. It means exactly what it is, nothing more nor less. Basically, all it says is that people are self-reported issues in a stat-sig manner. If you have been paying attention at all online, then that is already obvious. A lot of people have self-reported that already. Also, periods are affected by your overall hormones and hence things that affect them like stress. I have T1 diabetes and the covid shot for sure caused my body to feel more \\"stressed\\" for ~48 hours after taking it, and I could tell through my blood sugars. It was 100% expected because our bodies' immune systems think it is infected, and hence, it is fighting it and learning from it. That is the whole fuckin' point. Overall, this is not an unexpected or surprising result nor really concerning. It definitely doesn't imply the shot should be taken of the market or isn't a net good for most people. That could be the case, but this paper doesn't come remotely close to showing that.","title":"Well, well, well... how the turntables: Major Study Confirms Covid Vaxxed Cause Side Effects to Unvaxxed"},{"text":"There is no reason for anyone to join Truth Social except to kowtow to Trump and MAGA.","title":"John Fetterman Becomes First Senate Democrat On Truth Social"},{"text":"People's political decisions are driven far more, by what their friends, family, peers, trusted media sources, and acquaintances are saying than by what politicians are saying.Democratic politicians by and large in my experience are pretty good at walking that line.

If 51% of people have attached earlobes and 49% of people have unattached earlobes, \\"people with unattached earlobes\\" are the minority. Billionaires are a minority. Politicians are a minority. Left-handed people are a minority. A \\"marginalized minority\\" is a minority that is being \\"marginalized\\", as in \\"pushed to the margins\\" or \\"removed from the center\\". A minority whose priorities are thought of as peripheral and not that important, and whose suffering is not taken very seriously. So, say, people whose race or gender or sexual orientation or disability or whatever makes their lives way harder, because society is not designed with their needs in mind. E.g. people who have mobility problems are *marginalized* in places that don't have, say, ramps or elevators or where the hallways make it really hard to navigate a wheelchair, etc. You can chop up society in any way you want to make any set of groups such that someone is in the minority. \\"People named Bob\\" are in the minority because *most people* are *not named Bob*.But if there was widespread anti-Bob sentiment, if people tried to hide that they were named Bob to avoid it, if there were naming systems that required at least four letters to input your name, locking any \\"Bob\\" out of using them, if common things associated with \\"Bobs\\" were held in disdain by society, if \\"Bobs\\" typically made less money and were more likely to be homeless than \\"Jacks\\" or \\"Peters\\", if the life outcomes of \\"Bobs\\" were worse on every axis... Then they would be a *marginalized* minority. There is also the term \\"plurality\\" when there is no one group that makes up a \\"majority\\" (say, 4 groups, 30%, 25% 24% and 21%) but there is one \\"biggest\\" group. The \\"30% group\\" in that list is the biggest one, but it is still a minority (the \\"not-30%\\" make up 70% of the group!) it's just also a plurality. In your posts, you keep acting as if \\"minority\\" immediately means \\"marginalization\\". But lots of minorities (politicians, billionaires, able-bodied straight white men from upperclass families who hold university degrees, Boomers) have disproportionately large amounts of power. I struggle to think of a single regime where the people in power *weren't* a minority, given that \\"politicians\\" are necessarily a minority.

It's an issue that goes beyond trans healthcare--it regularly comes up in the abortion discourse, and beyond that there's the whole Jehovah's Witnesses/Christian Scientist situation--but it's something where quite frankly the cultural zeitgeist is simply too willing to tolerate child abuse in the form of withholding medical care for whatever reason, and it can genuinely be hard to parse between that and a parent being really skeptical of a doctor's judgement. It's difficult, however, to try and figure out a politically palatable alternative; *ad litem* guardians would be essentially impossible to implement large scale, and lowering the age of medical consent would be both generally risky and politically impossible.

Its shitty that America doesnt see eye to eye on these issue and it would certainly be best if we could establish a comprehensive plan of rights that covers all niche situations. However (I) American law generally never works like that, and a lot of legislation is basic foundational and then built on through regulations and the courts (II) if there isnt enough support for the *best* solution, rather than try and ram it through at the injection of the electorate, the focus should turn to the *best solution that we have enough support to pass now*.","title":"Liberals should defend civil rights  not cower based on election results"},{"text":"That's exactly what I keep reminding my wife about.

The study, based on self-reported data from an online survey, suggests that 85.5% of unvaccinated respondents who were within six feet of a vaccinated person reported menstrual changes, with 71.7% noticing symptoms within one week of exposure. However, the study's reliance on self-reported data and lack of established biological mechanisms linking proximity to vaccinated individuals with menstrual changes raise concerns about its validity. The journal itself is not widely recognized in the scientific community, and its articles have been criticized for lacking rigorous peer review.

This is an incredibly small number and is most likely even smaller considering Israels use of the Hannibal Doctrine. We already know that 15 of the deaths were caused by the Israeli military. All things considered the Oct 7th attacks really werent that big of a deal.\\n- Why is civilians killed in one day a relevant metric at all? Would you rather have 100,000 civilians killed over the course of a year or 680 Civilians killed in a day? Obviously the 680 because 680 is a substantially smaller number then 100,000.

It wasnt Hindenburg being super old or flubbing a debate, it was a populace hurting from the great depression and WWI, extremists breaking towards fascism on one side and communism on the other, and the resulting fighting and instability driving the broad citizenry towards the authoritarianism. All of which was fueled by hyper-nationalism and scapegoating of Jewish and other minority groups.

I knew, as did millions of others around the globe, including qualified immunologists and clinicians on the front lines, what was dangerous about the mechanism of action of mRNA drugs, that several treatment regimens were showing promise from benefit to complete cure, that the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) was not excessive for a respiratory illness and as usual, targeted the most medically vulnerable, that C19 had a survival rate in healthy populations of at least 95%: https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/us-mortality-1900-2020-age-adjusted-800x329.jpg   Almost all studies of C19's IFR have returned results between 0.04% and 0.5%.The basic info in this 2023 article was known before the first vaccine rollouts: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512201982XMorbidity and mortality were presented inappropriately as *relative* risk rather than *absolute* risk, which even FDA cautions against because it misleads--but ignored during the pandemic: \\"Provide absolute risks, not just relative risks. Patients are unduly influenced when risk information is presented using a relative risk approach; this can result in suboptimal decisions. Thus, an absolute risk format should be used.\\"The same problem favorably skewed outcome results for the mRNA vaccine trial data: A critical appraisal of phase III clinical trial data for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2 and Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273 shows that absolute risk reduction measures are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Yet, the manufacturers failed to report absolute risk reduction measures in publicly released documents. As well, the U.S FDA Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) did not follow FDA published guidelines for communicating risks and benefits to the public, and the committee failed to report absolute risk reduction measures in authorizing the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines for emergency use. Such examples of outcome reporting bias mislead and distort the publics interpretation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine efficacy and violate the ethical and legal obligations of informed consent. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7996517/*Pfizer Vaccine Offers Less Than 1% Absolute Risk Reduction* (published Sept. 3, 2021):\\nhttps://www.thepulse.one/p/pfizer-vaccine-offers-less-than-1-absolute-risk-reduction?utm_source=publication-searchWe knew there was no sound science for 6' social distancing.

One of the key differences is that under single payer, differing amounts of money are spent on individuals in accordance with their needs - a voucher system is the exact opposite.I've seen no evidence that Democrats largely believe doctors should be government employees. Many of them don't even support M4A. Regardless, it's not \\"disingenuous\\" to adopt a position you think would be more palatable to voters or a good transistionary step towards something else as opposed to what you might prefer if you intend to implement the policy you put in the platform.It's perfectly reasonable to sell people on a \\"proof of concept\\" type idea that could lead to further change in the same direction down the line. If Democrats ran on M4A and then nationalized the healthcare system instead, that would be disingenuous. If some tiny minority of Democrats think an NHS type system is preferable but that voters aren't ready for that large a change, it's not disingenuous to try to convince them of something more moderate in hopes that it will eventually win over more people to your way of thinking. The same goes for Republicans and vouchers in terms of getting education on a path to being more market-based.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Whoever's these are, they're lit up like Christmas trees at night, so they pretty clearly want to be seen.","title":"New Jersey mayors pen letter demanding action on mysterious drone sightings"},{"text":"I suspect this is why I have constant tinnitus in both ears that started right around the time the shots rolled out and people close to me started getting theirs.","title":"Well, well, well... how the turntables: Major Study Confirms Covid Vaxxed Cause Side Effects to Unvaxxed"},{"text":"McDonalds has the word Donald in it.

I don't think this loss was about policy necessarily, but branding. People bring up Trump's They/Them ad all the time as an example of how Dems are too socially to the left of voters and need to moderate on trans issues, but I don't think that's the story. Look at the undertones of that ad, it's not just \\"trans people are icky and gross and Kamala loves them, vote Trump.\\" It was \\"Kamala cares too much about niche social issues like transgender rights, Donald Trump will focus on the real issues.\\" Think of that line, Kamala is for They/Them, Trump is for you. He wasn't necessarily pledging to stand up to the Trans brigade, but moreso brushing them off. He'll be for you.I think that's the core lesson we need to take away. The Republicans successfully painted the Democrats as out of touch and caring more about niche social issues, whereas they will be the economy party that fixes the economy. Becoming more economically populistic or socially Conservative or any of these issues won't fix the fundamental problem that voters associate the Democratic brand with social issues. What we need to do is change the brand so people view them as core, economic \\"kitchen table\\" issues first, and social issues second.I also think that explains a lot of other things about this election. Why did DeSantis flame out so hard? Sure he had the charisma of a brick, but there have been plenty of uncharismatic, stiff, and awkward politicians in the past who have gone much further than DeSantis got. Al Gore was 500 votes from being president after all. DeSantis failed so hard because he made fighting \\"wokeness\\" his core brand. People initially were drawn to DeSantis because they saw him as Trump without the baggage, someone who will go in and shake things up and build a good economy without the tweets and the weirdness and the annoying stuff. But then when he had the national microphone, he spent all his time proclaiming himself God's warrior on the anti-woke crusade. He created the impression that he did not care about the core issues of the economy, he cared more about niche social issues like fighting wokeness.I think that's also why certain Dem attacks worked. They saw success messaging on Project 2025 and calling them weird, but why is that? Think of the undertones to that message. Walz calling them weird wasn't just him saying \\"They love social conservatism and I don't, vote Dem,\\" it was saying that they care about weird, niche issues, they'll be focused on abortion bans and other nonsense, while I, a normal person, am focused on the real issues. Project 2025 gave people the idea that the Republicans in office won't be focused on the economy, but on implementing this weird right-wing manifesto about God-knows what. It was all an attempt to make the public perception of the Republican brand that niche social issues are number one, and core kitchen table issues like the economy are number two.If the Dems are going to win 2028, that needs to be the core take-away in my opinion. They need to focus on saying that Vance or whoever the nominee is doesn't want to focus on the real issues like the economy, he just wants to fight his culture wars. The Democrats though, we care about the real issues. We're gonna make your salary go up and the cost of living go down, because at the end of the day that's what people care about first and foremost.TLDR: It's the economy, stupid.","title":"Liberals should defend civil rights  not cower based on election results"},{"text":"Introduces it to who?

He rallied behind the wealthier conservative party and on the other ends of the political aisle was the Nazi regime, socialists and (I think) communists. Papen convinced his political wealthy conservatives and the (very important) residing president to make Hitler chancellor despite Hitler's attempted coup a few years before (beer putsch). \\"I can control Hitler, guide him from the shadows, if you just make me vice chancellor,\\" said Papen. Meanwhile Hitler was saying stuff like \\"I literally want to dissolve the governmental congress/checks and balances system and create an autocracy.\\"Papen's group and the residing president were like \\"uh, are you sure?\\" And papen was all \\"of course! If we put him as chancellor but then use our group to corner him politically us conservative wealthy will effectively have full control of the government. Hitler is crazed, power hungry, and ruthless but without enough political sway he is toothless. We can use his fiery followers for our own means.\\"Spoiler alert: Hitler had enough political sway. He had multiple paramilitary/secret police groups and in a political deal The German gov underestimated Hitler and handed a large chunk of the police force to a major Hitler loyalist. The Nazi party then passed the 1933 enabling act which let Hitler bypass all checks and balances (could make his own laws without going through the Reichstag). Also he and they just ignored Papen and would do whatever without consulting him In 1934 Papen and his friends wrote a speech saying \\"ok the social leftists and communists who voted against us arent a factor anymore, please call off your paramilitary goons who are threatening all your potential political rivals haha.\\"Those of you familiar with history may have noticed that 1934 is when Hitler enacted the Night of Long Knives. 3+ of Papen's friends were murdered as well as some 'overly politically aggressive' Hitler loyalists (specifically the brown shirts). They kept Papen alive because he was still \\"potentially useful.\\"In fact, the first concentration camp (Dachau) had already been built...in 1933.\\nLong story short?

Como todos saben yo no soy poltico, de hecho, siempre despreci a los polticos y cmo no iba a odiarlos. Es ms, cmo no iba a odiar al Estado que es una herramienta de opresin. Alcanza con entender algo de economa y ver lo que hicieron a la Argentina para tener razones de sobra. De un pas que nada tena que envidiarle a las principales potencias del mundo, pasamos a ser una fbrica de miseria, todo por sostener el modelo de la casta, un rgimen de apartheid donde los polticos le roban el fruto de su trabajo a los argentinos de bien para repartirlo entre ellos, sus amigos y sus clientes. En fin, una historia que quienes estamos aqu conocemos bien y no tiene sentido repetir hoy. Este rgimen se extendi por 100 a?os, en ese marco se desarroll la poltica profesional. Cientos y miles de dirigentes entrenados en cmo comportarse, cmo negociar, cmo comunicar, cmo hablar a cmara, qu se puede decir y que no. Y nunca se olviden de meterle la mano en el bolsillo a la gente, que era el rasgo fundamental. Pero el a?o pasado pas algo curioso: los profesionales de la poltica se equivocaron en todo. Tuvieron que tirar el manual a la basura, porque los argentinos eligieron a alguien que hizo todo al revs de lo que deca su manual.?English:\\\\Therefore, today I want to reflect with you precisely about this, we are going to talk about politics, we are going to talk about method, we are going to talk about power. As you all know I am not a politician, in fact, I have always despised politicians and how could I not hate them. Moreover, how could I not hate the State, which is a tool of oppression. It is enough to understand a little bit of economics and see what they did to Argentina to have enough reasons to do so. From a country that had nothing to envy to the main powers of the world, we became a factory of misery, all to sustain the caste model, an apartheid regime where politicians steal the fruits of their labor from the good Argentines to share it among themselves, their friends and their clients. In short, a history that those of us who are here know well and it makes no sense to repeat today. This regime lasted for 100 years, in that framework professional politics developed. Hundreds and thousands of leaders trained in how to behave, how to negotiate, how to communicate, how to speak on camera, what to say and what not to say. And never forget to put their hand in people's pockets, which was the fundamental trait. But last year something curious happened: the political professionals got it all wrong. They had to throw the manual in the trash, because Argentines elected someone who did everything backwards from what their manual said. This is the reference to the \\"100 years of opression\\" Milei made at the CPAC. He's not talking about the \\"post WW2 liberal political consensus\\", instead, he's talking about the literal opposite: Argentina going in the opposite direction of the western political consensus.If you don't believe that the post-war political climate in Argentina was \\"oppresive\\", you're going to have a field day in Wikipedia reading about Juan Domingo Pern first-two presidencies, about the 3 military coups, about the proscription of political parties, about the Dirty War and so much more.Somehow, it doesn't surprises me that such a low-quality and false article comes from El Pas.

Natural monopolies are very rare and even when they occur in the free market, are usually benign or positive for the economy. In order for a company to become a monopoly (in common usage), that company has to do things *far* better than anyone else and *far* cheaper than anyone else and/or have a *very* high natural barrier to entry. Standard Oil is a case where the company just outperformed others so well it achieved something like 90% market share. But as competitors began to catch up, their share fell to 64% *before* the government stepped in to break them up. ASML is a company that has a monopoly on EUV Lithography for semiconductors since the barrier to entry is so high. I am unaware of monopolistic complains against ASML. When monopolies in a free market start becoming nasty or even just fat, happy and content, other entrants typically come in and take them out. Most monopolies due to regulations. For example, broadband monopolies were largely due to local regulations and large government fees to build out broadband lines. PG&amp;E is another example. Many municipalities require hookups to be through PG&amp;E and the regulatory body basically runs PG&amp;E, causing them to be a nasty monopoly.\\n2. Well, if that is a good thing and it makes sense to do it, why can't you do it privately? Buy insurance for a pension instead of being forced to do it. Or take the tax savings and invest it for your future. In the US, it's social security, where everyone pays a tax and at 65, you start getting checks. The returns are terrible and for many, you get negative returns. But since this is a government monopoly, you have no choice but to pay it.\\n3. Japanese trains are the envy of the world and they are privately run. The New York subway started as a privately run rail line before the city took it over, claiming their rates were too high, then jacked up fares after they took it over. Brightline is a rail line that just opened in Florida, a privately funded railroad. Compare it to California's government run HSR boondoggle, that is $250bn in with little to nothing to show for it. Since you bring up buses, Fung Wah was a bus company in New York that offered very low rates and became very popular. They no longer exist because the government put them out of business saying they were hazardous, despite little to no evidence offered that they had any worse an accident record compared to other buses. \\n4. This is a complex question, but with OPEC, markets respond to prices. If the US could just get out of its own way, its own production would be much higher. It could also move away from being so gasoline dependent if it would stop forbidding nuclear power.\\n5. Well, limited taxation is still taxation and should cover the needs of a minimal government. Military costs would come down significantly with a libertarian society, as the government would be far less belligerent overseas and getting some of the most productive members killed or maimed or PSTD'd.\\n6. There is no \\"official\\" stance on abortion. You'll have to figure it out based on libertarian arguments. That being said, the abortion argument among libertarians is far more interesting than other groups. I'm going to drastically oversimplify this, but... You'll have pro life people arguing that a baby within the womb is a life and is subject to the right to not be killed, especially since it did not willingly on its own cognition, enter the woman's body, unless the baby puts the mother's life at risk making it aggressive. You'll have pro choice people arguing that a woman must have bodily autonomy, it should be between her and her doctor, and that whatever the case is, the government will screw things up. Then you have also libertarians that are evictionists, that argue both sides and make a \\"compromise\\" argument, saying you can evict the baby (perform a C-section) and try to keep the baby alive, but you cannot kill it through abortive practices. Then others (like me) will take from various positions and stitch them together.

He incited an insurrection and tried to overthrow the government.And yet since the election you have done nothing but defend trump and attack your own party for standing up to him.  You described the dangerous and disgraceful appointment of Matt Gaetz to attorney general as god tier trolling.  You have asked us to stop freaking out about the man who ran on campaign promises to hurt us and the people we care about.  You have shamefully called his felony conviction for paying off a porn star politicized and have asked for him to be pardoned.  You committed to voting for Dr. Oz even before a hearing, and you of all people know how unfit Oz is.    I am a lifelong Democrat and have voted in every election since I was 18.  If you do not stop defending donald trump, I will not vote for you again.","title":"John Fetterman Joins Truth Social, Slams Bulls**t Case Against Trump"},{"text":"Honestly willing to suffer if I can still have the schadenfreude of all these evangelical dingbats suffering as well.

I don't seen an issue with Kids or Parents who want to go this route as puberty blockers are 100% reversible. Lupron does not reverse the effects of puberty, so we don't use it in patients at all who have already underwent sexual developmentI am a board certified pediatrician and in our state we can't do hormone replacement therapy but we can prevent the development of secondary characteristics through Lupron (like stopping the development of boobs or periods in a transmale, or deeping of the voice and hair growth in a transfemale). At any point the patient can stop puberty suppression and undergo puberty (though obviously later). I can't speak to cross hormones (hormone replacement therapy but those do come with irreversible changes and am okay with limiting their use in children but will absolutely push back against any attempts to stop puberty blockers. Puberty blockers don't work after you went through puberty that's the whole point.In order to prescribe Lupron patients require a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria which requires the following and clearly documented. (We can talk about the idea of gender dysphoria and whether or not should be a pathologic diagnosis versus affirming the idea that there is nothing wrong with being transgender but starting any medication should always come with a strict diagnosis, and this is just what it is called in the ICD-10 code today and patients understand this when explained that this is how the system and insurance is able to provide the drug)**A.** A marked incongruence between ones experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, lasting at least **6 months** (though personally I am only comfortable if it's been at least a year), as evidenced by at least **two** of the following:1.

A strong desire to be rid of ones primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of the incongruence.\\n3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender.\\n4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from ones assigned gender).\\n5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or alternative gender).\\n6.

Its pretty fascinating and is a great example of different countries implementing different solutions to the same fundamental problem, which is simply to provide affordable healthcare to everyone (universal healthcare). Single payer is just one of the ways its done, and is also called the National Health Insurance model. Thats where people buy into government-run insurance, which pays out private providers.Theres the Beveridge Model, where people pay taxes and in return get healthcare from the government. Care providers are typically owned and run by the government, and the government pays it all out.A more common approach is the Bismarck model, where everyone has insurance funded by payroll deductions, but the insurers are non-profits and have to cover everyone, and prices are heavily controlled. Healthcare is usually provided by private companies.In the US, Democrats tend to pretty widely believe in the concept of universal healthcare, but disagree on which system is the best considering where we are now. Id say the party position at the moment is that healthcare should be a fundamental right, the government should ensure everyone has affordable access, and the best way to get there is by building on the foundation of the ACA.Personally I think the ACA, with a government provided public option to help control costs, and forcing insurers to be a special kind of non-profit, is the best path for us to get to actual universal healthcare.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"School vouchers are (at least based on proposals I have seen) meant to allocate the education funding to whatever school the student attends. That isn't really the same as universal healthcare as proposed, as the latter involves a new tax and the \\"allocation\\" is for all expenses regardless of amount. If a private school costs $20k per year and the public school gets 12k/year, the voucher simply moves the 12k to the new school, and parents would be responsible for the remainder.Specifics aside, solutions aren't universal. It isn't inconsistent to want different methods for different issues.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Luigi","title":"Manchin, Sinema block Democratic control of NLRB"},{"text":"imagine is people got universal healthcare, how happy they'd be.","title":"Republican Support for Obamacare Hits 12 Year High"},{"text":"Reverse Fetterman is hilarious and sad","title":"And who exactly is responsible for that, you demented turtle"},{"text":"Why couldnt he just be a Von Trapp![gif](giphy|f64fQ6pTEqvp9vEdgT|downsized)","title":"And who exactly is responsible for that, you demented turtle"},{"text":"Music to my ears.","title":"Health Care Is NOT a Difficult Problem to Fix"},{"text":"Argentina had gay marriage and gender self-identification laws before most of the US did.

Another issue is that private schools are allowed to set their own rates, so even if a voucher program was started, there's no guarantee that private schools will become more accessible for the average student.

So its the perception that matters.I feel like this whole issue gets too much attention, also. Like, there's such a scramble to blame the election loss on trans people, as if it just couldn't truly be because...1. Biden was fucking senile (or perceived as such)2. Biden was fucking senile (or perceived as such) *and the party and media apparently lied about it or minimalized and downplayed it for years*3. Democrats went and nominated Biden's VP, someone who more than almost anyone else surely must have known how bad Biden had gotten4. The economy was perceived as bad, inflation did factually spike up, Biden policy (too big stimulus and protectionism) did make inflation worse, and normies may have a tendency to blame government for rising prices while not crediting it when their pay goes up even by more than prices rose 5. Dems pivoted on immigration way too little too late and with a bill that had bad optics. Biden immediately undid a lot of Trump border restrictions and left things liberalized for years despite massive unpopularity regarding the border crisis, before only pivoting in late 2023 due to the new political realities. And that came after Biden was one of the few Dems in 2020 primaries to appear \\"moderate\\" just because he didn't support literal open borders (decriminalizing illegal border crossings) and when many Dems supported abolishing ICE6. We've faced a national crime wave over the past few years, and the response from Dems and media has often been something like \\"well it's not really that bad because crime is still lower than it was during the 80s crime wave\\" even though crime is still considerably above pre pandemic levels for more recent years that normies will actually compare it to. Plus there was all the talk about how crime is on a downward trend due to initial crime statistics and data, but then shortly before the election revised data came out showing that for at least one of recent years where crime was at first thought to be decreasing, it actually increased. Tie this in with many local progressive DAs taking a soft on crime/catch and release approach, and it's easy for it to seem like the crime rates could be also suffering from underreporting and that crime could be higher (also ties in with seeing more and more public homelessness-associated with crime -in cities, with liberals and progressives acting like we just need to accept it because \\"it's cruel to ban public homeless street camping if you aren't also giving them homes\\"). I have no doubt that the trans stuff isn't that popular and has shifted to being less popular, but at the same time I'd guess Biden's age, Harris being Biden's VP, inflation, immigration and crime played rather more of a role of giving us a second Trump term than \\"trans stuff\\" did","title":"Liberals should defend civil rights  not cower based on election results"},{"text":"I mean these are just such different things that it's hard to analyze it through a lens of a double standard. These positions are perfectly consistent and reasonable once you factor in the structure of the existing institutions, the history of these institutions, and the need to compromise. And of course part of it is that even if the idea is good in theory, neither side trusts the intentions of their opponents. Finally there is a federal vs state issue here which is a big source of contention.Healthcare is already privatized. Education is public. Both sides are moving the institutions closer to their position and thus consistent with their ideology. It's just the starting positions are opposite and there are other practical, historical, and ideological factors at work. And as you pointed out, neither position necessarily represents the perfect ideal, which may represent the need to compromise or other practical considerations. Ultimately, Democrats are not socialists and Republicans are not libertarians...thus judging them strictly by these frameworks is futile.  If I had to pick a major distinction as to why these two institutions should not be considered a double standard, I think the big distinction is regulation. Healthcare providers are specialized, highly educated and strictly regulated. A single-payer healthcare system is at the federal level and can be reasonably sure that the patient is being treated by professional who follows established scientific methods...and they can control what services they pay for. Most importantly, it removes the private insurance industry middleman which is a huge source of the access and cost issue and doesn't have an equivalent analog in education at all. On the education side, the voucher system minimizes or removes federal oversight and risks limiting access to vulnerable communities. The providers under this system would be minimally regulated and thus the public can't ensure that the children are receiving suitable education. If providers were required to adhere to stricter curriculum standards, and access to schools in undeserved communities could be guaranteed... democrats might be more willing to consider such a proposal.This reminds me of the voter ID debate....democrats are not categorically opposed to a voter ID in theory, they are opposed to the ways that Republicans want to implement it.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"National crying doesnt work.

Where I disagree with you is that he deserves any real recognition as a \\"success\\".his achievements in foreign policyHe didn't make any significant strides here (apart from picking up some of the pieces that Trump left), and the thing that will probably be viewed in hindsight as his most significant foreign policy move is his undying support of the genocide in Gaza, even after the uncommitted movement. He also shat the bed on the withdrawal from Afghanistan.his decision?*not*?to run for reelection in 24This was not his decision. He did not step back gracefully. I'd like to remind you that he promised to be a one-term president when he ran in 2020. He was already old then, and he was shoved down the throats of anti-Trump voters due to a wild coordinated effort from his campaign and the DNC. He won primarily because of lingering nostalgia for and sympathy with Obama. He was forced out after he showed, time and again, that he was unfit for office.His breaking of that promise played no small role in Harris' loss. tbh I don't know if Kamala would've been the candidate if there were a normal nomination process, but if she were, at least she would've had more time to develop a real platform and gain more supporthe wont have the redemption arc Carter had with Habitat for HumanityRightfully so. He doesn't deserve a redemption arc.I'll grant you that the inflation reduction act &amp; build back better programs were good, but his crackdown on immigration, support of a genocide, and shooting his own party in the foot by stubbornly refusing to back down when it was called for and appropriate (not a mere 3-4 months before the election) give him a deserved spot in the presidential hall of shame.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"...loved in between the pages of a book but forgotten and disdained by your average Americans.that describes most presidents lol.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"Best of luck to him in the private sector.","title":"Chris Wray is resigning!"},{"text":"It's about time to elect officials that will write bills for universal health care.","title":"Elizabeth Warren Issues Dramatic 'Warning' After UnitedHealthcare CEO Assassination: 'People Can Be Pushed Only So Far'"},{"text":"I think after the 2010s of mostly \\"big state\\" right-wing economic populism, the 2020s will be the decade of right-wing lolberts.

The problem with a voucher system is private institutions can deny people they don't want. So all of the smartest kids, most well off kids will be pumping money into these private institutions, meanwhile students who are more costly like students with disabilities, students with difficult home lives, students who cause disciplinary issues will be shunted off to public schools. Those public schools and specifically the teachers will be underfunded, and so essentially you're creating an institution to pump out the next bunch of criminals in society. The reason we have a nationalized education system, is because its a public good. Just like our society benefits from roads being free because all of us are able to engage in commerce, and making them all private would hurt the economy even if it would benefit the new private owner. The same applies for schools, we have public schools, because someone who's educated is less likely to commit crimes, less likely to engage in anti social behavior, is more productive. The more education the more those effects are felt. On the other hand if you underserve the populations most likely to cause problems for society in the future, you're going to be paying for that 10 fold in the future.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Ah yes, that famous saying, \\"political power grows out of bills.\\" If centuries of electoralism haven't saved us from exploitation, why would it now when corporations have more power than ever?","title":"Elizabeth Warren introduces Senate bill to hold capitalism accountable"},{"text":"Do you not have copycat murders in Canada?","title":"Elizabeth Warren Issues Dramatic 'Warning' After UnitedHealthcare CEO Assassination: 'People Can Be Pushed Only So Far'"},{"text":"It was more than that. The high tax rates drove this problem too. When income taxes went super high, employers who wanted to pay their top people couldn't do so without sending huge amounts to the government, so instead they started handing out untaxed benefits. The liberals who pine away for the return of to tax rates near 90% can't seem to grasp this concept.","title":"Health Care Is NOT a Difficult Problem to Fix"},{"text":"Your description of the various perspectives seems really inaccurate. A school voucher system, while somewhat publicly funded, is ultimately a way of moving education further outside the public sphere and making it a more private system. Similarly, on healthcare, the Republicans want something like the current system, which is heavily privatized, based on a byzantine insurance structure. You ask whether the true agenda of Republicans is completely privatized education, but this isn't that important as a question. What's important is that a voucher system would be more privatized and profit driven than what we have now.We can note the same structure of thought for Democrats. A Medicare for all system, or universal healthcare, or even Obamacare's open marketplace, is a way of taking the often private healthcare system and making it more publicly run. The ACA wasn't a perfect way of going from point A to point B, as it is, as you note, a bit more like the school voucher system than it is like a fully public system, but it was a huge step up in public support. And, similarly, the Democrats want a strong public school system that is not about profit. So, I would say that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are particularly hypocritical. Republicans want to move both systems in a more private more profit driven direction, and Democrats want to move both systems in a more public less profit driven direction.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"y'all could have voted for harris to prevent a Trump 2nd term","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"I guess he felt that he already looked the part, so might as well go all in.","title":"John Fetterman Joins Truth Social, Slams Bulls**t Case Against Trump"},{"text":"Sorry, u/Verbull710 C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 5:  **Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation**.

Your child may be able to take a voucher and afford a private school, but what if the private school is full? They're under no obligation to accept every student and they can charge whatever they want. Meanwhile the public school loses funding and may not be sustainable.

An earlier BBB could very well have resulted in the same sort of thing - with the GOP throwing a fit but then after a few months passed, they just pass chips anyway So it's basically preferences: Do you prefer a BBB with a smaller Climate Change component and no infrastructure Bill or CHIPS ACT, or do you prefer the Infrastructure Bill, CHIPS ACT, and a larger climate change Bill?No, because again, infrastructure came before BBB stuff anyway so either way you get the infrastructure. And the climate stuff was just a carry over from BBB anyway, so it doesn't make sense to assume that Manchin wouldn't have done a similar sized climate spending with an earlier BBB, since despite leftist seething and rage, he was always open to substantial climate actionIt's more like \\"infrastructure, climate spending, and the full 10 years social spending with more policies included, and you may also get chips too\\" vs \\"what we did get\\" Cause you can only do Budget Reconciliation once a year, so two bites at the apple and the Democrats already used one of them for their Covid recovery Bill.Once a *budget year*. Which speaks to another issue where the Dems fucked up massively, though this was more Biden than SchumerDems massively overspent on the early 2021 stimulus which added like 2 to 4 points to inflation at its peak and wasn't necessary given that the economy was already bouncing back and vaccines were already going out. And the GOP had 10 senators willing to pass a much smaller moderate compromise stimulus that was more appropriate for the estimated output gapIf Biden took the GOP compromise rather than using his first reconciliation opportunity for a shitty overstuffed deficit spending stimulus, he could have appeared bipartisan from the start and then immediately pivoted to doing BBB. And that would be a huge benefit for the Dems because Manchin's biggest sticking point for BBB topline spending was simply worries about spending too much and causing inflation. He came up with his $1.5t topline in the middle of 2021 when inflation had already spiked up to like 5% but early in 2021 inflation was still around 1 or 2%. It's hard to say how much more spending he'd allow with an earlier BBB negotiations but one could expect it to potentially be more, perhaps something like $2 to $3 trillion, which wouldn't allow Biden to get all of his initial $4.5t \\"human infrastructure\\" and \\"families plan\\" proposals to go through, but would allow considerably more to be done, and importantly (for getting liberals and progs onboard easier) would allow for the CTC expansion to be done largely in full while still doing other spending too (since the CTC expansion itself was roughly $1.5t)So Dems could have likely gotten more of their social spending goals done while getting a \\"good enough\\" and less inflationary stimulus, and still getting climate spending done. And that all could have been done in the first few months of 2021, leaving the rest of 2021 and 2022 open for the Dems to try and negotiate for bipartisan infrastructure and chips and the other stuff. They'd anger the GOP more with a bigger BBB but would also have appeared more bipartisan from the start by taking the gop stimulus offer, and maybe it breaks even or it just turns out that GOP opposition to infrastructure and chips wouldn't be that popular and would hurt them. And even in that scenario, that leaves the second reconciliation opportunity that started in October 2021 open to be used for other things - this allows Dems to potentially bundle chips and infrastructure and pass them as a reconciliation bill starting October 2021. Which could also make the GOP look worse for not supporting those bills and forcing the Dems to do it on their ownWith inflation being lower due to a smaller stimulus and with the GOP appearing more partisan, maybe that would have also been enough to get Dems the 1% more of the vote that they'd need in the 2022 elections to get 52 Senate seats and hold the house","title":"Democrats stick with Schumer as leader.

I'm for the former not the latter because of the differences between education and health care.  Vouchers for education diverts funding away from education for all. Public schools provide for difficult to educate students, those with special needs. Private and religious schools do not.  Vouchers exacerbate the gap between the rich and everyone else.Vouchers for health care, funded through income tax, doesn't have this effect. Rich and poor would all receive the same basic care. The wealthy would be paying their fair share and so this would reduce the gap providing better overall public health.  I oppose Medicare for all because Medicare is funded through wage taxes, a regressive method of taxation. Income tax is superior because it includes capital gains tax and so taxes workers and investors at the same rate. I'd like to see an expansion of ACA tax credit eligibility, something that outgoing administration has supported. I believe this is what the Democrats and the American people want.Possibly we could model education credits on ACA tax credits. If so they would be funded through income tax and given out to those with higher needs and lower income. The system would be progressive rather than regressive. The credits to a low-income family with high-needs students(autism, fragile health) would need to be way higher than the credits given to star students from high-income families. Another difference is that ACA tax credits are for insurance, not directly for health care.

So instead of having a unifying message of people can identify how they please and here are some basic protections (something that most people can agree on), we started having debates over inmates and sports. Imo, Dems need to find the core ideals where most (if not all) of the party agrees, hammer those ideals in campaigns until they are able to enact them into law, and *then* focus on some of the other issues that arise from there.","title":"Liberals should defend civil rights  not cower based on election results"},{"text":"Come to the R side, John.

You cant just repeat 2020 Biden talking points with barely any change and expect to let Trump dig his own grave. Trump, on the other hand, won because he is really good at stirring up emotions in low propensity voters. Lots of ordinary people are politically disengaged, but many, particularly young men, feel like feminism and political correctness have gone too far. Take somewhere that Trump outperformed republicans historically. Put yourself in the shoe of a young black man in Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee, or Atlanta. Youre a democrat because you believe in a large social safety net. Youve voted democrat your entire life. But in these past few years, youve noticed that all these democrats you elect talk a lot but never deliver, or only deliver something watered down by their corporate donors. Meanwhile, crime seems to be rising in your area, so you feel less safe. Democrats have tightened rules on policing, so it seems like theyre to blame. Then comes Trump. Trump promises to be your retribution. Hell take you back to when life was easier. Hell crack down on the crime in your neighborhood by deporting the illegal immigrants and stopping the fentanyl epidemic. Of course none of this is actually practical, but instead of voting for the same old thing, you vote for Trump hoping something he throws at the wall sticks. Democracy and abortion rights arent really at the front of your mind when you work day to day and paycheck to paycheck, and it seems like democrats are out of touch with your struggles. Trump feels like a natural choice. You see the potential in him for change, ANY change, something seemingly hopeless from the democrats youve voted for all your life. The above is not my view, its just me imagining a lifelong working class democrat who went for Trump this cycle. Its not identity politics, its that Trump openly doesnt play by political rules, and when political rules have led to the same old thing for so many people, those same people want to see someone who comes in and messes up the system.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"No reason","title":"Do you think QAnon will return when Trump is back in office?"},{"text":"Agreed, and there's an even older mentor figure these people have been raised on but whose compassionate teachings they choose to ignore.

PollingSo far, things are looking pretty bleak, the riots earlier this year stunted Starmers honeymoon period and between scandals, doom and gloom messaging and a budget that was always going to anger more people that it pleased hes been on a steady decline since, BUT, it must be remembered that it has only been 5 months, the effects of Labour policies have not actually taken effect yet, assuming the predictions correct when labours policies start to  bare fruit the anger will subside and people will start to warm or at least be more neutral towards the government (especially as it will give them a platform to stand on) and a rebound is at least likely, its also important to remember Starmer is stunted by his more centrist position on Isreal Palestine which is not popular with young and Muslim voters, I believe a ceasefire is likely within the next 5 years and so this will become less of a strong talking point to use against him so many of these voter will come back to Labour2. National polling is not national seat shareOk, lets say things stay bad, starmer stays unpopular, reform rise in the polls, this does not help them in terms of power, sure reform may gain seats but in order to gain enough to form a government they are going to need a bloody tone of seats and the more they rise the more they split the right wing vote paving the way for more Lib Dem and Labour seats in strong conservative areas, sure they might take some Labour seats but without a formal pact with the tories all they will do is hurt both their chances in the aggregate and considering reform was built on not being the conservatives a reform conservative coalition would turn off a lot of centre right voters who will either sit the election out or go towards the other more centre options and a lot of reform supporters would be displeased with this concept aswell, lets also consider this election wasnt just a disaster for the conservatives, the SNP absolutely bombed this cycle with and with no party wide unity around any idea of where to go from here Scotland is poised to become a Labour stronghold once more, giving Starmer one crucial reliably left wing region to rely on keeping Labour in power, its the same story in London, despite perfuming quite poorly London gained Labour MPs3.

Yet they still want the benefits of extremely cheap labor, just with the added benefit of being able to threaten them with deportation so they don't ask for any decency. The liberal view is to close all illegal immigration, provide some small help to some of the immigrants already here, and open up more legal immigration. The reality is that most people taking the conservative view have no problem with the \\"right\\" sort of immigrants (i.e., white, European) regardless of their legal status and have problems with legal immigrants if they're the wrong color (see: the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, who are here legally).

If 20% of people support Reform as was polled in the last election and Labours support decreases to 30% (its probably much lower than that right now), even that is only a 10 point difference. Wilder things have happened like Theresa Mays 25 point lead over Corbyn evaporating into 2 points over a 6 week campaign. As for facts, what elections of late have been won by facts? Did Kamala Harris win with facts or did Trump win with emotions? Do you seriously believe that winning the information war means anything?Or do you mean facts as in supporting evidence for my view, if you read my post I already stated Labour got almost the same number of votes as Corbyn in 2019. But if we assume Labour only have a 10 point lead over Reform (perfectly possible considering Reforms 20% performance in the polls) and Labour is 30% (probably much lower) then thats only a 10 point difference. Corbyn overturned a 25 point lead by Theresa May in the space of 6 weeks so stranger things have happened.

They've become the party of the status quo at a time when people are so fed up with the status quo that they're willing to vote for the party of fuck it, whatever, can't be worse.  Democrats need to stand for something, first, and then they need to tell people directly how that's something the people should support.  No half-assed, mealy-mouthed stuff.  Straight talk.And, look, I'm no marketing expert -- but I'd love to hear stuff like:The rich have rigged the game.

They're not going to be nice to you just because you gave them everything they wanted.A society should give people a chance to be at least middle class.No one, man or woman, should have the government in the exam room with them.

The 1st question posed to her was \\"What do you think would be the biggest specific difference between your Presidency and a Biden Presidency?\\" She said they were obviously 2 different people. They have a lot of shared experiences, for example the way they feel about their families and parents, but they're 2 different people and she will bring her own sensibilities to how she will lead. She then gave examples about how an issue SHE'S very focused on is home healthcare, and that SHE'S done a lot of work on and cares a lot about violence against women and children, SHE loves our small businesses and gave a backstory why, and so the influence of a personal experience will have its impact on a Presidency.The NEXT question, by the same journalist was \\"If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden, DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS. And after saying there's not a thing that comes to mind in terms of...she went to explain those first few words by saying how she was a part of several key things including how they brought the price of insulin down for seniors, but continued that HER intention is to expand that to all Americans during her Presidency. Then she went on to list another accomplishment they had that was a shared priority.Having JUST answered the previous question posed to her, by the same journalist, there was no need for her to re-state everything else she just stated 2 minutes prior.Context matters. And, as I already said, claiming she was asked what would she do different than Biden and her answer was\\"not a thing comes to mind\\" like the media has repeatedly reported, is a misrepresentation. I watched her interview live. Her full interview. And your assembly of selected 3rd party transcripts and links and incorrect interpretations is a misrepresentation too.As for your suggestion she should have said \\"I would have signed my name on the check,\\"  I don't think she feels that way, and neither do I. So claiming that should have been her answer is ridiculous.All this, keeping in mind, that you interpret her saying that she and Biden have a shared experience of how they feel about their parents and families, as a BS answer that implies Biden doesn't love his family. ??

The left and progressives want a lot of positive rights like guaranteed housing, a 20 dollar minimum wage (or whatever ridiculous number it's up to now), socialized medicine. They could be losing because they're asking for a lot but I really think if they advocated for like a $12 minimum wage tied to inflation or increased funding to homeless shelters, or little incremental things. The left though wants every thing and are really disappointed when these things don't get delivered within an election cycle. People really need to step granted look at the grand scale of history.
