Trump! ??"},{"text":"There's a formal decision making process known as Multi Criteria Decision Analysis used to inform decisions in many areas.  MCDA considers two types of factors when analysing choices: criteria, and constraints.  Criteria are variable and you can grade two alternatives against each other by a single criteria.  Constraints are binary and if an alternative doesn't meet a constraint it is eliminated as a potential choice.  By giving each option a weighted value for criteria and adding those together, and then multiplying that sum by the binary values of each constraint we can determine which option best meets our requirements.In MCDA we care about all requirements, but some requirements may be deal breakers.  For example  maybe we want to build a new port, criteria might be proximity to industry (for cargo) and proximity to major urban centers (for tourism), and a constraint could be water depth must be greater than 20 meters (because if its not at least that deep cargo ships and cruise ships won't be able to dock).  A dock that is close to industry but far from an urban center or vice versa and have water depth greater than 20 meters are both viable options.  A dock that is close to both industry and an urban centre but has a water depth of only 10 meters is not a viable option.People intuitively make their decision on who to vote for using something approximating this method, they care about a range of factors but for whatever personal reasons they have imposed 1 or more constraints on the choice.  That does not mean the have no criteria or do not care about those criteria.","title":"CMV: those who don't vote because of a single issue (e.g. Gaza) don't care about any other issues"},{"text":"Honestly wondered if he posted that just to try to get more people out to vote lol","title":"Where is Harris?"},{"text":"Amen brother","title":"My vote as a combat veteran is for #Maga2024"},{"text":"rides in the passenger seat like he did the garbage truck.","title":"Trump campaign denies and revokes journalists election night credentials after critical coverage"},{"text":"Well, to be fair to the Dem party, they've already been protecting us from that terrible threat.?\\n(Terrible threat to their investment accounts, that is.)","title":"Y'know...

This also happens to be a land where denial is pervasive. You believe that you live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, yet you live in the most controlled experimental society on the planet. The tyranny that has been set up here is rather interesting, because it is a tyranny without walls. As a country and a collective consciousness, the United States still has not reached an awareness that something is not right. The environment of the United States is actually much more controlled than that of the former Soviet Union, where the control was obvious. Because everyone is so frightened of giving up the system in the United States, they are going to be forced to give it up. The system is corrupt. It does not work. It does not honor life, and it does not honor Earth. That is the bottom line. If something does not honor life and does not honor Earth, you can bet it's going to fall and it's going to fall big time. Consciousness must change. This is part of the Divine Plan, and this opportunity and setup are not going to be missed. There has been an over involvement in the material world and a complete lack of understanding of the nonphysical world that exists all around you, so there will be a reprioritizing of what comes first in life. People will stand up once they have lost everything, who had never thought of standing up when they owned everything.Much of the political maneuvering going on, particularly in the United States, is purposely designed to separate you. Look at the New Age. Do you see how the New Age is separated? All kinds of things are said to keep you from discovering what you have in common. When people discover this, they will begin to get angry. As more and more of the methods of control and separation are revealed to you, the anger will build in the United States. Events will occur that may look as if the country is falling apart, yet they will serve the purpose of bringing people together. A new pride and a new sense of integrity will come about because this is what is designed for the times.\\" The material realm is one area that everyone relates to. Life in the United States translates into how much money you have in your pocket and how much money the government wants out of what you have in your pocket. Taxes will be the issue that will create both the greatest amount of havoc in the United States and the greatest amount of unification, because you all have taxes in common. You may not worship the same God, but you all pay taxes. With a few more taxes piled on top of one another, people will begin to examine the quality of their lives. You will see a lot of anger in this country, because many people will feel powerless. Anger is one of the first emotions that will occur when people finally understand the manipulation thats been going on and begin to get in touch with their feelings.\\" People who need to watch television are not tapping into the wealth of information within their minds and immediately accessible all around them. As a matter of fact, if you really want to evolve, do not read your newspapers, do not listen to the radio, and do not watch television. If you are able to be media free for periods of time and you disengage yourself from the frequency of chaos and anxiety and stress and hustle-bustle and temptations of all kinds that you dont need, you begin to get clear. You begin to listen to what is going on inside of yourself and to live in the world and not necessarily be lost in it. You become clear. We cannot emphasize this enough! The education system is another area where you are controlled. Most of what you are taught is false. You work hard, take loans out, and pay money to learn something that is antiquated before you even set foot in the door, particularly in the realms of scientific, mathematical, psychological, and medical exploration.\\"-Bringers of the Dawn- Teachings From the Pleiadians book; Chapter 8, Outside the Ultimate Tyranny-- 1992 [Channeled in 1988-1989]","title":"I ve never seen propaganda this heavy since the Iraq war!"},{"text":"Just me and the bots","title":"Trump is going to win the election and the far-left lunatics on this site are going to have a complete meltdown"},{"text":"Weird","title":"'Disqualifying': Critics Torch Trump After Ugly Last-Minute Attack On Nancy Pelosi"},{"text":"awaiting election results is like the entire country waiting on a STD test to come back","title":"Advisers urge Donald Trump to declare victory prematurely on election night"},{"text":"Dont have to get rid of the filibuster, just actually enforce it.

One of the surprisingly unique things about Abrahamic religion in particular, so Judaism Christianity and Islam, is that it has this enduring quality and an ability to bind a community together. I don't think this is anywhere as evident as it is with the Jewish people. Beginning with the Assyrian invasion of the Northern nation of Israel around I think like 200 BCE, and then continuing into the Babylonian exile about 100 years later, the Jewish people found themselves a nation without a state. And as such they began to identify with this shared cultural heritage as opposed to a geographic location. And I say shared cultural heritage because around this time. In the world there really wasn't a concept of religion as separate from culture.So what ended up happening when the early Jewish religious texts were being curated, and this curation was happening in exile, you had a focus on building and enduring community and a resistance to assimilation. From an anthropological standpoint it's fascinating, it is not often that a group of people can maintain a cultural identity while being immersed in very different cultures. And while this is very evident with the early Jewish people, and the modern Jewish people for that matter, I believe a lot of that influence has impacted the growth of Christianity and Islam as well. Those religions tend to spread rather than adapt to new cultures as they encounter them. 2500 years of refining the recipe came up with something that resonates with people pretty well.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"He wouldn't have had enough dark energy to make it if he hadn't helped genocide those East Timoreans","title":"Bernard Marcus, cofounder of The Home Depot and billionaire Republican megadonor, has died"},{"text":"Maybe.

Or take vitamin supplements if they have deficiencies or get more sunlight if they require it for something like seasonal depression. Whether patients actually follow their doctor's advice is a different story, which is why pills get prescribed in conjunction with said advice so that at least some progress can be made even if patients were to fully ignore advice (which they do all the time), not to mention that many conditions progress beyond the point of natural remedies being solely effective.

The deep state isnt the Democratic Party, or the few real republicans in office, its the Trump party and the people who have grifted under him in order to gain position of power. Its honestly sickening for a democracy.

There is a reason you have a mental evaluation before joining the armed services, or law enforcement of any nature, because guns are not toys or props. They are a purpose built tool that isnt to be taken lightly. Yet these morons show them off for some kind of social status. My dad was in the FBI, grandfather in the GBI.

Abortion is probably the best example of the opposite. How a single issue voting bloc that consistently turns out to vote can have outsized influence. In Canada, pro-lifers represent about 10% of the population and 2/3 of the major parties do not allow their MP's do be pro-life. The conservatives are sitting at about 44% support and are looking to take 220 of 338 seats. If Pierre Pollievere decided to ban Pro-lifers from his party and those voters all stayed home, he would lose about 25% of his support and quite likely the election.\\nSo just 10% of the population has the ability to play kingmaker if everyone of them has the balls to stay home on election night. \\nMany US elections are determined by just a few % points and a minor swing can seriously effect the election.

Abortion is probably the best example of the opposite. How a single issue voting bloc that consistently turns out to vote can have outsized influence.

The conservatives are sitting at about 44% support and are looking to take 220 of 338 seats. If Pierre Pollievere decided to ban Pro-lifers from his party and those voters all stayed home, he would lose about 25% of his support and quite likely the election.\\nSo just 10% of the population has the ability to play kingmaker if everyone of them has the balls to stay home on election night. \\nMany US elections are determined by just a few % points and a minor swing can seriously effect the election. And if your party refuses to reassess, that is on the party.Edit: to better address your point. A party refusing to reassess for a single issue is not any different than for multiple issues.

Are you conflating left-wingers with what you call non-western men? Which group are we talking about? It is just happened, that Non-Western traditionalists dont have political power to have influence in Western politics and install their supremacy,I think you pretty much answered your own question. Western left-wingers are less vocal and less concerned about the beliefs of minority traditionalists by reason that they are not a relevant influence in their country's politics. That should not be confused with agreement with their views, it's just that concerns about their political influence are a low priority compared to the influence of christians in politics. The left-wing ideology greatly values secularism. This means simply that all religions should have equal freedom to practice their beliefs in the nation. So yeah...when one religious group is being oppressed by the actions or policies of another, then it is consistent with their beliefs to defend those minority groups.  so they fall into the category of oppressed ones, however the left-wingers fail to realize, that they are not their ideological allies. In fact they will be for Western equality until they will have the right to install their rules.I think most leftists recognize this. But part of the feature a secular laws is that they don't just protect minorities, they also prevent majority religions from \\"installing\\" their rules. So again, it is consistent to resist Christian influence in government because those same efforts prevent any other religions from overly-influencing the government. Look, we can reasonably discuss the merits of a secular society or not, but I don't think your characterization of left-wingers is fair. Their actions and views are consistent with regards to their secularist beliefs.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Thats because hes a rapist","title":"Team Trump Knows the End Is Nearand Theyre Pissed at Their Candidate - Donald Trumps own team is disgusted by him, according to a new report."},{"text":"No one will look down on you getting that L.

Maybe they give a grace period for said issue to be corrected, but if what they intended isn't or can't be fulfilled by local officials, they'll send their own agents, kick out the locals, to get the job done until the issue is resolved. They've **usurped** authority over local matters/powers, that local governments should be tackling and made them a lame duck in the issue. In whatever matter that was, the local government has been effectively *taken over*.  The DOJ does things a bit different. Since the 70s, states have temporarily lost their prison systems to federal authority, through receivership, due to how poorly they were run, its happened about 12-15 times and lasted for years. Which does not sound like alot. NY is currently at risk of losing Rikers to the Feds. DOJ has also used to method to take over mental health agencies, CPS, public housing administrations (like kansas city). Receiverships is direct and total take over of whatever administrations local government setup. If you're asking for instances of Guarantee clause (the whole state must have a republican government), that basically hasn't been used since the civil war. Its a nonjusticiable political doctrine, which is why you never hear of it. Only time SCOTUS will take a case related to it is to say \\"we don't take cases related to this\\".  Since it requires either the President or Congress to enact, its rare.

An extra $63 billion would not significantly change healthcare outcomes, and claiming every death from inadequate healthcare could be prevented with that little money is absurd. $30 billion a year would not be nearly enough to create a general national healthcare program from scratch. You're making the common mistake of grossly overestimating the size of US foreign aid relative to the budget. Cutting all foreign aid would not make it significantly easier to fund domestic programs. Also, if you oppose genocide, why are you ignoring Ukraine? Russia is obviously determined to conquer as much of Ukraine as possible and reduce what remains to a client state. Many documented Russian war crimes, such as [massacres of noncombatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucha_massacre) and [kidnapping of Ukrainian children](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-children-abducted-by-russia-left-with-psychological-scars-campaigners-2024-06-15/), suggest genocidal intent.

People should really wonder about this. It is manipulative one way or another:On the surface it looks like the bias is SO EXTREME in favor of Kamala Harris that you shouldn't support her, because you're being manipulated to by the system.However...This could be reverse psychology --- where the system pushes so hard for Kamala that the citizenry vote against her, in reaction to the manipulation.On their side of the fence they have the tools to know how most people react, so they can push one way or the other depending on how they want people to vote.  Or rather, how they want people to believe the outcome of the election will go.Because let's be real here... If voting made a difference they wouldn't let us do it.PS. I *am* voting for Trump though. Mainly out of spite for all the people who supported vaccine mandates and forced masking... And because Trump integrated RFK into his campaign. Truth be told -- I don't trust Trump... But I like Trump supporters more than I like Democrats. The Democratic party is the party of censorship and hate, and their woke agendas took all the color out of life.

He added, It costs you nothing.The embrace by the Trump movement by a literal neo-Nazi  who was previously a member of the Proud Boys, Patriot Front, and another hate group called The Base  offers evidence that Trumps late, ugly, attempts to expand his appeal to the fetid fringe of the American right could have met with some success. The Trump campaign did not respond to Rolling Stones request for comment.Based in New England, NSC-131 is infamous for dressing in black and conducting intimidating and sometimes violent flash-mobs. NSC-131 has often attempted to mainstream its hate by riding MAGA coattails  targeting the same kinds of people in person that Trump blasts, rhetorically, in his stump speeches  whether that means shouting down Drag Queen Story hours at public libraries, or harassing migrant workers housed at Boston-area hotels.Hood writes that the neo-Nazis long-term goals are not achievable quickly. In the meantime though, It is our responsibility to think clearly and do whatever we can to preserve and improve what we can in these times, he writes. Because of this, I am advocating for all Nationalists in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Virginia, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan to vote for Donald Trump.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-endorsement-neo-nazi-leader-nsc-131-1235154089/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-endorsement-neo-nazi-leader-nsc-131-1235154089/)","title":"Literal Neo-Nazi Leader Endorses Trump"},{"text":"Great post, future Conservative supreme court judge!","title":"Why Roe V.
