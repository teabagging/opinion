Part of the reason she lost is voters didnt believe her on her positions or believe she was being authentic bc she flip flopped or denounced her 2019 primary positions. I really hate this argument that Dems need to lie by promising pie in the sky policies (as its framed sometimes). Just genuinely work towards pie in the sky policy and be authentic in your position on it.

We went from \\"bomb bomb Iran\\" and a Republican president starting two decades long wars that arguing against made you unpatriotic, to a Republican presidential candidate bragging about no new wars and pushing isolationism.  America first speaks to those who feel abandoned by a government that is still helping others around the world. The Democrats keep pushing social policies, while breaking about how much they help minorities. If you paid any attention to Sanders, he left that last part of. Democrats could have ran on big social policies that benefit all Americans first, but they almost always seem to put a racial spin on it. They are going to help black business owners or black communities with policies that could help all Americans, but they don't message it like that well most of the time. Tell me, who was Harris going to help. If you were a single white man in his 40s making an average income in a state like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, it Michigan, what did Harris promise you? That she wasn't Trump mostly. She aligned herself with one of the families known for the waste of American lives and money in foreign wars that we shouldn't be involved in, promised very little to nothing in her messaging to these sorts of voters, and expected you to vote against the other guy. The other guy whose promising you that your life will get better because he's going to fight the things he's told you that's making it worse. Anyone with half a brain knew Trump's ideas won't help this type of guy, but the average voter doesn't know that. Instead they see the Cheney's, they hear how families will get a bigger tax credit, how first time homebuyers will get money, how those with student loans or starting businesses will get money, and maybe you get let taxes at the same time. Trump already lowered their taxes in their eyes. This is coming from someone who was excited for Harris, excited for a presidential candidate for the first time since Obama. I recognize the messaging issue, it's pretty clear for those who care to see it.

I see a world where children are harmed &amp; religious organizations cover it up and still present themselves as moral authority. Our existences are less safe since the first time he ran. I am angry and rightfully so that someone fueling hate &amp; violence is someone anyone could support. The GOP should have fallen apart long ago, or  distanced themselves from his rhetoric. So, yes. It is ironic. I've always thought we were screwed with a 2 party system. I grew up &amp; was watching the news since the George HW Bush. Which means I grew up through that war. No one had to tell me what wasn't adding up. Increasing the threat of safety to our own citizens is a damn problem. Don't you agree? So, my frustration with everything isn't because I \\"buy into\\" shit.It's because the GOP has run on hate &amp; promoted division within our people, and it is clear to me that it's far worse than even what may have laid dormant within some. So YES I take issue with that being overlooked as a non-issue. The GOP CREATED more lack of safety within our neighborhoods. Continuously. Yes, I take issue with that.

Four years ago, Trump refused to concede defeat to Biden, spreading baseless conspiracy theories that ultimately fueled the January 6 Capitol attack. This time, Biden hosted Trump with the calm demeanor he has championed as essential to preserving democracy, emphasizing collaboration with Trumps transition team to ensure a smooth handover of federal responsibilities.The transition stands in stark contrast to Trumps behavior in 2020, when his administration delayed key bureaucratic processes, stalling necessary preparations for the incoming Biden administration. By contrast, the Biden administration has been proactive, with the General Services Administration promptly acknowledging Trumps victory and initiating the transfer of administrative services. This underscores Bidens dedication to upholding democratic norms, even in the face of political rivalry.Another defining moment will occur on January 6, 2025, when Vice President Kamala Harris fulfills her duty to certify the election results, a solemn task performed in the very spot pro-Trump extremists overran four years prior. Her actions, alongside Bidens, illustrate a commitment to democracy that transcends personal political ambition, offering a fleeting return to normalcy before the uncertainties of a second Trump presidency. Together, these actions serve as a final testament to Bidens belief in the resilience of democratic principles.","title":"The Biden-Trump White House meeting was more than just a photo-op"},{"text":"Fair enough, the administration wasn't good on the border.

His stated goal in The Little Red Book is being witnessed today: in the universities. Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist renowned for his work in explaining the different mindsets in liberals and conservatives, has long warned about the growing political polarization and the change in culture at universities. In his book The Coddling of the American Mind, Haidt and his colleague Greg Lukianoff argue that the proliferation of three great untruths, namely what doesnt kill you makes you weaker, always trust your feelings, and life is a battle between good people and evil people, have set the stage for political absolutism on college campuses. By holding sacred the ideas of intersectionality, microaggressions, trigger warnings and other like terms, Haidt contends that a generation has been set up for failure, instilled with a mindset towards safetyism, the acceptance of revisionist history, and the belief that institutions that did not guarantee equitable outcomes must be intrinsically inequitable.

Read my reply a little more thoroughly. Raising the minimum wage to something liveable and enforceable means that it becomes a base minimum rather than an archaic rate from the 1970's. Raising it will mean that workers will be paid more than you are currently offering. Employers are always able to pay more than the minimum in order to compete for workers, as they do now, however the minimum must be raised in order for it to have any effect on wages.Raising the minimum to , say, $25 per hour means that workers on the adjusted minimum will not be screwed by low wages, such as that your businesses currently pay.Once a fair and liveable wage is established it must be adjusted for increases in cost of living so that it is not eaten away by inflation and become meaningless as it has over decades.If your business models are dependent on paying low wages then you need to raise your prices to pay higher wages or reconsider your business models.","title":"Bernie Sanders Says Democrats Have Lost Their Way"},{"text":"Nope, we've become soft.

The average American has been hurting economically since 2016 and its only gotten worse, and that heavily influenced the election as much as i want to mock the \\"Egg prices are high so i voted for Trump\\" sentiment, there is a legit problem there, where the average american is getting priced out of being able to simply live. This is neither desirable or sustainable and serious reforms need to be considered to bring down inflation, rent prices, and make the economy simply work for the average Joe. The wrong lessons that Democrats could take, is to become even more conservative in response to this election, to try and capture Republican voters like they tried doing. The facts speak for themselves, 94% of Republicans voted for Trump, and out of the remaining 6% i imagine a significant portion of them just sat out of the election instead of voting for Harris. The push to embrace \\"moderate\\" Republicans who got pushed out of the Republican party such as the Cheneys was doomed to fail, and only served to turn off Progressive and Muslim voters in the process. Another wrong lesson to take away would be to abandon parts of the coalition to make it more \\"appealing\\" to people who likely aren't going to vote Dem anyway, in this i mean throwing the LGBT community under the bus to appeal to transphobes and homophobes, or other minorities. This would be a massive mistake as it would fracture any trust built between the coalition under the idea that at any time if the DNC think its worthwhile politically, members of the party will be ignored and cast out. And we saw from the DNC's decision to embrace the Cheneys that they aren't particularly smart or politically savvy to know what the right option is, and this is without going into moral and ethical issues.","title":"Post 2024 Democratic Party Re-Branding Future Compass"},{"text":"Poor little angry incel troll.

To the contrary, the left got the majority of Muslim and Arab votes, but it was split between Stein and Harris.

This Representative has voted in favor of abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Medicare expansion, among many things, demonstrating that she and her constituents are not conservatives.Second, stop conflating Arabs and Muslims. A huge percentage of the Arab population on Michigan is and has always been Christian. Same with a lot of Palestinians suffering Israeli aggression right now, especially at the West Bank, are Christians.Finally, Im also mad that Kamala lost and that people voted against their self-interests. However, instead of attacking them, why not reflect on why were losing those voters? Last time we lost, we were upset that the working class voted for Trump, mocking them because Trumps policies would hurt them in the long run. Did that help us earn their votes back? No. We lost the working-class vote even more now (the real reason why we lost Pennsylvania). Now, the way we are behaving will guarantee that well lose Michigan for the foreseeable future.Lets be better at fighting the real fight to defend the vulnerable.

However, if you ever take a drive across the country and stay in, say, mid-state Pennsylvania you'll find that only Fox and Sinclair are seen.  Channels like MSNBC and CNN aren't watched in bars, hotel lobbies, or doctor's offices.  There isn't enough advertising pull for left or central channels to make an effort to be relevant.Also, in deep parts of the country where the population is sparse there isn't enough advertising pull to attract the mainstream channels.  There isn't enough pull to attract any channels, for that matter, so the often the only options are stations deep-pocket billionaires have bought up to push right wing propaganda.I stayed in a hotel near Wilkes-Barre recently, just before the election.  The local news reported: A) a whistleblower report that FEMA leadership had directed all aide staff to bypass Trump supporter's households, B) college campuses are now too dangerous to visit because of all the random terrorist violence, and C) everyone was looking forward to the low prices and prosperity that Trump's tariffs would bring.  I learned a few other things in the hour I watched.  College administrators in big-named schools are effeminate guys with blue hair and nose rings that report high levels of anxiety from a potential Trump's win.  \\"Normal\\" schools, like the small religious schools down south, run by clean-cut guys in button down shirts, report no such anxiety on campus.Living in the DC suburbs I can assure you that that channels like this do not, and cannot, exist.

When it comes to those championing the indefensible addition of known neurotoxin (derived from industrial waste, no less) to all of our drinking water, no rational arguments whatsoever are ever mounted or responded to. It's always straight to appeals to ridicule and/or authority since this strategy was [first outlined by Edward Bernays in the 1950s](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/08/lifeandhealth.health).Now, a new book, The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson, just published in the US, examines the background of the fluoridation debate. Bryson, who has had the advantage of access to recently declassified files, concludes that fluoridation is a triumph not of medical science but of US government spin, adding that, \\"The very same professionals and institutions who told us that fluoride was safe said much the same about lead, asbestos or DDT, or persuaded us to smoke more cigarettes.\\"In fact, in the 1930s, the very first researcher into fluoride, a Dane called Kaj Roholm, specifically advised against exposing children to fluoride, but his work was soon buried. Bryson links **the subsequent \\"discovery\\" that fluoride benefited teeth with research paid for by major US industries that needed to be able to defend \\"lawsuits from workers and communities poisoned by industrial fluoride emissions\\".**In 1955, farmers in Oregon took Reynolds Metals to court, alleging harm from fluoride emissions. The key medical experts for the farmers were Donald Hunter, an English specialist in industrial diseases, who told the court that fluoride was particularly dangerous because it was \\"an enzyme poison\\"; and Dr Richard Capps from Chicago, who gave evidence that fluoride displaced iodine in the body, thus leading to thyroid dysfunction. The farmers won a sensational victory, and US industrialists were shaken.** Dr Robert Kehoe, whose work was funded by major US companies, resolved - according to Bryson - to create a new medical orthodoxy that would be unassailable in future court cases. Kehoe set up an experiment with beagles, with the dogs breathing in fluoride. The results were alarming, and showed that fluoride travelled rapidly from the lungs into the blood stream, causing significant harm. Lawyers for major US companies received copies of the dog study; needless to say, it went no further. Until Bryson found it, no one knew of its existence.**The drive to encourage public acceptance of fluoride was handed over to Edward Bernays, known as the father of PR, or the original spin doctor, and the man who helped persuade women to take up smoking. **\\"You can get practically any idea accepted,\\" Bernays explained, \\"if doctors are in favour. The public is willing to accept it because a doctor is an authority to most people, regardless of how much he knows or doesn't know.\\"**Among the things that the doctors who endorsed fluoridation didn't know, according to Bryson, were that research impugning fluoride's safety was either suppressed or not conducted in the first place. When one doctor reported that fluoride supplements produced harmful side-effects in pregnant women, he received no funding to carry out further work.So fluoride became equated with scientific progress, and those opposing it were dismissed as cranks. For 30 years, little changed, with both sides in their entrenched positions.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"Wouldn't surprise me.

Meanwhile, Trump has been more or less constantly campaigning since 2015.Trump successfully fooled the majority of voters into believing that the economy was terrible, and that any and all economic issues (ranging from inflation to poor job reports) rested singularly on Bidens shoulders.This realistically could have been avoided if Biden had announced in 2022 (or perhaps even earlier) that he would not run again. I personally thought he was too old back in 2020 in the primaries. Anyways, if he had done this, another candidate could have had the chance to make their case and draw a contrast from Biden. Biden lost the Democrats this election, as well as his legacy of ending the era of Trump, because of hubris.Further, its unfortunate just how uninformed the average voter is in this country.

He talked about it differently, and he tried to be marginally less cruel, but he accepted the underlying idea and continued the underlying policy. And consider that the Dems are *already* talking about abandoning trans people in response to this loss -- apparently the Dems are perfectly willing to find a place for Trump's near genocidal bigotry, because despite Harris not campaigning on this at all, it was like the *first* thing they jumped to.So the claim that Trump's policies are dangerous has no credibility, because Dems keep implementing functionally the same policies except marketed in a more compassionate way. This means that the people that actually care about how cruel Trump's immigration or anti-trans policies are have nothing to gain by voting Dem (in fact, the Dem marketing sometimes makes it harder to get people to realize how bad it still is, so it can almost be *more* difficult to protect people in the cross hairs), and decide to check out and pursue other, more direct methods for pursuing their interests.And the people who do turn out to vote either *like* Trump's cruelty or don't really care about cruelty in policies and are instead voting based on other factors.It's the same thing with Gaza -- it's all well and good to say that Trump's policies will be worse, but that isn't going to mean anything to a family whose relatives already died in May earlier this year. You can't scare people by saying Trump will kill their loved ones if Biden already did.So if Dems don't offer people who care about a thing something to *gain* by voting for them, then people who care about that thing won't vote, because voting doesn't offer them a solution to their concerns. Instead, they will seek out other methods to address those concerns.And if the only thing Dems are offering are things that only benefit a relatively small number of people who are already pretty well off (which is what small business and home down payment support are -- those are nice to have, but that is only going to help out s few people...most people won't significantly benefit from that), then the people who turn out to vote will be disproportionately people who are already pretty well off. And the Republicans generally make better offers for such people.Now, I agree that the threat Trump poses truly is extreme -- he is a fascist, and I think he is absolutely going to try to go as far towards Nazi Germany as he is capable of getting. But that is not something most people in the US have ever encountered before. As with climate change, that is a theoretical fear that requires people to understand and accept the existence of things they have never personally experienced. And that is very difficult.And if that is the only thing the Dems are focused on -- being spared from something that's not currently affecting you and that has never affected you in the past -- then they're not going to win.If Dems want to scare people, they have to present with tangible, viscerally frightening scenarios. And if there aren't such situations currently happening, they have to lie about it (like Trump does -- he made people viscerally afraid of immigrants and crime even though that is not a significant problem at all).But even then, that's a bad strategy, because it still plays into Trump's worldview: reality is what powerful people say it is. And Trump is a better liar than the Dems.So the *better* strategy is to both point out the threat of fascism while *also* offering a credible alternative set of ways for people to solve their material problems by voting for Democrats.Aka what Bernie Sanders tried to do and has repeatedly encouraged the Democrats to implement without him.","title":"Why So Many Latino Voters Abandoned Democrats, According to the Data"},{"text":"Yeah a big difference is Republican en masses still watch fox news and affiliates.

It wasn't her. It wasn't her campaign strategy. It wasn't her ground game.

Most people never learned that the most powerful weapon of the Nazi party was not their military. It wasn't their science and engineering. It was their weaponization of rhetoric. For when rhetoric is weaponized, it's one of the most powerful weapons that humanity has. Because there are no protections against this in our Constitution or system of laws, the deck was stacked against the Democrats. No matter what they did, the propaganda machine would have adjusted its barrage of lies to compensate.So until everybody wraps their head around this, we are screwed. Because the huge propaganda machine is going to keep chugging along radicalizing people. And it will continue to sow mistrust and confusion among others.

Watching all the liberal Karens cry and scream in agony on TikTok. Fox News, the only Trump supporter among the major news networks and its now No. 1 in ratings over trash like MSNBC and CNN. This election was a big middle finger to Hollywood and their far Left woke-ism theyre trying to brainwash to us. A big middle finger to trying to character assassinate Trump when these same people were his friends prior to 2015-2016. You can see the difference in YouTube thumbnails between Fox News vs. MSNBC or CNN. Fox News has anchors just laughing. Another day to mock butthurt Democrats. While MSNBC and CNN have anchors looking emo and needing a tissue. Remember after Jan 6, Dems called Trump a war criminal and us as traitors. Shouldnt we start calling them that if they cant accept defeat? Karma, b*tches. These next 4 years and perhaps beyond is going to be fun watching the Left get a taste of their own bad medicine.

Throughout the election, Republicans acted in bad faith. And by electing a tyrant, they have broken that social contract. So the idea that Democrats must then stay bound to an agreement that the other party backed out of, seems self-defeating. And it seems based on some ideological perspective about democracy that is fallacious. For if you look at our founding forefathers, they fought against tyranny to establish this country. Having the leader of America democracy fight against tyranny to preserve our democracy is in the spirit of that.Moreover, Biden's oath is to protect and preserve the Constitution. How is he doing that by giving it over to Trump so that Trump can establish an authoritarian government?No I'm not saying Biden has to do it. I'm not saying that he has the resources to do it.

Desalination and expanded energy capacity sound impressive, but they fall drastically short of whats needed to avert an impending water crisis. The World Bank estimates water scarcity could gut regional GDP by up to 6%, a stark warning of what's to come without radical infrastructure upgrades. The scale of investment needed is absolutely staggering.You mentioned desalination plants. Let's look at those. Egypt's water crisis is staggering, and addressing it purely through desalination is an almost Herculean task. To plug the annual water deficit of 7 billion cubic meters, Egypt would need around 14 massive desalination plants on par with the worlds largest facility (Ras Al-Khair Power and Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia), each producing 1.4 million cubic meters daily. The scale of this is immense. Not only would the cost be astronomical, but the power consumption required would be off the charts, it would massively strain Egypt's already fragile energy infrastructure. Desalination is a ravenous energy hog, and scaling up to this level would demand a staggering amount of electricity. This isn't even touching on the environmental fallout from massive brine disposal and the impact on marine ecosystems. Betting solely on desalination as a fix is just impractical.My argument about space. The new cities? Many are unaffordable to the average Egyptian. Building new while neglecting old, crumbling infrastructure is a bandage on a gaping wound. Housing remains a critical issue precisely because these projects miss the mark on accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Transforming the Western Desert into fertile land is a pipe dream without massive funding and climate adaptation measures. Prior attempts have largely flopped due to exorbitant costs and technical hurdles. Unless corruption and mismanagement are tackled head-on, pouring money into grandiose projects risks nothing but wasted ressources.Finally - Sure, Egypt survived the Ukraine supply shock, but its limping, not thriving. High inflation, surging poverty, and mounting public debt, currently around 90% of GDP, are evidence that the economy is on shaky ground. The IMFs warnings of debt distress underscore that this is not just a bump in the road; its a full-blown crisis waiting to happen.Egypt would need nothing short of top-to-bottom reform and the purging of decades of rot to stave off collapse. Without sweeping changes, relying on grandiose fixes like desalination or flooding the desert alone is nothing more than a band-aid over a gaping wound.","title":"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history"},{"text":"No, they need some hardship to teach them adversity","title":"This is insane.

I got sick suddenly and nobody seemed to be able to tell me why. I was misdiagnosed repeatedly for about 7 years and finally got a diagnosis that makes sense with a treatment that helps but isnt helping me as much as avoiding processed food and chemicals. I installed a reverse osmosis in my house to filter all the water we cook and eat with. I only use free and clear chemicals to clean. I rarely eat out. I dont eat any wheat at all. I dont drink alcohol or soda. There are still chemicals that cannot be avoided. My medicine was making me worse. I weaned myself from drugs that had the worst side effects. I found natural supplements that give the positive effects on my health that I took meds for with significantly tamer side effects than the meds. I take probiotics. I exercise in a significantly different way than most people now because the muscles I need to work are in my hands and legs. I have watched many people around me go thru something similar. They each have a different diagnosis. Those who dont change their lifestyles continue to get worse and rely on medicine to tame the side effects of their other medicine. Its a real problem. When I saw that he appointed RFK to the HHS I cried because 95% of the people I talk to act like I am crazy for avoiding all of this. My husband and my kids are the only ones who believe me cuz they saw how bad it got and they knew  it wasnt just laziness on my part. Swimming through all the information out there to figure out whats real and whats not was a huge part of my life. The government and doctors and mainstream media all tell us this is just a hoax but even published studies show its not. We dont have a healthcare system we have a sick care system that aims to keep us sick so they can make more money. I have good insurance and still spent thousands of dollars on medical care only to slowly abandon it when it didnt work. I only take 2 prescriptions now and they are both for vitamin deficiencies so still technically natural. I am in physical therapy and thats the extent of my medical care now. I am improving a lot and I am so hopeful that RFK can help keep the people from having to deal with these types of scenarios.","title":"This is insane.

He didnt do that by buddying up with the Cheneys and saying that everyone is too ignorant to recognize that the economy is going well for the working class. The numbers may show a good economy, but peoples material conditions dont reflect that.Obama was succeeding a Republican who had a collapsing economy. So, obviously he would have a message about the economy being terrible because the public was blaming the opposing party. Kamala was inheriting Joe's baggage and the baggage of the bad economy as the incumbent party. Two totally different situations. I would agree that Kamala made a mistake in not substantially differentiating herself from Biden. Would it have made a difference? Possibly, but hindsight is 20/20.But let's be clear. Obama did not run in the general election in 2008 as some unabashed liberal. He did his share of running to the middle as well. Every successful Presidential candidate does.&lt;&lt;The anti-trans ads were to mobilize their base in the bigot community.I think that is naive.

But if recent history tells us anything, its that patchwork solutions often lead to deeper crises down the line.Take Lebanon. A relatively small country that got international aid and intervention to stave off total collapse, yet it remains in economic freefall. Why? Corruption, mismanagement, and endless political deadlock ate up every lifeline. The aid became a Band-Aid that delayed but couldnt stop the bleeding.Or take the very famous case of Syria. The world spent billions to stabilize it in different ways, but it spiraled into chaos anyway, triggering one of the largest refugee crises ever. Humanitarian efforts, foreign military intervention, aid packages, you name it, poured in but couldnt overcome the internal rot and instability.The scale of Egypt is much larger than either example. Throwing money at a nation with a massive population, systemic issues, and a ticking time bomb of food insecurity is a far bigger challenge. Even if superpowers step in, it would be like trying to fill a sieve with water, eventually, it all slips through.Temporary aid might buy time, but unless Egypt can fundamentally reform (which seems unlikely given decades of entrenched problems), were just kicking the can down a very short road.","title":"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history"},{"text":"The correlation is the guy spent 99% of his time trying to win over a phantom crowd of people who wanted a faux republican softie liberal instead of just being a real democrat","title":"Weak Democrats like Jared Polis already caving to Trump"},{"text":"Shes 84 years old.
