The White House, and Biden personally, have spent days decrying Trump for making false claims about the disaster response, including that federal funding is being diverted for use on people in the country illegally and that such assistance is capped at $750. The $750 is an immediate need disbursement, Biden explained, to cover urgent requirements like food, diapers and baby formula. Asked if he planned to speak with Trump to urge him to stop, Biden said he wouldn&amp;#039;t, but followed that with a message delivered directly into television cameras: &amp;quot;Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life, man.

Check out the breakdown on the Marist poll this article is referring to:* Trump receives majority support among Gen X (56%) and edges Harris among GenZ/Millennials (52% to 47%). Harris has a slight advantage among Baby Boomers (52%). The Silent/Greatest Generation divide (50% for Harris to 48% for Trump).I get that this is just Florida but the idea that Florida is literally the opposite of the rest of the country is kind of insane. This leads me to believe that they are getting some really fucking weird Millenial/Gen Z folks responding and then amplifying them. I am seeing this all over the place in these polls. We might be about to witness one of the biggest polling misses ever.EDIT: Here is another crazy one* Trump (53%) is ahead of Harris (45%) among white voters but underperforms the 62% he received among this group in 2020. Trump (58%) also leads Harris (40%) among Latino voters. Here, he does better than the 46% he received four years ago. Harris (76%) has a wide lead over Trump (24%) among Black voters, though she comes up short of the 89% Biden received in 2020.All of those seem wrong in different directions.

The citys Hub is one of nine Investing in America Workforce Hubs launched by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all Americans including women, people of color, veterans, and other that have been historically left behindChave access to job opportunities, and the training needed to fill them. This announcement comes during President Bidens visit to Milwaukee, where he announced EPAs final rule to replace lead pipes within a decade and announced $2.6 billion in new funding to deliver clean drinking water nationwide.\\n \\nThanks to funding from President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, infrastructure projects totaling nearly $100 million are in the works across the City of Milwaukee. As part of these investments, the city has begun replacing 100 percent of its lead service lines, reducing the timeline for replacement from 60 years to 10 years in alignment with the Presidents goal. The Biden-Harris Administration will create thousands of jobs for Milwaukee residents through these investments, and will continue to collaborate with local organizations, ensuring the city is training the skilled workers needed to accomplish these projects. The City of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District are leading the charge in creating workforce opportunities for the community.\\n \\nToday, collaborators in the Milwaukee Workforce Hub are announcing commitments that will expand pathways into these good-paying jobs to meet the Presidents goal.*Scaling Up and Expanding Apprenticeships*Registered apprenticeships are the gold-standard model for training a new generation of workers in the skilled trades and provide pathways to high-quality jobs for women and other historically underrepresented groups. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested more than $730 million to expand Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships nationwide, leading to the hiring of more than 1 million apprentices.\\n \\nIn Milwaukee, local organizations are taking steps to use more apprentices on public projects and prioritize graduates of local pre-apprenticeship programs which serve underrepresented populations. These steps build on the citys existing program, which puts residents on a path to a journey-level position in a skilled trade.   \\n \\nIn total, these actions will create opportunities for hundreds of new apprentices and help to grow certified pre-apprenticeship programs serving underrepresented populations, including high school students from Milwaukee Public Schools.  \\n...  *Expanding Pipelines into Apprenticeship*These expanded registered apprenticeship slots will create new opportunities for hundreds of workers in the Milwaukee area. The Milwaukee Workforce Hub will work to ensure every resident has access to these opportunities, by investing in pre-apprenticeship programs that offer disadvantaged communities a chance to develop the skills and work experience needed to succeed in these apprenticeships. As a result of the Milwaukee Workforce Hub, dedicated funding for pre-apprenticeships in the area will grow by at least $650,000.  \\n...  *Providing Supportive Services*The Milwaukee Workforce Hub will also support residents as they begin working in these growing fields, by helping residents with supportive services, including career navigation services and stipends. These investments will help ensure that workers have the resources and skills they need for continued success in the industry.*Additional Federal Support for Workforce Development*In addition to commitments from partners, the Biden-Harris Administration is making millions in direct investments in Milwaukee to support job training and upskilling to meet the need for these historic investments.  \\n...","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Holds Workforce Hub Convening in Milwaukee, Announces Commitments to Expand Pathways into Good-Paying Jobs"},{"text":"I feel about the tornadoes, Im still practicing.

No need to go into all of them. But its repeal is also not a full solution. The problem with having two Senators is that each can vote against one another and negate the voice of their state on any question. A potential solution ought to be to make the Senate a body of delegates of the state more than a body of older, richer members of the House. A possible solution:The Senate of the United States shall be composed of three Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years, with a power reserved to a two-thirds majority of each legislature to recall its Senators, or any of them; and each State shall have one vote except in trials of impeachment when each Senator shall have one vote. They shall be divided equally into three classes, each class composed of one member of each state delegation so that one third may be chosen every second year.But this alone does not prevent the states from rolling over to the central government when the spigot of money is threatened. The state must become independent of the central government in order to allow them to be restored to being a true barrier to unlimited central government. A possible solution:Congress shall have no authority to provide any money to any state or engage with any state to perform any policy, program or other service.It is said the judiciary is one of the structural barriers protecting liberty. But the judiciary can become politicized and faces threats to its independence with court packing schemes.The Senate change recommends above is one means of helping to depoliticize the judiciary. It was only after the 17th Amendment took effect that the confirmation process became a political circus. Mostly for the benefit of the Senators seeking to garner more voters.The threat of court packing also needs to be addressed in order to guarantee the independence of the judiciary. A possible solution:The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court consisting of no more than nine judges and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.And one last matter to consider related to the judiciary is the seemingly politicized administration of justice at the federal level. This will continue no matter who is in office since the U.S. Attorney General (USAG) obtains his/her employment from POTUS and can lose it the same way. Perhaps the means of appointing the USAG should follow a different model than currently exists. A possible solution:The judges of the Supreme Court shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint the officers in charge of executing the administration of justice for the United States. The officers in charge of executing the administration of justice shall hold their offices during one term of ten years.  If needed, the term of office could be altered but the idea is to give the USAG and federal prosecutors independence from politics and guarantee them their position absent impeachable offenses.","title":"Liberty  Democracy"},{"text":"There's no source for OP's claim.","title":"US emergency stockpile of electrical transformers was sent to Ukraine by Biden-Harris admin, leaving Americans devastated by the storms without power and electricity"},{"text":"Hah, \\"Trump's Tempe Tantrum.\\"  Can you imagine how the other side would have reacted had the roles been reversed here?","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Distances Itself From 60 Minutes Edit Controversy: We Do Not Control CBS Production Decisions"},{"text":"....not everything needs to be about the election.

Perhaps more that I am unaware of but I think it comes down to these ideas:1. Anarchism: the abolition of the state. Please do not conflate the word chaos with anarchy. Anarchy is merely a social arrangement in which no entity has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force over a certain geographic area.There is plenty of reading material on anarchism, anarcho-capitalism, anarcho-communism, etc and plenty of debate on whether these work or could work. I am not here to debate the efficacy of the idea, only to present it as an alternative to a democratically elected system of governance within a state.2. Mitigate the worst aspects and effect of democracy by limiting government and placing structural barriers in place to protect individual liberty.I would suggest, this is the more mainstream libertarian viewpoint. Structural barriers to protect liberty would obviously include things like a constitutional bill of rights, an independent judiciary, etc.Limiting the scope of government to a small number of subjects has been the focus of most libertarian writing since the movement came into existence by name. This would include things like ending the war on drugs, as an example, or separating the state not just from religion but also the economy, education, money, etcThe fact that we must continually argue against those who want to expand the state and explain how their actions are a threat to liberty just about wears me down. I become especially frustrated by those who argue that government should not be doing X and Y but then argue it ought to engage in Z, despite all being a form of intervention in matters in which the government has no business acting.Anyone who has dealt with modern day conservatives and liberals and socialists, etc has almost certainly come across these people. They ultimately believe in the necessity for state intervention in those areas they like and oppose it in those they do not like (you get my meaning). \\n \\nIn this sub, I still run across a good number of people who maintain their support for government to intervene in many areas which have nothing to do with its sole function of securing liberties. Tell me how the Depts. of Energy or Education are securing individual liberty. Does my liberty rest on the necessity to fund Big Bird and NPR, to lock away an adult engaging in consensual paid sex with another consenting adult? Just random silly examples, sorry.For all who say and replace it with what, these might be your only options. The toothpaste is out of the tube as far as democracy is concerned. So either research anarchism or start to roll back the state and resurrect the barrier that protect individual liberties because those barriers have been torn down right and left.Examples in the U.S. context: 17th Amendment-this is not a direct attack on liberty. Instead, it is a removal of an obstacle the Founders decided to include to be an impediment to the democratically elected Houses actions that could threaten liberty, and overspending. The U.S. is set up as a federal system not for the purposes some claim about slavery or repression. The idea was to have opposition to the actions of the states against those of the central government, and vice versa.I wish I could find the words to better explain this idea but basically the states and central government often are at odds to protect their purview. That conflict is meant to exist. It is a protection against either taking things too far.But what has occurred is the states lost their voices in the Senate and then became placated by central government money. That dependence forces the states to bend the knee to the central government and there no longer is the adversarial situation whereby each became a check on the other. Now the central government can run roughshod over the states and I would argue, liberty has been the victim, as the central government has become larger and more pervasive.","title":"Liberty  Democracy"},{"text":"Im worried about the gender gap in young voters.

These are (relatively) rare events that cause massive losses. Most insurance is pretty simple to price in principle. You just take the average expected losses and divide that out by all the policyholders plus a little margin for profit. This is broad strokes - of course there are different classes based on underwriting characteristics and whatnot, but you get the point. But how do you price something that costs a shitload of money and only occurs very rarely? The expected value of that loss will be very small. You may need to literally collect premiums for decades before you've actually built up enough of a reserve to adequately cover the loss were it to occur. So do you just charge everyone more than their actuarial expected value so you can cover the loss in a shorter amount of time? Is that fair? What happens when you've built up enough of a reserve to cover one catastrophic loss? Do you charge everyone less? What happens then if a catastrophic event occurs in two years back to back? These are extremely difficult events to adequately insure. You need nationwide exposure so that when a catastrophe occurs, it only impacts a small portion of your policyholders. But the Florida insurance market is suffering - large insurers are leaving and small insurers that operate locally don't have a chance in hell of being able to cover even a single hurricane. In my opinion there isn't an adequate private solution. The state should probably offer \\"hurricane insurance\\" similar to how California has its own earthquake authority. People can choose to buy it or not. It's extremely expensive. Eventually people will have to leave if they can't afford to cover the risk. The only other alternative is to continually subsidize rebuilding in these areas, which is a pretty massive waste of resources and economic potential. Or get Floridians to build traditional Japanese housing that can be torn down and rebuilt quickly.

Trump won by eight four years ago. A positive Montana result for Democrats would have kept that string going, giving them a path to Senate control. They didnt get it. Without Montana, the Democratic path to the Senate would require flipping a red state. The Times/Siena polls suggest it wont be easy. On paper, the two easiest options ought to be Texas and Florida, but the polls find the two Republican incumbents ahead  Ted Cruz by four points in Texas, and Rick Scott by nine in Florida. If these were the final results, it would almost be the end of the line for Democratic Senate hopes. But theres one last race to be considered  in Nebraska, where an independent candidate, Dan Osborn, has been competitive in the early polling against the Republican incumbent, Deb Fischer. Mr. Osborn said he wouldnt caucus with either party if he won, which would leave Senate control uncertain. With Mr. Tester falling behind in Montana, theres a case that Texas might just be the Democrats better  if hardly good  path to holding the Senate. While the idea of a blue Texas might seem unimaginable, its not necessarily that far-fetched anymore. Mr. Cruz won by less than three points in 2018, and Mr. Trump won by less than six in 2020. If it werent for Republican gains among Hispanic voters in recent years, Texas would probably be a tossup in the presidential race this year. And interestingly, Mr. Cruz does fare worse than Mr. Trump among Hispanic voters in the poll. Still, Mr. Cruzs four-point lead over Colin Allred  which is in line with other polling  seems close to robust given that the state will probably vote for Mr. Trump in November. And from a financial standpoint, a serious effort to contest the state would cost Democrats hundreds of millions.","title":"Why Democratic Senate Control Seems to Be Slipping Away"},{"text":"The more she speaks","title":"Dems with data are 'extremely bullish' on Trump winning, Harris may lose six swing states: analyst | Fox News"},{"text":"His next stop will be in Flint Michigan to complain about the taste of Dasani water","title":"Trump in Detroit: \\"The whole country will be like Detroit if Kamala Harris is your president\\""},{"text":"Its squarely focused on her being a step-mother, with the implication that since shes not given birth herself shes not a *real* mother and thus not a *real* woman.

One of the effects of such a CME impact (and the associated geomagnetic storm it creates) is to induce high electrical currents *in the earth itself*, which can impress themselves on the ground return paths for the power grid and cause breaker trips and worse (transformer core saturation and other reactive effects).At the time of this writing, the planetary K-index has exceeded 8, and is now into major storm territory, and the induced voltage in the upper Midwest has reached ~5V/km. The ground currents that were largely responsible for the 1989 Quebec blackout were on the order of 20V/km. So, we aren't quite there- yet.

Our system would never allow people that kind of control. It's funny that people even believe that...No, the election campaign shows wealthy interests which candidate would do the best job of peddling THEIR agenda to the American people.This is why presidential debates are such garbage and nothing real is discussed outside of typical Overton Window controlled viewpoints.Believing in a president is like believing in Santa Claus or Easter Bunny. Except those were real things put on by your parents because they love you...The president is there to lie you into giving up more of your money and freedom, to make the wealth class wealthier at our expense. It's his job to push wars, fake pandemics, economic/trade agendas that make money for corporations at our expense, etc.None of it is for us.And yes, this includes Trump. It includes *all of them.*It's sad more people don't understand this stuff because it's so obvious. But again, they're just grown up versions of kids believing in Santa Claus. Except worse...Your parents gave you gifts. WTF did any of these presidents give us?  Did Trump drain the swamp? No, his cabinet was immediately filled with the swamp because he doesn't even get to pick.What did Trump do besides make the wealth class wealthier and set up the Covid operation? (Yeah, look up Operation Crimson Contagion and Executive Order 13887... sigh.

Both people's can claim reasonably to be indigenous, and it is antisemitic and factually incorrect to ignore the indigenous nature of the Jewish people to Israel.Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and held no power over its people. How could they possibly oppress them? The west bank has its own government, and so it is also not run by Israel.  Also, do you know what an apartheid state means? In Israel, all persons, regardless of religion, race or ethnicity, have equal rights and can vote. Until the most recent election an Arab party has been part of the majority ruling coalition. Palestinians living in the west bank and Gaza are not Israeli citizens and thus have no voting rights there, which is reasonable. Some are subject to Isreali oversight but only under in the west bank based on a treaty their government agreed to.

That being said, I'm not sure that this has much to do with the topic at hand. However, since you reply here seems to be implying that private airlines have some responsibility in filling the aforementioned logistical holes, I'll address the implied concern in an effort to move this conversation along.As I and other people have mentioned, the reason why it isn't a feasible option to use airlines to do last minute evacuations is that doing so opens up points of failure that could lead to the otherwise preventable loss of life. I mentioned some of these points in my last comment here:Also: What if airlines had not raised prices (or even lowered them) and thousands of ticketed passengers showed up at airports only to be put on standby on oversold flights and ended up trapped at an airport when the storm made land fall? And what about people who may have been trapped on an aircraft whose departure was delayed because the logistics of taking care of standby passengers?I addition I disagree with the utilitarian idea that one is obligated to put themselves at risk to help other people (which I believe might be at the heart of of our overall disagreement here).  As such, I don't think it's reasonable to ask either/both land and air based flight crews to operate last minute flights out of the path of the storm at the risk of them not being able to evacuate the area in time themselves.  However, If they want to volunteer to do it, I have no problem with it.","title":"CMV: The drastic increase in airline ticket prices out of Florida is not because of corporate greed"},{"text":"Well, you see, they're not opposed to social programs, they're just opposed to ... other people ... getting them.","title":"'Not a Democrat' poster, big time MAGA, brags about their son receiving significant help from a Medicare program created by Democrats that the GOP wants to cut"},{"text":"I'm continually amazed by how many people vote against their own self interest.

These analyses were done on public speeches by the way, so they arent totally indicative of the persons overall language skills, as presidents have appeal to a broad demographic, so most of them tend to speak more plainly to the public than they normally would in private settings. Also important to know, these figures actually come from separate analyses that were specifically focused on a specific set of language skills, not their overall ability as a whole, and were done by multiple separate groups researching this topic. Trump, on the other hand, was found at to be at a roughly 6th grade level in terms of vocabulary and grammar, and at a fourth grade level in terms of his sentence structures and verbal complexity. He is the lowest in both of those areas of any president in history. The latter score seems to be especially low largely because of his difficulty in speaking without going on long tangents, oftentimes in an unrelated vein to the point he really wants to make.Obama may have spoken more simply when he was president, but people forget he was a successful lawyer before he was a political figure. He certainly can speak at a higher, more refined level, but if he had done so throughout his Presidency, most of the country simply wouldnt even be able to appreciate the difference, or even understand his more complex or nuanced positions because he didnt explain them in simple enough terms. But lets not pretend thats what Trump is doing. Aside from his known poor educational background and the multitude of obvious signs of mental decline, he is one of the worst public speakers I have ever seen. Hes practically illiterate. As far as we can tell, based on the fact we know he wouldnt even read his daily security briefings as president unless his name was mentioned at least once per paragraph, he might as well be. Hes functionally illiterate because he refuses to read anything that isnt about him.","title":"Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes: \\"Americans are Ready to Turn the Page\\""},{"text":"at this point, all minds are made up","title":"Kamala Harris is pushing herself as the change candidate C but its clear shes just Biden 2.0"},{"text":"And yet, the latest NYT poll shows her 5 points behind The Orange One in Florida.

Good change, of course. IMO Obama was talk change, Trump is bad change.Of course, you don't get change if the change candidate loses, which is why good oration helps.Whether or not Obama meant to walk change but was obstructed is disputable but I'm definitely tired of democrats who choose bipartisanship over real change for hypothetical change in the future. Kamala at least seems to understand the republican party will not be her friend or the country's. As dark as it is I prefer keeping it real about what the republican party is. And bizarrely enough she's managed to get support from republicans with this approach, some who see what the republican party has become. I don't trust them further than I can throw them, but it's interesting that serious rhetoric yielded more actual bipartisanship around how fucking stupid and destructive MAGA is than the usual coddling of republicans. Granting MAGA did the heavy lifting as far as creating that opening.With Kamala I still simply don't know whether she'll be walk change but I'll still take her over bad change.","title":"Harris seeks to recapture Obama-era energy as he rallies for her in Pennsylvania"},{"text":"So, a blue state if they're free of 'reds'?","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Distances Itself From 60 Minutes Edit Controversy: We Do Not Control CBS Production Decisions"},{"text":"Harris is going to have a very difficult time winning PA.

It's either what happened or keeping the US in Afghanistan far longer, because the Taliban had already resumed their offensive past the deal's deadline and did not attack US troops for the sole reason that Biden had committed to getting the US out. Meanwhile, Trump, for some reason chose to:- Negotiate a deal with the Taliban without involving the Afghan government.- Somehow agreed to release 5000 Taliban prisoners.- Was president for 11/14 months the deal afforded, and didn't evacuate Americans civilians while only approving 1799 out of 20000 SIVs.- The lack of SIV processing was because Trump's administration broke the system which offers protection to Afghan allies.- And despite having so much more time to come up with an exit plan, he left Biden's administration without one.https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/kamala-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal/index.htmlThis means Biden had far less time to evacuate everyone and come up with an exit plan.

And FRJ darkened the skin of his opponent in ads proving race WAS a factor in the election as much as I wish it wasn't, Baldwin is white, and sides with Republicans on alpt of border and drug issues so that's another small advantage Baldwin has compared to Barnes, and while I agreed with Barnes 100%, the video clips of him saying defend the police sadly didn't work in his favor, there's no such videos of Tammy Baldwin ever saying such a thing. Sadly she's given the police MORE funding and points that put in her ads. I don't agree with all the pandering to the right/center she does, but I do think it gives her a significantly better chance than barnes (FRJs opponent) had. And she has way better ads than he did. \\nDon't get me wrong, I agree most voters in wisconsin are idiots, otherwise we would've never re-elected FRJ, but I think the fact that FRJ won his election is a sign Tammy Baldwin is more likely to win, not less likely. With them both being incumbent white people in this swing state full of racism. And the \\"split ticket\\" voters will go for Baldwin the same way they voted FRJ and Tony Evers on the same ballot. because in their eyes it \\"keeps wisconsin balanced\\" to have a senator from each party (as dumb as that is, trust me plenty of people here want that) plus RvW wasn't overturned yet when FRJ won, democrats have won every statewide election since then by double digits.  I'm terrified about the presidential election, but I legit don't see ANY reality where Tammy Baldwin loses. Like I genuinely don't think that's a possibility no matter how dumb wisconsin voters are. Also if you look at ANY poll except this one it shows Baldwin with a much wider lead, and cook polls are literally known to artificially get closer as the election gets closer to get more clicks, they delcare every election a \\"toss-up\\" by the last month to farm engagement.

The other is a Cuban. Given that the Cuban-American communitys founders were fascists who fled their homes when *their* fascist regime got overthrown, I expect them to lean more fascist here, too.","title":"Kamala Harris holds major lead over Trump among Florida independents: Poll"},{"text":" how is trotting out actors, even old and famous ones, going to help?It helps keep the campaign momentum and increase voter turnout.","title":"Julia Roberts is returning to Georgia to campaign for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Commie leftist invents tornado grenade to destroy free speech and suck patriots guns into the sky -elon","title":"Long time democrat, only recently began experimenting with weather control.

It is in fact an effort to save the Jewish state from extinction within the next generation.Here's the problem: very soon there will be more Muslims than Jews in the areas under Israeli control. Once that happens, any truly democratic state that exists in those areas will elect Muslim PMs 100% of the time.Israel *could* try to disenfranchise it's Palestinian majority through a combination of Jim Crow and apartheid tactics - one could argue they are doing this right now - but it seems unlikely the world will put up with that forever. In particular, Israel is highly dependent on aid from America, and as we saw this spring, younger Americans seem to be much less indulgent with Israel than there parents have been. So it's starting to seem very possible that one day soon an American president will say \\"enough\\", and Israel will simply have no choice but to empower its Muslim majority.We know exactly what this look like, because it happened 34 years ago. In 1988, bowing to a massive international campaign of boycotts and economic pressure, South Africa freed a convicted terrorist named Nelson Mandela from prison. In 1990, he became the first Black President of South Africa. South Africa has had exclusively Black Presidents since.So that's what likely awaits a one-state Israel. It will hold off as long as it can, but eventually it will cave to international pressure, just like South Africa, and after that Israel will become another Muslim majority state in a neighborhood full of them.Finally, let me say that as someone who has been to Israel, and fell in love with it, I really do hope that cooler heads prevail there. Israel is a lovely country, and I would hate to outlive it.TLDR: Either Israel commits *fully* to an actual, no-bullshit 2-state solution, or it becomes a Muslim-dominated state within a generation.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time. Coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country.

Aren't land based transportation methods also capable of evacuating people? Especially with the advance notice these people had on the storm?Im not confident about what the optimal solution is. What I am pretty confident about though, is that there is a better solution out there, whose primary limitation is airlines being unwilling to not make maximal profit. Rerouting flights, reimbursing families that can prove they were flying out of necessity, anything like that.What about encouraging people to not wait to evacuate until catching a fight is one's only option to escape the storm in time? Again why do you believe that catching a last minute flight is the only method of survival here?Unless you think there are literally 0 options available, then the people who are forced to pay exorbitant amounts at risk of death, and the people that will just die because they cant afford a plane ticket are at least to some extent in their situation because of the greed of the airlines.Again: Why are you assuming that the only two options here are catch a flight or die?Why is evacuating by car well in advance of the storm not an option here? Employment concerns? What is easier replace one's job or one's life? Personally, I never put my employment over my own personal safety. If an employer can't respect that, that's not someone I want to work for. Also: What if airlines had not raised prices (or even lowered them) and thousands of ticketed passengers showed up at airports only to be put on standby on oversold flights and ended up trapped at an airport when the storm made land fall?  And what about people who may have been trapped on an aircraft whose departure was delayed because the logistics of taking care of standby passengers? Is there only one way to mitigate the risk of death in these types of circumstances?Have you considered that jacking up prices might have saved lives by discouraging people from congregating at airports and by helping fights depart more quickly and efficiently by not having to take care of standby passengers?","title":"CMV: The drastic increase in airline ticket prices out of Florida is not because of corporate greed"},{"text":"Trump hasn't either.","title":"'Scared' Donald Trump is 'hiding' from journalists: ex-Obama adviser"},{"text":"I'm not so sure I know anyone who's even been asked...","title":"Kamala Harris holds major lead over Trump among Florida independents: Poll"},{"text":"[https://x.com/mazemoore/status/1843664856446316758](https://x.com/mazemoore/status/1843664856446316758)","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Distances Itself From 60 Minutes Edit Controversy: We Do Not Control CBS Production Decisions"},{"text":"Thank You!

The lowest level would still be subject to the current rate-increase caps, the second tier would have increased caps, and the third tier would have no rate-increase caps at all. Set X and Y arbitrarily high so at first only the most expensive homes are above Y and only wealthy people own homes above X. Then, every year, reduce the X and Y thresholds so that 2-3% more homes will fall into them every year. Eventually, the political cost of increasing premiums on the poorest people may get too high, so then you stop adjusting the thresholds. But at that point you've already ensured that the most expensive individual claims are being paid by products with much higher premiums than today.","title":"Milton threatens to trigger flood insurance reckoning for Congress"},{"text":"Well, we won't actually know that until the election itself.

At a time where a large chunk of the population is too cognitively impaired by garbage media diets.   Having to vote on whos less corrupt and having to pick a side of which group of billionaires are nicer for our society.  When the answer is neither group is, and our best option is the one that isnt trying to steal all the power for themselvesWhat is the solution even.  The only practical option is to play within the system that exists for the change you want.  But that system is designed to change anyone who plays it instead of the other way around.  The ultra wealthy are ultra wealthy because they are mastermind manipulators, and they have a very vivid view of how the world is connected that most of us dont have,  we dont even see 90% of the influence they exert on us through every facet of our lives.  They are predators, and the violent greed is hidden behind invisible schemes and smiling faces.  Just the path to finding knowledge of how the world works is painful enough for anyone with a sense of morality.  And thats enough to distort you into an emotional state thats ineffective at objectively solving problems.  Leaving you stuck with knowledge but no realistic path to acting on it beside mindless revolution that causes more harm and puts people against you who want the train to keep pushing.Then your question becomes do you fight it and suffer in the process.  Or do you dance with the devil and join into the structure of exploitation to have your own slice of stability/comfort?Most people choose the latter when push comes to shove.  Either giving to their own dark impulses/instincts or rationalizing it by their need to support their loved ones.  In the end the corruption leaves its mark, and for some that dance with the devil turns them into demons little by little.

As an independent, political moderate I did not vote for Hillary or Trump in 2016, so chose to vote 3rd party as NY would go Dem anyway. I voted for Biden in the false belief in him presenting himself as a moderate. But I will not vote 3rd party this time, even though I don't like some of Harris' more \\"progressive\\" stances, and even though NY will again go Dem. The first reason is that I believe there is more sentiment toward compromise than in the past, and that there could be an increase if Trump/MAGA can be defeated and therefore crippled in their influence. The border bill is one indication of that possibility. Also some of the more leftist candidates have been defeated or challenged more than in the past. The fact that Harris proposes certain things does not mean they will be implemented as is, as she will primarily allow the system to work through Congress. Trump will find whatever way he can to make things happen and to coalesce his power to subvert the will of the majority. He will only appoint people who will bow to his wishes, will eviscerate the civil service ranks and replace them with Trump/MAGA acolytes, and will wield the power of the Presidency as has never been done before.Secondly, though I dearly hope Harris will win, even if she does not win we need as many votes as possible against Trump to make it clear how much opposition there is to him. I am still hopeful that she will pull it off, as I don't want to see the proof that Trump will be a disaster for our nation.","title":"The Case for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Well first off, how democratic is democratic enough to warrent no protesting?Russia has elections are protests there wrong?The US calls itself a democracy but it has a lot of undemocratic elements.

This practice isn't greedy.\\n(2) is just not correct. The total number of voluntary denied boardings yearly, across airlines, is ~100k. The number of involuntary denied boardings is ~10k. The total number of boardings is ~155 million. Voluntary denied boardings are usually compensated with a free flight, or some fixed cost upgrade, in the hundreds of dollars (and costs even less to the provider). It's also difficult to overbook poorly - because any ticket that comes with seat selection (the more expensive ones) can't overbook unless intentional.\\nDynamic pricing exists precisely why you might think it does - to maximize profit. The reason early morning flights are cheaper aren't *just* because people might miss them - but because people in general want to travel at more convenient times, and dates, for them. That's why Tuesday flights are cheaper than Monday flights - the former is usually more useful to business people or vacationers. Early booked flights are cheaper - because if you could buy later at the same price, why lock your non-refundable ticket in now?\\nDynamic pricing, alongside different tier tickets, mean that the airline can sell a ticket for close to the maximum value you'd be willing to buy a ticket at. High price tickets can be sold to the small fraction of demand, and lower price ones to the bigger part of demand. This maximizes producer surplus, and minimizes consumer surplus. The dynamic pricing algorithm is intended to price tickets so that the plane is exactly at capacity, and every passenger paid the maximum they were willing to pay.\\nSome would argue the above is \\"corporate greed\\". Despite not changing the service, at all, ticket prices go up to match demand. In fact, the quality of the service goes *down* because it makes browsing airfare so much harder.\\nThis holds true for Amtrak, too, which has adopted the same policy of dynamic pricing. The service does not change, but the closer and more convenient times that you book, the price goes up.\\nDo I think they're intentionally messing with the algorithm for a hurricane? No. I think it's just dynamic pricing doing its thing. Extremely high demand means that you can sell at $8000 per ticket, and still see sales. But if the algorithm itself is corporate greed, then this particular application of it is as well. People are just more okay with profit maximization when it's occuring outside of natural disasters","title":"CMV: The drastic increase in airline ticket prices out of Florida is not because of corporate greed"},{"text":"It's more about who's life has more value with them.

Meanwhile, Trump's own inner circle has repeatedly questioned his fitness for office, calling him unfit and lacking intellect, a reality that's hard to ignore when watching him speak at a rally or being laughed at in interviews. His vision of making America great seems to pave the way for chaos, as it did during his presidency. How can anyone of sound judgment support a 78-year-old man who glorifies dictators, champions white supremacy, and suggests dismantling the Constitution? Its beyond me.

The nation as a whole is shifting dynamically to the left. It has been for decades. The only reason the GOP have held as tight a control as they have this far is due to three reasons: the Senate granting the rural states more sway, the House being capped at the total number of representatives so it disproportionately helps the rural areas, and finally gerrymandering (though to be fair the last two are interconnected).As the population has gradually shifted left, we've seen how hard the red states work to gerrymander the districts to maintain control. Look at Mississippi. Look at Tennessee. Hell, look at Texas! The districts in those states look like a jigsaw puzzle from hell. All of it is designed specifically to help them maintain control and they know it. In another 20-30 years, even the 'red' states will begin to shift towards purple and those already on the line will be dominated by blue leaning voters. So what can they do to maintain power indefinitely?Voting won't work. Even electing Trump and pushing Project 2025 will result in the masses throwing them out come 2028 (or violently rising against them if they try to stop elections). If they go that route, then THEY will be the ones on the front lines and in the hot seat. They don't want that! So the way forward is for them to stir up the masses ala Jan 6th. Push the polls of Trump/Republicans being ahead. Then if (when) they lose, call for the morons who have swallowed their bullshit to revolt. Let them sacrifice themselves to overthrow the government and then (if they win), the GOP can step in to rule. They can toss the Constitution and make a new one in their own image at that point (its what the people wanted, right?!) and redesign things so they'll never lose again. And if the civil war goes badly, well... \\"It was ANTIFA that did it! It was a civil protest. Nothing to see here! We had nothing to do with it!\\" - against, just like Jan 6. I honestly fear that's their game plan right now. Not to push to win - but push to set up a violent conflict for WHEN they lose.

The waiver is still under consideration. Last year, the EPA granted California a waiver to begin phasing out diesel-powered trucks in favor of electric alternatives.    $24 billion from 2027-2055 for roughly 25% of semi-trucks and other heavy-duty diesel vehicles to be electric by 2032.    $14 billion from 2024-2042 to slash nearly all emissions from fossil fuel power plants to achieve a zero-emission electrical grid by 2035. Plants, primarily coal and natural gas-fired, must implement costly carbon capture technology, switch to renewables, or shut down. The rule has not been finalized.    $7 billion from 2032-2051 to limit soot pollution levels, which critics say jeopardizes domestic energy and manufacturing.    $390 million from 2024-2035 for a proposed emissions rule that fines oil and natural gas companies for leaked methane. Critics say it will raise consumers energy costs and divert money from clean energy.\\n\\"The Biden administrations unbridling spending and reckless policies will disproportionately force hard-working Americans to foot the bill for these costs.The House Budget Committee has been sounding the alarm on President Bidens myriad of harmful policies.

Unless the President realizes the chasm between his dreams and our fiscal reality, we risk falling further into a debt crisis that will not be easy to recover from.

Its our fucking neighbor and its maddening that nobody seems to pay attention to whats going on there or how many Canadian white-collar workers put their optimism (and investments) in our economy because they are so pessimistic about their own nations future. Thats not American exceptionalism, we should be concerned (or at least aware ffs) when our liberal allies are that vulnerable. \\n  \\nSame thing in Europe, my left-leaning friends have no idea that young urban citizens cant afford to buy a home like their parents could, the anxiety around inflation, the rise of right-wing/anti-immigrant rhetoric in response, etc. They just assume these issues only exist in America and that people in Europe are happy. \\n  \\nI was listening to ?Le Dbat? on France 24 yesterday and it was all about the revelations in Woodwards book about Trump and Putin. I get why Putin is relevant to French listeners and we are their ally nation and all, but it was painfully obvious to me that in our media, the information does not flow the other direction at all. \\n  \\nWhat foreign politicians are doing and the resulting public opinion is very rarely covered by our media and never in such detail. Whereas ?Le Dbat? has recently been all about the American election and the Israel-Hezbollah conflict (which inevitably then circles around to discussing Bidens leadership). \\n  \\nAmericans on both sides have no idea that our domestic topics of discussion are closely watched and covered front page news in other countries, and yet we are the only voters who are empowered to influence that leadership  French voters have no control over which American will be leading talks in the Middle East, or whether our Congress unlocks funds to help Ukraine, but they are deeply interested in those outcomes. \\n  \\nI really wish that more American liberals followed news in other countries for a healthy dose of reality and perspective.

Obviously the BBC and Globe and Mail publish in English. Theres no reason to be ignorant about the issues in other liberal countries even if our media doesnt care to cover European politics or issues. Its in our interest to know whats going on! I would also argue that its also important to know whats going on in Africa and Asia too, but lets at least start with our closest international allies ffs. \\n  \\nSorry for the long comment, you just unlocked a rant that I have about American liberals. On some level I expect the right wing to be willfully ignorant, but Ive been disappointed by left wing ignorance too. \\n  \\nObjectively speaking the US economy has had a much healthier recovery from the pandemic and our inflation was spread out throughout our large economy and has clearly leveled off.

Wesley Swearingen, an FBI agent from 1951 to 1977, writes in his memoir FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose about the long-standing rumors within the Bureau concerning the relationship between FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Associate Director Clyde Tolson which include allegations that Hoover ignored the Mafia for decades because the wise guys had incriminating goods on the supposed lovers:One year after arriving in Memphis, Hoover transferred me to Chicago, Illinois. I was thrilled  my mind was full of gangsters, Tommy guns, and the FBIs famous machine gun battles of the 1930s. It was clear to me from Chicagos newspaper headlines that gansters ruled a Chicago underworld element in the 1950s because gangland style murders averaged close to 100 a year in the Chicago area. * * * But when I told my colleague and veteran agent Vince Coll of my big plans for Chicago, he said that Hoover did not recognize the existence of a mob in Chicago. According to Coll, Mafia leader Meyer Lanskys organization had enough on Hoover and Tolson, as closet homosexuals, that Hoover would never investigate the mob.The allegations were fleshed out in Official and Confidential: the Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover by Anthony Summer. A review of the book (Partners For Life) by Sidney Urquhart for Time magazine summarizes one alleged incident as follows:Perhaps Summers most bizarre revelation is an account provided by Susan Rosenstiel, the wife of a liquor distiller and gambling crony. Rosenstiel recalls attending what she thought would be an elegant private party at New York Citys Plaza Hotel in the company of lawyer Roy Cohn, Hoover and others. Instead, Cohn introduced Rosenstiel to a woman named Mary, dressed in a fluffy black dress, lace stockings and high heels. It was obvious Mary was no woman. You could see where he shaved. It was Hoover, said Rosenstiel. Joined by Cohn, Hoover stripped down to a tiny garter belt and proceeded to have sex with two young boys. Cohn later joked about the evening. That was really something, wasnt it, with Mary Hoover?The two young boys with whom Hoover allegedly had sex perhaps were provided by Ed the Skull Murphy who was a long-time Genovese associate involved in the crime familys gay bar and boy prostitution rackets in New York City.  Curiously, Murphy also was a long-standing FBI informant according to a May 8, 1978 article (Skull Murphy: The Gay Double Agent) by Arthur Bell for The Village Voice. Indeed, this article contained the interview in which Murphy expressly speaks of J. Edgar Hoover as one of his sisters: He was the biggest fuckin extortionist in this country. He had presidents by the balls. He had a record on everybody and his brother.The allegations that Meyer Lansky had incriminating evidence against the FBI Director are particularly credible in light of the relationships among all the parties with political fixer Roy Cohn  a fellow closet case who died of AIDS in 1986  at the center of it all.\\"","title":"TIL Nixon resigned for spying on Democrats but in 1964 the FBl spied on Republicans for Lyndon Johnson."},{"text":"They make plenty of sense, they just dont make sense for the majority of Americans.","title":"No, the government is not controlling the weather. \\"It's so stupid, it's got to stop,\\" Biden says"},{"text":"I feel like hyena is a euphemism here.

Governor (also elected statewide and more likely to be GOP), giving more power to the Senate Majority Leader (which means Phil Berger now has the power he needs to build his own machine, complete with his son on the State Supreme Court ruling on his dads laws and another son running his home county), and, yes, gerrymandering.

In the hierarchy of needs, tending the environment is a luxury because it doesn't directly benefit the ones tending the environment. It benefits their descendents. We aren't facing apocalyptic climate conditions right now, all the climate worries are about future issues where the world will radically change. The fact we care about the world 100 years from now, instead of scrapping for survival today, is an argument for western society. It means we've reached a point where base survival and prosperity is no longer a concern.Take India and China for an opposite example. Both nations are trying to modernize and uplift hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty, and with India, that number is more like a billion people. They don't have the leeway to care about clean energy, because they need to care about mass poverty and development first.So they burn coal and throw plastic in the rivers, and don't give a fuck about the climate.Meanwhile, we have the leeway because our nations are already developed and much more prosperous. The people with the resources are the ones who care about the environment, not Indian subsistence farmers burning brown coal and manure for warmth in the winter, not Congolese factory owners burning coal because it's cheap and they need power. It's the people with plenty who can care about tertiary  as in not immediately pressing and not immediately effecting them  issues around the world.It seems like you took offense to something and rolled into this huge rant about how privileged I am, but only privileged people can care about future problems.

Our US farmers no longer had a market for their soybeans and to avoid catastrophe across the Midwest the US had to provide economic assistance to our farmers.  Basically, Trump used tariffs as a weapon against another country and it backfired and caused economic problems in the US and increased our costs.  Trumps economic plans will not work.

When this happens, the Palestinians are supposed to understand that they have no chance to get a state of their own, and they would have to choose between one of the three options C a life of subjugation under Israeli rule, emigration, or a shahid \\\\[martyr\\\\] death.Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel\\\\_Smotrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich)So yes, I believe a lot of parties inside Israel are working actively to undermine the two-state solution.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

That life evolve to thrive in those climates over millions of years. In all of those cases, mass extinction followed the rapid climatic changes. Why? Life cannot evolve in mere centuries.You seem to ignore the fact that we are in the middle of the 6th mass extinction. Do you know why the Holocene extinction is occurring? I don't think so. If you did, you'd realize how laughably meritless your argument is.Warmer climates have actually bred the greatest biodiversity and the largest animals on average. Over millions of years.And also, Coral reefs are not the bedrock of sea life. That would be Plankton that actually thrive in carbon rich environments. Pick up a book.It's not the carbon that is the problem for phytoplankton, but the temperature. Pick up a book.","title":"CMV: Society does not need radical change"},{"text":"She's not Trump is good enough for me.

The west bank has problems, yes, but Palestinians are not being killed there, outside of the occasional criminal issues. The government has diplomatic channels to Israel, and there is the potential for peace. Settlements are a domestic issue, and frankly are generally on unoccupied land.The government of Gaza is Hamas, whose goal is genocide and routinely makes, what should be protected infrastructure (like hospitals) legitimate military targets via their illegal use. They have also infiltrated and control most aide organizations operating in the area, including an arm of the UN, making information difficult to verify. They routinely hoard and redirect aide shipments to their own people making helping civilians difficult. This is not just routine corruption, it's a calculated effort to use the suffering of their own people as a weapon against Jews and Israel.Almost every attack from Hamas violates international law by targeting civilians, their stated goal again is to kill all Jews in Israel. When Israel strikes against Hamas and kills civilians it is not aiming at civilians, it is not a war crime to kill some civilians by accident in the pursuit of military targets. Because Hamas often sets up civilian infrastructure,  usually off limits, as legitimate military targets this makes unintentional civilians casualties impossible to avoid but it is noticeable that Israel compromises their operations routinely to warn civilians via texts, phone calls and other systems.But the most important difference is if tomorrow Hamas said \\"actually here are your hostages, we don't want to kill you anymore\\" and started to establish diplomatic ties (as Jordan, Egypt and many others have done) the war would be over. Israel would do what it has shown itself willing to do (see Egypt etc.) and peace would be possible.If Israel pulled out of Gaza, as it did before in 2005, and said, \\"we aren't going to fight you anymore,\\" the war would not be over, but Hamas would get the chance to do what they say they want, ie. To kill all the Jews (and likely other religious minorities like the Druze) in Israel.","title":"New polls shows 72% of Jewish voters across seven swing states favor Kamala Harris over trump"},{"text":"After visiting the heart of Mexico last year, you realize that the Mexicans in Mexico and Mexican-Americans here in the states are different in thoughts and ideas.

Hazard pay or not - flying during a hurricane risk is likely more expensive to an airline. I am obviously not an airline pilot, or involved in the airline industry so I gave an hypothetical example to convey that idea. The exact details of why it might cost more are irrelevant to the point I am making. Heck, even if we find out that it doesn't cost more for air lines at all (which I find unlikely) this doesn't change my point. I will give you another, more realistic example of why it costs more for an airline - canceling a flight last minute is a risk they would be taking if they try to fly from an area of a crisis, canceling a flight is pricey for an airline. Why would they risk canceling a flight if the reward isn't high enough. why good economics and blatant exploitation are often the same thing.You do realize that's by design right? You want people to  do what's good for the economy - in this case making flights more accessible to more people (because they would increase the amount of flights that they send out from a region, that way they are carrying more people). You don't care if they do it from the goodness of their heart as long as it's done. The truth is, most people wont risk their lives or livelihood to help other people - I am not sure why you expect airlines and companies to do so. And if you rely on companies doing things for the goodness of their heart you are in for a bad time.For example, in their Articles of Secession, the slaver states were bang on the money when describing how their current economic prosperity was only made possible through the African slavery.I think that you misunderstand what economics is. Economy =/= economics. The fact that the southern states created an economy that's dependent on slaves has nothing to do with how the laws of supply and demand works.Really, when you have something that you think is economically unfair - ask yourself, and I mean really ask yourself - how do I imagine the world working differently? Forget prices, imagine they don't exist for a second.There's a limited amount of plane seats, how do you make them more accessible to more people?Either you increase the number of plane seats, or find out who are the people that wants them most.Now describe your system and how it reaches a better outcome than basic market economy? I am sure you will get a noble price in economics if you find such a system.","title":"CMV: The drastic increase in airline ticket prices out of Florida is not because of corporate greed"},{"text":"And somehow the race is still leaning to trump, according to various reputable swing states latest polls.

Chappell Roan is doing something else, by not taking a side, but really taking a side privately, shes saying neither candidate shares her exact views. Shes outspokenly in favor of LGBTQ rights and pro-Palestine, and while Harris supports the former she cannot politically support the latter. I think Roan is supportive of a ranked choice ballot with multiple third, fourth, fifth party candidates and since Harris represents this older binary system, she wont publicly stand with either candidate. Like I said I think its more harmful for her not to choose in THIS particular election, but until the US adopts ranked ballots and encourages more than two parties to run, we need to stand with the only sane choice.","title":"Opinion: I'm an Arab American activist.

Thats awesome! As for your questions, those here smarter than me can add on but Id say take anything said on the internet with a massive grain of salt. Is it more likely that Trump is secretly assured of victory or that he demands attention and ignores any bad news because his ego cant take it? Also, polling is an inexact science at the best of times and with clear biases in play we are not in the best of times. The only poll that matters is the election itself.As for Washington states primary, I wont assume anything so a primary is the election held to determine which Republican and Democrat (usually) will run in the general election. WA is largely unique in that this is not divided by party, so in theory two republicans could advance as almost happened in the land commissioner race this year. That combined with WA mailing every voter a ballot makes it a pretty unique scenario. It has proved in the past to be more predictive of the actual national environment than polling. That said, there are no actual crystal balls, things like this are predictive until they suddenly arent. BUT it is a great sign and one with infinitely more weight than randos on Reddit with no more information than the rest of us.To your last question, I consider myself a realist and very pragmatic. I was admittedly shocked at the 2016 results because I just could not imagine that many fellow Americans  supporting Trump. That said, I am extremely confident in a Harris win, far more so than I felt in 2020. There are lots of good indicators; high quality polls, fundraising, enthusiasm, special election results, midterms results and WA primary. That said what it really comes down to for me is this. He lost as the incumbent (advantage) in 2020 against arguably a weaker opponent. To win in 2024 he has to do better, what has changed and what has he done to make that realistic? I see the exact opposite and will be very surprised if Harris doesnt outperform Biden. This time is filled with uncertainty and worry because we care about the future. For now the best thing you can do is be sure to vote and then get everyone you can to do the same.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 10, 2024 - 26 days until election day!"},{"text":"I'm in ft Lauderdale.

They control 25 and 11 percent of cloud market respectively, bring the theoretical number up to close to 70%. The closest \\"alternatives\\" likely don't have the same degree of infrastructure, resiliency, or support. Salesforce cloud, for example, pales in comparison. It's weird that you argue further down that these smaller companies would simply fill the void left by these without understanding that to serve the applications needed they'd have to become as large as the companies in question. It's not a good argument. Small companies often build their market share in spite of, not due to the lack of, bigger players in the industry. When they build their market share by necessity they have to grow. If you expect IBM cloud to stay lean while they take on even a significantly smaller portion of the hosting that any of the three large companies  have that feels like a pipe dream.And while I agree we have a consolidation problem in tech, that is a different issue than the idea that they aren't currently necessary and wouldn't cause significant turbulence by simply not existing one day. That they sell nothing people need, especially as an increasing number of apps, electronic services, etc. come to depend on their hosting is a spurious claim if not outright wrong. That things used to operate before this with some degree of functionality and that things would be fine without them is like trying to put the genie back in the tech bottle.The idea that the internet itself would be down is a little bit of a reach but if you don't think cloud providers with the market share of the companies you list being gone or down wouldn't have a cascading effect on services you currently take for granted and maybe even need, I have lots of bridges to sell you.","title":"Brazil lifts ban on X after Elon Musk complies with court demands"},{"text":"Speaking of parties, sometimes when I ask my dog if she needs to go potty, I pretend we are going to party in a Boston accent","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Wow.
