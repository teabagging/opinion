The paper denied it's editors the chance to blankly endorse Harris based on incendiary framing. That makes sense especially given the assassination attempts. The actual motivation of the owner was he wanted the magazine to give a \\"moderated\\" endorsement, one which included a list of pros and cons for each candidate, clarifying their values at LA Times, and endorsed after an explanation. The LA times journalists were the ones who wanted to write a one sided, dehumanizing, violence-inciting piece implying no [reasonable, moral person could vote for Trump](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/meltdown-at-the-la-times-billionaire-owner-denies-vetoing-presidential-endorsement-top-editor-resigns/ar-AA1sO9Ts) \\"The Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years,\\" Soon-Shiong wrote on X. \\"With this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being president for the next four years...  Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision.\\"It is also worth adding that the LA Times owner's daughter is a progressive activist, one who influences the leadership, and is one of the few progressives that is actually upset over Palestinians being killed more than free lunches, abortion or migration, and probably hates the neoliberal journalist's moral hypocrisy. So there was probably also some \\"I'm speaking\\" type backlash behind the scenes that motivated her to take a stand. Additionally, Soon-Shiong's daughter Nika, a progressive political activist focused on the Palestinian cause, has reposted tweets critical of Harris's support for Israel. She is also involved in the leadership of the paper. If the editor wasn't such an idiot, she could have just done that lip service, but she didn't want to \\"normalize\\" Trump. Now where this gets particularly funny is Trump used the non-endorsement as a hit on Harris. It's an attack that nobody would give a shit about, EXCEPT the staffers at that company. That was what the editor herself cited as the tipping point, when Trump himself used this \\"non-endorsement\\" as an attack on Harris. In her emotional resignation letter to Executive Editor Terry Tang, Garza said she grappled with whether the decision to endorse no candidate really mattered. But after the news broke, she changed her mind.\\"**The reality hit me like cold water Tuesday when the news rippled out about the decision not to endorse without so much as a comment from the LAT management, and Donald Trump turned it into an anti-Harris rip,\\"** she wrote. \\"Of course it matters that the largest newspaper in the state -- and one of the largest in the nation still -- declined to endorse in a race this important.

Romney tried to nudge the party away from it, but he's practically been run out of the party at this point. MAGA is really nothing more than a nationalist rebranding of the Southern Strategy.In short, the lunatics were taking over the asylum even before MAGA came on the scene.

I think about this often actually, its all suspicious Before all of this the vape industry (tobacco and cannabis) was profiting more than the tobacco industry. Customers would go out to the reservation to avoid taxes. Which the tobacco industry and the government didnt like. They tried to lobby the government to ban flavours (which they lost). So the tobacco company created the JUUL (owned by Imperial Tobacco) \\nThey found marketing loopholes and celebrities to endorse them and it blew up. Before the JUUL vape juice (liquid) had relatively low concentrations of nicotine. It was easier for people to eventually quit their addiction. Sadly, JUUL came out with a sleek design and 60mg which they sneakily advertised at 6% (to make it sound low) and everyone got hooked on them. People were getting nicotine sickness and teens wanted to chase the head rush. Due to the mess the JUUL industry cause in Canada, the government decided to put heavy regulations. My province banned nicotine free products first (which I didnt understand cause youth want high levels) and then 5 months later banned anything above 20mg. JUUL ended up pulling out of Canada after screwing up the market here. Then all of a sudden the news of vapes hospitalizing people came out. The headlines didnt specify anything, and news outlets knew people wouldnt even make it to reading the bottom of articles. Which at the very bottom stated it was black market THC cartridges and not anything to do with nicotine vapes. I did my best to show my customers the truth. They ended up catching the suspects which I believe were a group of 4 people on the east coast of the US. Canada has strict importation laws for cannabis and nicotine products. For people to come down with the sickness in my country was incredibly suspicious. BC is a big producer of cannabis, so why would some shops buy from some small business in the east of the US. Then covid happened. I believe 100% that the government knew it was the early stages of covid or knew there was some viral lung infection going around. They saw the opportunity to heavily tax an industry that was mainly mom and pop business and took that opportunity. Now Canadian companies and American companies cant compete against disposables. I want to say roughly 95% or more of the disposables in the US and Canada are filled with Chinese liquid. Liquid that by-passes US regulations on ingredients. My friend whos manufactured eliquid for years, told me the Chinese nicotine made him sick and ate away at the metal on his vape. So Im waiting for the media to cause a frenzy again. The government got two birds stoned at once.","title":"Does anyone remember right before COVID? There was the vaping pandemic?

This investment comes as part of the Presidents overarching Investing in America agenda, which is increasing American competitiveness and boosting manufacturing in industries of the future.Semiconductor packaging allows multiple components to be brought together as a single electronic device. Advanced packaging brings those components together in novel ways that improves performance of chips while reducing cost and power consumption. CHIPS for America anticipates making available up to approximately $1.6 billion for funding multiple awards across five research and development (R&amp;D) areas, with the potential for follow-on funding for prototyping activities. This funding opportunity furthers the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Programs (NAPMP) mission to establish a vibrant, self-sustaining, and profitable, domestic advanced packaging industry in the United States.  \\n...  \\nInvesting in R&amp;D has never been more important to drive advances in semiconductor technology and establish leading-edge domestic capacity for semiconductor advanced packaging. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications are pushing the boundaries of current technologies like high performance computing and low power electronics, requiring leap-ahead advances in microelectronics capabilities, especially advanced packaging. Solving technical challenges in advanced packaging will help U.S. manufacturers compete globally.  \\n...  \\nThis funding opportunity spans five R&amp;D areas to address key challenges and technology gaps in advanced packaging detailed in the NAPMP Vision Paper:* Equipment, Tools, Processes, and Process Integration\\n* Power Delivery and Thermal Management\\n* Connector Technology, Including Photonics and Radio Frequency (RF)\\n* Chiplets Ecosystem\\n* Co-design/Electronic Design Automation (EDA)This multilayered approach targets R&amp;D efforts that are complementary to one another, and will ultimately translate into results that can be integrated collectively and seamlessly into existing advanced packaging manufacturing processes for semiconductors. Expected outcomes from R&amp;D efforts include new prototypes and innovative advanced packaging flows suitable for adoption by the U.S. semiconductor industry. CHIPS for America anticipates making available up to approximately $1.6 billion in funding across multiple awards of varying size and scope. Anticipated amounts will vary by R&amp;D area and range from approximately $10 million to approximately $150 million in Federal funds per award, with awards being made over a five-year period of performance. Additionally, CHIPS for America anticipates reserving up to $50 million to support awardees future prototyping activities, to be conducted at the anticipated National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) Prototyping and NAPMP Advanced Packaging Piloting Facility.  \\n...  Statement from Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo: Securing domestic packaging capabilities is a key part of our mission to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

By hey, dems where supporting the Republican created bill.","title":"What the hell is going on!"},{"text":"Newsstream link: [https://www.proquest.com/canadiannews/docview/3120105564/EED5A4D55930455APQ/](https://www.proquest.com/canadiannews/docview/3120105564/EED5A4D55930455APQ/).Summary: Mostly what the whole affair reveals, as if there were any doubt, is how utterly supine Liberal MPs have become C how fearful, how craven C before the power of the Party Leader. The days before the meeting had been filled with accounts of small groups of MPs meeting in secret; of a letter being circulated, on paper, with no copies permitted; of MPs making each other swear not to wilt in the face of the inevitable counterattack from the Leaders office, all relayed in whispered off-the-record briefings to reporters, no doubt with the aid of false wigs and burner phones. Is this any way for the elected representatives of a G7 democracy to carry on? These are not below-stairs servants in the mansion of some Transylvanian count. These are members of the Parliament of Canada, once considered a position of some repute. Each one of these frightened shadows was elected by the votes of tens of thousands of their fellow citizens to represent them in the House of Commons, to shape the laws that govern us, to stand up, to speak out. Yet here they are, too terrified, even in their desperation to rid themselves of a Leader who has taken the party to the brink of annihilation, to so much as say their own names, lest the wrath of His Awful Majesty or His More Awful Chief of Staff come down upon them. But of course they are. It isnt just that every moment of an MPs political life, from the day they seek the nomination to the day they leave, is controlled by the Leaders office C their fates determined, their votes decided, their every utterance dictated C in a way that would crush the most independent spirit. Its that these are the people who volunteered for this, who willingly signed up for this humiliation. That a small minority have belatedly summoned the nerve to challenge the Leader C only, leave my name out of it, wont you C is not out of any newfound desire for liberty or self-respect, but only in search of a more electable slavelord. Things are a little different in the Conservative camp, since the caucus, alone among the parties, voted to adopt each of the powers available to it under the 2015 Reform Act: not only the power to elect their own caucus chair, or to expel or readmit a member, but also, crucially, the power to fire the leader, with rules for how it could be done. Still, the leader retains enormous power over individual members, not least since, like every party leader, their signature is required on their nomination papers. A majority of the Conservative caucus now has the means to toss its leader, but woe betide the Conservative MP who steps out of line. But even by the standards of the other parties, the Liberal caucus has proved notably servile. They are desperate to rid themselves of Mr. Trudeau now, but they were no less desperate to surrender themselves to him a decade ago. And now they are stuck with him. They can make his life miserable if he stays, but they cannot make him go.Further readings:[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/justin-trudeau-election-liberal-party](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/justin-trudeau-election-liberal-party) Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said pressure was building on Trudeau but that his unhappy lawmakers do not have much power to force him out. Trudeau holds all the cards. It is up to him if he wants to stay. The Liberal party revised its rules in 2016 so that the party leader is immune to any challenge to his leadership so long as he is prime minister, said Wiseman.[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-leadership-review-formal-mechanism-1.7096351](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-leadership-review-formal-mechanism-1.7096351)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-parliaments-problem-isnt-a-lack-of-decorum-its-the-houses-lack-of/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-parliaments-problem-isnt-a-lack-of-decorum-its-the-houses-lack-of/)!ping Can","title":"Opinion: Liberal MPs lack the means C but mostly the courage C to take down their Leader"},{"text":"I still dont understand why Trump doesnt sue for defamation","title":"Checkmate, Democrats."},{"text":"They exert control over anyone with any sense of shame for their behavior... something they don't have to bother with, but you do.

I would argue it's not a threat they are even capable of pulling off if they wanted to (and they do). If Trump and the GOP make a sweep of the government, which they seem poised to, they are going to be able to do far more than Trump could have in 2017 when he had to deal with intra-GOP infighting, and Democratic leadership is going to be decapitated for about two years. Vox and other Dems have this delusion that the DNC will be capable of a \\"Tea party\\" like, libertarian/neocon-alliance fueled resurgence. Dems hint at this as Tim Walz talks about Liz/Dick Cheney giving \\"libertarians\\" permission to vote for a Dem, as if that means anything. https://www.yahoo.com/news/tim-walz-doesnt-libertarians-opinion-175045799.htmlDoes Tim Walz know what a libertarian is? The Minnesota governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate referenced the libertarian philosophy during a recent appearance on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show. For some reason, Walz is possessed of the notion that former Rep. Liz Cheney (RCWyo.)of all peopleis going to sell libertarians on voting for Vice President Kamala Harris.Their understanding is not merely wrong, but it's laughably detached based on a very shallow surface level understanding of American political groups that I'd like to elaborate on. The Tea party folks may have been a bit co opted by corporate interests but there was a big grassroots surge with some genuine motivation, they had a pre-existing ideological faction that was receptive to the ideas of smaller government, combined with resentment at Obamas over-reach like \\"too big to fail\\" bailouts and such. This wasn't a case where a simple demographic (educated white voters) being greedy and was blindly pushing for libertarian economics out of class warfare + disdain for everyone else. The handful of \\"libertarians\\" and such folks who moved from the GOP to Dems have no coherent ideology beyond anti-Trumpness, and molding the party to please them would provoke more of a backlash, more than whatever they'd gain. There is no such faction in the Dems that can be weaponized against the \\"left\\" that Vox hates. Most of the Tea-party receptive ideologues have shifted either to mainstream republicans, the Libertarian party itself, to Trumpism, or have become Democrats. Vox is putting on an argument that is every bit as reality detached, cringey, and laughable as the \\"real men for Harris\\" ads, only they dress it up with academic verbiage.","title":"If Harris loses, expect Democrats to move right"},{"text":"Despite the fact that Republican playbook since the 50s has been to push for Russian style communism.","title":"Hillary Clinton says Trump's Madison Square Garden event is a 'Nazi rally'"},{"text":"This is stupid.

Pollsters whose primary business is helping Democrats or Republicans get elected are not used. They tend to make their horse look better. When there are multiple polls for a race, the most recent poll is always used. The middle date of the polling period is what counts (not the release date). If other polls have middle polling dates within a week of the most recent one, they are all averaged together. This tends to smooth out variations.**What algorithm (formula) is used to compute the map?**In 2004, we ran three different algorithms. The main page just used the most recent poll. The second algorithm averaged three days' worth of polls using only the nonpartisan pollsters. The third one included a mathematical formula for predicting how undecided voters would break based on historical data. The second one was most stable and gave the best final result, so this time a slight variation of it is used: The most recent poll is always used, and, if any other polls were taken within a week of it, they are all averaged together. This method tends to give a more stable result, so the colors don't jump all over the place due to one unusual poll.**Should I believe poll results?**Sometimes, but keep in mind the effects of methodology, undersampled demographic groups, and constantly changing public opinion.*","title":"On this day in 2012, Mitt Romney led Barack Obama by 0.6 in the polling average for the National Popular Vote and was set for a historic landslide in the Electoral College"},{"text":"Not to mention corporate greed, which is the main culprit.

The Biden admin spent almost a billion dollars to push falsehoods about covid vaccines, boosters, and masks on the American people. If a pharma company had run the campaign, it would have been fined out of existence.\\nHHS engaged a PR firm, the Fors Marsh Group (FMG), for the propaganda campaign. The main goal was to increase covid vax uptake.The strategy:\\n1. Exaggerate covid mortality risk\\n2. Downplay the fact that there was no good evidence that the covid vax stops transmission.\\nThe propaganda campaign extended beyond vax uptake and included exaggerating mask efficacy and pushing for social distancing &amp; school closures. Ultimately, since the messaging did not match reality, the campaign collapsed public trust in public health.The PR firm (FMG) drew most of its faulty science from @CDCgov's \\"guidance,\\" which ignored @US_FDA findings on the vaccine's limitations, as well as scientific findings from other countries that contradicted CDC groupthink.The report details the CDC's mask flip-flopping through the years. It's especially infuriating to recall the CDC's weird, anti-scientific, anti-human focus on masking toddlers with cloth masks into 2022.President Biden's covid advisor, @ashishkjha, waited until Dec. 2022 (right after leaving government service) to tell the country that \\"[t]here is no study in the world that shows that masks work that well.\\" What took him so long?In 2021, former @cdcgov director, Rochelle Walensky rewrote CDC guidance on social distancing at the behest of national teachers' union, guaranteeing that schools would remain closed to in-person learning for many months.During this period, the PR firm FMG put out ads telling parents that schools would close unless kids masked up, stayed away from friends, and got covid vaccinated.In March 2021, even as the CDC told the American people that the vaxxed did not need to mask, the PR firm ran ads saying that masks were still needed, even for the vaxxed. \\"It's not time to ease up\\" we were told, in the absence of evidence any of that did any good.In 2021, to support the Biden/Harris Admin push for vax mandates, the PR firm pushed the false idea that the vax stopped covid transmission. When people started getting \\"breakthrough\\" infections, public trust in pubic health collapsed.Later, when the FDA approved the vax for 12 to 15-year-old kids, the PR firm told parents that schools could open in fall 2021 only if they got their kids vaccinated. These ads never mentioned side effects like myocarditis due to the vax..@HHSGov has scrubbed the propaganda ads from this era from its webpages. It's easy to see why. They are embarrassing. They tell kids, in effect, that they should treat other kids like biohazards unless they are vaccinated.When the delta variant arrived, the PR firm doubled down on fear-mongering, masking, and social distancing.In Sept. 2021, CDC director Walensky overruled the agency's external experts to recommend the booster to all adults rather than just the elderly. The director's action was \\"highly unusual\\" and went beyond the FDA's approval of the booster for only the elderly.The PR campaign and the CDC persistently overestimated the mortality risk of covid infection in kids to scare parents into vaccinating their children with the covid vax.In Aug. 2021, the military imposed its covid vax mandate, leading to 8,300 servicemen being discharged. Since 2023, the DOD has been trying to get the discharged servicemen to reenlist. What harm has been done to American national security by the vax mandate?The Biden/Harris admin imposed the OSHA, CMS, and military vax mandates, even though the CDC knew that the delta variant evaded vaccine immunity. The PR campaign studiously avoided informing Americans about waning vaccine efficacy in the face of variants.The propaganda campaign hired celebrities and influencers to \\"persuade\\" children to get the covid vax.I think if a celebrity is paid to advertise a faulty product, that celebrity should be partially liable if the product harms some people.In the absence of evidence, the propaganda campaign ran ads telling parents that the vaccine would prevent their kids from getting long covid.With the collapse in public trust in the @CDCgov, parents have begun to question all CDC advice. Predictably, the HHS propaganda campaign has led to a decline in the uptake of routine childhood vaccines.The report makes several recommendations, including formally defining CDC's core mission to focus on its core mission of disease prevention, forcing HHS propaganda to abide by FDA's product labelling rules, and revamp the process of evaluating vaccine safety.Probably the most important recommendation: HHS should never again adopt a policy of silencing dissenting scientists in an attempt to create an illusion of consensus in favor of CDC group think.\\n \\nYou can find a copy of the full House report here. HHS must take its findings seriously if there is any hope for public health to regain public trust.https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/We_Can_Do_This_NIH_PR_Campaign_Report_PUBLIC_82616d81eb.pdf","title":"The House report on HHS covid propaganda is devastating.

It's not the relative rate of actual occurrences.  It's the rate of, \\"Huh...If this person wanted to do me harm, I'd be like...MEGA-FUCKED right now.\\"Very few men sexually assault, and very few women wrongfully accuse.  Far greater numbers, though, I think have situations in which details were fuzzy, communication was poor, parties felt pressured, substance abuse was likely present, etc.  Human communication can be dubious in the best of circumstances.

Was it a resolution to that particular argument or to the issue overall? Agreeing that there is a kernel of truth to your opponent's fears is a great first step but was there an agreement about what policies should change and how going forward? Failing to engage with men, as South Korea shows, only leads to a more catastrophic gender divideI'm a little suspicious of that framing. How is South Korean society, or South Korean women, \\"failing to engage with men?\\" And if they're doing so because the men in their lives have repugnant social beliefs, I don't like describing it as \\"failing.\\" I don't think it should be women's and non-binary people's responsibility to coddle men with gross opinions. Why can't we just say that when men have regressive social beliefs and vote accordingly, they are to blame instead of the victims of those beliefs?What I'm interested in is hearing from men about what exactly they want, how exactly those desires aren't being met, and how they could be met. Do they want subsidies for male K-8 teachers? Do they want to redshirt boys? Do they want to set aside tutors just to work with college boys? Do they want college students accused of sexual assault to be immune to any punishment from the school unless they've been found guilty in a formal criminal investigation? Having identified the issues, what are the policy proposals to solve them?And even then: How can we trust that's not a fig leaf? God knows plenty of racist NIMBYs will come up with more respectable reasons to object to development, or xenophobes will come up with more respectable reasons to object to immigration. So it's not clear to me that actually implementing the requested policy proposals would impact the partisan gender divide. What if it's like MAGA in general where there's an elite class of douche-whisperers saying that their less well-spoken comrades are really just upset about totally reasonable material concerns when we know it's just about restoring the traditional social hierarchy?And how does this fit into the affirmative action framework? Are men who are otherwise opposed to affirmative action going to support affirmative action for men? Because I can imagine that some proposed solutions especially in the education sector will essentially be affirmative action for boys.Finally, I'm skeptical of the idea that women and non-binary people being nicer to shitty men will make them less so.

Participants,  from high schoolers all the way to retirees, tucked in for the long  journey into what has been dubbed for years as Trump country or areas  that are heavily Republican.Vice  President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, are  marginally ahead of former President Donald Trump and J.D. Vance in  terms of polling: At presstime, she led 46% to 43%, according to [a recent Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-are-reutersipsos-us-public-opinion-polls-conducted-2024-05-09/).  For context, the poll surveyed 4,129 adults online: one-third  registered Democrats, one-third Republican, and the remainder  independent voters.Polling should be taken with a grain of salt, but it does serve to  highlight how close this presidential election is.

This subject matter makes me pause.It is debated whether there are moral, ethical, or political lessons to be learned from the Holocaust, and if so what they are. In contemporary discourse, there are many references to proposed lessons to be learned from the Holocaust, which are less common in the work of Holocaust scholars.[1] In his 2016 book of the same title, Michael Marrus classifies the lessons drawn from the Holocaust into the categories of early, Jewish, Israeli, and universal lessons.[2] The authors of a book on Holocaust education separate the lessons into deontological, consequentialist, and ontological lessons.[3] Political scientist Ian Lustick classifies responses to the Holocaust by Israeli Jews into four categories: the Holocaust as a \\"Zionist Proof-text; Wasting Asset; Object Lesson for safeguarding human rights; and Template for Jewish life\\". He argues that the last has become hegemonic since the 1980s and that the consequences of seeing enemies as Nazis and threats as existential are damaging to Israel.[4] The existence of specific lessons to be learned from the Holocaust is cited as a justification for Holocaust education, but challenged by some critics.[5] There is a tension between the argument that the Holocaust was a unique event in history and that it has lessons that could be applied to other situations.[6][_Wikipedia: Lessons of the Holocaust_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lessons_of_the_Holocaust)","title":"No, were not teaching Dems a lesson.

I'm sure there are people out there who think like this and I think it's misguided for the same reason you're making at the end of your comment, but I also think it's misguided for another big reason.Basically, it makes any discussion impossibly complicated, because now we have to start doing identity math before we have any conversation. If it's okay to be a bit misandrist if you're a woman when talking about men because men have privilege, can you tell me exactly how misandrist you can be? Because surely there is still a line you shouldn't cross. How much more misandrist are you allowed to be if you have fewer of these societal privileges, like if you are female and non able-bodied how much worse is your speech allowed to be to account for the privilege disparity? What if we're talking about financial privilege is someone less financially privileged allowed to be more bigoted in their speech against someone who is more financially privileged in discussions about financial privilege? How much more, exactly?In my mind this kind of thinking quickly gets to a place where we all have to walk around with a DNA ancestry evaluation and ready to show our net worth so we all know exactly how privileged one another is (and even that wouldn't be enough to really vet someone's total societal privilege, and the amount is impossible to calculate with words and language anyway) before we engage in any conversation, lest we risk offending someone.Your argument to this is like an appeal to goodness and decency and I agree with it, but also, the 'easy argument' doesn't have a leg to stand on because it's impossible to moderate since identity groups could easily be infinitely fractionalized basically down to the individual. If you follow this down to it's logical conclusion, there would be 8.2 billion different identity groups which you would identify by name and SIN #, and any two people discussing intersectionality would have a unique value, call it the privilege rhetoric equalizing value. Someone better at math can say how many permutations of these values there would be.All this to say, it is?**objectively easier**?to just assume that no matter who you're talking to you should aim to be?**at least**?civil and respectful, but ideally like, encouraging and uplifting. It's a zero sum mindset that people who talk like this have. Any discussion about something else takes away from the discussion they want to have. But there's so much opportunity and possibility in the world that if they focused that same negative energy in a positive direction, towards uplifting everyone (or at the very least don't focus on bringing others down), it seems obvious to me that everyone would be better off for it. It feels like all these people are fighting and scrambling for they're piece of the pie, when it's actually not that hard to just make more pies.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"She doesnt need to win Texas.

A 2 child policy with no subsidies and increased taxation for 3 and above can do the needful and regulated as per the population growth. Coercive methods like forcible contraception is for animals and not for intelligent beings and therefore are not recommended. Mind you, population control of a country also goes hand in hand with immigration restrictions. You dont want the hard work that your population puts in for control to be dismantled by another country's wayward population.","title":"CMV: Im pro-abortion.

This is a conspiracy that is way too far out there for this sub even. I'll drop some more things for you to go out and discover now that you've accepted this.Yes, we are in a firmament. A dome. An inverted fishbowl, with water above us. That water came down in Noah's day and flooded the earth. No one can leave this place. It is designed for us to live inside of. It is like an indestructible glass. God is above the water, above the firmament. He is literally above us, like how Jesus says He is from above and we are from below. There is a world above our world. The \\"heavenly\\" world.The devils are down here with us. They have been watching us, and trying to shape societies to go against God's Christ, and Son. Hollywood is one of their arms. I have personally casted out devils in the name of Jesus from people who did not believe they had them. Spiritual parasites are everywhere, possibly even in you.Hell is beneath our feet deep into the earth. There are millions if not billions of living souls being tortured by evil spirits for centuries and millennia. The underworld. There are many sections of hell, also prison cells. A section even put together to deceive newcomers into believing they've reached heaven. It appears cavernous, mountainous, dark, sulfuric, burning, maggot-filled, demon/chimaeric creatures all around, etc. Look into biblical descriptions of hell, then watch after death experiences of people arriving there, and later being saved and resuscitated. The parallels are uncanny. Regardless of if your atheist or buddhist, you can find these accounts from people far and wide. Many are way too traumatized to recount what they've seen, and have kept it secret for many years.There are no aliens. Anything from without of the firmament is a spiritual being. Many of these UFO's are man-made technologies as well, or are worked on in tandem, with these beings.Jesus is the Christ. God is a righteous and holy being. We could not lay our eyes on this being without dying ourselves. That is how sovereign He is. One day everyone will be judged for their sins by His righteousness. The only way out is to accept His son's blood atonement for our sins, and follow Him, or else we will be made to pay for our sins with our eternal souls. The devils want you to reject all that I am saying. We are truly in a war with them for our lives.Research the claims of the bible.

I don't need polls or the electoral college to tell me that. Another way to put this is what are we supposed to do with poll results you hold so dear?included in your conspiracy theoryIt's not a conspiracy. It's not theory. It's not even mine. It's news.Not saying you're definitely wrong, but it seems pretty unlikely.How likely do you think Republicans have the hopes and dreams of Americans on their todo list? Is that also a conspiracy theory? The solution is that people dont have to come to work to try to operate trains after theyve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough Republicans to join us in making sure that people have access to sick leave. - Sen.

What has gotten worse since the 70s and continued through Biden admin, is income inequality and wealth concentration.  Home ownership is increasingly difficult for young people and almost completely unavailable to poorer minority communities.

Women on average need to be having 2.1 children for a sustainable society. That is the goal number all societies should shoot for.1 boy 1 girl and small % of one extra in case the boy or girl dies in childhood before they make their own kids.In South Korea women have on average 0.78 children. That means that means less than one child per woman on average is born. This of course leads to an aging population and shrinking economy and tougher conditions for everyone society as the years go on. It becomes all old people pretty quick and then when those old people start dying off the population gets smaller and smaller. This leads to people never being able to retire. Pretty soon society becomes a ghost town.In Niger they have the exact opposite problem. Women are having 6.75 children on average. This leads to housing shortages and lack of proper care for the children and lower quality of life as they expand more and take more resources. This leads to over crowding and more pollution and more problems all around. Young people need vast resources such as schooling and food and health care and this leads to things like child labor and all sorts of negative things. A lot of times countries like this go to war because they just so much youth they thrown into the meat grinder!Currently in the US the TFR or total fertility rate is about 1.67 per woman. So, that is about 5 kids for every 3 women. You want to have just over 6 on average. We are getting some of the problems that South Korea has, but not the extremes.Globally, we are at a TFR of about 2.3 which is okay slightly above replacement levels so palces where the population is growing like Africa and India we definitely need more abortion, and contraceptives and birth control to get those numbers down from growing so rapidly.In places like The US and Europe, and South Korea, and Japan where fertility rates are below the 2.1 necessary level we actually need initiatives that will make people want to have more kids up to the point of having 2.1 kids.Societies should be aiming for close to that 2.1 number.2.0 is fine. So is 2.2. But the further away you get from that ideal 2.1 the more problems you have in a society.Some argue \\"Immigration can solve this!\\" No, no it can't... You are shipping in people from different cultures, and ethnicity and replacing the current inhabitants. In small numbers immigration can be great for a society, but it is like salt. A little bit adds some flavor, but a bucket full ruins the meal... And the numbers we need to prevent collapse is like a dump truck full of salt. So people need to stop aborting their kids, and start making more babies. As a society we need to do more to help parents. Tax credits for having kids, and more benefit programs for kids, and better school systems. We are not doing any of that though, and we are making a society more hostile towards kids and people starting families.","title":"CMV: Im pro-abortion.

It truly is the Last Best Place on Earth.A lot has changed in Montana since I served in the governors office. But the collective love for our state and country has remained strong.Thats why Im asking you to join me in embracing our states tradition of voting for person over party and cast your ballot for Sen. Jon Tester.As a Republican, I worked for years to elect Republicans in Montana and across the country. But, there is one hallowed promise we make to each other as citizens that transcends political partisanship and that is to faithfully seek the public good above everything else.Following Jons example, it is an easy decision for me to support him.Ive known him for years as a friend, a colleague and a constituent. And I have always admired and trusted Jon because of his courage to stand up for Montana as his first priority.Simply put, Jon is not a typical, political partisan who elevates his party above the best interests of Montana and the nation.Montanans want to see a secure border, and Jon has been working hard to provide that. When the Biden Administration tried to repeal Title 42 and the Remain in Mexico policies, Jon was one of the leading voices diligently working to pass the strongest border security bill weve seen in years  a bill that was backed by border patrol agents, and would have put more manpower and technology on our southern border.Whether its Second Amendment rights or states rights, Jon Tester has consistently stepped up to do what he believed was right for Montana.Clearly, Jon is an independent voice for Montana. Hes proven it time and time again. Hell confront anyone  even his own partys president  when their policies wont work for Montana.His legislative record is proof of a deep and abiding commitment to the people and state he serves as Montanas senior United States senator.Thats why I, along with Republicans across Montana, have thrown my support behind Jon. From business owners to homeowners, from sportsmen and women to elected officials  Montana Republicans know from experience that Jon Tester can be unconditionally trusted to support, protect and defend our state and nation.The Democrat Jon Tester I met 28 years ago as a Republican governor is still the Jon Tester I know today.

However, the debate killed him - but going from the debate, I think three weeks was a very reasonable time to decide to step down.Now, if we go back to whether he should have stepped down way earlier and let an open primary go forward - there's so many unknowns in there that it's just hard to make predictions.

Johnson.I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, No, I already voted for these people, he said. Then, we have to explain to people, Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now youve got to go again.And youll probably have to go in December and do it one more time, he added.A post-election analysis of Ossoffs field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoffs paid relational organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become community mobilizers  a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off, Ossoff continued.Ossoffs efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.Opinion | John Fetterman is Running a Test that Democrats Need to Watch  \\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/08/09/john-fetterman-tries-to-lure-rural-voters-00050352 Ive noticed one Democratic candidate who defies this trend.

One 27-year-old woman in Westmoreland County, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area that struggles against the Pennsyltucky stereotype, praised Fetterman for showing up and speaking bluntly.in conservative Westmoreland County took on the air of a party.

Someone made the remark that with an environment like that, the wise thing to do for LGBT people is to get more aggressive about homophobia and racism, deplatform people that disagree with them, etc. Basically, go on the offensive and start calling out bigots.I disagreed (gently, I think) by pointing out that much of the success of the LGBT movement in my lifetime had been premised on being out, being visible, and being a positive symbol -- giving people some benefit of the doubt, admiring their positive qualities, but absolutely refusing to hide or be ashamed. Now for context, I am a big, tall, broad shouldered, bearded and masculine man... who is bisexual, and who was dating a man at the time.A cis, straight woman told me, \\"I don't know why you think you even have a right to talk in this space. As a cis, straight white man, you should be quiet and listen.\\" Now, I know how it feels to have people talking over your experiences; as a Jew or a member of the LGBT community, you hear a?*lot*?from the majority population about what you believe, often talking over you, and it can be frustrating. At the same time, the thing I was saying would have been no more valid had I?*been*?a \\"straight white man\\", and?*no one*?likes to be told they are invalid.I politely let her know that it's unwise to assume someone's sexual orientation, and that I was speaking from personal experience -- but I often think, what would I have said and how would I have felt if that had not been the case? Would I have been more reluctant to engage with my sister's friends again?So here's my point: I don't think you're talking about a phenomenon that is particular to the left, and young men -- nor do I feel like someone like Tate is particularly good at?*attracting*?young men. Algorithms are feeding people content they engage with, and content like Tate's (that respects the opinions of a certain kind of man, and dismisses others) will immediately alienate older men, women, sexual minorities, etc, while a certain type of feminist rhetoric will immediately alienate young men, and so on.The end result is that, in an environment in which people have an infinity of options about what to engage with (and are often not making a conscious choice in the first place), the communities people end up in have more to do with what has alienated them, than what is uniquely attractive to them.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"#Make Monero your riot.* It's more effective\\n* It gives you better protection","title":"Do not riot"},{"text":"A bunch of those 25 are raising stars on left wing social media.

Personally given the way the country is so polarized and hearing various interviews with \\"undecided voters\\" over the last few weeks, I doubt it would have changed very much significantly had he dropped out earlier.

Just curious though: have you looked into what's the Libertarian stance on making it easier firing government bureaucrats? Are they trying to usher in an age of fascism too? Shouldn't a genuinely curious person wonder if some of their conceptions about reality are wrong when they take that into account?3) I'm not accusing Trump of lying or claiming he will fail in his general efforts. I'm accusing you of likely being misled by the fake news. Trump said that MS-13 are animals, and the media launches into \\"Trump said that immigrants are vermin!\\" headlines. Anybody who has seen one of those crazy fucked up execution videos online would probably agree. He says that \\"illegal immigrants are poisoning the blood\\" of the country (which by the way, is literally true with the Fentanyl epidemic) and that morphs into \\"Trump is explicitly ushering in Hitler's Racial Eugenics\\".

He's still behind in the 538 aggregator and literally behind in every single non-poll indicator. She has a dramatically better ground game, bigger rallies, significantly more donors/volunteers, better endorsements, etc. Also the economy, market, and inflation are all significantly better than they were a year ago. Democrat enthusiasm is higher than it's been in the last 2 elections and early voting is indicating this will be a high turnout election. The only election Trump won was a low turnout one with a fractured Democratic party against a bad candidate who ran a bad campaign. Trump and the RNC have put a significant amount of money into Trans issues and the responses to the messaging has been fucking terrible. They are running an awful campaign by almost every available measure. This is why people like Lichtman and Carville are still confident in her winning. I just read one of the pro-Trump polls that just dropped and there was a really telling bit that bodes well for Harris. 60% of people thought the country was on the wrong track while 65% of them said their lives were on the right track. That means the sample has a reality problem and the \\"economy\\" is literally an issue that isn't affecting the majority of them personally. That's still a problem, but it also indicates that this wrong track shit lacks conviction. Absolutely nothing other than party and gender make this look similar to 2016. The odds are polling companies overreacted to under-polling Trump voters the last 2 elections and are lining up for a massive miss. If you need more evidence on that front look at how bad(6-8%) they have missed on every special election in the last 2 years.

Yeah. Should neo-Nazis be able to break into a Muslim shop and shout death threats at the owner? No. Should Muslims be able to enact laws enforcing the death penalty for LGBT people?

Now, the Department of Education is rolling out a new plan that could provide debt relief to 8 million borrowers who are suffering from financial hardships.The new plan, unveiled Friday, would provide loan relief for approximately 8 million people with student loans who are suffering financial distress caused by other debts, ranging from medical expenses to costs due to a natural disaster. The Education Department said the proposed rules will be published in the Federal Register in the next few weeks, and that it expects to finalize the regulations in 2025. President Joe Biden made delivering debt relief to people with student loans a key policy issue of his 2020 campaign, but Republican-led states have sued to block many of those efforts, while the Supreme Court in 2023 ruled 6-3 against his plan to erase up to $20,000 in debt for millions of borrowers. **Read more:** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-8-million-financial-hardship/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-8-million-financial-hardship/)","title":"Biden administration rolls out new student debt plan, this time aimed at people with big debts"},{"text":"I've taught in high school and college classrooms since the early 90s and something definitely has changed in young, conservative white men.

I was raped at 14 by a hospital employee, and neither the police nor the hospital's investigations team put even close to enough effort into finding the person.That said, there are STILL objectively sexist laws on the books in several places that discriminate against men. In the UK, an AFAB person legally cannot be charged with rape, as rape is defined as forceful penile penetration. A woman can commit what we should all agree is a rape against a man, and even in the most severe cases, will only be charged with one or more of various crimes like sexual assault, which carry shorter prison sentences.Another good example is in academic research. Studies like [this](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/33378/3/Fisher%20%2526%20Pina%20REVISED%20FV%20AVB%2010-05R.pdf) one from 2015, and [this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794296/) one from 2023 both indicate that the prevalence and psychological trauma of female on male rape are disproportionately underresearched compared to male on female.[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20130223165109/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri0809.pdf) study from 2008 found that among 40,000 male inmates who reported sexual misconduct on the part of prison staff, 64% of them claimed to have been sexually abused by female employees.Another good example is in regards to statutory rape done by teachers. Male teachers on female students is overwhelmingly viewed as abhorrent and disgusting, while female teachers on male students STILL sees large groups of people saying things like \\"I wish my teacher was like that!\\"Again, I am not trying to say that sexual abuse women experience is taken as seriously as it should be. That is not at all my point. My point is there is a serious gap in how seriously it is taken between men and women. Woman on male rape is disproportionately underresearched, socially overlooked, and in some places, not legally recognized in the first place.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Happened in 2016, can happen again.

The memo sets a series of deadlines for agencies to study the applications and regulations of AI tools, most of which will lapse following President Bidens term. The memo also aims to limit the most dystopian possibilities, including the development of autonomous weapons, according to the New York Times.National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced the new directive today at the National Defense University as part of a talk on AIs presence in government operations. Sullivan has been one of the Presidents most vocal proponents for examining the benefits and risks of AI technology. He also raised concerns about Chinas use of AI to control its population and spread misinformation and how the memo can spark conversations with other countries grappling with implementing its own AI strategies.The memorandum establishes some hard edges for AI usage especially when it comes to weapons systems. The memo states that AI can never be used as a decision maker for launching nuclear weapons or assigning asylum status to immigrants coming to the US. It also prohibits AI from tracking anyone based on their race or religion or determining if a suspect is a known terrorist without human intervention.It's good to see that some nascent policies around AI/ML are starting to be developed, and hopefully this work will continue apace over into the next administration. It's also good to see that the president is still continuing to push forward with his work towards the end of his term and hopefully this will continue over the coming months as well.","title":"President Biden sets up new AI guardrails for military, intelligence agencies | The new guidelines prevent AI from making decisions about launching nuclear weapons and granting asylum"},{"text":"For those that aren't aware.[https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris)**This Day In History:**?[October 25, 2020: Biden +8.0](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html)?|?[October 25, 2016: Clinton +5.1](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)A tie (or even a 2 point lead for Harris) would be very very good as it implies that Trump will do well in the swing states.If the popular vote is actually tied in polling, or he has a lead, then Trump is going to win.

There was a debate in the late 1800s between the Austrian School (subjective theory of value, capitalism, limited govt, free markets, liberty) and the German Historical School (labor theory of value, Marxism, central control, objective economics via mathematics justifying central control). The economists of the latter went on to influence (guess who) the fascists of Europe in the 1920s-40s. Fascism and socialism shouldve died after WW2 however it was kept alive, fascism even being considered right wing is an artifact of that (it is actually a nationalist, socialist/syndicalist mixed economic approach, marked by high societal division, often times fueled by the planners themselves; not unlike what Democrats are pushing for now, to fix capitalism). Many left wing economic methods have been retroactively tied to the subjective theory of value, and this is where the measurement problem appears. The whole basic concept of the subjective theory of value is the value of things are subjective and not often measurable in any terms (say, an employer hiring a fresh out of rehab nephew to help get him on his feet, though many empiricists would find this irrational, it makes perfect sense to subjectivists). While I dont consider Trump to practice pure praxeoligical, subjectivist economics, he at least acknowledges the truth that a freer society, with less top-down control, is a more prosperous society. And that *is* a step in the right direction. The opposite, more central control, only warms the seat for an eventual tyrant, and Id be willing to bet it wont be Trump or any principled conservative, or libertarian leader.Edit: wordingEdit2: Subjective theory of value*, not subjective theory of labor","title":"Reductio ad Hitlerum: 60 years of Democrats falsely calling the Republican nominee a fascist - Washington Examiner"},{"text":"I'm from his hometown.

As opposed to how it was when I was in school myself or even the beginning of my career, boys are a troublesome, uninvolved afterthought at my school. Clubs, student leadership, honors classes, all of them are dominated by women 8 to 1. Boys are the entirety of our dropout prevention program. Boys' fail rate is quadruple the girls'. Young ladies speak up in class and express empathy and curiosity about the world. Getting a boy to pull his face away from Clash of Clans for more than a minute is pulling teeth, and half the time I hear boys chime in to discussion the sexism is eye-popping. Ofc not all young ladies are academic rockstars, but the disproportionate issues with young men are overwhelming.There's so much that goes into it. Young men aren't wrong in that earning potential is lowering, it's far more expensive to get a degree, life is more expensive than ever, dating sucks even more than it did before, climate change and general doomerism are increasingly validated by current events...and they're watching young women increasingly involved, increasingly attending college and increasingly not needing a man's financial support to be independent and happy. Combine that with a constant stream of far-right influencers and the general punk attitude of the preteen boy and it's not a shock at all that these young men are turning to incel behavior to vent their frustration. It's much easier to blame feminism turning women into whatever it is they think than to realize that the lifestyles their fathers and grandfathers lived were propped up by bigoted laws and attitudes. If there is a silver lining, it is that, in line with what I stated earlier, young men are by a wide margin the least likely to vote. Of course, their apathy is the entire problem so I can't exactly cheer that, but them building class consciousness would go a long way towards keeping our country from its rightward trajectory.","title":"I visited JD Vances hometown.

This is why planned parenthood is a thing.  Your first example reeks of right-wing fear mongering.

The welfare system is called a safety net for a reason.The second item can happen overnight. Once again a strong safety net would help people bounce back from adversity with greater ease.As for your third point, Orphanages are overflowing and I kind of agree here, but a stronger social safety net would improve this too. Foster care (and actual orphans) is a whole separate thing and would be largely unaffected by abortion practices.Your last point is the only one I strongly agree with. If you plan to have children you are not going to be able to take care of, no matter what you do, you should just abort.I feel like you are coming at the problem from a right-wing ideological perspective. Like most self-proclaimed centrists, you just act like pro-business/anti-human thought patterns are somehow good for society when the opposite is true. People fail all the time. Most people will get back on their feet, given the chance. Unfortunately, the worse our system gets, the fewer people *can* bounce back and we (US) have been gutting our social safety net for decades now.As an aside, if you think democrats or liberals are on the left, you are sorely mistaken.

But pastor Wilder takes exception to something else, too.The Republican party right now is doing a really wonderful job of faking relationships, he says. The emails he receives from the Trump campaign C which he signed up to for research purposes C often start with exuberant personal messages such as I need you or I cant do it without you. Its ingenuine, Wilder says, recognising that some in his congregation C which splits about 50/50 on party lines C have fallen into the trap  Mens health is something we overlook in America. Men want to be part of something C to feel like they belong.Increasingly, this election looks set to be defined by an entrenched gender divide. This is particularly evident, according to recent polls, among white men without a college degree, who favour Trump by a margin of 70%....Naturally, what the pastor describes forms only a fragment of the reason white men are attracted to Trump. Some in the cable news commentariat chastise the Harris campaign for failing to connect with men, overlooking the reality that swathes of them continue to carry so much gender and racial bias that connection is impossible. Throughout this election I have heard many voters describe the vice-president of the United States with vicious misogyny, often in line with remarks Trump himself has made....The gender divide that defines this election is even more pronounced among younger voters, according to recent polls. Some 67% of young women support Harris, compared with 28% who support Trump. And 58% of young men favour Trump, against 37% for Harris.Before we set out to walk the streets, I ask the group if they think the very definition of masculinity is on the ballot this year, too. Some nod in agreement. The conservatives definition of masculinity is hard-working blue-collar man, who works hard to support his family, his wife, his livelihood, his home and his community, says one young man. Those on the left, I dont think they know what a man is.I ask the groups president, Grant Bagshaw, whether he has concerns about the dozens of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, and of the jury decision last year to hold the former president liable for sexual abuse. Its an uncomfortable subject. I dont know. I dont think any of us know, so I wont make a judgment on whether they are telling the truth or not, he says, adding: Republicans and most Americans in general  they just dont believe the media most of the time.The last point of the distrust of media in general has been a deeply concerning trend for years now. Along with the consolidation of many media outlets into the hands of a few, there's been a flood of misinformation that helps to not only muddy the waters but also breed a sense of fatigue in the general public that serves to disregard all information sources either legitimate or not. In order to reconnect the public with elected officials, the conduits that facilitate this connection, be it the media or other venues, needs to be revitalized to serve the public at large rather than specific partisan goals.","title":"I visited JD Vances hometown.

Even the bare minimum of an apology hasnt been offered. Anecdotally, none of my friends from MENA communities are voting blue this time around because of the admins handling of the crisis in the Middle East and if Harris loses, its partially going to be because of that. As a whole Dems/liberals have really dropped the ball on giving a shit about international peacemaking. Which seems like a nothing burger because armchair strategists like to think domestic policy is the only thing that matters. But Sudanese, Haitian, Afghan, Burmese, Lebanese, and Palestinian Americans all live in swing states and I have heard from all of them that the administration has completely low balled them into turning out (no this isnt a laundry list, urban America is actually this diverse). The thing about foreign affairs is even having the concept of a plan is enough for most people and there is nothing for that, including current conflicts being assisted like Ukraine.  Some of the things being done, like ignoring reports about humanitarian aid being blocked, and then sending a letter pausing weapons shipments for lack of humanitarian aid, only after a month (and though probably not realized but occurring after Election Day) does no favors and ruins good will further.The caveat to everything I said above could be wrong though if 1) she wins and the fact 2) this is all anecdotal and I dont have any firm proof one way or the other.","title":"Behind the Curtain: Dems fear they're blowing it"},{"text":"I do agree with a lot of your sentiment...but would add that once they disagree with their chosen dictator, they believe they will be able to just vote him out and get a new one that supports their beliefs.

I'll concede that it may not fall under absolute freedom of speech, but the books would still be available, just not in schools.Saying that it's a violation of freedom of speech is like saying that being unable to bring a firearm into a school is a violation of 2A. It's obviously not.Here's a thought experiment. If I were to write a book about how to effectively commit a school shooting, would you say that schools not allowing such a book in their libraries is a violation of my freedom of speech, or would you rather conclude that it's a reasonable limitation for the purpose of harm reduction for kids?Regarding the teachers fired for discussing sex-ed, I suppose you're referring to the cases related to the so-called Don't Say Gay bill in Florida (based on a cursory Google search). If that's the case, I honestly don't know enough about the topic to give an informed opinion.However, regarding firing teachers for not disclosing information to parents about their children, I do somewhat agree with that. Parents have a duty of care towards their children, and keeping information hidden from them can lead to issues with that duty. For example, if a child is suicidal, their parents **should** know about that, for the child's own safety.However, if we're talking about young teens, then sure, they have a right to privacy and a psychological need for it. In those cases, while I still think that it's in the best interest of the child for the parents to know what's going on, it is somewhat of a gray area.No, regulations.Wouldn't that same logic apply to book bans and the limitations on teacher-student communication? After all, they're just regulations.And against what most 'leftists' would wish, kamala and walz have stated their stance on the issue - even that they are both gun owners and think 2A should stay in place.Yeah, that's fair.Everyone knows **all** they would do is set up barriers for mentally ill individuals that were previously able to buy or gun malls where anyone and everyone can stroll in an purchase - ie close the loopholes.Those aren't loopholes that exist. Anyway, the banning firearms based on vibes that I was referring to is a policy supported by many Democrats, including Kamala.For example, Biden said he'd support a ban on AR-15 following the (first) assassination attempt on Trump, because an AR-15 was used by the shooter. Kamala has [stated](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/kamala-harris-assault-weapons-ban-tax-relief-pennsylvania) that she'd be in favour of such a ban and that Walz agrees with her (while also not understanding what an assault rifle is). That's like banning Ford F-150s because they cause the most crashes, ignoring that it's the most common car in the US. It's purely based on vibes.Another example of vibe-based restrictions would be the the assault weapon bans in California and other states. In California, military-style features on semi-automatic centerfire rifles, such as pistol grips, folding and telescoping stocks, and barrel shrouds are banned. Those restrictions are purely based on vibes as the banned features don't make a firearm any more dangerous. Some specific models are also banned (AK-series rifles, Beretta AR-70, Steyr AUG, ...) despite them not being any more dangerous than any other semi-automatic centerfire rifle.If you're a 2A supporter this should be 100% okay with you.Yeah, I don't have issues with universal background checks, limiting firearm ownership for mentally ill individuals, and mandatory waiting periods. There are probably other restrictions that I'd agree with, although I can't think of them off the top of my head.Those are sensible policies. They reduce the risk of people getting shot, while also not infringing on the right to own firearms.lol see election year 2000's EC vote.What are you on about? You're either severely misinformed, or purposefully misrepresenting the truth.One (1) Elector from DC (Barbara Lett-Simmons) abstained from voting to protest the lack of representation in Congress for the citizens of Washington DC. However, given the Electoral vote went 271-266 for Bush, even if she voted for Al Gore it wouldn't have changed the result.The whole controversy surrounding the 2000 election revolves around the Florida recount. Bush won Florida by such a small margin that, by Florida law, they had to recount the votes. The recount lasted almost a month, and the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to stop the recount. The dissenting opinion seems the more reasonable one to me, but I'm also not well versed in US law. If anything, the recount controversy shows how manual counting of votes (with all interested parties present) is the better option, but I do have strong opinions against voting machines and vote-counting machines in general.However, it has nothing to do with the Electoral College.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris will win the election."},{"text":"Time for Elmo to go back to where he came from","title":"An Elon Musk-backed dark money group is behind a fake Kamala Harris manifesto"},{"text":"I'm so tired of bedwetting Dem staffers.I am incredibly impressed with Kamala's campaign.

Comparing Tate to Peterson is like comparing Miley Cyrus to John Stewart.

This makes sense as he comes from academia where this is, or at least used to be, the standard. I have heard arguments from Peterson that I very much agree with. By saying this online, I will likely be called a bigot, sexist, or transphobic. Just because I think he made a good point on one topic in one conversation. Now me being an adult will realize that the people calling me this are not very intelligent, and their opinion means less to me than my cat's opinion. To a young kid, this treatment makes them feel like they have no common ground with liberals and can push them into even more extremes like Andrew Tate. I agree with this post; we, as the left, have failed our young men online. We failed them online because we became the bullies. We told them they are rapists, sexists, ravists, and privileged. We told them they were the enemy. Then we are surprised when they fall into the hands of someone like Andrew Tate. Tate just hates women and thinks they are inferior.

We see this in the real world when we look at periods of massive change like the FDR era and more recently, we saw a significant move 'to the left' after the 2018 Democratic landslide.In 2020, although Democrats won the election on record turnout, results were closer than expected and the election was a disappointment, thus a little wavering back to the center. Political reality--namely the 50-50 Senate--also forced moving 'to the right.' It is actually amazing how much got done with the 50-50 Senate. In the past, it took pretty large majorities to make change. In 2022, it would seem the bottom fell out on Democratic popularity. Approximately 9,243,895 people who voted against Republicans in 2018 didn't show up in 2022 while Republicans had record turnout. This little fact yells loudly: Democrats need to move away from progress. (Thus my comment above that you didn't respond to: \\"we need to keep them out.\\")Democrats become more conservative when those who bother to vote support Republicans. This is what has happened most elections since 1980, first in the White House then in Congress. Refusing to support Democrats makes them move to the right. This is how competition for power in representative government works. We see this in the low turnout elections of the 1920's and 1990's.While it is true that people support policies 'to the left' of the Democratic agenda, it doesn't matter if people who support certain policies won't vote for Democrats. We see this when comparing ballot initiatives on abortion, minimum wage, Medicaid expansion, etc.--people vote for progressive policies on the same ballots where they vote for Republican politicians.Crime actually is an issue because it moves voters. Always has. Defund the police is a political loser.There is no \\"viable opportunity for political power\\" in elections outside of the two big parties and it has been that way for 160 years. The fact that you are so adamant to selectively retort on some comments to push that voting doesn't matter right before an election tells us that you think voting matters very much--you are vigorously against it.","title":"As Harris Courts Republicans, the Left Grows Wary and Alienated"},{"text":"I never got the hype of release the files of what we already know about but the majority of people in the states will think youre batshit crazy what 9/11 files dude?

I think its HOW its phrased and comes across. In the last few years, theres been a lot of casual shitting on men in left wing spaces. And not just men; entire comment sections are filled with things like no one cares about your problems white girl or no one asked for a straight guys opinion.I get comments like that in some cases; like when a woman or Black or gay person is sharing their lived experience and someone else is negating it. But my god there were times where it felt like you couldnt say ANYTHING without being told to shut up, get over it, or never speak again based on your non-oppressed gender/race/sexual orientation.I have been in conversations where most people in the room are in a more societally oppressed class, and we could be talking about random shit that is literally in my area of study/expertise. But I quickly learned that I had to let statements with completely incorrect facts/assumptions continuously slide because my opinion (based on the literal facts, as someone specialized in that field) was unwelcome if it contradicted the opinion of someone who was not straight or white. Or Id hear things like well youre white, Im sure youve never gotten a speeding ticket. Or white people dont get told to shush in public spaces, thats just Black folk. Both of which were completely false re: my lived experience and every white person I know, but I eventually learned to nod my head and let it slide because anything else would get the conversation heated. I also learned my family/cultures issues were irrelevant - my grandparents grew up very poor, under Nazi occupation and starving, and when I was literally asked about my family/cultural background and answered that, plus that we were occupied by a foreign power for 400 years, all I got back was well, my ancestors were slaves! Wanna compare to that?!! At no point had I tried to say they were worse off than enslaved people, or had that been a topic beforehand. I was responding to a direct question, and all I got in response was how much better off and privileged my grandparents were starving under Nazis in some rural farming village, and how DARE I imply my people had ever suffered, since they were white?I remember watching Big Little Lies and repeatedly seeing eye rolls and whole articles on how no one cares about these rich white womens problems. I will remind you, the shows problems werent oh the housekeeper shrunk my clothes. The two main issues were literally horrific violent physical abuse, and a traumatic rape leading to PTSD.But to a whole bunch of the leftist community, these were things to be eye rolled or scoffed at cause they were happening to rich white women. So who cares if they get raped or beaten! They live in nice houses. And that sentiment was justALLover the place a few years ago. Friends who wouldnt give white homeless people money and scoffed at their homelessness - cause, you know, white people are immune to growing up in poverty or mental disorders and drug addiction, I guess. I could go on and on. It made me start to get resentful; the constant dismissal and inability to offer an opinion, having to go along with what someone less well off, not white, or not straight was saying even when I factually knew it was wrong, being told people who had suffered trauma, starvation, and war were in fact super privileged. I worked on it to let the resentment go and not let it turn into something else, and the fact that this more extreme discourse has died down the last few years definitely helped a lot. I see it in things like Cynthia Erivos nonsense about how its actually racist a fan made an edit of her movie poster with the hat tilted down to look like the original. Most people are now comfortable pushing back on that; a few years ago? It would have been the most racist shit in the world and if you disagreed, you would also, in fact, be racist.But my point is, I totally understand how OP and men like him are lured to the right when the left acts like this. Its not right and its not excusable for anyone to become a woman-hating Tate follower. But we cant just constantly be shitting on men online and in person, telling them their problems arent important, or dismissing any opinion because a straight white dude said it so no one cares. That kind of hostility became very typical of our liberal side the last few years, and Im glad its falling out of favor a bit. Because whenever you talk to people like that? Absolutely no one is going to listen to your point. Theyre going to shut down. And I know that was a big aspect of what we called tone policing butdo we want to communicate our issues and help people understand and advocate, or do we want to angrily snap at people who have done nothing to us? Because at some point we have to acknowledge we cant do both.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Thank ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"These signs have popped up in my Michigan city this week and I immediately read them out loud like a caveman, told my wife I did that and she howled and she had done exactly the same thing!","title":"Elder Maxson sees this and then proceeds to endorse Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"MAGA is unifying and decentThe left spies on and persecutes those who oppose them.Satanic left ruining the country","title":"Trump wont rule out Hunter Biden pardon if elected"},{"text":"Someone probably just figured out today that Joe Biden isn't running for reelection","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Stephen A. in a never-ending quest to stay relevant.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"A sliver of copium from NYThttps://preview.redd.it/ylw8vn3puvwd1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c2557b7b67ec51ec2a9f6f1ecfb1e44f46ebf71","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Exactly.

She is trying to come across as moderate to the regular voter but committed to the cause to the left. She wants to say she'll be different from Biden, but also doesn't want to criticize the administration she was a part of. She can't run on a good track record either, since immigration, foreign policy and the economy are all not doing too well.

Ukraine is a money laundering nation for US billionaires who act through the US govt. And since 2022 the vast majority of ukraine assets have been transferred from common assets (owned by the people) to private assets (owned by those who are telling the US to get involved, such as BlackRock who now owns more land in ukraine than ukraine does)The US invades places on behalf of people like musk. In fact for musk himself in the case of bolivia where they installed a coup of the govt and a right wing puppet regime to set up vast strip mines for lithium, specifically for musk as well as other technology manufacturers who needed cheaper lithium. Musk has said on twitter publicly that this coup took place for himSo all invasions are, is the ultra wealthy like musk wanting to acquire a trade route or valuable assets, sending in the taxpayer-funded soldiers at eye-watering expense to go and do the hard work. Then once the invasion is complete, the US military withdraws and hands over to private mercenary forces. So the ultra-rich hasnt had to pay a penny for the invasion, if anything has made a profit if they own significant military stocksIf you look at who funded ww2, it was the same people funding both sides. Those people are now entrenched within the US since part of ww2s purpose was to move wealth from europe and britain to the US and have the US as the new world leader. When russia defied expectations and started winning the war they had to speed up getting the wealth and valuable nazis out of the US so they had the US invade as well. If you map out the US actions after d-day they werent really interested in retaking things to defeat the germans they were interested in wealth extraction. I still think this was the purpose of US troops in europe during ww2. The thousands of tons of gold they extracted is still in the US today and countries have asked for their hundreds of billions back and been refused constantly. And the nazi scientists of course built the atom bomb as well as led the cold warSo the elite know that they pretend goodguys and badguys we are funding ukraine to help those poor people survive against evil russia is just roleplaying for the children and people who still watch TV news. Everybody else particularly the actual super rich, know that this is just theatre. They can act how they want to act and its not a problem because their interests ARE US interests because the US govt entirely works for them. By definition they cant commit treasonAnd doing things like funding russia to extend the war is essential for ukraine because the entire purpose of ukraine is to have a lengthy proxy war so they can bring even more of it into private ownership and launder/clean more money via donating it to ukraineThe only way a billionaire would be considered treasonous is if he did something that was against the interests of the other billionaires. For example george soros did something before i was born, idk what it was, so he was kicked out of almost every western country and blacklisted and i dont doubt he has assassination attempts. I dont mean what he did with british pound sterling this was after that. So whatever he did, was treason. Not because it led to US military deaths or vast wastes of taxpayer funded resources but because he went against the interests of the billionaires who actually rule the worldMusk isnt doing this so no matter how many soldiers die it isnt a problem.

Its weird because it is a rare occurrence that people like you have the ability to see through all of these things clearly and that your gut instinct tells you to question all of it. I always wonder why there are so few people like this in this reality. Its always a boost for me when I see content like this.So anyways, I think it leans more towards the alien conspiracy #1. Although conspiracy #2 kind of blends into conspiracy #1. I think that they are essentially the same conspiracy (The truth) From personal experience in my own life I think that there are intelligent non-human beings manipulating human beings perception through different means. Take a look at the jabs for example and what La Quinta Columna are saying about it. Clearly there is a non-human agenda going on right now. I get that humans will sell out for a buck, but these stooges are clearly being given orders by non-human beings. Youre dead on with the Antarctica angle. There are obvious no-go zones that give us all clues as to what is truly going on behind the scenes. Im no expert on dimensions or portals, but these beings can clearly either be cloaked/invisible or they can shift to look human in appearance. The thing that gets me is the telepathic aspect of our reality. People put so much emphasis on their thoughts and their mental health issues. The whole demonic thing is just this telepathic phenomenon in general being labeled in a way that makes more sense to the average Joe. What Im getting at is not only are all of the things you mentioned going on, but also the human population is being telepathically controlled by all of these aliens. I wish I could explain it better and say who the players are and how the technology is being used on humans, but that is the best I can do for now. Trust me I wish I knew. Its a mystery that can drive me bonkers sometimes when I think about what the proper solution is to it all. What is interesting is how people like you and people like me can sense this for whatever reason. Then you have the other 90-95% of the population who will dismiss it because they dont have enough proof.For some reason either people want proof or they may be getting convinced directly that it doesnt exist by someone or something. This seems to be a result of these beings wanting to remain stealth from all human perception. Are all human beings minds connected to some sort of alien AI technology that they are all unaware of? So it runs like a software program on the background of a desktop computer without being recognized that it is even on? So if you have a suicidal thought is it even your thought in the first place? Or does it come from a malevolent ET AI technology platform? Or could it just come directly from an intelligent malevolent ET themselves? To me that is what the low vibrational loosh phenomenon is all about.Rule #1- Be fully aware that this phenomenon exists in your own mind. From moment to moment it can manipulate you in any way that it sees fit. All it wants is to control you. It wants you to be a slave to this low vibrational way of thinking at all times.Rule #2- Be aware of this phenomenon in other people around you because if it cant get to you (Rule #1) it will program others to influence you in the same manner.?All I know is from continuously experiencing things in my own life something is off. Ive seen too much crazy shit that doesnt add up in our society and it all points towards this phenomenon every single freaking time. Something unseen is definitely there pulling the strings. So in a nutshell I hope this partially answers your question. The religious context of the particular wording just makes the term aliens more acceptable to the mainstream so that it is labeled as demons instead of aliens. So are there aliens constantly dicking around with humanity? Absolutely. Is there AI also involved? PossiblyIf you havent already go check out the website The Cosmic Switchboard. Its a great resource.","title":"Is it Aliens, or is all that is happening related to God/Heaven/Angels/Demons?"},{"text":"There was 4 years of a Trump presidency to review.

Observers around the world are watching with concern, as these actions test the resilience of democratic principles in the United States.Criticisms directed at figures like Vice President Kamala Harris, labeling her as a 'communist,' reveal a misunderstanding of political alignment. In fact, by internationally recognized measures, which consider social conservatism, economic policy, and foreign policy, the Democratic Party is comparatively centrist, often aligning closer to right-of-center positions than most major conservative parties in Europe. By contrast, the current MAGA movement within the Republican Party echoes ideologies common in Europes far-right parties, particularly in its approach to nationalism and populist rhetoric.Such polarizing characterizations and extreme partisan divides continue to shape the U.S. political landscape, inviting us to reflect on the direction in which American democracy is headed.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris will win the election."},{"text":"Side of beef.

As you said the article is 'high factual' but you seem to ignore those and other similar things in the article that completely undermine and call into question all your accusation and hear-say being thrown into overdrive by Democrat political partisanship.This seems to come at a really convenient time when Democrats hate Musk more than ever and fear what an asset he is to the Republicans. Not like Democrats haven't lied through their teeth like in 2016 pumping up the Steele Dossier to try to overturn the election they lost for like 2 years, and then, when those were proven totally bogus, democrats continued to try to impeach Trump on the grounds he didn't cooperate with their bogus sore loser politically motivated investigation.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk has most likely committed treason"},{"text":"Hysterectomy is for women, Vasectomy is for men.Personally I feel women who don't want children at all but don't want to take birth control should just commit to getting a Hysterectomy so they don't need to reproduce at all.

By that logic I could say the right wingers fail women, because the rights of women are going to be harmed if Trump becomes president.I also find it funny how the solution for men is to just go back to the old times, where women were baby brooding machines, deprived of abortion rights and so on, which is the wet dream of the Trumpists instead of maybe working on the real problems like the mental health of men, the lack of chances for poor boys and so on? All these boys are basically voting for people who will never solve any of these problems either.

This funding includes 654 grants that will help small businesses and farms across the country implement cost-saving, clean, efficient energy systems on their properties, in addition to a $20.5 million grant that will help Allegheny Electric Cooperative meet over 80% of its power requirements from carbon-free resources by 2026.More than 600 of the funded projects under both programs announced today are made possible by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act, the nations largest-ever investment in combating the climate crisis. They also advance the Presidents Investing in America agenda to grow the nations economy from the middle out and bottom up.  \\n...  \\nThrough REAP, USDA partners with agricultural producers and small businesses to lower business costs through clean energy and energy efficiency systems. The New ERA program provides funding to member-owned rural electric cooperatives to transition to clean energy, keeping electricity costs low for hardworking families, farmers and small business owners and preventing power outages in the face of extreme weather exacerbated by the climate crisis. Secretary Vilsack also announced the availability of an additional $600 million in REAP funds that farmers and small businesses can apply for by March 31, 2025.*New ERA Investment Expands Clean Energy for Rural Households in Pennsylvania and New Jersey*Through the New ERA program, USDA is investing $20.5 million in Allegheny Electric Cooperative. This award will help reduce energy costs and secure reliable, clean energy for rural residents in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.The funding is expected to support the cooperatives investment in 25 megawatts of clean energy, which will help serve the electricity needs of approximately 235,000 households served by Alleghenys 14-member electric distribution cooperatives.In addition to lowering costs for rural households, the New ERA grant will allow Allegheny to meet over 80% of its power requirements from carbon-free resources by 2026. This will mean a reduction of nearly 100,000 tons of climate pollution annually, or the equivalent of providing electricity for nearly 18,000 homes.This Biden-Harris Administration New ERA opportunity to invest in more affordable, clean energy resources will make Allegheny one of the cleanest, most carbon-free generation and transmission cooperatives in America.*REAP Investments Lower Costs and Create Jobs*In addition, USDA is investing $126 million in REAP grants that will support 654 clean energy projects in 39 states, Guam and Puerto Rico. This includes $24 million in grants that will finance 112 clean energy projects in Pennsylvania.Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA has invested $66.8 million through REAP in Pennsylvania through 475 awards that directly serve farmers and rural small businesses across the state. Nationally, USDA has invested more than $2.4 billion in approximately 8,500 renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements since President Biden took office. This includes more than 3,000 clean energy projects totaling more than $800 million which were made possible because of President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act.The investments announced today will help make it possible for agricultural producers and rural small business owners to expand their use of wind, solar, geothermal and small hydropower energy and make energy efficiency improvements.These innovations will help them increase their income, grow their businesses and address climate change while lowering energy costs for American families.  \\n...*REAP Inflation Reduction Act Funding Availability*As part of todays announcement, USDA will make available an additional $600 million across three funding rounds from now until 2027.During each funding round, the Department expects to make available $180 million in general REAP funding and $20 million in set-aside funding for underutilized renewable energy technology.These funds are made possible by President Bidens historic Inflation Reduction Act and will be the final REAP funding availability from this legislative package.USDA is accepting applications in this first round through two windows. The deadlines to apply are Dec. 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025.Both REAP and the New ERA Program are a part of the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40% of the benefits from certain federal investments go to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.For additional information about the REAP funding availability, see page 83449 of the Oct. 16 Federal Register.Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas. Visit the Rural Data Gateway to learn how and where these investments are impacting rural America.An example list of recipients and project scope are in the press release. Statement from Vice President Harris:For far too long, rural communities throughout America did not receive the resources they deserve. That is why President Biden and I worked to increase investments in these communitiesfrom supporting their small businesses, to targeting resources toward their health care, education, and economic well-being, said Vice President Harris. These new awards for rural electric cooperatives, farmers, and small business owners will build on this work by creating jobs, generating business opportunities, and ensuring that residents of rural communities  from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Idaho  have access to affordable, clean, and reliable energy. We are committed to making sure that rural communities have the resources they need to thrive.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Continues Historic Clean Energy Commitment to Lowering Costs and Creating Jobs for People in Pennsylvania and 38 States, Guam and Puerto Rico"},{"text":"thanks! il post more here","title":"Liberals actually having to watch and defend her"},{"text":"When and how are we going to kick Putins smart balls to the roof of his smart mouth?I am tired of the election interference and fascistic meddling.

This small proportion is amplified due to bombastic content3.  The socials have an incentive to pursue engagement,  and bombast yields love clicks and hate clicks, clicks are clicks4.  A very small proportion of individuals, not necessarily genuine members of a purported group, potentially operators, consciously or subconsciously adapt rhetoric and messaging that's radicalization ratcheting.  5.

You'd be wrong. And this is a good thing!Typically, one side dominates, until a switch in teammates, a new form, or simply better tactics comes in.Raditz dominated Goku and Piccolo. Hell, Raditz needed to be kept off guard and then held by Goku for Piccolo to launch an attack that killed the two Saiyans. Such a desperate move showed the stakes. Nappa dominates until Goku shows up, making a mess out of the Z fighters. This makes it cathartic when Goku utterly curbstomps Nappa.Vegeta and Goku are actually pretty even. That is, until Vegeta becomes a Great Ape. Then he runs roughshed until Yajirobe cuts off his tail. Afterwards, it continues to be even, with maybe a slight edge to Goku, due to Gohan's presence. We're on the edge of our seats, thinking who can win this tight match.Frieza's lackeys get utterly trashed by Vegeta on Namek, who pulls off some big brain plays. Only Zarbon lives through an encounter with the Saiyan Prince, but he's throughly dispatched in another. And after the Ginyus come in and trash Vegeta, Gohan, and Krillin they get clowned by Goku (except Ginyu himself). These series of battles showcase Vegeta's intelligence and cruelty, as well as Goku's heroism and strength.Frieza is perhaps one of the best examples in the show. Dude's nigh untouchable to the Z fighters, who lose more and more members as the fight goes on. They have to rely on their wits to even live. They are hitting him with Solar Flares, running away and hiding, and literally using a medic (Dende) to heal the Z fighters when they get clobbered (or in Krillin's case, outright impaled). It's CHEAP. In games, we'd call this \\"cheesing\\". But it keeps them alive, at least for a bit longer. By the time Goku arrives, Dende is dead, Vegeta is at death's door, Krillin is worse for wear. These guys are barely hanging in.And Goku dominates. All the humiliation Frieza served to his friends and family is now being dished to him. Frieza now has to contend with someone as strong as he. Frieza gets a few good licks in, but the audience now knows something: Frieza is not invincible. He makes the grievous mistake of killing Krillin for the second time, inspiring Goku to become a Super Saiyan. And the second Goku turns into a Super Saiyan, this match is over. Frieza gets smashed, swung around, and rightly destroyed. Hell, dude even cuts himself into 2 with his own attack. Goku then gives him some energy to leave the planet and think about what he's done. Frieza, being the fascist galactic tyrant he is, decides that nah, he hasn't done a good thing yet and he's not gonna start now.So, he shoots Goku in the back. But this fails and Goku gets rid of him with a Kamehameha.

The background where she is free to ignore there is no evidence an assault weapons ban will promote public safety, because she operated in a circuit court that never asked her to give even a flimsy justification for her policy and to this day is pulling the brakes as much as possible to avoid applying Heller in good faith or Bruen. Someone who can smoke marijuana and then go on to prosecute others for the same because she believes in selectively enforced prohibition. Someone who championed funding states that implement measures which circumvent due process by imposing definite sentences completely abrogating an enumerated right as a mere civil order.

Someone who claimed a home invader would be shot, despite that she signed an amicus brief in Heller suggesting Americans don't and shouldn't have the right to keep and bear firearms in defense of their home. Through Harris eyes, her countrymen are police and prosecution, or cockroaches who don't deserve the human right to effectively defend their own lives.

That said, Elon has also been saying some weird things in public recently about how if Trump doesn't win he's going to be arrested. He also went from supporting Ukraine and being relatively politically neutral to criticizing US policy on Ukraine and aggressively supporting Trump in a very short time, which is unusual. Not proof of wrong-doing, but definitely odd. 2.  WSJ is considered one of the more factual news outlets. They aren't perfect, but they are pretty good, and they are not left-wing media by any means. 3.  Anonymous sources are a critical part of journalism and demanding that all sources be identified would mean that a lot of news would simply never see daylight, and we would have even less transparency than we do already.

That said, I am not a legal expert on treason law, so I don't know if that is a requirement, or if Russia would meet the specific requirement. My understanding is that Russia is considered a hostile country and that we have heavily sanctioned them as a result, but beyond that I would need to defer to experts on this topic.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk has most likely committed treason"},{"text":"The preponderance of evidence standard still requires actual evidence.
