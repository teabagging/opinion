Inevitably, the remaining provinces would join. Since Quebec controls a large swath of the St. Lawrence Seaway and overland trucking through Canada from Maritimes to Ontario, it created a situation where Atlantic Canada had no alternative.

I think many Americans also believe this to be true and wed be doing a disservice by not changing the system.

A few points in response 1. Every group of people has similarity bias, not just Indians. I dont think thats a fair point to discriminate against one race \\n2. Caste system discrimination is practiced by a few bad apples, and generalizing that to all Indians is again not fair. This should be handled by corporate politics and through HR, not by the government discriminating against Indians \\n3. At least for Indians, the ones who immigrate as students have to pass an English proficiency exam called TOEFL. Part of a merit based process for green cards can raise the bar on English proficiency too. I agree this should be required and is valuable for assimilation. I dont know how the Canadian process works but I imagine its not just students who are immigrating and causing the sentiment, its more blue collar workers. Sorry if Im making an incorrect assumption, feel free to correct me if Im wrong\\n4. This point isnt related to country caps and applies to all new immigrants. I dont know how fully true this is but you can try to stamp this out through a more rigorous process and country caps is not the way. It just assumes higher assimilation by country \\nI also think the concentration of Indians in Canada  is much higher than the USA so theres going to be more sentiment.

This amendment achieves that end:The Senate of the United States shall be composed of three Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years, with a power reserved to a two-thirds majority of each legislature to recall its Senators, or any of them; and each State shall have one vote except in trials of impeachment when each Senator shall have one vote.

Kaplan had made multiple decisions that spoiled the trial, including his decision to allow two other women who had accused Trump of sexually abusing them to testify.\\"To recap:  The $5 million jury award was from the 1st trial. The additional $83.3 million was from a 2nd trial because Trump refused to stop defaming Carroll after having been ordered by the court to cease doing so.","title":"Appeals court upholds $5 million award in sexual abuse verdict against President-elect Donald Trump"},{"text":"You forgot Lockheed","title":"The White House has announced an enormous $2.5 billion dollars aid package to Ukraine today."},{"text":"A wall isnt needed.

They are heavily laying off a lot of other functions like hr/dei, various community and marketing type roles, excessive management that used to be engineering talent like software engineering managers or technical project managers and those have to go through the internal process to decide to take the engineering jobs again (which are a lot more work). They also are firing a lot of people who just dont perform or quiet quit remote. Just as there are 10x engineers, the pandemic and WFM created a larger group of never do anything play video games or take care of kids and pretend to WFM 0.1x engineers. Yeah sometimes its good mid career and early career engineers getting laid off. But a lot of it was just bloat that came from the no consequences world of cheap fed money. I do not think someone who is good and has a couple years of experience as a software engineer is still having much trouble. People I know who arent are, and people who arent in engineering are. As an example, Elon laid off over 75% of Twitter when he took it over. What he focused on keeping was high performing engineers. Also, perhaps half or more of people with cs degrees arent particularly good software developers and never will be. Even from very good programs, some people just cant code well. Its a strange field in that way. Need very strong general cognitive capability and the right work ethic and approach. Getting into a program doesnt give you those things. We do have a lot of people with cs degrees who arent useful as software developers (but usually are useful for roles that arent software developers like other IT roles which are typically lower paid but also high paid compared to most jobs). Labor market conditions are job specific. We probably need more engineers that deeply understand AI. We dont need more DEI programs apparatchiks who can for example ensure that all 190 LGBTQ+ days are correctly celebrated on the Facebook campus and make version 500 of the training materials to help you check your privilege. Those are all tech workers. And I bet some of those were on h1b.Lastly, keep in mind we are at low unemployment vs historic levels. This isnt 2009 or 1980.

They know that being homeless in the us is better than living in South America. For example, mexican immigrants can send money back to relatives in Mexico even though they make less than minimum wage. So, the rest of the alliance tolerates this. Democratic leaders know that sanctuary city status is not popular, but they don't leave that up for popular vote, because they know it will get repealed.","title":"Progressives Say GOP's H-1B Visa Feud Distracts From Real Problem: 'Billionaire Robber Barons'"},{"text":"Hopes and prayers","title":"Appeals court rejects Trump's attempt to overturn E.

I base my values on morality, you base your values on freedom. As George Washington said: Religion and morality are the essential pillars of civil society.Not only are drug laws unconstitutional but they run afoul of the very ideas this country was founded on.Our country was founded on FREEDOM and MORALITY. Not just freedom, not just morality. Communists base there entire system on morality. You base your entire system on freedom. I base my system on both.You need permission from strangers to remodel your bathroom, and then those strangers claim a right to enter your home to see if they approve of your remodeling job! And then you have to PAY them for it! We've become slaves!I totally agree. The government has grabbed way to much power, but only because we've let it. And as John Adams said: We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion...Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.Communists believe that property ownership is immoral. Are you sure you want to go with morality as your basis for law?Communists base there morality on there own subjective beliefs. If you're going to base your system on morality, you need an objective morality to base it on.The government was never meant to be Santa Clause that gives you a society with the moral preferences you prefer.That's not what I'm saying.

Jean Carroll won against Donald Trump when a jury found the U.S. president-elect liable for sexually abusing and later defaming the former magazine columnist. The decision was issued by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. The May 2023 verdict stemmed from an incident around 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan, where Carroll said Trump raped her, and an October 2022 Truth Social post where Trump denied Carroll's claim as a hoax. Though jurors in federal court in Manhattan did not find that Trump committed rape, they awarded the former Elle magazine advice columnist $2.02 million for sexual assault and $2.98 million for defamation. A different jury ordered Trump in January to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her and damaging her reputation in June 2019, when he first denied her rape claim. In both denials, Trump said he did not know Carroll, she was \\"not my type,\\" and that she fabricated the rape claim to promote her memoir. He is appealing the $83.3 million verdict. Carroll's cases are continuing despite Trump's having won a second four-year White House term on Nov. 5. Trump's lawyers argued the $5 million verdict should be thrown out because the trial judge should not have let jurors hear testimony from two other women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct.","title":"Trump loses appeal of E.

Considering how Greece and Turkey have been at each other's throats for decades, that's probably a good thing. That said, Greenland is also a European Union territory and while the EU's GDP has been somewhat reduced by us leaving, it's still packing enough economic clout to make things uncomfortable for the United States if they so chose. Obviously, trade wars hurt everyone involved and can only benefit our global competitors, but then again that's never held Trump back before. I doubt the EU would want to go down that route unless they really can't avoid it, but I cannot see any scenario in which either Denmark or the EU as a whole would cede Greenland. The most ridiculous thing about the Greenland situation in particular is that good old fashioned diplomatic and trade talks could really easily resolve everything Trump wants. If US firms want access to Greenland's mineral resources, I would imagine the Greenland government would happily sit down and discuss terms. If the US wants to expand its strategic footprint, again, I suppose it's just a matter of hammering out the compensation. The US has been running what used to be Thule Air Base (and now is [Pituffik *Space* Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituffik_Space_Base), because of course it is) since 1940. Greenland is a big place. I'm sure they can find more space for the US military to set up installations.

We have multi tiered school systems where otherwise bright students fall through the cracks based on a whole host of factors. In the working world, plenty of employees fall through the cracks as well. Example: millions of women had to drop out of the workforce during the pandemic. Were havent totally recovered even now. That was probably more of a drain on top talent than any visa could fix. How are we enticing these women back into the workforce?In corporate America, there is a lot of cronyism that also disadvantages bright people with great ideas because another person is more part of the club than the intelligent person who gets better results. I dont know that a visa is solving that problem. Also what defines top talent? Is it degrees? An H1B visa only requires a bachelors, that isnt any different than the average American. Is it test scores? A good score in school doesnt necessarily translate to being flexible or creatively thinking, which is something that America (despite its educational difficulties) does better than Asia. Our strength is creativity, its why we are successful. A great GMAT score (for example) isnt indicative of that.Is it the entrepreneurial spirit? Immigrants are great at being entrepreneurial, but an H1B visa doesnt help with that when they require sponsorship from a company. Basically, what are the goals of this country and how does this system fit in with this? Shouldnt we look to sealing up the cracks and helping Americans reach their potential first? I am all for immigration across the board. Ive worked with immigrants for my entire working life. Most are hard working and amazingly strong people. It takes a lot of courage to come to a new country and a new culture and I admire that. But we need to make sure we are making the best decisions for this country.

They were raiding schools, court houses, hospitals. Under Trump they expanded the jurisdiction of ICE to 100 miles from the border and they enlisted the aid of local police - adding to the responsibility of cops more things police werent trained to do. To date, expedited removal has been exercised only for aliens encountered within 100 air miles of the border and 14 days of entry, and aliens who arrived in the United States by sea other than at a port of entry, the agency states.The action also seeks to expand a police-based immigration enforcement program known as 287(g), which allows local and state officers to perform immigration duties if they undergo the requisite training. The program fell out of favor under the Obama administration after Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced in 2012 that it wouldnt renew contracts that were in place at the time.https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/21/dhs-directs-border-patrol-ice-immediately-expand-deportation-efforts/Empowering state and local law enforcement agencies to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law is critical to an effective enforcement strategy, and CBP and ICE will work with interested and eligible jurisdictions, the memo reads.

And if the public one day turns against those rights, the state has the obligation to use force to defend the liberal democratic order from the people.And there we see the problem. There is no institution on earth so strong that it can stop the will of the people from overturning the liberal democratic order. A lot of analysis has focused on structural factors like institutions, but there is surprisingly little that focuses on the foundation for all those institutions: the civic culture.And the truth is that American civic culture is in terrible shape. Maybe it has gotten worse, or maybe has been bad for a long time. We can debate the causes and the details, but it is very clear that there is a significant section of American society which does not hold allegiance to the values supposedly embodied by the United States. They might believe they are still loyal, but their actions and their views, as seen with polling like this, demonstrate otherwise.A liberal democracy cannot simply declare that the cultural sphere is outside of its zone of concern. It cannot simply declare neutrality on what is the foundation of society. To do that is to allow antidemocratic and anti-liberal sentiment to metastasise into a movement that may some day bring about the destruction of the liberal democracy. The use of force to uphold the republic might be an antidote to reactionary swells, but prevention is better than a cure.I am not advocating for massive censorship of the kind usually favoured by those that mention the paradox of tolerance. Instead, I am asking for the liberal state to become an active promoter of republican virtue in every aspect of the culture. From a young age, citizens must be steeped in a liberal democratic culture that permeates society. Every effort must be taken to ensure that the people produced by American society do not support the xenophobic and reactionary barbarism so prevalent in the America of today.","title":"Nearly half of GOP voters want military to put immigrants in camps"},{"text":"The dementia just keeps getting worse","title":"Biden regrets leaving presidential race, thinks he couldve beaten Trump"},{"text":"Your thinking too hard trying to explain his actions.

He was speaking about how it was stupid that the EU had to rely on Germany for tank production and things of that nature. That if something happened the EU shouldn't be reliant on Germany being in their side because they had to provide the vehicles. I asked how much would it cost the other European nations to do it on their own. Design the tanks. Get the factories prepared to build those tanks for the first time in war time, and then still be completely behind on design and production efficiency. So that is too expensive. They license the design instead. They still need to build their own factories to build the machines and currently there is no demand for that. So the factories are retooled towards commercial goods in the meantime, but if something were to kick off it would take time to get everything retooled and the people retrained. Or since Germany has that capability and the designs already, just buy from them while they can. Otherwise the first tank they produce would cost billions instead of the cost that Germany offers from their established military industrial complex. And who would benefit in such a hypothetical where everyone in Europe did what this guy wanted. Russia. They asked he how they could be so wrong, not in a sensitive bind of way, and I responded that they haven't actually thought about the logistics and infrastructure required for that kind of war. Plus I have seen Hearts of Iron played enough to know that a nation like Belgium wouldn't be able to have the manpower to both fight and develop the weapons for war. If you are building up your mechanized weaponry then you need to have the factories and design already there. If you have to go from square one you will be locked into only being able to afford the most basic of designs and if you develop something new it takes time for production efficiency to build and be able to produce the new weapon at the same rate as the old weapon and you have to be thinking of keeping the soldiers supplied with something, and you may end up sticking with the old design because otherwise your soldiers will have nothing.

Militias are good for defensive wars but not in offensive wars. It would'nt've worked in WW2.Dude, just listen to yourself. You sound like a neocon. The only legitimate violence is defensive violence.\\\\I think what is criminal should be based on morality.Communists believe that property ownership is immoral. Are you sure you want to go with morality as your basis for law? You undermine yourself at every turn.\\\\Are drug laws, taxes, and conscriptions rights violations? Probably. Are they moral? It's debatable. I'm personally undecided on drugs and conscriptions.What is debatable about it? Even the Declaration of Independence states that men institute governments to secure *their rights,* not their arbitrary moral preferences. It also says that when governments are injurious to their *rights* they have a right to change it or *abolish* it. We've been changing the government for hundreds of years now, and look where we're at. You need permission from strangers to remodel your bathroom, and then those strangers claim a right to enter your home to see if they approve of your remodeling job! And then you have to PAY them for it! We've become slaves!  \\nThe government was never meant to be Santa Clause that gives you a society with the moral preferences you prefer. You have every right to form that society and to reject those want different moral preferences through peaceful means such as the Amish method of shunning, for example, but you have no right to use violence to force anyone to comply with your preferences, like for example, radical Muslims do.Not only are drug laws unconstitutional but they run afoul of the very ideas this country was founded on. You should read Lysander Spooner's essay *Vices Are Not Crimes, a Vindication.* In it he explains what actual crimes are and demonstrates that vices (including drug use) do not meet the definition of crimes.  \\nThis is why I consider people who think like you to be socialists (to me your 'wing' doesn't matter except for some technical details). You place collective rights above individual rights, and then you call it morality. Rights (as in natural, individual rights) are a doctrine of what constitutes self-defense. I.e. it is justifiable to use violence to stop someone from taking your life or otherwise physically harming you, or preventing you from making decisions for yourself, or to the use of your property. In order to enjoy rights you must have moral agency, which is the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and collectives such as nations or classes or societies are just abstractions - categorizations that we sort people into. Abstractions have no moral agency because they are just mental constructs and are in-and-of-themselves incapable of any thought, much less the ability to distinguish right from wrong. The idea of collective rights is incoherent and can only be destructive to natural individual rights. And the upholding of individual rights is the very thing that the government was founded to do.Drug laws are a form of central planning not different than that of the Commissars of Soviet Russia, and it has been proven time and again that central planning, whether it is of the economy or of a society, is impossible to do successfully. Free markets in economics and social preferences is the only way to satisfy the rights and wants of individuals.  \\\\And if the government was as small as it used to be, we wouldn't need taxes, tariffs would pay for it.  \\nTariffs are taxes, too. It is the people of a jurisdiction being forced to pay more for products which is then paid to the government. Once again it is a violation of individuals' rights to their property just as much as robbing a bank is.","title":"What is your opinion on Paleo-Conservatives?"},{"text":"https://www.geni.com/path/George-Washington-1st-President-of-the-USA%20is%20related%20to%20Donald-J-Trump-45th-President-of-the-USA?from=6000000008211776777&amp;to=6000000007106626344trump is related to washington?","title":"Update to all presidents being related and descending from one English King.

After doing so I decided to make a second post on this topic as an update to what I found. Also, I mention Genghis Kahn as an example because him and his family tree share extensive similarities to how vast they have become, not the way they were conceived. Its important to recognize that Genghis Kahns genetic legacy is far more widespread simply because of the size and scope of the mongol empire at the time compared to King John who would only oversee England and some parts of France and reportedly only had five legitimate children.

It's leading to Indian immigrants not feeling the need to integrate into Canada and only sticking to other Indian immigrants. This causes problems like:1) Some workplaces who have Indian managers will only hire other Indian immigrants, pushing out non-Indian employees  \\n2) Caste system discrimination  \\n3) Linguistic isolation if you're in a group of people who all speak a different language than you  \\n4) New immigrants are less likely to learn unwritten social etiquette or the \\"Canadian\\" ways. These things are what make Canada great. To be clear, I don't support racism against Indians. But I do think ethnic diversity will help Canada. Right now, it feels like Canada is an atomized society, divided along ethnic lines.","title":"CMV: Green card country caps are outdated and should switch to a meritocratic system"},{"text":"Why are we debating this topic?Elon and the other cronies will get what they want regarding the Visa system.

If you are on an H-1B and your employer fires you, you have 60 days to get another sponsor or your visa will expire. Meanwhile, interviews for a tech company are usually multiple rounds and can take months, so if they don't find a sponsor immediately it's over. This means that it places employers in a place of immense power over those individuals. The positions that typically use H-1B visas are also almost always salaried and overtime exempt. They can have them work 20-40 hours of unpaid overtime, with on-call expectations, and they have to do it or they face deportation.I'll also address what you said about pay rates, which is a convenient lie for most of the industry. Legally, yes, they need to be paid the same as an American. Practically, this often does not happen for several reasons. Foremost is that it isn't enforced. There are a bunch of consulting agencies (Known as the WITCH companies) that exclusively attempt to hire H-1B workers at the lowest wage they can and then rent them out to tech companies as contractors. Outside of those instances, there are also employers that will post a job with absurd requirements and low pay. When they don't find candidates they will claim they need an H-1B visa to fill the position. In that case, they would have paid an American the same, but they were offering the job with a salary an American wouldn't accept to begin with.","title":"Progressives Say GOP's H-1B Visa Feud Distracts From Real Problem: 'Billionaire Robber Barons'"},{"text":"my work is paying for my school this time around and the field im in is much more likely to churn out a well-paying job than my first pick.

Liers were more punished when they were discovered when right now, it is'nt such a sensitive issue.  As you pointed out, diverse perspectives have always existed, but in general, we held the public expression of opinions to a certain standard of (false, pretending) objectivity. One of the criteria of that objectivity is how easy it is to verify statements. Many politicians rely on statements regarding complex situations where 1. it takes time to disprove or 2. there are no right or wrong answers but moral choices at the root. Donald Trump embodies the new situation, where he can literally declares so many gigantic and easy to disprove lies, but faces no consequences from it.

Even the clinical studies did not support the claim that opioids were not addictive. Neither experts, nor their work, informed the decision process at the FDA. The FDA based their decisions on the testimony of pharma executives and lobbyists, not experts. A family doctor is an expert on common symptoms and what to do about them. Unless they have a specific interest in medical research (for example, an Md-PhD in a relevant field, or a passion for drug research), they are not trained nor have the time to evaluate new drugs or new drug studies. They tend to follow FDA guidance. Id say a doctor that has prescribed a specific drug many times and seen the effect on patients then becomes an expert on that drug later, after the fact. Many of the first voices that started to speak out against opioids were indeed doctors. In defense of doctors though, I think it would still be hard to claim that if we had replaced doctors with people with even less expertise than them, that the opioid crisis could have any been better! Yet as a society the end result is that we trust medical science less, and instead embrace random statements without evidence, which is arguably worseI think your example illuminates well why the public  can be led to distrust expertise, but I dont feel that this outcome is fair to either experts of doctors. And unfortunately, when experts get discredited, charlatans (like say, Purdue Pharma) become even more powerful.","title":"CMV: The post-truth era will usher in a new dark age if we don't stand up for evidence and compassion."},{"text":"This is gonna shock you.

They work on vaccines early because by the time you *know* it's a rare exception, it's too late. It takes literally months of research. They don't roll out millions of doses until they see something has actually transmitted to humans and is taking off in the population. It does cost a lot of money, but when a disease has a possible 50-60% mortality rate in humans, it's worth moving on it early. Anything past 25% in a highly communicable disease that makes people unable to carry out their duties for 10-14 days, and you'll quickly lose too many workers for businesses to function. That includes first responders and medical personnel because they're exposed first, then utility workers including water, power and sanitation, food production workers, transport workers... I'd rather they work on a vaccine as soon as possible. That's why for some types of diseases they start early and spend more. For all the sadness of the people who were lost and those who were disabled by it, we got lucky with Covid-19. It mutated enough it had nowhere near the impact of the 1918 flu epidemic. H5N1 seems to be enough of a variant it could turn out the same.I wish everyone who opposed this fast tracking would actually study the 1918 flu outbreak, particularly how contagious it was and how fast it killed.

And then you had UNIVAC, the first commercial computer. Then America invented the semiconductor, and you had the birth of Intel. Then we invented the Internet. And thats just the cliffnotes, because there are so many landmark innovations in tech pioneered by Americans.Almost all major tech companies had very humble origins. Apple started in a garage. Microsoft in a seedy motel. The Cisco founders initially ran their business out of their living room, where they hand built routers. Facebook, of course, started in a dorm room, as did Yahoo.By the 90s when you arrived, and when H1B visas came into existence, America had long been dominant in tech. And we kept that dominance the way we always have, by fostering a risk-taking entrepreneurial culture. The attitude that you can start small and conquer the world, and a determination to follow  your dreams even when people call you crazy.The other countries you compare America to did not have that culture.

If the Supreme Court decided that his executive order was official business, then he would be immune from prosecution. However, would issuing a blandly unconstitutional executive order be considered to be official business? Personally, it should not be, but I guess with this Court you never know. Regardless, the executive order would remain null and void, because it exceeded the Presidents authority.The same logic should apply to an executive order ending birthright citizenship.

The breakdown of social contract between employers and employees means that a company that trains an entry level employee will lose out to a competitor who saves on the cost of training and so has the money to pay more to poach the same employee that the 1st company used valuable resources to train. Sure some people stay a while with the original company, but most don't. So it creates a negative feedback loop.

The aggressive tone of debates is partly a reflection of a deeply divided political climate, driven as much by social media algorithms and partisan media as by any individual politician. Trumps no-filter style resonated with millions precisely because it rejected the perceived elitism and insincerity of traditional politics, which many Americans had grown disillusioned with. To blame Trump exclusively for the breakdown of families and friendships overlooks the personal responsibility of individuals in fostering respectful discourse and the role of opposition rhetoric in escalating tensions.Second, the claim of cultish behavior around Trump is hyperbolic and overlooks how political enthusiasm manifests across the spectrum. Obama had supporters crying at rallies, and Bernie Sanders inspired fervent devotion from his base. Trumps supporters express loyalty because they feel he represents their values and fights against what they see as institutional corruption and bias. Patriotism takes many forms, and the flags, tattoos, and displays are expressions of that passionnot blind worship. The accusation that Trump supporters would choose his flag over the American one is an unfounded stereotype meant to delegitimize their perspective.Your criticisms rely heavily on generalizations that ignore larger societal dynamics, overstate Trumps influence, and unfairly demonize his supporters while dismissing their legitimate grievances and values.","title":"What Can You Tell From My Ranking Of Republican Presidents?"},{"text":"That said if thats what goes down, theres a good chance Trump carks it in those 4 years","title":"GOP \\"playing with fire\\" if Johnson removed as speaker, Rep.

I'm not saying Trump is all these horrible things, but he's led directly to the following:\\n Debates becoming more vicious and intolerable. Listen, in 2016 during the primaries, it was fun. But now, people are shocked when presidential candidates are being respectful in debates. That is all his fault. He has ruined the debate platform and that has also indirectly led to more division because his supporters begin frothing at the mouth with insults the second someone points out his flaws. He has fucked up this nations ability to have a conversation. In 2000, Gore and Bush voters were family, in 2008, Obama and McCain voters were friends. Donald Trump has fucked up families, friendships and more due to what he does. And most of his supporters will say \\"snowflake\\", but it's not because people are offended. Donald Trump's no filter speeches have done nothing but shown his dick riders that they can be intolerable and vehemently rude and get away with it because everyone else is sensitive.\\nAlso, I know this is a left wing thing to say, but Donald Trump has made politics cultish. Even Reagan, who literally won every state except for Minnesota, didn't have people tattooing him on their body or basically whoring out their truck with flags. You can call it patriotism, but these guys worship him more than the American flag. If you stuck a Trump flag and an American flag in front of a Trump supporter, and told them to pick, they'd call the American flag woke left wing libtard propaganda and have it burned.

Only if you make below than 27.3k GBP are you not obligated to pay anything...but the debt is still there and it is still accumulating interest. You just don't have anything taken out of your paycheck. You start making payments when you start making more than 27.3k.On one side of the spectrum, there are going to be people who will never make enough to make paying it off worth it. On the other side, there are people who will be able to pay it off sooner rather than later.Then there are people who in neither of those situations. I think there will be a lot of people who won't be able to pay it off before 30 years but will end up paying substantially more than the loan amount because of interest.
