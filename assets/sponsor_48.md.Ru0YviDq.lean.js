When most people had been doing 30-40 tasks a day, this average suddenly dropped to around 10-15.

Being further left doesnt mean one is more liberal. It ultimately depending on the individuals views usually comes down to how one arranges the state economically, if someone is more oriented toward the collective and the working class or focuses on individualism, the chips falling as they may as for how much power, property, money someone has. As a leftist or democratic socialist or whatever label I could put on myself, I believe that at the end of the day, in the grand scheme, the two major parties are nominally different in the regard of at all. Henry Wallace in the 1940s, Eugene Debs, Bernie Sandersall these types as well as civil rights leaders who espoused similar views on a grander stage have been repeatedly gilted by republican and democratic forces forever. The powerful stay in power, the liberal world order where a system favors the wealthy and the corporation via capitalism is not being regulated to enough of a degree to shift the scales in the working class favor. Thus our frustration with centrists and liberals who throw their hands up and just give their votes freely due to fear of the alternative without making their politicians work for it. Notice how Kamala is starting to appeal to the center right with some of the positions she has taken lately. Is it optics during an election season? Will she abandon the right and move left if she wins? Maybe? But she could just as easily promise the left things and move right after the election like Biden did. Im not saying the common registered voter thinks this way.

This is a reason I could never support Trump no matter his policies, he clearly cares nothing for integrity. Your second paragraph seems to be you questioning this stance and I am unsure why. Perhaps I am misreading it, but '16s result seems pretty clear.  Large, disaffected electorate (and the seeds for many of our grievances have been planted for many years, not blaming Obama) taken by storm by a demagogue.  Following a very contentious (perhaps too contentious) D primary that not only highlighted reasons why Clinton shouldn't be the nominee, but also had a tad bit of corruption inside the D party.  That played into the narrative Trump had been spouting since he announced.  Ds had the presidency for eight years by then.  It is pretty rare for a party to hold the presidency beyond a two-term president, it shouldn't have been a surprise that they would lose the White House.  In 2020, the country was in an unprecedented situation and incumbency is a powerful thing, so it is noteworthy that Biden won, no matter how close.I think candidate couch's biggest appeal is that the Ds are in a bad position.  You can tout your policies, but if I don't care for them, you throw out the \\"but how could you vote for Trump?\\"  If I vote for Harris, it will be seen as consent for the policies I don't care for.

Retailers run on the need for sales metrics to increase year over year. Most have a baseline of 3% growth annually.

That would equal $3,650 to $4,300 for both tariffs, which aligns with Harris statement.The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a Washington D.C.-based think tank, projected that the 10% and 60% tariffs would collectively lower average after-tax incomes of U.S. households by about $1,800. Thats 55% less than what Harris said.The liberal group Center for American Progress Action came up with a $3,900 figure, which is close to what Harris said. However, this estimate is based on a 20% tariff, which is on the high end of what Trump said Aug. 14 in Asheville, North Carolina  that he was considering a \\"10 and 20 percent\\" across-the-board tariff, rather than 10%.The Peterson Institute of International Economics, another Washington, D.C.-based think tank, initially projected that the 10% and 60% tariffs would cost a middle-income household about $1,700 extra each year.

He grew up in a time of extreme racism and enforced segregation. This segregation was enforced by both of the political parties in the states.He would have seen Jackie Robinson being the first black baseball player to break the colour line in baseball, seen Joe Louis become the first black heavyweight boxer to be allowed to fight for the title in the USA (boxers used to be able to draw the \\"colour line\\" which prevented black boxers from fighting white champions. The previous and first black boxer to be heavyweight champion (Jack Johnson) had to fight for the title in Australia).He would surely have heard about the black wall street massacre, have known about the actions inspired by Rosa Parks, and most importantly, he died only a year after the Civil Rights Act was passed.From his prism of experience, both sides were as bad as each other because they both protected white people first. It's no surprise that he thought that the only way black people could achieve self determination was to separate completely from white people.Liberals in 2024 are very different. Many white liberals accept that black people are institutionally disadvantaged in the USA and they find that to be unfair. They have already voted for a black president on two occasions and could possibly vote for a female black president soon. I'm sure Malcolm X would never have expected that America would have a black president based on his experiences.Of course, there are some liberals of whom Malcolm X's assessment would still be correct, but when talking about so many people who are defined as liberal, it better to talk in generalisations and in general the application of Malcolm X's assessment of liberals to liberals today is inaccurate.What's also important is that his views changed after converting to Sunni islam. When he went on his pilgrimage, he saw Muslims of all races and colours together \\"interacting as equals\\". Had he not been assassinated, it's quite possible that his rhetoric would no longer have been \\"black Vs white\\".TLDR: Malcolm X may well have been correct about American liberals in his time period, but that doesn't mean he's still correct today.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"Fuck the Post, and fuck the right-wing election-denier that dropped this article here.\\nNothing to see here, folks.

In his own words, the liberals do so in order to gain power or retain power. I always think this argument is a little bit funny because if liberals were really just using blacks to gain and retain power then why in the world would we elect Barack Obama or Kamala Harris? If this all was a power grab for white liberals, then we shouldn't be letting these people of color anywhere near the levers of power. And yet here we are. Watch in November as tens of millions vote for Kamala Harris, with the majority being white people. Whether the democratic option is a good choice or matches your policies than you are aligned with fascism or dont care about women/whichever other vulnerable demographic they can use as a card. This is manipulative and is reflective of Malcolms argument.As a woman whose guaranteed rights of privacy and access to healthcare were sacrificed in the dobb's decision, I very strongly do not see myself or my interests as a \\"card.\\" I do think it was extremely naive of the Democrats to think that Roe could never be overturned, but once that realization was made, they've been doing good. Especially, on the state level. I live in Colorado where even late term abortion is protected. The Democrats are trying to add it as a constitutional right at the state level this November. I guarantee you it will pass. We also elected the first gay Governor, Jared polis. I see the Colorado state legislature and Jared polis sign all kinds of bills that do quite a lot to protect minorities. For example, not too long ago they wrote it into law that state schools had to allow native Americans to wear religious symbols (like sacred feathers) while graduating. And they did it with absolutely zero fanfare. I just happened to notice it because I was going through the back pages of the local paper and it didn't even say that this was a Democratic initiative. I looked it up because I was curious. How did that bill serve the Democrats interest to obtain and retain power? It didn't. It was just a simple gesture that acknowledged the dignity of native peoples. Sure. You could say that this was a low stakes situation but it was hardly an attempt at manipulation if nobody knew who the authors were. Also, aren't there a number of native Americans that are in high levels in the Democratic party and in government? Definitely more than the Republicans. Do we have a lot further to go? Absolutely. But to say that there is a false promise being made about integration is a stretch at this point. We're integrating quite actively. I have no doubts that there was a false promise back in the day. I'm also fairly certain that you could find a smarmy Democrat politician or two who only pay lip service. But when push comes to shove, the Democrats are the ones who try. Their primary roadblock is quite definitively the Republicans who vote against everything Democrats want no matter what it is. If we actually had reasonable moderates to work with, I feel like we could accomplish quite a lot. But the structure of our political system is not helpful when one party has decided to completely stop governing. And make no mistake, if the Republicans can take my rights away then they would be absolutely delighted to take yours too. The Democrats are far from perfect but they know they need us. Hell, they *are* us. So they will do what they can with the power we give them. Though, a swift kick in the pants will be needed periodically. Thus is the nature of American politics.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"If someone wants to ask them, whatever, but most people actually have standards for journalists they watch and they want real and honest questions, not just clickbait soundbites","title":"Fox News Bret Baier Defends Combative Kamala Harris Interview, Would Love to Have Her on Again"},{"text":"Its also possible to change your mind based on new information.","title":"Jill Biden says it was the right call for her husband to drop out of 2024 campaign"},{"text":"For bigger stuff, yeah.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian losses are going to be much higher and will be a demographic catastrophe.It's the State Department that's pretty much directing this, and then Congress. It's the tail wagging the dog. Congress is the dog, right, and the State Department believes that war is a tool of statecraft, or diplomacy, that they're going to use war for diplomacy, and they don't want Congress to get in the way. So once it gets started, we're supposed to just open the pocketbooks and let the money flow. And they're afraid if we got any bit of bad news about how the war was going, that there would be a reluctance from Congress to keep funding it, or push for an ending. Well I often disagree with the Congressman, but at least he is asking the hard questions about Ukraine. To his credit, he has asked hard questions about Israel and other foreogn policy issues as well.","title":"Tom Massie: Washington purposely blacking out Ukraine casualty data | In a Q&amp;A with RS, the Kentucky lawmaker explains why he is demanding hard numbers"},{"text":"I'm supporting policies not your kooch.","title":"Kamala Harris Suggests Men Are Misogynist if They Do Not Support Her"},{"text":"Who?","title":"Gerald Fords daughter endorses Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"At the time of those comments, Malcom X's goals were not black and white Equality.It was Black separatism.Of course White Liberals are opposed to Black separatism.

If it's more cost effective to work from home, and certain people can't do that, then I'm with you and your boss. Do what works for you and let them go.But what works for your Boss, and the company you work for, doesn't mean it makes sense in all situations. Different offices are different. Some places of employment depend on entry-level workers, who have never had a 9:00 to 5:00 job before, others don't. Some offices, everyone in the office has a very specific job, that has a very specific time limit allotted. Others are more communicative and collaborative, without strict deadlines.In the time it takes me to open up my email, type it up and hit send, I could have walked an office over asked and had my questions answered, and gotten back to work, instead of having to wait for a response which could be minutes or could be an hour.You can see when one of your coworkers is busy or not with something more important in the office, not so much at home.Communicating verbally is faster than text ileven in real time typically. At the office you don't need to set up a time for video call. At lunch time, coworkers might be gaining friendships, which is a good thing for the employer. It gives people a reason to want to stay at the job, to maintain those friendships. One of the benefits of working in certain places is the social aspect. Work from home essentially negates that. For the person with a husband or wife and two kids at home, that social aspect is less important. However, for those who are looking for friends or significant others, that social aspect can be important, and can therefore be a reason that the person wants to stay there at the company.It can be a matter of babysitting for some people, but for many people it's not supervision in that the boss needs to come by every half hour on the dot to make sure everyone is doing their work. It's more like some people work better under pressure and being in the same area as your boss is pressure. Like some athletes play better under pressure, and some athletes crumble under pressure. In a perfect world you'd want the guy who is dominant in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and in the middle. But in reality that's not always the case, sometimes you can't always find the guy who can do it all in all scenarios.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Is that a schism along racial lines?

The Dems basically conceded to the Republicans on economic issues (aka the issues that affect the working class most acutely) and from that point on the main difference between the two parties was their disagreement on a few specific issues- abortion, gay marriage, guns, etc.?After decades of short-sighted neoliberal policies that completely gutted the middle class and shot wealth inequality through the roof to levels unseen since the Gilded Age, much of the American working class is thoroughly disenfranchised and (rightfully) resentful of the system thats made their lives materially worse over the years. ? ? Republicans have been *extremely* effective at using this built-up collective resentment to their own advantage, while Democrats have largely been content to stay the course set by Clinton 30 years ago despite the fact that its becoming increasingly unsustainable.?Now, the Republicans arent actually any *better* for the working class than the Democrats, and in many ways are actively worse- both parties will ultimately choose to support the interests of the rich over those of the working class every time- but Republicans at least *acknowledge* that things are shit. If youre a working class person whos been utterly screwed over by the system and your choice is between two parties who wont actually help you in a way that matters, its probably going to be tempting to pick the party that at least *validates* your anger, however insincerely, rather than the one that views you as a simple bumpkin with a bad attitude.?Thats why there were so many people who were excited for both Trump *and* Bernie- not because their views or policies are similar in any meaningful way, but because they both tapped into the populist sentiment thats been simmering among huge swathes of the working class for years now.

Thanks for such a detailed response. I am British but I've travelled Iran extensively and love the country. my main interest tho is that my best friend works for BP and I like giving him a hard time.?\\nSo there are three interesting claims here. Iran wanted to change the deal later so it must have been a bad deal. Iran deal was bad compared to Saudi deal. And Iran workers were mistreated.?\\nThe fact that Iran wanted new terms after loads of oil was found and oil became way more valuable isn't surprising. I don't think there is an argument there.?\\nThe comparison with the Saudi deal is much more complex. Prospecting became much much cheaper at the same time that oil became much much more valuable. And the probability of oil existing in Saudi in the 1930s was much more likely because of the known prevalence of oil in the area by then. However my 'back of am envelope' calculations suggest Saudi still had a better deal at the time it was made by a significant factor even if the 16% to 50% comparison is far from a fair comparison. Id argue that doesn't make Iran exploited to any significant factor but it does mean they got a worse deal.?\\nBased on these first two points I'd consider Iran to be like a casino where UK wins the jackpot and Iran refused to let them have their winnings.?\\nThis is where I think point three is actually really interesting. The UK refusing to give decent salary and working conditions to the workers is important considering they just won the oil jackpot. Aramco did not treat their employees well in Saudi. But BP got so lucky with the terms of their deal that they had next to no excuse.?\\nWhen you put these three points together. I feel like BP should have increased the working conditions for workers far more.

Any mainstream outlet that leans hard left and supports the establishment Democrats is routinely ignored by many Americans now. Sure, some still believe the mainstream media, but enough to win a general election? Your \\"messaging\\" stops working when you get caught up in too many lies and hypocrisy. Then the endless gaslighting starts. Watching Jen Psaki, Admiral Kirby and Karine Jean Pierre go on endless gaslighting routines just drives away moderates, undecideds and independents. It's calling people stupid. It's saying \\"You are too stupid to see this obvious lie\\" That's most of what MSNBC does. Just fringe radical propaganda. An undeclared complicit arm of the DNC. Here's the most insane part of all this. When Trump actually does something truly over the line, once it's reported, now many Americans won't believe it. Because it gets lost in the endless attacks, gaslighting, lies, hypocrisy and whataboutism since 2015. The more the current establishment Democrats attack Trump ( and now Stein) in the MSM, the more people will seek out \\"independent media\\" to try to get to the truth. Or at least some balance. How do you run a major political Party when a majority of Americans won't listen to what you have to say anymore. Don't get me wrong, most of the time, Trump is a moron. He's just exhausting. Even many Republicans are tired of his shit. But pouring it on against Trump since 2015 has hit a saturation point with many working class people. I.E. \\"OK, we get it, the Orange Guy is a huge piece of shit. Everyone knows that. Now what are you going to do to help actual working class people and their children?\\" The DNC unintentionally gave Trump one of the rarest gifts in all of American history. Trump can say the most insane things now, and many Americans won't bother to listen to the left leaning outlets or will immediately assume it's another lie. And NOT because half the country are some kind of cultists. But because the lies never stop about Russiagate, FISA warrants, Hunter Biden, inflation, illegal immigration, gas prices, all this lawfare, and especially the public school lockdowns and business shut downs during the worst parts of COVID19. Having a guy arrested for being on a beach alone without a mask. Shutting down churches. Forcing vaccine mandates. Trying to get small businesses to enforce \\"vaccine proof cards\\" Now Trump can say whatever insane thing he wants and people just shake their heads and shrug their shoulders. They think it's another lie. Or they are plain tired of the MSM trying to convince them that Trump was a grifter and a moron when everyone realized that in 2015. Trump, for all his flaws, and he's often an idiot, committed the greatest troll job in recorded history. Basically the DNC, MSM and most of the establishment Democrats totally self destructed for their enraged TDS.

I can do 100% of my tasks remotely from home. I can talk to any member of the team I need to nearly on-demand with Slack and video chatting. With the ability to share a screen on video chat, you can get nearly 100% of the communication you would have if you were in an office face-to-face with someone. And while we still enjoy a great deal of flexibility, since the pandemic upper management made some pushes for us to come back to the office 3 days per week. Why? Because they just believe people work better that way, despite not providing any evidence for that belief. The part of the company where I work delivered on a major project during COVID. Everyone was fully remote and a project was completed and delivered to much success and money for the company while everyone who worked on it stayed home in quarantine. So when they pushed us back, I straight up asked what the problem was they were trying to solve. Were we missing milestones? Failing to achieve various personal assignments like continuing education? Delivering an inferior product? Nope. And they really couldn't produce an answer.

If that's true, than politicians can't actually be held accountable for their ultimate decisions.I also find it funny because that's ultimately how politics/politicians are supposed to act. They're supposed to be a representative/reflection of the popular pressure behind them. Why would you expect a politician to respond to some political situation? Just because you think it's the morally correct thing to do? They're politicians, they respond to whether they get a vote, so to get what you need done, you must be popular, you must have that pressure.The manipulation is a two way street. You can manipulate politicians into advancing laws and policies that benefit you (e.g. civil rights), and they can pretend to like you when they're obviously just after your vote.

In order for that idea to make sense, he *had* to demonize Liberals as much as Conservatives, because otherwise the unknown risks of his goal would outweigh the known risks of working with Liberals and Moderates to overcome systemic racism.Of course he later renounced these beliefs, and said he was wrong. It may be interesting to read more about him to see why (he talks about it a lot in his autobiography).For a non-appeal to authority argument, I think if you look at history it's abundantly clear that while White Liberals will certainly prevent as much racial progress as possible at times, progress *does* happen when Liberal politicians are in charge. Especially if they are in charge for an extended period and with majorities that allows them to essentially split in Moderate Left and Progressive Left.In addition, i look at the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln (mostly because I'm much more familiar with this part of US history, not because there aren't examples in other places) and see that Lincoln's moderating rhetoric was crucial to the success of the North and freeing the slaves. By drawing a line in the sand of \\"we will not hurt slavery, but will also not allow it to expand any further,\\" he set up the North to be willing to go to war at first to prevent the South from seceding over slavery, and then to have freeing the slaves as an outright goal. Has he not been so moderate, it is very possible he would have lost the election, and almost certainly he would not have been able to get enough people in the North on board with carrying out the war. The slave states would have left the Union and expanded slavery southward.To be clear, this doesn't mean don't push for more progress, doesn't mean to call out Liberals when they fall short. What it *does* mean is be productive when doing so. The eave of the election with the other side wanting literal Fascism (and let's be clear, it *will* make things worse for basically everyone you claim to care about) is *not* the time to expect radical changes. (For that matter, expecting quick change is also going to leave you disappointed. It took the first century of the US existing to free slaves, nearly another century for the Civil Rights Movement to finally win concrete victories. How long did it take women to get vote vote after Susan B Anthony? How long after that until women got more rights than that? Gay marriage was a decades long fight. History is taught as if the last push of decades or even centuries long battles was all that was needed to create massive change, but in all cases it has always moved like a slow wave. And of course if no one had been willing to act unless they were part of that final wave, then the wave would never have been large enough to change things in the first place)","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/solamon77 ([2?](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/solamon77)).^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"/u/Expert-Diver7144 (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1g91mng/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_malcolm_x_was_correct_about/), in /r/DeltaLog.Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"And remember that they pretended Obama's economy was horrible and on the verge of collapse all through 2016, and then in Feb 2017, Trump had his press secretary announce without an ounce of shame that \\"The job numbers were fake before but they are very real now.\\"So they just pretended that Trump magically turned the economy around overnight.

For an analogy, suppose the only issue on the ballot is whether to shoot a man in the head or the shoulder. Is the moral option to vote for shooting the man in the shoulder as he survives? Or is the moral option abstaining entirely as its immoral to vote to shoot someone? How does this moral scenario change if you dont believe the executioner would actually go through with shooting in the head? What if you do believe they will? Its unclear what the answers to these questions are because its up to interpretation of the individual. All this to say that reducing the enemies of progress as a leftist vs liberal, and even more specifically white liberals, is pointless as these groups of people are not really singular blocs.

This was a period of time before the civil rights laws were passed and African Americans were literally in an apartheid state. Hopefully we can agree that the civil rights in the US have improved compared to 1963, and that is due to incremental change by liberal policies and voters. It's important to remember that Malcolm X was essentially an anti-white, black nationalist during this time. The context of the statement is firmly about the struggle of black vs white and the need for a segregated black nation. But not long after this speech Malcolm X rejected his Nation of Islam identity and a lot of the beliefs he had. [https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp\\\\_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=3619](https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=3619)But perhaps you are suggesting the statement is true independent of the context. But I'm not really seeing where you are substantiating that view. And of course, the obvious point that tons of black people, women, and LGBTQ freely support the Democrat party independently of the \\"white liberal.\\" The thing is, the Democrat party is a coalition. It has both members that support Israel's actions and those who do not. To say that they are ignoring issues for political expediency is ignoring the reality of the electoral system and the fact that there is active and internal resistance with the party. The reality is that the Democrats have to have governing power before the smaller coalition of pro-Palestine advocates can get any results. Hell, there are even pro-Israel women, pro-Israel LGBTQ, etc. The fact that you are lumping them all in on one side against the \\"white liberal\\" seems to be as misguided and prejudiced as the statement you are defending. The white liberal, of which I am one, thus supports the party ticket for pragmatic reasons...recognizing that it is a small but definite step in benefit of minority interests compared to the other options. From a pragmatic point of view. Eventually you have to realize that principled stances often don't help anyone except your own personal feelings. Obviously we would like the world to change to suit our principles, but often the peaceful options for doing so are limited and the violent options are always worse. Believing harder in those principles does nothing in the real world, but pulling the levers that are available does change the real world. So to me, engaging with those limited options does not mean you are abandoning your principles, it means you are simply pulling the levers that are available, which to me is better than simply wishing for levers that don't exist yet.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"They are laying groundwork for The Big Lie 2.0.

So many people on their high horse about not voting for Kamala because of the Biden admins handling of the Gaza-israel war. And I agree its bad.

You say \\"good, hopefully that turns them off\\". But again, isn't this just \\"the high road, 2.0\\" (TM)? Without a good understanding why Trump won in '16, I am no longer willing to subscribe to classical concepts of what should help or sink a campaign. Because under traditional circumstances, neither '16 nor '20 should have been close.  \\n  \\nWhich brings us to number two. \\"The blue areas have become bluer and the red areas have become redder\\" is what I remember from some election broadcast in either 2020 or 2016. That's a question of enthusiasm - do you actually go and vote, or are you too busy, too content, too apathetic to go and to it? Does candidate couch win this year? Trump has been extremely successful there. Again, it's necessarily going to be a bit of speculation, but I do connect this strength of his with his vicious attacks on everyone \\"outside\\" - not just the \\"fake news\\" media and \\"socialist\\" democratic politicians, but his attacks on immigrants, and left \\"elite\\" universities (and their students) and so on.Now, I don't have hard facts on this, but at least in my circle the thing that drives down enthusiasm is hearing for the unpenteeths time how some dude who is still calling themselves \\"undecided\\" thinks about the two candidates. (For some reasons, it's soo many dudes with soo many bad takes, but oh no if I called them out of being sexist jerks.) At this point it very much feel like everyone undecided is a soft-repubican at heart, and the whole nation now has to tend to their personal feeling about whatever so they can grudgingly vote for Harris. It moves the conversation away from the issues we should be talking about and that are important to me, giving my peers the impression that \\"neither party really cares about me, so why would I vote for either of them?\\". Candidate couch wins this round.Mocking this whole situation, stating the (let's be honest here, obvious to us) fact that Trump cannot run on his record nor on his policies, because his record is trash and his policies are unpopular, relieves some of this dread. \\"At least I'm not the only one who feels like this is ridiculous.\\" I don't know how we would ever get good reliable data on which effect is more in practice - is it people being turned off by a feeling of \\"they are mocking me\\", or is it people turned on by a \\"hey, I can be better than this guy\\" and \\"at least I'm not alone who thinks we have collectively become crazy over the last ten years\\".  \\nNumber three - suppose it's an either-or, not an yes-and. I am human, you are human, if you can be 100% disciplined all the time then good for you, but I cannot and will not. I can either stop talking politics at all - or I can \\"spend\\" my social capital where it's most valuable and \\"recharge\\" it where it is the least harmful. Which to me is a very logical step to take.I know you purposefully left out the media in this version of the post, but I have to put something about that in here: You are currently doing the same that drives me crazy when the media does it: A democratic candidate has to be flawless, has to ace anything and everything. Trump on the other hand gets the kid's gloves and the media will sell it as a success if he did say a grammatically correct sentence.  \\nAnd for you, a democratic voter (!!) has to be always on point, always on message, avoid frustration or anything - in short, they have to be flawless. At the same time, Trump supporters can literally yell \\"Jews will not replace us\\" and nobody cares. I believe you're not intentionally putting up this unequal standard for malicious purposes, but oh man you would be so good at that if you wanted to harm Democrats by requiring perfection only on \\"our\\" side.","title":"CMV: Telling People That They Are Stupid Is Not Smart"},{"text":"Kathy Griffin had her life ruined over a very clear example of first amendment parody speech.","title":"Elon Musk Jokes in a Church About Someone Killing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"That's a spin, not a story.","title":"Kamala Harris LITERALLY tells voters at Wisconsin rally to not vote for her"},{"text":"In theory, this is a lovely idea but not all of have the privilege to be idealistic and morally pure regardless of consequences.Im disabled.

What other view points do you agree with? Malcolm stated that white people and African Americans can never integrate and was against integration. He was pro-violent uprising. He also suggested that the African Americans create their own government.One supposed \\"white liberal\\" but actual traitor he names is Abraham Lincoln. Even though Abraham Lincoln was killed prior to reconstruction and a reconstruction being steered by Lincoln would have been much better than Johnson.The entire crux is that \\"the white liberal says they want to do X, but because they're stymied by the opposition, then they really don't mean it.\\" Rather than focusing on the people doing the styming.We're to believe that integration was bad because the 1954 SCOTUS should have predicted white flight to the suburbs. Or when asked: Why can't African Americans use the political process for their advantage? Malcolm's answer is they aren't smart enough.The biggest counter point to this all: The most reliable voting bloc for the Democratic Party have been African Americans. They're an actual power broker. Obama was able to win, and Biden later, even though they lost the majority of white people.

Because it seems like there's two possibilities. 1) liberals are secretly evil and support the policies that they do because they want to inflict harm and gain control for self interested reasons. I don't think there's evidence for this and i don't see why antonymous takes on Reddit that might as well be Russian bots should count as compelling evidence. 2) liberals are really dumb for believing what they believe and in fact anyone who disagrees with Malcolm X is either dumb (liberals) or evil (conservatives or sometimes secretly liberals). This is completely worthless political analysis by Malcolm. On top of being unprovable in the slightest, it provides no grounds for action nor any superior ability to predict the future compared to more realistic analyses. If the goal is just to say that people who disagree with Malcolm X are stupid or evil then that's a fine thing to say, but then we change zero minds, produce zero useful ideas, and make zero insightful predictions. And if you can't do any of that, what's the value of the analysis?I see how you're elaborating your position more, but i don't think there's a lot to connect your Malcolm quotes with the (otherwise pretty reasonable and normal) ideas you're bringing up elsewhere, at least where i can see. The major confounding feature here is trump. In 2024 it's very easy to support the claim that trump doesn't care about democracy and will do irreparable damage to the political system of the US if he wins. It's also very easy to support the claim that if abstain or vote third party, you're going to be giving free support to trump by disusing your vote.

My point is that both need a regulatory third party and those regulations are the single most pivotal fulcrum defining these markets and the focus is on the right place. A libertarian wet dream of capitalism, without a government stepping in to protect the free market will never end up being free for long with monopolies, oligarchies and wealth absorption forming their own form of governance to become the regulatory body of industries and the overall market. Google is an example of how you can have this go down, where it used the still adapting and loose regulations regarding the internet in the 2000s and 2010s to seize an unbelievable control over the web market, and would weaponize it for over a decade and only now the Government is catching up to it and working to break it apart to preserve a free market. Regulation and that third body, the government, is needed to ultimately create and protect both of these systems, and the most important pivoting aspect of them is the specific regulations. The decision that the means of production can be privately owned or are publicly owned are a matter of regulation and policy. A private citizen can own means of production because the government protects that right and a private citizen can not own means of production because the government denies them that privilege. The definition of a capitalist or a socialist economy is centered on the policy and regulatory role the government takes in the market. The difference in regulation is without a doubt THE most important aspect, because one cannot properly exist without the specific policies and regulations that ensure it can exist. Also, a socialistic model where the means of production are spread among the workers and now outside non contributing investors doesn't have to just be democratic, in a future where algorithmic process is improved those decisions could theoretically be taken out of the worker's communal hands entirely, they now do the work assigned to them by the new third body regulatory system that would make these decisions and be paid as the algorithm defines as proper payment. So even the democratic angle could be done away with in a future theoretical.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"Don't heckle if you can't handle","title":"Christian students in Wisconsin speak out after Kamala Harris told them they were at the 'wrong rally'"},{"text":"Exactly the same thing happened in my family.

Where a similar event is occurring. Liberals are not acting to stop the genocide. Conservatives obviously endorse it, but it is a simple fact that Harris and Biden and nearly every Dem congressmen vote to approve weapons to Israel and support what's happening there right now. Dems have been supporting the Israel project for decades.20 years from now, if Liberals end up finally pulling support from Israel, somebody will be posting only defending liberals saying, \\"but it was liberals who ended the genocide not conservatives\\"...This is the point the OP is making. There are elements in society that are pushing liberals to take these actions. They aren't taking them on their own, and therefore don't deserve credit for them.Another example of this is FDR being given credit for all the social works programs and workers rights protections and woman's rights enacted during the great depression. It was unions and political activist groups and Woman's groups that pressured and pushed him to enact those laws.

A lot of small businesses start ups function this way.   \\nI'm not talking about a single factory collectively owned by its workers, I'm talking in a socialist economy, where the industry is socialized and you wouldn't have competing companies, the industry is collectively owned by its workers.   \\n  \\nIn a free market capitalistic manner, both the owner and the worker are capitalists at the baseline, they must coordinate an agreed upon sum that is agreeable to the worker and the owner for the exchange, the owner owns the some of the means of production, be it the work place, the factories, the organization or other supplies and the employee owns their own labor, knowledge and skills they bring and are offering. If the owner is being asked to pay out too much, he can refuse employment, if he tries to force the worker to work for less then the worker can afford or feels he is valued at, he can leave and offer his skills to another organization willing to pay higher. Corporations are freely able to modify their salary offerings to entice higher skill workers within the industry as the market and needs demand as there are other corporations in the same market that are competing for employees and if an individual's value is worth what they are looking for they can try to work their way to higher salaries, you actually see that \\"job hopping\\" trend happening in a number of industries right now.  In a democratic socialist industry, where ownership is shared by all employees throughout the industry, these decisions are no longer bound to the individual's personal wants and offerings, the democratic decision is sweeping. He can try to argue for his own self interests against the whole, but ultimately the only option for him if a vote undervalues his worth is to leave the industry. With his share of the business however now tied to his participation in labor, he is caught in losing all investment upon leaving, giving a far more lop sided power to the socialist control of the industry as there is no second option for him to offer his labor and skills too. He has invested in learning skills and licenses and such to work in the industry and his choice is to accept the value placed on him through democratic decision or go work in another industry entirely. This is a less inherently free position for the individual by nature.   \\nGranted, neither a full socialist economy nor even a proper free capitalist market currently can be said to exist on a sweeping whole in real life, economies exist in a mixed state of competing interests constantly working to enact regulations that support their interests, instead its usually an industry by industry manner, but in these examples, the one more freeing to the individual laborer will be the capitalist market as his very labor is completely his to barter with on his terms.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"Tax the American oligarchs.

Democrats were winning the black vote and the labor/working class vote before 1980, yet people here are acting like these constituencies are in conflict. They are not. A united working class has long controlled the government. That ended when neither party would put them front and center. But ever since, it's just been a matter of who would begin doing that again and Democrats waited until the Trump coalition began doing it again. Despite that Trump clearly doesn't represent labor or the working class, it was still enough to peel some longtime Democrats away. This isn't about race, but rather about taking care of the bottom income bracket for all races. The main thing that has changed is that Democrats have quit doing this and it's something that even this nice article failed to do. LBJ's War On Poverty has hardly been mentioned since 1980 and the immediate result was 20/28 years with a Republican President. I don't know how it could have been worse for Democrats in that span?Edit: I'll add that the primary reason Democrats are back in the game today is due to the floundering of the GOP after Bush 43.

Democrats have tried to take \\"the high road\\" for almost a decade by now. It hasn't been as successful as I would have assumed. We lost in 2016, and the election 2020 was extremely close too. At the same time Trump has always been Trump, has always insulted and mocked \\"outsiders\\" relentlessly. If you are correct, shouldn't have these two elections both blowouts for Democrats? Or, to phrase it in different terms: If mocking and shaming was counterproductive, why is this election still so close? You might argue it's different to mock the opponents compared to regular voters - and Harris herself has been very clear to distinguish this on her FOX interview - but to me this on its own has a hard time to explain Trump's \\"surprising\\" success, who's mocking isn't targeted either.2. The election isn't necessarily decided by the \\"still undecided\\" voters, it is also decided by a bring-out-the-vote effort. There are so many voters in this country who don't vote at all, that shaming \\"undecided\\" voters to fight apathy might work. In a way that's a continuation of 1: If I recall correctly, Trump won states simply by \\"running up the numbers\\" in already deep-red counties.3. Reddit is probably a harmless place to cool off some steam before engaging with real people again.  \\nNot all interaction is created equal. Reddit is - for one reason or another - a heavily liberal bubble, compared to the overall electorate. Also one dirty secret of electioneering is that most efforts have a very low percentage of voters actually reacting to it positively. I don't have the numbers at hand right now, but think of like \\"less than 10% of voters who get election advertising in the mail will vote for you if they didn't before\\" (Still enough to win close races, mind you). There is one big exception: If you interact with someone you personally know in real life, you have a crazy high percentage to influence their vote (and even higher to just encourage them to vote).  \\nSo, laughing at the stereotypical \\"undecided voter\\" here on reddit is pretty harmless (there aren't many here, they will see a lot of left-leaning content already and they are not likely to be influenced by it either way), and if it gives me the energy back to constructively and honestly engage with my uncle who happens to be an undecided voter, that's worth it 100% of the time.","title":"CMV: Telling People That They Are Stupid Is Not Smart"},{"text":"That was obviously commentary on how the working class is viewed in this article and media in general not what the commenter thinks the working class actually is.","title":"When Did Democrats Lose the Working Class?"},{"text":"I know they have existed in capitalist countries.

Trump's only opportunity to secure the black vote was for Kendrick to go on stage and say Kamala not like us, backing Janet Jackson. I'm certain he's thinking it, but doesn't want to risk losing his own black endorsement. Kanye flipped sides and black folks still support him, but when blackness is your entire identity you start making irrational moves. Some folks in the black community think Katt Williams should have sent a note instead of calling people out on a podcast because it's \\"black on black\\" damage to the culture where other cultures don't eat each other out. And by other cultures either they mean jews or they're wrong. White people don't back white for skin. We practically hate each other. You do see random black people greeting each other on the street, public buses and wherever they congregate, so the difference in community expectations and allowances between races is out of pocket. Blacks and white are in a similar boat, but blacks want to keep pretending that all whites are the jews who bought and sold their ancestors, while jews want to pretend not to be white until this storm clears. So now your common American black person (African American is reserved for people from Africa who move to America, not black people around the world, and that's why calling Kamala an African American due to a Jamaican heritage is crazy, especially when her Jamaican lineage is white slave owners and she got straight up caught lying about it) pretends that all whites enslaved their ancestors (many of whom didn't have slaves in their ancestry) in order to gain social advantage. This creates a big problem in society, as the common individual persecuted for crimes they didn't commit will inherit criminal intent. Call a man a slave owner and he'll just call you stupid, but if you can make society believe it then he begins to believe it, and that becomes a path of least resistance because it's now imbedded in his personality even though neither him or his ancestors participated in that. Society is too closely monitored for us not to blame this shit 100% on our government and the most wealthy people in our known universe.

Even free markets have historically NOT been talked about in a libertarian capitalist manner and free market capitalism does desire government regulation to protect the freedom of the individual to invest their resources and labor value as they see fit without foul play like monopolies. They also have and need a regulatory body to enforce the fair free market, without the regulatory body pushing regulations that favor some industry members over others. The goal of \\"Free Market Capitalism\\" is to have a market protected from anything that would divert or change that market, such as a monopoly controlling too much market share to subvert fair bartering of goods and services, regulations passed that give unfair advantages to some players and not others, or foreign markets dodging internal regulations to undercut the market at the cost of the overall market. Socialism needs a central authority to ensure that the democratic decisions of the collective are enacted fairly and prevent individual ambitions from breaking apart such collectives in the name of self interest. Both systems need regulation and the core concept that defines them is what the regulation is doing. If regulation gives a major protection to unions in an industry, allowing greater collective bargaining and limiting the ability of the company to fire those employees and hire new ones, but instead need to negotiate, that is a move most would consider socialist for example. You are putting power in the hands of the collective workers to argue for better distribution or conditions for their labor. That power is protected by the central government that is actively working to move the economy to a position where collective bargaining holds greater influence by binding the individual options available to the capitalist. You cant get to any socialist format without that third party.   \\n  \\nA regulation that tariffs foreign producers that skirt governmental regulations normally imposed on the businesses inside the country, to level the playing field and preserve the ability for internal corporations to function and work within the countries boarders, that's free market capitalism. Libertarian Capitalism would argue that preserving the freedom of the country's market to be improper, and would allow companies to ship off labor to countries that will make the products cheaper by paying employees less and violating standards the market is normally supposed to be held too. The profit opportunities are better then undercutting the values of the fair market that exist.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"She is pure eviI","title":"This is the most tyrannical and evil thing that Kamala Harris has EVER been caught on camera saying."},{"text":"They say it was just an edit down of her full answer, which would be more acceptable than splicing in something totally different.

This is why in the age of social media and just in general the Internet and information being everywhere have not been kind to liberal democracy or its institutions. This happens every time the main median for communication changes in society. Literacy and the written word upended medieval feudalism. Mass media like radio and then television changed society dramatically through WWII. Now things are changing massively again and we are going into unknown territory, yet again. One limiting factor though is the aging population. Rarely are there actual revolutions or huge upheavals in society when the population is old. So that's a counter to all the changes in the media and how information is consumed. I think there is a high likelihood that American Hegemony is going to be chipped away bit by and there will be a cultural malaise that will descend upon the US in the coming decades.

If you dont want to buy birth control, then ideally, the solution is that you can either not have sex or accept the much higher risk of pregnancy that comes with unprotected sex.

The problem has always been drilling into hot rock destroys the bit and its not like you can just pull it out and put a new bit on as it would collapse the borehole. So there are companies using millimeter wave drilling which basically evaporates the rock into a gas instead of making physical contact. With technology like this, you could see municipals running their own micro plants instead of running powerlines all over the place. Another use case is a cheap way of desalinating or purifying water. Since the water is in a supercritical phase (ie still liquid but beyond the flash point) the contaminated water would flash to steam on the surface allowing for the serration of particulate matter prior to entering into the turbines, preventing corrosion. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240312751022/en/Quaise-Energy-Raises-21-Million-to-Accelerate-Terawatt-Scale-Deep-Geothermal-Energy","title":"Biden administration proposes to boost geothermal energy projects by cutting early-stage environmental reviews"},{"text":"Lincoln was hated back in the day; as you say hated enough that half the country fought a civil war upon his election.Maybe it's the cynic in me, but one could make the argument that the only reason we smile upon his name has less to do with hindsight and more to do with the winner being able to write the history books.How Trump will be remembered in the future will depend on who the winner is this time.","title":"Dems are so fearful they're now in the Trump-is-worse-than Hitler stage as Election Day nears"},{"text":"Yeah it was kinda weird, because he is one of the few actual journalists there that doesn't typically get involved in the theater like the dude that moved to CNN.

So she has cast a broader net, taking less for granted, than Clinton while still maintaining the basic \\"not Trump\\" appeal. She doesn't have the same scandals behind her, either. She also has a campaign team that is much better at using online media and alternative media more generally. I think she might be a better speaker even, but she's more hit and miss.

In many forms of socialism, like Marxism-Leninism, the state controls the means of production rather than the workers, and the state is not democratic. Even if it is, it does not mean that property is controlled democratically, as there is nothing democratic about the way the property is managed, it's all top-down without worker involvement. The definition that most revolutionary socialists and scholars thereof use is *private ownership* over the means of production versus *social ownership* or *worker ownership* of the means of production. Note that this definition still excludes social democracy, which does not advocate for social ownership outside of key industries and welfare systems. In many countries, socialism is synonymous with social democracy, not with this definition of socialist, which is usually referred to as  communism. The regulation and government control vs free markets definition is popular because it includes all forms of socialism, including reformist ones such as social democracy.Your definition is so narrow and specifically framed as good, I worry that it might be an attempt at a No True Scotsman, designed to make it so that any form of socialism you don't like is \\"nor real socialism\\"","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"This is yet another evidence point that serious discussion online is damn near impossible because there's too much to gain from histrionics and nothing to gain from having your mind changed.","title":"Dems are so fearful they're now in the Trump-is-worse-than Hitler stage as Election Day nears"},{"text":"Boycott McDonalds.","title":"No, McDonalds didnt confirm Trumps baseless claim about Kamala Harris"},{"text":"If you wanted to summarize the change of the Democratic party over the past 20 years in one sentence, it would be: \\"From post-racial to most-racial.\\"","title":"Yep, it will be white folks' fault if Harris loses."},{"text":"Thank you so much for what youre doing!","title":"Phone banked for Georgia yesterday ~60% of those who answered said they will vote or voted for Harris"},{"text":"Those 40% mostly just said they were either uninterested, not voting, and ONE caller actually said he was voting for trump.

The oppressors are fighting to keep the oppressed under their heel and extract as many resources as possible from them. The oppressed are fighting for freedom.

They view it as giving guns to Nazis because 'they were running out so we had to give them some to make it more fair'. They think that any help given to white men will inevitably lead to backsliding on key issues around minorities and women.While racism was certainly at one point a deliberate tool of oppression, it's hard to argue that it's that today. Most modern racism is structural, accidental, or due to the result of decisions made decades ago. It's still harmful, but it's not the tool of some monolithic entity to keep the blacks in line. Even if it was, it's almost certainly not benefitting the rural white trash in Tennessee.If it's not the whole pseudo-marxist thing, then it's often just a lack of understanding.

Where does it follow the framing that you mention? **Cut Taxes for Middle Class Families**\\n \\n Vice President Harris and Governor Walz believe that working families deserve a break. Thats why under their plan more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans will get a tax cut. They will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle class and working Americans: the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Through these two programs, millions of Americans get to keep more of their hard-earned income. They will also expand the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 tax cut to families with newborn children. They believe no child in America should live in poverty, and these actions would have a historic impact.\\n \\n Unlike Donald Trump, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are committed to ensuring no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes. They believe that we need to chart a New Way Forward by both making our tax system fairer and prioritizing investment and innovation. They will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share, so we can take action to build up the middle class while reducing the deficit. This includes rolling back Trumps tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, enacting a billionaire minimum tax, quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks, and other reforms to ensure the very wealthy are playing by the same rules as the middle class. Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent, because when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger.","title":"When Did Democrats Lose the Working Class?"},{"text":"Cope, seethe, etc. I can be whatever I need to be to ensure she doesn't win.","title":"Kamala Harris Suggests Men Are Misogynist if They Do Not Support Her"},{"text":"Unfortunately that usually requires money, and no one wants to spend money on stuff that likely won't have an impact ??","title":"They knew Democrats couldnt win reliably red Utah.

And so Vice President Kamala Harriss mention of having worked at a California McDonalds in the summer of 1983 led directly to the unexpected sight of former president Donald Trump standing in the drive-through window of a McDonalds restaurant in Pennsylvania, pretending to fill orders for pretend customers.\\n \\n The line connecting those two things was Trumps decision that Harriss McDonalds story was a useful way to call her dishonest. Despite Trumps long track record of making obviously false claims, theres not much difference in how Americans perceive the honesty of the two candidates. By stating that Harris had invented her service with the fast-food chain, Trump can play the same game he played with Barack Obama in 2011: Elevate a murky biographical detail in an effort to hopefully make people wary of a Black Democrat.\\n \\n That detail is, in fact, murky. Last month, in an effort to unearth evidence of Harriss employment, I tried to contact McDonalds and the owners of the franchises on the island of Alameda, where she worked. But 1983 was in the pre-digital-data era and employment records for short-term workers at franchised fast-food chains from that period were almost certainly not considered essential documents to retain. I was able to find no evidence of her employment.\\n \\n Trump and his allies used that informational vacuum to suggest that she never worked there at all, that she was simply an elitist attempting to pose as someone with working-class roots. And to really hammer that argument home, the billionaire former president spent part of Sunday posing as a McDonalds employee. (The restaurant was closed and the cars that went through the drive-through were supporters who had been screened by the Secret Service.)\\n \\n On his social media platform, Trump claimed that his campaign had obtained proof that Harriss assertions were false.\\n \\n We have checked with McDonalds, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin Kamala Harris ever having worked there, he wrote Sunday afternoon. In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this job for years.\\n \\n Notice the rhetorical jump there: from no record of working to never worked. Its like saying that, if Americas collective memory and documentation of its history suddenly evaporated, we could prove that Trump was never president, since no record of his having done so exists.\\n \\n The restaurant chain  obviously not unhappy at the attention  sent a message to its employees that was obtained by The Washington Post. It indicates that no records of Harriss employment exist, but makes clear that this is not an aberration and not a reason to think that she didnt.\\n \\n Though we are not a political brand, the message reads, weve been proud to hear former President Trumps love for McDonalds and Vice President Harriss fond memories working under the Arches. While we and our franchisees dont have records for all positions dating back to the early 80s, what makes 1 in 8 so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had.\\n \\n The reference to 1 in 8 is to a corporate marketing program highlighting that (it claims) about 1 in 8 Americans have at some point worked for the chain. As McDonalds clearly accepts that Harris did.\\n \\n The message from McDonalds also touted how the owner of the franchise that Trump visited was proud to highlight how he and his team serve their local community and make delicious food, like our World-Famous French Fries. Sure enough, Trump briefly worked the fryer at the restaurant, in an attempt to suggest that he had more experience doing so than Harris did. (Which, again, is baseless.)\\n \\n But its a rather incongruous message given that Trump is also trying to position his candidacy as centered on the promotion of healthy food. This is an offshoot of his endorsement from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suggested, when abandoning his own candidacy, that Trump had committed to promoting healthy eating if reelected. Unless, you know, he can twist the knife on Harris.\\n \\n We end where we started. There is no reason to think that Harris didnt work at McDonalds in 1983 and, as demonstrated above, every reason to think that Trumps suggestion that she didnt is offered in bad faith and without evidence. But, then, this is also not unusual in the 2024 presidential campaign.**","title":"No, McDonalds didnt confirm Trumps baseless claim about Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I voted against Ted Cruz...

Int the debate he came across as someone that believed men must compromise their masculinity in order to be a good person.I was hoping to hear more \\"real men stand up and do the right thing even if it isn't popular... they fight for the little guy...\\" but what I heard was \\"men should be good listeners...\\"That's not going to influence the demographic that he was supposed to represent.","title":"When Did Democrats Lose the Working Class?"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|pQmWjYrz39YAg)","title":"Bidenomics has served over 300 Million"},{"text":"Can't wait to see the apple tv+ sci-fi miniseries on this, called \\"The Golden Calf\\"","title":"Harris says Trump 'demeans the office' of the president after he calls her a 's---' vice president"},{"text":"False.

Mosaddegh faced large opposition, much of which was directly the result of his immediate grabbing of excessive executive power upon gaining a parliamentary majority. The myth is that Iran was some kind of haven of democratic ideals, but the reality is that Mosaddeghs decline was nothing out of the ordinary for Iran; the previous pm was assassinated for Christs sake. People treat him like a martyr because its cutesy to believe Iran was a flourishing democratic state sabotaged by evil westerners, when it was not. Mosaddeghs initial rise to power began by appointment of the shah, parliamentary elections to confirm him as pm which were halted early to ensure he held a majority, and then immediate seizing of dictatorial powers through abuse of emergency powers. Mosaddegh resigned in 1952, and was shortly thereafter reappointed by the shah due to rioting; no British or American coup there, just Iranian infighting because *gasp* plenty of Iranians disagreed with Mosaddegh. He also used his executive powers to dissolve the Supreme Court, and later called a referendum to dissolve the majles; the people who were actually democratically elected; this would be like a prime minister of the U.K. dissolving parliament and parties whilst maintaining their leadership. The central claim made by many in this thread is that without US and British interference Iran would be a thriving, secular democracy. This is a lie. The US spent money to fan the flames of existing discontent, and Mosaddeghs time in office was mired by anti-democratic actions and election interference. The only reason people pin the blame on his particular administration ending abnormally instead of the prior one ending by assassination, or the many others which did not follow democratic procedure, is because this one happened to involved British and American interests. Thats it. The only unique thing about Mosaddegh in particular was his nationalism. TLDR: the argument that the current Iranian regime is to blame on the British and Americans is stupid. Wikipedia is not giving you an accurate view of Mosaddegh nor of the cias involvement in Iran. If anything, Mosaddegh had no problem with dictatorships; he just wanted himself at the helm, rather than the shah.

It started with cable television, 24/7 news channels, syndication of AM radio talk shows, the internet, and ultimately social media. All of this coincided with the decline of US manufacturing and the rust belt areas. True, some of the themes of this media were about race but it was not only about race. It was about the perception of fairness, equal opportunity vs forced outcomes, and social class. Fox News, Limbaugh, Beck, and the Russian troll farms were able to create a mythology about \\"elitist\\" Democrats who prioritized abstract ideals over the real struggle of the working class.And the Democrats provided just enough examples to make these claims seem credible. For example giving Nancy Pelosi so much prominence for so long. She was a wealth urban Democrat from a city far from the rust belt and known better for its liberal culture than factories or industry. She made it easy for right-wing media to rebrand Democrats as not supporting the working class.Meanwhile, so many Democrats responded by shouting \\"racism\\" even louder. The fact that the Democrats didn't recognize that it the issue more is complicated than race only accelerated the process. People don't relate to those that superficially and automatically assign pejoratives to them.","title":"When Did Democrats Lose the Working Class?"},{"text":"1. Look up gini coefficients for countries, you might be surprised at what you find. There are also many developed countries that have massive wealth and social inequalities such as Korea. 2. Canada and New Zealand are both great counter examples. Its worth considering that the countries you mentioned are some of the wealthiest countries in the world and as a result, the cost and expectations of people in those countries are higher than other places. Developed east asian countries are also hyper competitive in terms of school and opportunities making it essentially mandatory to hire a private tutor. 3. This might not be super obvious, but there is an inverse relationship between how oppressed people are and how loudly they complain about their oppression. University students are typically the most vocal group regarding these topics, but if you think about it, this is one of the most equal times in a person's life and they are a group that is better off than the average. People are louder because they have no fear of reprisal, so we tend to hear from them a lot. Not a lot of North Koreans complaining about oppression. There is something else to consider... the anglosphere countries are also the most ethnically diverse and immigrant friendly and that introduces many societal challenges other places don't even need to wrestle with. If you want an example - Japan, hell France has a lot of tension with immigrants.4. Plenty of developed countries essentially have next to no safety nets, think of countries where there is a stronger sense of obligation from children to their ageing parents and generally speaking its because the kids are the social safety net. 5. This has more to do with immigration. Again, these are some of the most welcoming countries towards immigrants. Housing is also challenged by a larger proportion of single people (a sign in a sense of prosperity and freedoms since people don't need to get married to survive) which raises demand for housing.6. Japan, Mexico, Korea come to mind as having absolutely terrible work life balance. Anglosphere countries do have a reputation in many european countries as being harder working.... but jeez some european countries are absolutely calling it in work wise. 7. One thing I've noticed as a Canadian is that when there is an emergency and someone needs help, like someone who seems to have overdosed and needs medical attention, the people who are by far most likely to help are Caucasian. Some groups seem overtly opposed to helping others and there are cultural reasons for it.

Zuckerberg's congressional hearing a few years ago.According to her testimony and the congressional findings, Facebook had detailed analyses of how their algorithms affect public, some of the data suggested that the way they work has a very negative impact on mental health, and an increase of dividing society. Despite having a way to counteract the negative effects, Facebook did not decide to make changes because it would reduce revenue.I think this clearly indicates that although harmful action is not the main function (it is to maximize profits), it is hard to talk about unconscious action here. The algorithm itself does not have any intentions, because it is a piece of code. However, the company that created it and actively uses it most certainly has intentions that are difficult to call neutral, especially in a situation in which they consciously act unfavorably for the community, motivated solely by profit.Bias:\\nSimilarly to the intentions aimed at profit even at the expense of negative social consequences that corporations using algorithms have, the situation looks like when it comes to their political preferences.Some time ago in an interview with Matt Taibbi, I heard him mention that after Trump's first victory, the CEO of Google during a speech addressed to Google employees openly said that this decision was a mistake and, accompanied by loud applause, mentioned that they cannot allow it to happen again.  His words were apparently put into practice because earlier this year evidence of bias in Google search algorithms was found.Access to information:\\nAs you mentioned, the operation of algorithms leads to the creation of information bubbles, and indeed such an effect is clearly visible, but it is not limited only to the political sphere, but limits access to information and in general.I have always used YouTube with great pleasure because the materials proposed for viewing often contained content on topics or were from a field that I was not familiar with, but in the end it turned out to be very interesting for me. Well, currently it is hardly possible, because YT only offers based on the material watched and to a lesser extent, but still, on what other users who also saw this material have watched. This takes away a certain randomness and in my case prevents me from learning about ideas from different fields.Not every corporation uses algorithms that work in the same way.  During the congress hearing I mentioned, the fact was raised that fb displays information that arouses angry reactions in the user, for example, in order to increase engagement, because violent emotions are well monetized. This means that in reality fb can provide you with political information about an opposition politician, but it will be content that is presented in a controversial way or concerns negative actions and as a result causes anger. The effectiveness of violent emotions in increasing engagement has also been picked up by many creators. On yt I have seen many channels on which every published material contained content suggesting some kind of threat, such as climate change, actions of politicians, corporations, WEF, China, etc. They were not politically oriented, they simply provided content additionally presenting it in a way that was supposed to arouse negative associations because it increased the channel's profits.  The algorithms used for monetization also cause many problems. Some content on YT cannot count on income from advertising or views because it concerns topics that are not in line with the platform's policy. This causes many creators to self-censor in order to earn money.Other negative phenomena:\\n- calculating property rental prices using algorithms leads to inflated prices.\\n- insurance companies or banks effectively reduce creditworthiness or inflate insurance premiums based on algorithms.Hope you would be willing to concider those issues when forming your opinions.","title":"CMV: Algorithms, though neutral, unintentionally create filter bubbles by showing content based on engagement patterns.
