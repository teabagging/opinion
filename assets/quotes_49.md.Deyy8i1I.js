That technological progress was achieved by rapid population growth after the Industrial Revolution freed industrialized countries from the Malthusian trap that limited population for all of history before that. Using that bounty, industrialized countries established pension systems to sustain retirees using taxes paid by workers. This system is only sustainable as long as population continues to grow, or at least plateaus. Unfortunately, birth rates plummet in almost every country that achieves a certain level of development, for various reasons. With greatly increased life expectancy from modern medicine, this means that the ratio of workers to retirees falls. That means a higher share of people who consume goods and services but don't produce them. Immigration can delay this, but fewer immigrants become available the more countries complete their demographic transitions. This leaves policymakers a choice between cutting pensions, raising taxes, and increasing public debt, which all have bad effects. Technology might offer a way out of the trap by increasing workers' productivity, but a shrinking supply of young workers is very bad for innovation, and elder care is very resistant to productivity improvements anyway. A modern economy doesn't require a large number of workers because of some fact of capitalism, but because there's no other way to satisfy the endless desires of modern society. Demographers are concerned with replacement rate because the economy becomes increasingly hard to sustain in the long run if it falls too low. \\"Consuming less\\" is a choice most people consistently refuse to make, because everyone except ascetics enjoys gratifying their wants. It's an especially unreasonable demand for people in middle-income and developing countries, who want to enjoy a rich country's standard of living.  After several generations of population decline, the luxuries you take for granted today would become unaffordable or disappear entirely. The standard of living would fall for most people, and the poor and vulnerable would be hurt worst of all.  \\nAlso, if you're worried about the present state of elder care, you should be very worried by population decline, since problems with elder care will get much worse as the ratio of elderly to working-age people available to care for them rises.","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"This is the conspiracy subreddit.

I have some reason to believe most of the passages that seem to mandate wifely subordination (can't teach, stay quiet, submit to husbands) were not meant to be general principles for wifely behavior, but rather specific instructions for that church. Another Redditor suggested, rightly I think, that the issue was that since men were allowed to attend synagogues and women weren't, women were thus unfamiliar with synagogue etiquette, so Paul had to instruct them in it - keep quiet, don't teach, and ask someone in the know if they have any questions (i.e. the men in their lives). So I think you're right - in Scripture, men and women are equals.\\n2. *\\"Jesus didnt judge or exclude based on tradition or social norms.\\"* Hard disagree. Jesus judged more than anyone else. He never told sinners that their sin was okay; he told them to repent and stop doing it. That their sin was *not* okay is the entire reason he died for us. But he also didn't \\"judge\\" them in the sense that he *condemned* them for their sin, no. Just because he associated with sinners doesn't mean he accepted their sin. He accepted their *repentance*. He accepted their *belief*. And he gave them forgiveness in return. Sin was to be repented of. Note the Rich Young Ruler for an example of Jesus rejecting association with someone due to unrepentant sin.\\n3. *\\"Jesus prioritized helping the poor and vulnerable.\\"* I'll agree that Christians should pay more attention to this than they do. Where they disagree with progressives is that compelling others by law and being generous with other people's money isn't the spirit of Jesus' commands on the subject. But one could make a case.\\n4. *\\"Caring for others overrules strict adherence to rules.\\"* Definitely something to be said for that.\\n5. *What would Jesus do? often doesnt align with conservative stances...Jesus would lean toward progressive values of kindness, inclusion, and care for the vulnerable.\\"* This doesn't fit in the \\"progressive vs conservative\\" paradigm. Conservatism is simply about retention of societal norms, while progressivism is about replacing them with new norms. Neither of those things have anything inherently to do with what's under discussion. Conservative Christians are just as capable of kindness, generosity, and inclusion as progressive Christians.I think the more fundamental issue at hand is that progressives lost Christians before they even started by throwing out the Bible. Whenever Christians expressed concern that progressive values were possibly inconsistent with the Bible, the progressive response was not to show them that their values are, in fact, consistent with it, but rather to tell them that the Bible isn't true and that they should throw it out.Conservatives didn't tell them that. Conservatism is about preserving and retaining norms, and Scripture was one of those norms. Had progressives appealed to Scripture, rather than discarding it, I think Christianity would be more associated with progressivism today than it is. Progressives lost the battle before it even started.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"Are you saying that if Covid hadn't struck, the economy wouldn't have catered anyways?Out of the 3 options in absence of Covid, the economy does widly better, the economy stays true to course, and the economy craters, only 1 is economic-consensus validated.

John 8:1-11: Jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman, rebuking the judgmental crowd with, Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone. ?

Matthew 22:37-39: Jesus said the greatest commandments are to love God and love your neighbor as yourself.Jesus was not a hippie or a laissez-faire libertarian for emphasizing compassion. Christianity still posits an objective difference between right and wrong, and ensuring you're doing the right thing is of the absolute highest importance. \\"If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\\" (Matthew 5:29-30)This is within one of the scriptures you quote. How can you say that just because Jesus doesn't want an adulterer to be literally stoned to death, that means he challenged the \\"traditionalists\\" who thought adultery was wrong? He's challenging them on their response to the sin, not on their perception that adultery is a sin.

My mom has the exact opposite notion and insists that I buy her anything to show her that I care about her. I demonstrate my love for her in every occasion but she has this enormous emotional attachment to receiving a gift that I can't fathom. This wouldn't be a problem, except she never asks for anything specific. NEVER. I remember how I felt whenever I received gifts I didn't ask for and at one point I broke down crying because I hated the thought of someone going through all the effort of finding and picking and buying a gift that I was never going to have any interest in. I don't want to knowingly put anybody else through that! My mom has the exact opposite philosophy and values only the effort put into finding and choosing a gift and not the gift itself. She explicitly told me that she would rather me go to a store and pick out a mug with mom written on it than nothing at all.She can't fathom how you feel either. Remember that.I'm on her side on this, personally. I haaated being asked what I wanted as a kid and hate it to this day, though I'm obv polite about it and do sort of answer people now, but depends on the person. There WERE a few things I did and was clear about, but it was usually something new (like the hot toy) or something no one who knew me would have thought I wanted (like actually, a pair of socks).Asking for specific things, in general, feels bad. it's like 'give me cash. I WANT.,.. ' I love giving gifts. I am the person friends and family members ask for gift suggestions or ideas for other people. I tend to give gifts people really like.To me, gifting is about really listening to people, knowing people. I feel like if someone can't think of anything to get me, they just don't know me very well (and I am not talking about oh, some obscure thing, but like if you get me a gift card and it's to Starbucks, have we even met? If it's to my fave market, I think that's very thoughtful.)I also do feel slightly bad if someone I'm close to ignores a gifting occasion -- again it is NOT about stuff or $$$ spent. It's you know me, you know I like Christmas, for example, and even a card and a candy cane I'd be very happy you remembered and thought of me.This is also not saying I just do things on commercially-promoted days and not other days. I give people random gifts, do things for people lots of random times, and people do things for me. But some of us like a holiday and like thinking of and hunting for that perfect thing (which to me is the thing that the person I'm giving it to either would love but wouldn't buy for themselves, because they wouldn't spend the $ on because it's not needed needed or because they didn't know it existed.) and it brings us a lot of pleasure to do that. Especially around holidays. I bake all the time but I still plan and think about xmas baking and gifts.I got a friend who's always been into knives and swords a weekend blacksmithing course. I was so happy to have found the place and the class they could go to ... they loved it, made a dagger, went back for the next level themselves.That's really fun for me and I'm guessing your mother.

Welcome in. But your characterization of the gospels, Bible, and Christ arent complete.

He often defended the weak and vulnerable but He also told them to go and sin no more. He rebukes mostly the proud and powerful, especially insofar as they misused their privilege, power, and wealth. Liberals and progressives are plenty privileged and wealthy and do nothing with their wealth unless it makes them or their friends richer. As Carlin said, its a big club and you aint in it. Christ observed Judaic traditions but He also established further ones. This doesnt mean we ought throw aside tradition, it means we ought seek him in every tradition we uphold.

An appraisal of freedom rivaled in fervor only by conservatives? Youre onto something but will have to dig deeper to flesh out more of the mystery and the resolution, insofar as there even is one, revealed over time.

It is very common to see high level politicians in their 70's, 80's, and even 90's in America while that is much less common in other democracies. Indeed politicians born in the 1940's and even 1930's are still relevant in America today, while similarly aged politicians in Europe have been out of power for many years. To fix this problem I propose that there should be a maximum age of 70 to be in government. This maximum age limit would apply regardless of whether the person is appointed or elected, whether they are in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches, and whether they are in the federal, state, or local government. On the other hand, the minimum age to be involved as either a legislator or executive at any level of government should be 18 years old. These reforms would not eliminate \\"career politicians\\", a term which in my opinion has received far too much negative attention. Rather it would eliminate people overstaying their welcome in politics. What do you think of the proposed maximum age limit? Do you think these reforms would help make governments seem more relatable to the average person?

Russia engaged in a massive campaign to influence the election, that went as high as Trump's campaign manager and many of his associates. It certainly had an impact, but it's impossible to say how much of an impact. Saying \\"I think the impact was large enough to change the results\\" isn't saying Trump is illegitimate or should be removed from office or something. It should also be noted that *Trump himself* called Biden an illegitimate president, and Trump tried to overturn the election. Biden didn't do that. Kamala Harris didn't do that. Obama and Hillary Clinton didn't do that. There is no both sides on this issue. Only one side is threatening state reps to throw out legally cast ballots, changing laws to make it easier for them to throw out votes, refusing to concede the election and instead going on massive campaigns pushing fraudulent claims to rile up their base to the point that they'll storm the Capitol building.Like OP said, I'm tired of pretending this is perfectly normal, acceptable part of politics.

I think their hypocritical cop out is that they think helping the poor, reserving judgement, caring for others should be done outside of the government. They are also going to be under the opinion that government is not efficient which obviously again is a cop out.So while I think Christians could easily wiggle their way out of  not believing in progressive programs, I find there to be little room for support for our modern financialized capitalism. The New testament is very explicit about this.From Matthew 6:24:\\"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\\"From Mark 10:25:\\"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\\"In this way, if you are going to engage with the political nature of Christianity and Christians wanting the government to reflect Christian values, I think it is best to start with the point that Jesus absolutely did not think rich people are compatible with Christianity.

The problem you have is many religious folks give more to charities. You cannot proclaim opposition to *government* programs as not wanting to help the poor. It is quite logical to conclude some government programs, while well intentioned, actually hurt the poor. Therefore those should be opposed.Point 3 - The same bible repeatedly *does* enforce rule following. Hell it condones slavery. This is the case of people deciding what sections they want to follow vs not. It's back to the non-uniformity of Christianity.Point 4 - You do understand there is a difference between what people think Jesus would do and what they think is appropriate for a government right?Now - you ask why religion would not want to associate with progressives - look no farther than the open hostility many progressives have toward religion. You can see almost daily some progressive/leftist etc posting here about how religion should be outlawed in some way.

If you were allowed to keep all you earned and that would be enough do you see how them thinking if everyone learned to take care of themselves we can all be good. And again through tough love we might all be able to learn to be self sufficient and not need to burden others with our crosses the same way jesus didn't give his cross to another\\n4. Yes a christian might break the law to prevent you from hurting a child. So to help that unborn child of god, they will love that child by breaking the rules to keep them safe. And even CHANGE the rules to ensure that child is safe\\n5. Jesus would teach a man to fish. And so we can give a homeless man a fish or teach them. Teaching is harder, not everyone will learn.

So you can get her something expensive but not costly. Like $20 dollar finger toe winter socks don't cost a lot of money but are expensive for socks. She probably wouldn't buy it for herself but now that she has them might use them. Or if you bonded over an interest like rock climbing you can buy her a mug that has a rock climbing hold as a handle instead of the regular handle. She would use the mug but this has a momento/interest connected to it. If you can't think of anything make a small frame out of paper.

As anecdotal as it may be, I have familial experience in the matter, as well, on a few notes. My mom had breast cancer that was almost at the threshold of being stage 4. They did chemo and radiation, after a mastectomy. She was still having issues and the treatments nearly did her in. They offered her an experimental injection, which was either rDNA or mRNA, I'm honestly not sure. This was right at the turn of the century. Oddly enough, the disclaimer they gave her was that it would most likely eliminate the cancer, but her life expectancy would be capped at 10yrs due to known complications where autoimmune disorders were concerned. She took it, it got rid of the cancer, and she lived almost exactly 10yrs to the day, succumbing eventually to the *known* disorders caused by the technology. It always seemed crazy that they knew then and told her, while the past few years any mentions of such *known* issues were dealt with heavy handedly.Cut to 10 more years, and my dad takes a few of the ViD VaXxeS. Within months he had 3 autoimmune disorders and 2 types of cancer, very rapidly progressing cancer. He had great insurance, so of course they reassured him they'd pull out all the stops and could certainly cure his stage 4 cancer... wait, what?I insisted they were taking him for a ride; he insisted I wanted him dead. They threw every known treatment at him, including multiple exploratory surgeries the last of which uncovered a softball size tumor in his lung that they \\"hadn't noticed\\" prior. Wild that 3 types of cancer wouldn't be considered viable for treatment by an insurance company. It's almost as if they ignored the last one until they were done milking him, as he had plenty of chest xrays done during his time being treated. So anyway, after 3 back to back surgeries in 3 days, none of which he ever woke up from, he was essentially only alive by mechanical means. Having now located the 3rd cancer, they *immediately* became very insistent on palliative care. It was gross. They did exactly as I said they would, getting every penny they could out of him and leaving him chopped up and barely clinging to life. The man they wanted to pull out all the stops for to keep alive just months prior, was now occupying an ICU bed which could be more profitable with someone else in it.I gave them hell and made them accommodate him for a few more days, then signed the papers and bid him farewell. He disowned me for warning him about the medical industries practices, and in the end I was the only one who fought for him. Really sad stuff. But anyway, no, I'm probably not turning to the medical industry for much of anything, vaxx, chemo, or much else.","title":"Russia says it has developed a vaccine against cancer?that will be rolled out to patients for free."},{"text":"Yell all the good ideas over your shoulder on the way out like you didnt have the opportunity to address them sooner","title":"Biden calls for ban on congressional stock trading"},{"text":"Sounds too sloppy for these conniving fools.

To respond to this request, Cardona and his staff will have to dig into a legal morass worthy of a law school examination.Superficially, the question seems a simple one. Everyone agrees that the Secretary of Education is empowered to make adjustments on federal student loans. The debate turns on the precise meaning of provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) which confer upon the Secretary the power to consent to modification of, and to compromise, waive, or release, amounts due on certain student loans.

Eventually, the pain hits - a tooth is going bad. You down some pain meds, complain to everyone about how shit toothaches are but otherwise ignore it. Your gum starts bleeding constantly - you start using mouthwash, but still don't go to the dentist. It hurts to eat, you start eating around it. People start commenting on your rotten breath, and you keep complaining about the tooth - all the things that you'll do to correct it when you go to the dentist. Except, of course, you don't.Eventually, the pain becomes debilitating. You get dragged, kicking and screaming to the dentist. The appointment starts, and you talk the talk, blaming the tooth. The dentist inspects before telling you that the tooth needs extraction, along with several others that have worsened because of your laxity. And it needs to happen fast -- or the infection its causing could travel to your brain and kill you.Your response: \\"I can't do that! What about my perfect smile? What would people think?\\"The Democratic Party as an institution has the appearance of [bipartisanship/the moral high ground/stability/whatever] than the reality. They push ineffectual candidates because \\"it's their turn\\". They try to 'meet in the middle' when it has shown over and over again to end up following their opponents to the right.When their opponents threw out the rulebook, they didn't do anything except complain, so the behaviour was normalised. Now, minor steps no longer work - the Democrats have few options left that aren't on the scale of \\"stack the supreme court to enable judicial reform\\" - and they won't do it because they know how it will be viewed.The Democratic Party is afraid of bad PR, and the sad irony is that, while its true that it would be a nightmare - their optics don't even matter! They already get accused of being baby-killing-commie-welfare junkie-satanists! Their opposition has shown that they will happily make shit up about the Democrats regardless of whether it happened or not! At this point, the only thing the institution is doing is giving their opposition a veneer of credibility.","title":"Pelosi Won.

I also think there's a thing to be talked about here along the lines of the fact that economic inequality is a major problem, and in light of the volume of information available on the reasons for that, namely your plutocrats and fascists, there are few ways to view support for those people, and between evil and stupid, stupid is the more charitable option.  We can work with stupid,  you can become not stupid.  Evil is harder.  Either way, there is a component of responsibility to that support, because the fascists and plutocrats could not do what they're doing without it.Which ties back into the notion that I feel you're advocating for giving the MAGA crowd a pass because they're not the root of income inequality, but I'm saying this is a \\"por que no los dos?\\" situation.We can blame the plutocrats for being the root, and work with the MAGA crowd to help them realize that they actually are propping up fascism because they want cheap eggs, and that is either stupid or evil, and asking them whether they want to be stupid or evil. So far, it seems like the jury is out on which they prefer, but they're definitely committed to one of the two, which is unfortunate.","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"You know who is the bigger voter block than trump voters?

And that is expensive even if everything goes perfectly smoothly. As it is, someone has to foot the bill for that testing, as well as testing the manufacturing process, efficacy, etc etc. They dont have to prove the mechanism, but they do have to be able to make the product and sell enough of it during the patent period to recoup their costs. If you cant patent it at all, no one can afford the research/testing because someone else could just produce the same without having to pay the research and testing costs. Unfortunately, this is why drug companies mainly go for the drugs that can make billions. Lots of drugs fail to make it to market. And all of those failures also have to be paid for out of the ones that are the blockbusters. It is the same reason why you wont really see any kind of thc product ever get FDA approval. Now the conspiracy part comes in when the big pharma company pays the generic manufacturer to not produce it, or they dont put forth the best version from the beginning so roll out a better product a decade later, etc etc etc.","title":"Russia says it has developed a vaccine against cancer?that will be rolled out to patients for free."},{"text":"You did not address the vast majority of my comment.

Voters do not actually face any direct consequence for their personal political beliefs. It is actually extremely rare to find a policy that a person can make a one-to-one connection to within their lives. It's why single issue voters groups within LGBT groups and anti-abortion activists are so noteworthy- they can see a tangible result of the policy. Most people don't have that feedback. Even if they chose poorly, they will not personally see the connection between their voting and the results that happened. Even the people who are experts on these issues have an extremely difficult time even attempting to model reality, let alone some random person who barely got through high school.Also, what do you mean by accountable? You mean socially accountable? People already do that. It doesn't work as well because people tend to hang around people similiar to them.

Secondly, the reason the economy was better post-Covid than everyone else is: 1) we didnt initiate a full shutdown like everyone else did (Thanks, Trump) and 2) Operation Warp Speed rolled out mandatory vaccines here in the US very quickly (a program that began 6 months before the 2020 election and ended a couple weeks after Bidens term started; also, thanks Trump).

Yes there are those people, they see this time as opportunity to be loud about it... then you have the likes of elon and his self-interests boosting those people's views. Mix his ownership of twitter, the bandwagon effect, advanced in-house AI systems, and motivation to manipulate society as much as possible (remember, you only need just north of 50% of the voting population) as a means to his own end, it is a potent monster of propaganda - and they used it.  If you can make it appear that \\"there are so many people that think x on twitter\\" people start to think \\"hmm, maybe I'm wrong, there's so many others that think x on twitter\\", it's a direct feed into some people's minds.  What also hurts more than anything, is the MSM latching onto what's started on twitter, and then boosting the crap out of it mainstream or having a tiss about it... all that does is feed the monster.  There's an effect of always following their lead, not being on the offensive.... it allows them to be in the drivers seat and ultimately gives more weight to these hateful points.Right and far-right ideology based youtubers were bought up too. Some of those channels make millions a year and they will also say whatever the script is that's being sent to them. They don't care - they take the capitalist approach. Where progressive youtubers struggle bc there's no one sponsoring them in the same manner.  Along with the checkbooks, do you suppose those right-wing channels get boosted by the same party-members that own other media/advertisement companies?  It's also in their best interests to keep the capitalist machine ticking... where progressive channels that discuss the woes of the systems/companies/capitalism would counter their profiteering schemes.   \\nIn 2020 Bernie clearly discussed policy that would be detrimental to the elites, their media companies, the drug companies, the insurance companies, the corrupt deals, etc. So the media shafted him for it. Since no media would cover him (despite being the frontrunner) he got the clever idea to do a fox town hall. Fox okayed it, probably thinking how much of a laughing stock they could make it out to be.  But what happened? He answered their questions with genuine answers that were clear and.... made sense? He received multiple rounds of applause!  And these folks that fox had let in to their studio to be audience had maga hats on, they were certainly die-hard republicans.  But wait, that doesn't make any damn sense.  Bernie was the evil 'blue' party.... he was even a communist, like what in the fuck is going on here?    \\n  \\nIt was a sterling example of - when you discuss and want to properly represent real people - the 2 party bs doesn't matter.  They wanted change, and he had recipes and receipts to get that done. For once, it was a politician that wasn't a puppet. People could tell he was going to fight for it too.  Which is a feature no other politician demonstrates.So if trump states even a bit of these things, lies or not, it appears as if he's not a puppet to them... not because of 'dumbness' on their part, they desperately don't want him to be a puppet. On the other side, you should see that there's real discouragement. With the remaining people being registered independents, who also want these things, there was no motivation coming from the dem camp this yr, and some might have bought the trump messaging/trap somewhere along the way.","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"Yeah right.

The dems have campaigned on 'their' set of policies, and never get more than 1% of it implemented. For example we all believed Biden when he adapted from Bernie, that he would eliminate higher ed debt.  Biden could have easily handled this and it wouldn't have been reversable or anything... and to great praise, but instead they took the detour route that opened the door to hoards of lawyers and other entities to inject havoc, essentially self-sabotaging it and then shoulder shrugging like they didn't know it would happen. This doesn't just affect dems and is an example of 'screwing' - at a minimum, not following through.  This same pattern of promise - then 1% effort/'success' - and throwing on top, the media 'glowing it up' and stretching it is just sickening after many cycles.  How much of that works until there's real damage to reputation?  It becomes: \\"yeah, sure, whatever -- I know you don't care\\"  \\n  \\nThis makes campaigns unbelievable by default - we all know what they say, isn't what they'll do (for the current Dems/ pre-trump repubs), and that they will effectively keep everything as it were = right of center to the hard right.  Why would they do that? Elites thrive right-of-center to the right, nothing changes for them, they continue to be a black hole.  Trump shamelessly manages this by lying outright, but since it's different, it's received differently.When it comes to trump, you have to understand that he was toting 'populism' to these people - a solution we all **desperately** need.  Sure, we can see through the bs, we know he will not be beneficial to 'normies' - but if all your social media, the onslaught of bots pushing their propaganda, and the news of \\"your bubble\\" are telling you that he will... as you go about your dailies, it's becomes all you know.","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"Citizens United sold the country to the highest bidders.","title":"2024 might be the year American democracy ended and fascism began"},{"text":"A true liberal will never win.

The Democratic Party Lost."},{"text":"The Democrats are absolutely the architects of their own defeat. This should have been an impossibly low bar to clear against Trump, and they absolutely fucked it up. Biden said he'd step down in 2019, but then waffled on that commitment. He stayed in the race far too long. Democrat donors refused to budge on Israel, and allowed the Gaza situation to create chaos among Democrat voters. I actually think Harris ran a great campaign - but she only had 100 days to do it because Biden refused to step down until the problem was so severe and public that the reaction forced the issue. It's so fucking frustrating. Every single time history presents them a pristine opportunity to rise to the occasion they fucking botch it. The party NEEDS to be giving people like AOC the spotlight. She's one of the ONLY people in the party at this point that people really like. They need to be empowering the next generation and they are just fossilizing around their old, extinct politics and it drives me fucking insane.**EDIT**: A lot of people seem just super naive about how politics work. In 2019 [Biden's campaign told the media he didn't intent to run again](https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2019-12-11/joe-biden-suggests-he-would-only-serve-one-term-if-elected-president)Yes, I am aware that the source is \\"advisors close to the President.\\"I am aware that Biden, himself, never got in front of a camera and used his meat flaps to say these literal words. That doesn't mean the campaign didn't absolutely and intentionally disseminate this information to the public for a specific purpose.That's how communication is done in traditional politics. Biden did not want to be *committed* to that - as he would be if he said it himself - so instead his campaign released it to the media, *and he never contradicted the statement*. Which means that he didn't intend, at the time, to rerun, but he wanted to keep the option open, and give himself plausible deniability - which you people are literally now proving worked, because you keep saying \\"he didn't say it.\\"He released that to the media *on purpose*. Please, if you want to have a discussion about politics, understand how it works.Do you see how the headline of the article I released is \\"**Joe Biden Suggests** He Would Not Run Again\\"Do you understand why they used \\"Joe Biden Suggests.\\"It is because the journalist, the editors, and everyone who follows American politics understands beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is intentionally disseminated information from Biden to the public. That's how this shit works.Just tell me - after that story, did Biden get up on the podium all fire-and-fury and say \\"I will ABSOLUTELY run again in 2024!\\"No, he didn't, *because he didn't want people to think he was when his campaign released this information*. Otherwise he would have contradicted it immediately, because he would have been **clearly communicating his intent to be a two-term president**. He did not do that. Now, there are two scenarios: 1) This is genuinely what he wanted at the time; to be a one-term president. \\nOR\\n2) He intended to run again, but wanted to let the public believe he wouldn't, to shore up support from donors and voters who may have been worried he would try to run again.Either way, he said that in 2019. He allowed that to disseminate through the media, he allowed people to believe it - he owns it.","title":"Pelosi Won.

[A 2023 bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1679) proposing something along these lines had 29 co-sponsors, 8 of which were Republicans. The other thing is there is a large contingency of Democrats who do just genuinely believe that this would be a good thing and would happily (or also because they realize it would look bad if they didn't) vote for this type of legislation regardless of who introduces it. This does not need sweeping conservative support, if even a large minority of Republicans get on board with it there's a good chance it passes.Also the Supreme Emperor of the Grifters (Trump) has zero skin in the game on this issue; he's not a member of congress.

However, let me get into this:?\\n- I think the perception of government effectiveness is not something that everyone feels. Most people feel that their health insurance get 5-10% more expensive per year, that taxes rather rise than fall, that public pension schemes become more meager over time. And this while the state increases the share of redistributed wealth continuously (this is true for all western countries, besides of Argentina). Yet, I have a hard time to tell what my state is doing with the money I give them. And I give them a lot.?\\n- the reason that the government takes ever more is the demographics. Means, there is a very strong rational selling point for clones. A la hey, yeah, there are actually not enough work age people. Lets add some more to the pool. Of course they are not allowed to take your job - I could actually imagine people being okay with this, if they get an actual advantage out of it. If people think that they can benefit from this, they will welcome it?\\n- There are many things - especially in western societies - where tabboos got fully normalized. Gays adopting a child? That was only few years ago a total disgrace. Couples/gay couples using a donated egg cell and growing the baby in the body of a stranger? Only the pope gets worked up about this. A drag Queen playing Jesus in the last supper at Olympics? Again only the pope gets emotional - what I want to say: Western societies notmalized crazier things than cloning. Being against cloning for ethical reasons is strongly connected to the sacredness and exceptionality of human life argument. Which is a religious argument that no one really believes in anymore.?There might be pragmatic reasons, why cloning wont be done by government: Birth rates suddenly rise, AI robots become super adequate workers that fill the gaps of demography, people are ultimately too afraid to be replaced by clones.?However: If government see an opportunity to do this, they will. Because they can broaden their control over people and ultimately cement their reason to be. If people see more advantages in it for themselves than risks, they will accept it.?","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"And the Democrats wonder how Trump won??","title":"For the Democratic Party, it's still hip to be square."},{"text":"No doubt she'll poison her party from within till that day too.

I know it's a simplistic question, but think about it! I asked Chatgpt \\"why should we stop sending money to other countries and concentrate on our own\\" and this was the response:The argument to stop sending money to other countries and focus on domestic issues often centers on the idea of prioritizing national interests. Here are some reasons people give for this perspective:# 1. Addressing Domestic Problems* **Economic Challenges**: Many argue that resources should first go toward solving domestic issues such as homelessness, infrastructure repair, education, and healthcare before assisting other nations.\\n* **National Debt**: With high levels of national debt, some believe that foreign aid drains resources that could be used to strengthen the countrys economy.# 2. Ensuring National Security* Critics of foreign aid often contend that money sent abroad sometimes ends up in the hands of corrupt governments or groups that may misuse it, potentially causing security threats or fostering anti-American sentiment.# 3. Self-Sufficiency* Encouraging other nations to develop self-sustaining systems rather than relying on aid can, in theory, foster global independence and reduce long-term dependency on aid.# 4. Perceived Inefficiency* There is a perception that foreign aid doesnt always achieve its intended goals. Critics argue that funds are often wasted or mismanaged, failing to make a meaningful impact.# 5. Fairness to Taxpayers* Many taxpayers feel their hard-earned money should be used to benefit their communities directly rather than being sent overseas.# 6. Focus on Economic Growth* Redirecting foreign aid funds into programs like job creation, small business grants, or innovation within the U.S. could potentially stimulate the economy.# CounterargumentsWhile the above points present a case for prioritizing domestic needs, it's worth noting counterarguments:* Foreign aid can improve global stability, reducing conflicts and migration pressures.\\n* Economic partnerships and aid foster trade opportunities that can benefit the U.S.\\n* Humanitarian aid supports the countrys global leadership and moral standing.","title":"Joe Biden Threatens African Country, Will Deny $480 Million in Aid if It Doesnt Legalize Abortion"},{"text":"Nancy gonna push him down stairs","title":"Biden backs congressional stock-trading ban with just weeks left in office."},{"text":"Ruining the country one dollar in her pocket at a time.

They want to be told what to think, as shown by the rise in algorithm-driven, short-form content such as the stuff shown in TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, et cetera, and people (not everyone, but an insurmountable majority) want the slop to keep on coming, and if the slop tells them that the future for the country is through poorly thought out tariffs and privatizing public infrastructure, then let the slop rule us all.And at this point, you start to feel more and more that with a populace unwilling to do the hard work in maintaining a democracy, and that it has failed to represent the will of a large chunk of the country (none of the presidential candidates got over 50% of the vote, and I wouldve been skeptical at best of a Kamala win, and many voters have avoided voting on party lines, such as voting for Trump and going for progressive state level politicians). So if it takes another form of government to please the masses, then why bother to save a democracy that hasnt saved us?","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"Amazing how many lies are in one comment.","title":"2024 might be the year American democracy ended and fascism began"},{"text":"Hmmm, sounds like a lawsuit to me.

Creating conditions that help and  incentivize having children is much different than oppressing women. I'm a feminist, and indeed, I want women to have the freedom to have as many children as they would like (including none) in our current system- which is not currently the case. In advanced economies, say Sweden in your example, most parents want to give their children the same or better living standards that they experienced. This is increasingly more difficult and very expensive, even with generous parental policies like in Sweden. Children are generally a cost, and do not help with household production in the West. They of course will have a much lower likelihood of starving, but they also are incredibly unlikely to choose having children if they think they would come anywhere close to that.On the other side, in the Congo, or other developing economies, living standards and cost of living are much lower. It takes a lot less $ to improve living standards for your children than your own. Further, more children can actually be a net financial benefit. They can help with child care, elder care, farming, household tasks, and, in some cases (that aren't ideal) they work and earn an income. They also can take care of you as an elder, when you have no government sponsored care.I'm not saying that's how it \\"should\\" be, but the current reality is we have different experiences across countries. Things that are unacceptable in western countries are just part of life in others, often due to necessity.","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"I hope her kids pawn all her shit and buy dumb shit with the money.","title":"Nancy Pelosi just got Democrats to pick a 74-year old with esophagus cancer for the Oversight panel over AOC.

I generally think if you take person A and put them in person B's situation they're going to behave pretty much exactly the same way as person B. I think what we think of as personality is just emergent behaviour in response to stimulus.   Extroverted people are generally energized or destressed by social interaction and process thoughts and feelings by social interaction, whereas introverts find them tiring/stressful/unhelpfulAgain I think this is context specific. I may be generalising from my own experience and observations - but in fairness so is everyone else And my experience/observation is that whether one is energised or exhausted by the party has very little to do with the person and a lot to do with the party. But then if you have a string of energising/exhausting parties in a row you might fall into the trap of thinking that you are the sort of person that finds them energising/exhausting when actually it was just luck.

Charles Kushner the wealthy real estate developer who was convicted of several federal crimes in 2005[1][4]? Was Hunter Biden in the administration? ?? Charles Kushner's Conviction and PardonCharles Kushner pleaded guilty to 18 counts, including:- Tax evasion\\n- Making illegal campaign contributions\\n- Witness tamperingHe was sentenced to two years in federal prison in 2005[1]. The case gained notoriety due to the nature of the witness tampering charge. Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with federal authorities, and had the encounter secretly recorded. He then sent the video to his own sister, the wife of his brother-in-law[1][8].On December 23, 2020, President Trump issued a full and unconditional pardon to Charles Kushner[7]. The White House statement cited Kushner's philanthropic work and \\"record of reform and charity\\" as reasons for the pardon[1]. Controversy and CriticismThe pardon was controversial and drew criticism from various quarters:- Republican Senator Ben Sasse called it \\"rotten to the core\\"[1].\\n- Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who prosecuted Kushner as U.S. Attorney, had described Kushner's actions as \\"one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\\" he had ever prosecuted[8]. Recent DevelopmentsIn a surprising turn of events, President-elect Trump announced in November 2024 that he intends to nominate Charles Kushner as the United States ambassador to France for his second term[5][6]. This decision has raised concerns about potential nepotism and the appointment of individuals with criminal records to high-level diplomatic positions[6].Sources\\\\\\n[1] Trump Pardons Jared Kushner's Dad, Who Paid a Prostitute to ... https://people.com/politics/trump-pardons-jared-kushners-dad-manafort-stone/\\\\\\n[2] Who did Donald Trump pardon?

Ex  food stamps,  WIC,    housing etc.Essentially because of the issues  not just with slavery but also Jim Crow, there's about a $100,000 gap in generational wealth among African Americans compared to White Americans.    So just close the gap.  It's not that big of a deal and IMO if it would solve the problems created by institutional racism I think it's an easy simple solution.I'm white.   I'm more annoyed about having to fund wars and military stuff than I would be about this.  I certainly do NOT think they are asking WHITE people to pay black people.

Also ocean acidification means probably they'll be allowed to do deep sea mining and try to turn the ocean into a giant salt battery. Climate change is only a threat to normal people, people like me with Summer SAD, and rich people who have wealth that is tied in to a large labor force in some way.But that doesn't matter. Climate change is a different kind of problem. A fertility crisis is literally a supposed lack of children because children have value. But we can tell children actually have no value because of the child poverty rate. We can also tell because 1 billion children aged 2C17 years, have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or neglect in the past year. The premise of the argument is that children are an investment in the future, but if that was the case, our society would focus primarily on making sure that our investments were protected. A valuable resource gets more valuable when it's scarce, but we haven't seen that bear out with children. Like with climate change- we actually have made gas more expensive, made land more expensive, etc. We're seeing a time when everyone is obsessed with taking beach vacations and so on. The cost of water and beef and chicken and stuff have all gone up when they've gotten more scarce. When more things happen, we'll see the cost of electricity, water, and fruit and vegetables go up. We aren't doing that with children, instead we're trying to increase the likelihood of child poverty.","title":"CMV: The fertility rate crisis is the biggest crisis we'll face for the next 100 years."},{"text":"I definitely feel like it's them (russia) or china, and trump refused to comment on whether or not he had been briefed - which probably means that he was.  and the fact that *everyone* who knows is hiding it only raises my suspicion of them being bad news...I don't know how long this can stay hidden for.  it's only becoming more severe and recognized by the populous, and at some point, something's gotta happen to clue us in on what's happening.","title":"why am I not seeing anyone discuss how the drones could be from a foreign country?"},{"text":"Democrats will say this shit and then turn around and wonder why Americans think theyre out of touch.Its long past time we start tar and feathering the losers and the fossils out of the party.","title":"AOC defeated by Gerry Connolly in battle to lead House Oversight"},{"text":"At no point did I espoused that this is **the only issue** keeping down turnout in the Midwest.\\nI offered constructive criticism of the party's public perception and you turned it into partisan pandering over BernieVClinton.\\nYou chose to ignore the entirety of the message because you saw the word \\"Bernie\\" and turned into a reactionary dnc apologist.","title":"Democrats failed to address voters' 'despair', says top Biden official - Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm says Donald Trump listened better to suffering rust-belt communities"},{"text":"Well good luck with that, idiot.

High potency opioids have not.Opium has been around and used by humans since the BC times, much like alcohol. It wasnt the same as the high potency opioids prescribed today, but neither was the alcohol. For most of human history, the alcohol consumed by humans was low potency and in the 1-2% abv range. Its a false argument. The situation is just getting worse. Alcohol is stable situations.Is it? Both substances were used by humans for most of our existence and have been altered and manipulated in more recent history for increased potency. Theyre both extremely addictive and can cause severe withdrawal and even death. If your argument is that alcohol is in stable conditions, then I find it hard to believe you actually care about people being addicted and dying. When 3 times as many people die yearly from alcohol, you should be ringing the alarm bell on these highly addictive substances. I think opium should be legal and alcohol should be legal. Im talking about man made substances.Are you trolling? The alcohol consumed by humans is man-made. Fermentation can occur in the wild, but the bottle of vodka at your local store was distilled by humans.

They're medical conditions, and aren't meant to be used in the same context as things like Myers Briggs.I think the disconnect comes out in your books example.  When people say something like \\"you like books, you must be autistic,\\" they aren't really talking about a medical condition, they're co-opting the word to be used for a different purpose (or they don't know what they're talking about).  It happens with things like OCD as well - \\"you clean your kitchen so much, it must be your OCD\\".  There is a difference between liking a clean kitchen and having a compulsive need to do it because it's seems like the only thing you can do to stop yourself from thinking about darker thoughts.Those things may impact your personality, but they aren't formed because of your personality, if that makes sense.The other thing that I can see wrong is that personality types can do some good, just maybe not as much from a social aspect.  Not the best example, but if you're interviewing for an employee to fill a sales job who has to impress clients, maybe filtering out anyone who scores as introverted might make sense.  Some of them may have been fine at the job, but it may be more efficient to be able to filter out some results.","title":"CMV: Personality types do more harm than good."},{"text":"Annnnnnnd ,,,,,,,,nothing will happen.
