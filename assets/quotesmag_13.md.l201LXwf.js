We had nearly 30 candidates come out in 2020. And somehow, someway the next Democratic candidate wasn't even someone in the top 10 from the previous primary cycle. Harris didn't even make it to the primaries last time! She pulled out before they had started because she was not generating any buzz whatsoever. Even as a candidate who pulled out early, she still received less votes than people like Joe Sestak, John Delaney, Julian Castro, and Cory Booker. The person who ran the most similar campaign to Harris in 2020? Steve Bullock - both pulled out of the race within a day of each other and both only garnered a few hundred write votes. And yet, despite being an already clearly unpopular choice, in 2024 the Democrats decided to pivot to that as their choice. No primary, no nothing.

As for grant money, I wish more money flowed into universities and universities would be the ones funding researchers and projects. They are in the best position to be making these decisions.

But there are two big ones.The first is we've overproduced PhDs, which, due to high supply and low demand, has forced graduates into longer and longer time in the contingent academic market of post-docs, VAPs, and adjuncting, in which CVs get longer and longer and then become the competitive standard for tenure track roles. Now newly minted PhDs have publication records that would have been more representative of an Assistant Professor going up for T&amp;P just a few decades ago, and for an R1/R2 institution that's still not enough in many disciplines, so to the contingency market for possibly a decade it is. The problem is exacerbated by universities 1. Not investing adequate resources into doctoral professional development and 2. Not having a culture that promotes doctoral professional development and career diversity. Many PIs/advisors have very progressive views about career diversity and understand their supervisees aren't supposed to be mini-me's and can take their skills to the non-academic market, but unfortunately, there are still many who live in lala fantasy world and don't know how bad the academic market is and, at most, will only give perfunctory attention to professional development if required to if their research group is funded by a training grant that requires it. Every so often, Howard Gardner will write a completely tone deaf article for The Chronicle in which he pontificates from his ivory Harvard tower about how working in an academic career is the gold standard that every PhD should strive and a pox on you if you don't agree.The other issue is the preoccupation with \\"novel\\" research. This is a major problem in the social sciences, particularly psychology, a discipline in which the replication crisis has been well documented. Rather than focuses research programs on a handful of theories and research strains with promise and building out their respective discourses and literatures, everyone is trying to blaze a new trial, which creates more and more studies that don't get replicated because everyone else is trying to be \\"novel.\\" Since CV length, H index, first authorship, and all of the other academic vanity metrics have taken precedent in defining a research career, constructing knowledge with longevity doesn't happen.","title":"Peter Higgs: I wouldn't be productive enough for today's academic system"},{"text":"Yeah because ruining trade with our key domestic trade partners, Canada, and Mexico, will totally help us be less dependent on countries such as China.

Basically, since the last breakthrough in 1997, string theory has been basically stuck. The main problem if I can still explain it correctly years after reading this stuff, is that there's a huge number of possible \\"string theories\\", each describing a universe with different topography and different properties. The math necessary to derive predictions from these universes and figure out which one we actually live in currently doesn't exist and has resisted our best attempts to find it.The breakthroughs in the 90's brought tons of attention onto String theory, and with it lots of funding and researchers to work on string theory. From all of this effort... Came pretty much nothing. Barely any advancement has happened since. So many people are bitter about all this wasted effort. String theory is thus emblematic of the wider problem of theoretical Physics treading water for decades.There's a different strain of criticism which I personally don't like which calls string theory unscientific because it's unfalsifiable. I don't like this criticism because the lack of practical predictions is a bug, not a feature. String theorists are trying to derive predictions, and the theory wasn't chosen for its lack of predictions. This criticism is more relevant to the various multiverse theories that are more fundamentally non-predictive. There's this strawman of string theory as \\"self-proven by its mathematical elegance\\" instead of by predictions but I don't think serious scientists believe that.For completeness, I'll also mention that there is another criticism of moving the goalpost that is commonly applied to particle Physics by Sabine Hossenfelder and the like.

I just read the article, and either someone is purposefully being disingenuous or doesn't understand the genesis and functional meaning of neoliberalism.   Moreover, what does the term centrist neoliberalism even mean? There is no such thing as centrist neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, since the 1950s and on, think Mont Pelerin Society, has become decidedly a utopian right-wing idea. It is fatally flawed, starting with this idea that all of us, without fail, are rational utility maximizers. If that were the case, the world's richest and most confused incel, Elon Musk, wouldnt have driven a company he paid 40 odd billion for -down to 8 billion. There's a failure of rational utility-maximizing right there by the world's supposed genius, and the ordinary person is supposed to carry the burden of being a perfect consumer in the Neoliberal utopian ideals set forth by Hayek to Friedman. Seriously?As I grow older, I watch this world disintegrate because people believe there is a utopian ideal of anything. This is the basic pessimistic idea that makes a true centrist. This is why so few identify as centrists without partisan beliefsit's all work, dirty, and empirical. What you do have, however, is a growing population of people who have become willfully ignorant and will defend their right to be that with unmitigated violence.

Ill be long since dead, and people will wildly paddle left and then wildly paddle right and wonder why their boat sits in one place and makes no progress. They will point fingers at each other, laying blame on the other side for all the evils in the world.The oligarchs, autocrats, and dictators of the world will forever be slapping each other's asses as the middle and lower classes annihilate their freedoms and hope.We live in the age of stupidity, where everything that was fought for during the French Revolution is quite literally being handed back to the ruling class.

Tune out the noise. You really don't need to know about every time some federal politician holds a speech (or as we say today: \\"Destroyed and demolished the $OTHER party\\").?\\n2. Things move slowly even today. Checking in to the news cycle once a day / every two days is usually enough to be very well informed.\\n3. Disengage emotionally. Take the hyperbole and exaggerations out of what is being said and deal with the subject matter at hand. It's helpful to just acknowledge developments (good ones and bad ones) calmly because wild emotions are not great at making big decisions for you and your loved ones\\n4. Keep track of local developments. Even in very homogeneous communities, the city/council can make impactful decisions one way or the other.

If they were afraid of his base, they wouldn't run at all. No, it's more about wanting to control his base and win their favor through Trump. As for not convicting him in 2021, like I said, they want his base to vote for them, so they let him slide. They believed that was the end of Trump and that no one would ever vote for him again or that he'd end up in prison. When it became clear that the system wasn't going to clean up their mess for them, they had to jump back into the cesspool with Trump. True, they SHOULD have convicted him in 2021, but the GOP is shortsighted, ignorant and lazy. They had a chance to get him from around their necks, but now they are shackled to him as long as he draws breath. However, should Trump kill or harm anyone, especially a political figure, that's a road they won't go down for one reason and one reason only: if he did it to an opponent, he'll do it to them too and they have no idea of knowing what will or won't trigger him. Safest best is to remove him from power and try to save what little face they can with the public. The public really won't be lulled into acceptance. This isn't Russia where killing of political opponents has been commonplace for nearly 100 years now. There's no taste for it here and it won't be tolerated. Plus, the media will SWARM on it like piranha to a piece of meat. It'll be EVERYWHERE with 24/7 coverage.

He's protected by them, but when it comes to him telling them what to do, they will ignore him. Why? They don't need him, he doesn't finance him and they sure as hell don't respect him. Here's the problem as to why Trump got away with not being branded an insurrectionist; Clause 3 of the 14th amendment is too vague on key issues:\\\\#1. Who determines if someone is guilty of insurrection?\\\\#2. Who enforces the decision of someone being an insurrectionist?\\\\#3. What determines if someone is an insurrectionist?The ruling of the SCOTUS is that an individual state cannot determine if someone is an insurrectionist. If they can, then say if in a future election a democrat is running, and the state of Mississippi decides to kick them off of the ballot because they believe that person is an insurrectionist, and they convince a bunch of other red states to do the same. It would cause election chaos as you'd have states kicking candidates off of ballots on made up insurrection claims. Basically, while Clause 3 of the 14th amendment is well meaning, it's inherently broken as it lacks key defining parameters by which someone can be held accountable as an insurrectionist. So, when people cite Trump's case about not being held accountable as an insurrectionist, it's not because the SCOTUS is in Trump's pocket, it's because the clause is broken and is, technically, unenforceable and too open to abuse in its current state. You would have literally had Red states kicking Joe Biden off of the ballot because their judges said he was an insurrectionist while blue states would have kicked Trump off because their judges said he was an insurrectionist with no national consensus as to which one actually was because no grounds for determining and executing such a judgement had been defined.

So it is **NOT** a neutral action no matter how hard people try to delude themselves with this take.

This is WHY we need term limits. America is pretty blase towards corruption, but only to a point. After about 12 years (2 senate terms or 3 terms in the House), about 90-95% of modern politicians hit a level of perceived corruption even Americans find abhorrent. Perceived as in, I could make a claim and enough Americans will believe it. Look at Alex Jones' Adrenochrome claims. Believable because we've got enough old people who've been in congress 30, 40, even 50 years that people believe they'd do ANYTHING to continue to hold onto power. Which, in some cases on both sides of the aisle, is true. FFS, Nesle, our largest bottled water maker, has paid both political parties to rule that Clean Drinking WATER was not a human right.That said...The biggest flaws are something that nobody's willing to look at: Overconfidence. The Democratic Party believes it's own hype. In my state, they actually believed that Kamala could win by playing the \\"I've got a vagina and melanin\\" card. Like the Kamala Ads here came just short of her appearing on screen and literally saying this. Their campaign offices couldn't answer a single question about her political stances, and were pompous assholes with a superiority complex. They act like the tactics that worked when America was financially fine, when most people could worry about things besides \\"How am I going to feed/clothe/shelter myself/my family\\" would still work.

It's a podcast hosted by a dumb ape who will platform pretty much anythingWhich in today's media environment makes it a center-of-right podcast.

But he platforms far right extremists and plenty of mainstream right wingers along with everyone else, and the dude endorsed Trump so there's a pretty clear lean even if it's not some ideologue thing. The listenership of the show also leans right-wing male.Her not going on Rogan isn't what cost the election of course but it's a symptom of the Democrat problem where they campaign like it's 1988 instead of 2024.This is correct. However, what's implicit in your statement here is that the electorate is dumb dumb stupid and needs to be pushed like sheep to vote against an American hitler. This is apparently correct.

As an organizer in a swing state that flipped red I think that had we not tailored our message to different groups or tried to appeal to the entire coalition, wed have lost in a wipeout landslide like 1980.Messaging is obviously not our only path to success but it always plays a role and can be improved. Theres always a new angle to consider and Im sure that there are some very highly paid staff working on it as we speak. And dealing with the right wing misogynist media environment is a part of what we have to deal with when it comes to messaging.I think that the media environment is not so much an amplifier as it is like a radio or tv broadcast in that it can be hijacked or metaphorically modified to amplify the opposite of the intended point. Right wingers do this all the time when they do stuff like, when Obama talks about a public option he really means death panels. The right wing media at the time amplified it but the code stuck even when Democrats talked about it and the reactionary messaging set up the crushing defeat of 2010.Like it wasnt something that should be the basis for a campaign, but calling culture war Republican talking points weird would be a good way that this can be countered. Trump is immune to it because he ironically avoids new types of crazy and is just the same type of crazy he has always been, albeit amplified. But if we used it on Ron Florida is where woke goes to die Desantis, his buzzwordy and more shrill type of crazy would be seen as weird by the American public even when he had the spotlight on him.Maybe the media environment can be turned against someone in addition to refined tailoring, as defining a candidate or a policy is often the most important step of mounting a decent defense or attack.Just some extra thoughts.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"Look at my last posts","title":"Central Valley Democratic challenger Adam Gray takes lead in last uncalled House race"},{"text":"a lot of that inflation was simply companies using excuses to make record profits.

Unfortunately, 5% of the population chose to be cartoonishly evil, going full-on psycho-cannibal mode and attacking the 95% that didn't.

The majority wanted to fight but I think maybe 70 - 80 of us were actually good PVP players. Lets just say it is really easy for a small group to hit and run attack a large group especially a group where every single person is not willing to put them into the dirt.

We are human beings, we doubt, we question, and we change our views from time to time. I worked as an organizer for the Harris campaign and the 2024 Biden campaign for seven months and youd be surprised how many people disagreed with administration policy from within the field office. Id often get volunteers who were passionate about democrats but maybe they voted their conscience on a ballot question or a judicial candidate in a way that goes against the party line. And thats ok. Politics is not meant to turn people into robots.And the spite voters are always there. There is no more universal human emotion than some flaming hatred against a certain outgroup or scapegoat. We can avoid prejudice towards marginalized communities but Im sure that many of us feel a genuine hatred of certain Republicans or a part of their coalition like the rich. I dont think that anyone in the history of the country has not voted to some degree out of spite for the other guy. Like Im sure that you had great reasons to vote for Dems but how much of your vote was motivated by anger against the Republican Party? A portion of mine was for sure.People are complex and frustrating and fascinating to an equal degree, and politics is the center of that. I agree with you that we must keep hope as some appear to vote against their interests or get swayed to the other side, but please recognize that these people are doing something common and natural, and while you are allowed to view them as annoying, we can develop ways to appeal to them.The field of rhetoric, communication, and messaging is so vast that our culture has barely scratched the surface of what is possible and how to appeal to people.

There are many in Iran that are opposed to the oppression of their government and I do not speak ill of the Iranian people. Nor of Muslims. Seeing as you know very little about Islam and Muslims I will teach you - and I hope you are humble enough to learn. I respect Muslims and their devotion and I am perfectly willing to call out other  warring religions as I have already done in response to your post. I also hope you are humble enough to see that this is a Holy War and to really understand it, you have to understand all sides prophecy and why they think the way they do. Just because someone points it out does not make it Islamaphobia. Since its inception the IRGC has also been the main organ for advancing the clergys objective of exporting the Islamic Revolution abroad. This is confirmed by Irans 1979 constitution, which establishes the IRGC as an ideological army and mandates it with an ideological mission of jihad in Gods way; that is extending sovereignty of Gods law throughout the world. Unlike the regular Iranian army (the?*Artesh*), whose primary objective is to protect Irans borders, the IRGCs principal mission is to protect the Shia clergy and advance the Islamic Revolution at home and abroad.The Quran claims that Muslims worship the same God as the Jews (e.g. Sura 29:26). Muhammad asserts the Quran is a confirmation of the scriptures that God gave to the children of Israel, not that the scriptures in the Bible are not valid (the italicized footnote comment is from Quran.com): We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. And to Allah we all submit. (Sura 2:136) Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures.1 (Sura 2:41) Footnote - 1 This refers to the passages in the Torah and the Gospel So, Muhammad taught that people should believe the Bible and that his teachings confirmed it, not that they overrode it.Muslims believe that following the teachings of the prophets, regardless of their specific faith tradition, is essential for salvation. Sincere Jews, Christians, and followers of other Abrahamic faiths who adhere to the teachings of their respective prophets (e.g. Moses for the Jews and Jesus for the Christians) may find salvation according to Islamic beliefs (cf. also Sura 2:177). Islam, however, sees few people in such groups as sincere.?Remember? when Allah said, O Jesus! I will take you and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers 15 above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. (Sura 3:55)Now, when it comes to prophetic events, most Muslims seem to be looking for a leader who will arise in these end times, who is sometimes called the Imam Mahdi: In a 2012 Pew poll, in most of the countries surveyed in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, half or more Muslims believe that they will personally witness the appearance of the Mahdi. In Islamic eschatology, the messianic figure known as the Mahdi (the Guided One) will appear before **the Day of Judgment**. This expectation is most common in Afghanistan (83 percent), followed by Iraq (72), Tunisia (67), and Malaysia (62).41 Mahdi means the Guided One. The Imam Mahdi is believed to be a leader who will unite Muslims and eliminate Islamic poverty.The day of judgment will only arise , when Ar-Rum are the dominant civilization of the world. (Hadith from Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Naysaburi209) Ar-Rum literally means Roman. But in the above context, this means the European western civilization will be the dominate civilization in the end.  Basically, a European world order will replace the Anglo-American dominated one of the past couple of centuries.Although the belief in a Mahdi apparently had been a minority Sunni view and has had rejection by some Sunni authorities, the Muslim World League issued a fatwa in October of 1976 commanding Sunni Muslims to believe in the concept of an Islamic Savior called the Mahdi.222 It should also be noted that some Sunni groups want a Caliph to arise and rule an Islamic caliphate that includes all the territory from northwest Africa through the Middle East and even further east.223 However, Sunnis (who vastly outnumber the Shiite Muslims) should not change their anti-Mahdi views (various Sunni scholars also agree224) or want such a Caliph, because of what the Bible shows will happen. Shiites also would do well to recognize that just because someone may claim to be the final 104 Imam (or Mahdi), does not mean that God will agree that he should be followed. Neither Sunnis nor Shiites should support one who will appear to possibly be the final Imam/Caliph in the next decade or so. A major leader of Islamic lands will apparently make such claims and rise up, but will be defeated soundly.So to go back to my point on Iran, mainly Shia Muslims, funding the Houthis, Hezzbolah and the Palestinians, it is about their prophesied Imam Madhi and the Day of Judgement.","title":"CMV: Muslims are the new Jews"},{"text":"And people claim that feminist isnt hurting rights of men.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"He doesn't give a flying fuck about the economy.He'll make provisions for the industries that properly \\"donate\\" to his golf courses or whatever This is just good old-fashioned mob style extortion.","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"Kamala tried Her handlers refused to let them discuss immigration, marijuana and other shit.

Do we work with the societal bias against female-coded traits and ideas among certain voters, or try to change it?  I know it's not quite so simple, but look at it that way for a moment.To be clear, I think we absolutely need to continue to have policies that appeal to blue-collar men, and it's always smart to tailor your message to your audience.  There's an inherent weakness in the idea that if we just use the right messaging we'll be OK, though.Let's say the next Dem candidate for President does this perfectly.  They have the best, sharpest, most dude-friendly message imaginable, and use it at every factory in the Rust Belt.Imagine for a second that you're a GOP strategist tasked with defeating this Democrat.  What would you do?To me, it's pretty simple - go on all the shows, go to a bunch of rallies, and just lay on the Trump-style rhetoric.  Play up how manly and tough you are, and talk about how Dems do nothing but talk about gender and identity politics.  Do you think it'd work?  I do!  Because there's already a huge apparatus to send that lie all over the place, and no messaging can break through that.  My proof of this is pretty simple: Harris and Walz already did exactly what you're proposing, and look at what happened.So while you're right that we've got to modify our message for our audience, that's not enough.  Because Republicans already have a warehouse of bullshit they can keep going back to.  See Episode 3 for more details on this.You're right, but we also have to do the hard work.  We've got to question the ideas that lead to bias against women, and help the guys in our lives question them as well.

Sure, you could throw in \\"have access to birth control and abortions\\", but it doesn't even really come down to that, because we see exceptions where those things don't matter.If you run a simple scatter plot of \\"gender inequality vs fertility rate\\", you will find strong correlation (R squared is 0.64 in the data I looked at) with almost no exception. Any demographic or nation with a [gender inequality index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Inequality_Index) below 0.2 does _not_ reproduce itself. Doesn't matter what men do, doesn't matter what men or women think.Actually, there were two exceptions in the data set, so I'll just mention them. Israel and Kazakhstan. Israel's birthrate is supported by its fundamentalist Haredi population as well as an ideology that believes it must reproduce in order to survive (due to constant threat of war on all sides). I can't speak for Kazakhstan, but it's probably a blip on the radar before their women stop having kids too.This was a known problem in the ancient world. Civilizations that allowed women to inherit money and land from their dead husbands were doomed for collapse. This happened in Ancient Sparta, for instance.So, let's be crystal clear: you don't need to \\"fix\\" gender ideology in order to change the material circumstances of birth rates. You need to change the material circumstances of women, who will then have different incentives, and birth rates could then go up. This trend is not directly driven by ideology. The only ideology at play is the indirect drive for women to start their adult lives by becoming educated and pursuing a career. That's what needs to change.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"I think Dems need to actually touch the grass at some point.

Sure, they talk about global warming, and the plights of all the identity/minority groups, but here's the problem with that: The AVERAGE VOTER only cares about those things when they've got lots of extra spending money, fresh drinkable water coming in through their pipes, and can afford to buy a house/new car instead of being stuck permarenting/taking public transport.

Because, even though there may be only a handfull of titles at launch, and most people tend to go back to the old systems for a while unless there's backwards compatability... unless one or more of the new systems' games is like a Ghosts of Tsushima, is because of the status that having the newest/best brings.

The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an eternal law.","title":"Liberals Are Finally Admitting Bernie Is Right | After another devastating loss to Donald Trump, a few liberal pundits are begrudgingly admitting it  Bernie Sanders was right."},{"text":"You realize project 2025 is named for that because it only needs one year to enact everything","title":"'Tired.

But Jewish identity doesnt conform to Western categories, despite centuries of attempts by society to shoehorn it in. This makes sense, because Judaism predates Western categories. Its not quite a religion, because one can be Jewish regardless of observance or specific belief. (Einstein, for example, was proudly Jewish but not religiously observant.) But its also not quite a race, because people can convert in! Its not merely a culture or an ethnicity, because that leaves out all the religious components.

I make it a habit to follow the news on both sides of the spectrum. It's about the only way you can come to some kind of reasonable conclusion about what the facts might actually be. One of the funniest parts about this election to me is there's nothing that can be cried about as far as how the process went down. You can't complain that he barely won the electoral college, or that he didn't win the popular vote. You also can't continue to keep insulting the electorate and believe it is going to help you politically. When the leaders of the party come out and start insulting their core constituency and some sort of weird maybe we can shame them into voting the way we want them to vote it's always going to backfire I don't know how to tell you this but what you assume to be an insult toward me something that just makes me laugh, it's the realization that you're unable to examine what's right in front of you in any way other than how it confirms the beliefs you've been propagandized into accepting For the record, I have never voted for the president elect, I have always viewed him as somewhat of a joke.

In 2020, that number was 1.1%, a slightly smaller number that could be pandemic-influenced (more mail-in ballots, etc.) In 2012, the number was 1.6%. Bullet ballots would not be enough to change the result of the election.In Pennsylvania, I looked at the Attorney General's race, because it's held in presidential years. In 2024, 2.2% voted for President but not AG.  In 2020, that number was 1.6%.

If there was an intent to stuff ballots for Trump, they'd have every reason to make sure that they got Republican Senators in all of those states, too - and while Casey was defeated in Pennsylvania, Elissa Slotkin and Tammy Baldwin won their races in MI and WI. For Michigan in particular, we have an option to \\"straight-party vote\\" and select everyone from that party - so why make a false bullet ballot when they could select \\"Republican\\" and get Mike Rogers for Senate, as well as perhaps other Republicans in downballot races?I would love to believe that there were some grand conspiracy, and we were the rightful winners. But sometimes the truth is much simpler - Harris was a candidate associated with the incumbency in a year where incumbents and their parties suffered historic losses worldwide. The far-right has risen in power in many countries, and it's to our benefit to examine why - and attempt to reach the voters who are being brainwashed by their nationalist jingoism - rather than dismissing it as a stolen election.() I left off 2016 because Michigan did not have a Senate election or other notable statewide election.() The number for 2024's Senate race was only 1.0%; however, since there was no Senate race in 2020, I chose to look at AG races instead.","title":"Central Valley Democratic challenger Adam Gray takes lead in last uncalled House race"},{"text":"So basically Republicans are targeting journalists and then have the gall to tell Biden You better pardon our pet hacker or else youre targeting journalists.","title":"Reps McGovern, Massie urge Biden to pardon Julian Assange to 'send a clear message' on press freedom"},{"text":"Attempting the same while expecting different results?

That is, I think that is a lot of disagreement amongst democrats about what good economic policy is because: A) economics as a field is actually incredibly complicated and even experts (in fact, especially experts) are uncertain about (and will disagree about) how large parts of the economy function and B) by becoming the party of expertise, the Democratic Party has ended up home to the majority of economists and policy wonks, many of whom have credible, well-supported disagreements about economics (and of course, there are the cranks who want their say as well and who the experts are unwilling to capitulate to). A party like this can be deeply concerned about passing good economic policy (and in fact probably generates better economic policy than the alternative), but be extremely bad at presenting a unified front in terms of messaging about what that policy should be. Social policy positions, by contrast, are much less fractured, as the party mainstream mostly agree on values of equality, racial justice, lgbt rights etc. (Yes, there is some disagreement about the details of that social policy and there are wedge issues like Gaza, but there is much more consensus here than there is about the economy), and so it becomes much easier to identify these positions with the Democratic Party. (This is also why I think Democrats can be well served by focusing on economic issues in which there is expert consensus eg. Housing and YIMBYism).My less generous theory is that the gap can be attributed to misogyny: social justice is seen as feminine and therefore trivial, economic policy is seen as masculine and therefore important. The Democratic Party is coded as feminine and therefore concerned with social justice, the Republican Party is coded as masculine and therefore concerned with economic policy (ignore the fact that democrats have a much deeper well of economic expertise to draw on and actual economists are overwhelmingly democrats).","title":"The Perception Gap That Explains American Politics - Americans overwhelminglybut, mistakenlybelieve that Democrats care more about advancing progressive social issues than widely shared economic ones [Gift Article]"},{"text":"Yea prices may have gone down in your area but it has nothing to do with trump.

Awhile back, we had some especially nasty attacks on black-owned businesses in Bellingham. There was an enduring unwillingness to discuss it head on, spread among people and perspectives.      \\nThose of us who refused to budge on the issue also came from a large swathe of our tent.    For me, the tell was that it then, as has been before, the desire to move on when issues of racial, sexual, or other visible/invisible minority issues are brought up.   \\nEven when there is not something *directly* we can do about it, I consider the refusal to entertain the idea a recurrent tell.2\\\\. Same as it ever was, listen. My approach offline is to let people exhaust themselves, and then talk about one or two things they seem to care about. I use the word *seem,* and I really want to emphasise it. Some of these people are winnable; some of them are just 'having a bad day,' and while that never excuses anything, a light nudge can do a lot of good.Others don't run out of steam, because they aren't using tells or dogwhistles but a bullhorn, and what they really want is a platform to enshrine their beliefs to anyone in range.   \\nIn that case, I usually just ask if there is a point to anything they're saying, and figure out whether to try any other approach or move on.3\\\\. Recently, I had someone bring up (of course) Hilary Clinton, and talk about how she was so 'preachy.' I asked what she - the person I was talking with - meant, and she didn't really know, because she hasn't heard Hilary Clinton speak. Not once.   The Hilary Clinton she knows is through 'funny' 'memes' from right-wing sources, and hours of youtube content consumed in a similar fashion to older right-wing voters consuming Fox News.So I asked what she didn't like about Clinton, and she didn't really know. But she was angry at me for asking, because her friends didn't like Clinton, and friends never lie or give bad information.I didn't press the issue; I did mention she might like some other Democrats and their plans for healthcare, which she tentatively agreed on before I described something which she found pretty good - healthcare being a prime concern of hers.    \\nThe revealing that I was talking about, [you guessed it...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993?useskin=vector)Did make her think for a bit, but I don't think she'll change her mind.  \\nWe only see each other sometimes, at events like tonight.    \\nShe will talk to other people, and those people's regular opinions will take precedence.I think, sometimes, issues get *dismissed,* even among vulnerable communities, because admitting people care is difficult.    \\nAdmitting you might have not had a full understanding is difficult, even when people are working with you, and not against you.    \\nThere's no easy way to solve that, either; I don't think it can be solved.   \\nMy *hope* is that our conversation, which never got too heavy, rattles around in her mind into the future.   \\nBut we'll see, as ever; we'll see.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"...

People blame 'the DNC' or 'the DEMS' or 'beltway elites', but...    \\nI know that these are just organisations of people. People like you, and like me.     \\nAnd more than that, I know what I - and what most of my peers - sound like when we talk, or more accurately, *listen* to voters.   \\nMuch as I value long discussions, that's not the approach we take.We spoke about housing, a lot; we spoke about the economy, a lot.  \\nWe spoke about individual rights, often tailored to voters we talked to.   \\nBoth here, in Whatcom, and in other places I volunteered. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.     \\nAnd yet people listened, and they were enthused.  \\nI do not believe they were faking it.But they cared far *more* about hurting other people.One of the things I've gotten a lot, now, in the aftermath is pushback and anger.  \\n\\"Don't preach at me!\\" \\"Did you want me to swear *FEALTY* to the DEMS?\\" \\"It's Kamala's fault for being the nom!\\" etc.But the places it comes from the most are not Dems, but people who I - again -    \\nSuspected sat out at the end of the day, some of whom have admitted to voting for Trump and/or republicans.       \\nI don't judge them when we're talking, though I do have my feelings.            \\nBut I listen, and treat them like adults, and separate what I firmly believe, and have believed for my entire life.What I will focus on instead, is going over your suggestion.      \\nIn the short term, that *will not work* if people making these decisions care more about hurting someone, even themselves, than helping anyone.In the *long* term, that is what we've done and have had to do.   \\nBut, unfortunately...   \\nThere are a lot of voters who need to feel directly impacted before they're willing to act on the things they *say* they care about.Always, when thinking about this topic, I return to an old acquaintance of mine.    \\nOne I can't jettison, and do more good by checking in on, but a person I think it would be very hard for anyone of us here to call a friend.He does not *actively* hate anyone who is not like himself. But inactive hatred remains hatred -And, whenever his life is good, his #1 value, how he has *always* voted, is against the party in power - Dems -     \\nAnd locally, for whomever he feels is going to cause other people pain.  \\nI am not exaggerating how he thinks, here, either.     \\nWhen he has good circumstances, all he talks about is how 'others' are going to take those away from them, and also how rough he has it.On top of everything else, his union salary is high, and I would argue the reason he *likes* the union he's in because it feels exclusionary to him, which itself seeps over to other members he interacts with. (Which is, itself, a problem.)Now, the caveat; the moment republicans screw over the nation, which has happened every time they're in power, he's willing to vote Democrats up and down the ballot.  \\nThe harsh words are mostly gone, but he is *begging* anyone, someone, to save *him.*   I do not have any delusions he is going to change his mind, but we work with what we have.I'm sorry for going on here, but I wanted to add an older perspective on this one.     \\nThere are a lot of people that *say* they want 'union hall/construction site stump speeches' -    \\nWhile knowing that's an acceptable way to appear, among the company of their more left-wing friends.      \\nThey might nod and agree that the dignity of work sounds like a nice line, but they are not voting for Sherrod Brown, unfortunately.Which gets us back to the long term.   \\nIn the long term, our ability to reach these voters depends on people like you and me.   \\nAnd we can; but a lot of how we reach them is *parties in power flipping.*   \\nObviously, that's not sustainable. However, I think it's just as important to understand that there are a good chunk of voters that -  \\nRight now, in the world we live in -   \\nAre at that place as their starting point, right now.I believe that our long term goal is, unfortunately, doing what we've done since I've started this work.     \\nPatiently working with the voters, but understanding that what they say they want and their actions may be very divorced from one another.        \\nUsing that work - and whatever approach works best with the voters who are regulars - to make them more receptive to our ideas and ideals.      \\nNot only in their words, but in their *actions* as well.*Fortunately,* I do think that's possible, as it has been in the past. Hard, yes, difficult, absolutely.      \\nAnd it will involve a lot of what you write as code-switching (interesting, I've only ever heard that in the context of language!), but also -     \\nRecognising that the people we are trying to win over may seem responsive, may *genuinely listen,* and then -On the night, do the exact opposite of what they said and implied, and blame us, while resting peacefully, without a doubt in their mind.Sorry for going on, I'll sum it up as -      \\nDo what works for you, but *please don't lose hope* if what feels like it should work, what *feels* like it's getting a good response and *is* working...  \\nIs ultimately let down by voters, themselves.    A lot of what we do is not just finding what works best, but enduring through that kind of terrain -   \\nAnd I know firsthand how frustrating that kind of defeat after genuinely good energy and connections can feel.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"No one elected her though she didnt choose this?","title":"Kamala Harris video goes viral, raises eyebrows"},{"text":"Many, many people:Not even enough to win the popular vote.","title":"Barron Trump 'Smarter' Than Kamala Harris' CampDemocrat Megadonor"},{"text":"Shes not black lol","title":"Kamala Harris video goes viral, raises eyebrows"},{"text":"DEIsny, it seems, has been uniquely hellbent on falling on that sword; Walt only knows why.You'd think they'd have learned something from a freaking Indiana Jones movie getting its box-office ass kicked on **July 4th weekend** by a controversial independent flick.in looking it up a clue was that the Google AI recommended this movie for kids over 10 because of how?*complicated*?the plot could be for younger kids.I must be missing your point here.","title":"What better day to think of Children's toys"},{"text":"right?

Have you noticed that these examples I have given you, a few scattered throughout your post are from the last month.  Not drudged up from history, and again - I say this with the full admission that there will be more Christians persecuting Jews and Muslims in the future. You say you are a humanist correct? I have provided a quote from a Muslim Scholar, you did not respond to it and maybe it got lost in the multitude so I will post it again, this is from 2014 which shows a pattern of Palestinian behavior on how they sacrifice their children and blame the Jews, this is FROM a Muslim Scholar, him calling out the truth of the matter is not Islamaphobic in any sense of the word. It is speaking truth.**Sheikh Ahmad Adwan, who introduces himself as a Muslim scholar who lives in Jordan, said on his personal Facebook page that there is no such thing as Palestine in the Koran. Allah has assigned the Holy Land to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment (Koran, Sura 5 C The Sura of the Table, Verse 21), and We made the Children of Israel the inheritors (of the land) (Koran, Sura 26 C The Sura of the Poets, Verse 59).**I say to those who distort their Lords book, the Koran: From where did you bring the name Palestine, you liars, you accursed, when Allah has already named it The Holy Land and bequeathed it to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment. There is no such thing as Palestine in the Koran. Your demand for the Land of Israel is a falsehood and it constitutes an attack on the Koran, on the Jews and their land. Therefore you wont succeed, and Allah will fail you and humiliate you, because Allah is the one who will protect them (i.e. the Jews).The sheikh added: The Palestinians are the killers of children, the elderly and women. They attack the Jews and then they use those (children, the elderly and women) as human shields and hide behind them, without mercy for their children as if they werent their own children, in order to tell the public opinion that the Jews intended to kill them. This is exactly what I saw with my own two eyes in the 70s, when they attacked the Jordanian army, which sheltered and protected them. Instead of thanking it (the Jordanian army), they brought their children forward to (face) the Jordanian army, in order to make the world believe that the army kills their children. This is their habit and custom, their viciousness, their having hearts of stones towards their children, and their lying to public opinion, in order to get its support.It is worth mentioning, that the above mentioned sheikh visited Israel and met Jewish religious scholars. The Israel in Arabic site conducted an interview with him, in which he said that the reason for his openness towards the Jewish people comes from my acknowledgment of their sovereignty on their land and my belief in the Koran, which told us and emphasized this in many places, like His (Allahs) saying Oh People (i.e the Children of Israel), enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned unto you (Koran, Sura 5 C The Sura of the Table, Verse 21), and His saying We made the Children of Israel the inheritors (of the land) (Koran, Sura 26 C The Sura of the Poets, Verse 59) and many other verses.He (Adwan) added: (The Jews) are peaceful people who love peace, who are not hostile and are not aggressors, but if they are attacked, they defend themselves while causing as little damage to the attackers as possible. It is an honor for them that Allah has chosen them over the worlds C meaning over the people and the Jinns until the Day of Judgment. I made the reasons for Allahs choice clear in my books and pamphlets. When Allah chose them, He didnt do so out of politeness, and He wasnt unjust other peoples, it is just that they (the Jews) deserved this. (Cohen E.

Today I just feel like a rational person who exists without constantly feeling like I've been wronged by everyone I come into contact with. I walked away from that life and my daughter and I have much healthier relationships with each other and our family. I don't feel lonely in a room full of people in the same way I used to. I let things fulfill me and stop focusing on what I don't have. I think you are 100% correct and it's definitely disheartening but I know if I can snap out of it, others can too. I still have many progressive views but I am much more open minded and I really thought I was the most open minded before. I have more empathy than I was telling myself I did. I'm just less miserable.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"So, I'm definitely not going to be able to give you information on current FAFSA best practises. However, what I can tell you is that - while I do thinking going after FAFSA is on the incoming administration's agenda -    \\nIt is far better to apply for it than not.   \\nAt the very least, you'd apply for it and get temporary aid you may or may not have to pay back, as opposed to... Getting no aid from FAFSA.Realistically, it's likely to be a harder thing to do.    \\nGiven your state, assuming you're in Maine for college, I would imagine there might be a temporary safety net put into place if Trump and the republicans succeed in weakening or removing FAFSA.But generally speaking, we try to put these resources in place so they're used; using them is part and parcel of our fight, just like expanding them is.   \\nYou using them is another link in the chain you can use to talk to friends and family who voted for the wrong people, or whom didn't vote.And - of course! - they help you, too!So I'd very strongly advise applying.   \\nUnfortunately, nobody here can tell the future, but I think what we've seen so far suggests a a fairly contentious administration, which has effects on the administration's ability to do the things they want to do.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"2/3 of the country are just fine.

The judicial system perpetuates this system of repression, and the monarchy carefully manages it to ensure that religious dissent is swiftly and rigorously punished.Systematic purges of judges and their replacement by more radical justices could be impacting ongoing legal cases against religious minorities and dissenters, according to a 2023 USCIRF report. Beginning in the summer of 2022, Saudi courts began issuing egregiously long prison sentences against dissidents  including religious dissidents  who peacefully expressed their beliefs.Human rights groups and survivors of the Saudi penal system report regular torture and the acceptance of forced confessions in court in a practice that contradicts international human rights standards on the treatment of prisoners and the?acceptable use of evidence. In 2022, a group of 81 men were executed in what the U.S. Department of State called the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdoms history. Among those executed were dozens of religious minority Shia Muslims.Speaking in a TV interview, the head of the?Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice dismissed the mass execution as the eliminat\\\\[ion of\\\\] violators, calling it one of the most legitimate actions  to preserve religion.International law requires that the death penalty be reserved for only the most serious crimes. However, with its lack of a written penal code and the wide sentencing discretion given to judges, Saudi Arabia is notorious for handing down the death penalty in cases where such a punishment is patently undeserved.In response to Saudi Arabias consistently egregious record on religious freedom, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has recommended adding it to the Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) list every year since 2001, when it began making the recommendations.","title":"CMV: Muslims are the new Jews"},{"text":"It is complicated by the fact that \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" don't mean the same things on opposite sides of the Atlantic.Likewise, most American political parties are more over-broad coalitions of disparate factions who agree on a few unifying issues but have more differences than similarities.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"The next hurricane that floods Florida should be considered punishment against Republicans.","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"Really gotta tone down the rhetoric, Kamala.","title":"Multiple Democrats say they were targeted by Thanksgiving bomb threats"},{"text":"The war on Palestinians was waged over 75 years ago.

Do you think that endeared her to Democratic voters who don't buy into anti-immigrant fearmongering? Her DNC speech included statements like wanting to have the \\"most lethal fighting force in the world\\" and said she'd always stand up for Israel defending itself and would make sure they had the ability to do so in a time when Democratic voters didn't want to hear that from their candidate. Nor did they want to see their candidate hanging out with Liz Cheney and normalizing Republicans while saying they'd have spots in her administration. Do you think that wasn't a problem?You can have all the retorts you want, but Kamala was an awful candidate who ran an awful campaign on AWFUL policies. Her campaign did nothing but make her come off as a Diet-Republican. Their only selling point was that people should vote for her because she's not Trump. There was nothing done to separate herself from the unpopular Biden administration. The messaging from her and other Democrats was awful and it's time to stop blaming people on the left for a Centrist's loss.

There are certain things that plain and simple just are bad which no person wishing to live a life of goodness should do, however there is a grey area where good/evil becomes a lot more nuanced and subjective. Good/evil in this grey area, to me, is based on a multitude of personal, environmental, circumstantial, (the list goes on), factors. It gets quite complex and it's quite tough to pinpoint a singular definition of good and evil in this grey area; God/Satan to me is a pretty succinct way to describe some universally good/evil things, but I'll say it doesn't do a good job with the nuances.

Other countries will retaliate. Worldwide economies will suffer. US companies will go bankrupt, farmers will go out of business. The Trump administration will funnel US tax dollars to prop up companies and farmers most hit by the results.Trump will \\"negotiate\\" new trade deals, which will be fairly similar to trade deals previously existing but with minor changes around the edges. Did USMCA differ substantially from NAFTA, and did it solve our trade issues with Mexico and Canada? Nonetheless, Trump will announce these new trade deals with great fanfare and claim he's \\"fixed\\" our trade and immigration issues.Subsequently, the Trump administration will change the processes for reporting trade and immigration numbers and cherry-pick the data to make the statistics look better.  Right wing media will parrot Trump talking points of the great success, and the MAGA faithful will hail Trump as a hero.Meanwhile, the US economy will have lost billions of dollars, our GDP will have suffered, inflation will have shot up, and the deficit will explode due to loss of tax revenue and payouts to businesses and agricultural interests. Great.Edit: I left some other details out. Trump will argue (in fact, he already has) that income from tariffs will be large enough to justify huge tax cuts. The net effect of this will be to replace the income tax with a more regressive sales tax (since tariffs on consumer goods are, ultimately, sales taxes); and giving huge tax breaks to the wealty and to corporations.Later in his administration, when tariffs don't produce significant revenue to replace the lost tax revenue and the deficit skyrockets, Trump will use that to justify cuts in social services: Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, Veteran's Benefits, and so on.","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"Shh. ??","title":"Does the Democrats still want to win 2028?

Especially in terms of rhetoric, but with actual policy as well. But actually, the Overton window is specifically regarding what is politically acceptable to the mainstream population, right? So in that case, I'd say it's pretty wide here. From that Wikipedia article you're referencing, they show this table for modern mainstream political ideologies.|Left|Center|Right|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Democratic Socialism|Christian Democracy|Conservatism|\\n|Social Democracy|Classical Liberalism|Conservative Liberalism|\\n|Progressivism|Social Liberalism|Nationalism|We have sizable groups supporting each one of these in the US, likely with some sort of bimodal distribution with one peak somewhere between social liberalism and progressivism, and the other peak somewhere between classical liberalism and conservatism. Of course this isn't the full spectrum of ideology and communism is off to the left and fascism is off to the right. But even though the distribution is bimodal, we have many instances of people crossing it for specific issues. 46% of Republicans support legalized gay marriage, which is certainly a pretty large departure from right-wing emphasis on maintaining tradition and religious values. Andrew Yang with his UBI platform picked up some conservative support, a redistributive proposal that would be considered pretty far to the left.Consider this: there are many people that in 2016, were hardcore Bernie Sanders supporters and by 2024 became Trump voters, and the reverse is pretty common as well. It's a common enough phenomenon that there is a Wikipedia article about it, and both candidates had widespread support.Now you might criticize these people and say that they don't have solid foundational political beliefs and just go with populist rhetoric, but the fact that this can happen with so many politically-disengaged people implies to me that both Bernie and Trump are within the \\"acceptable\\" part of the Overton window. Not acceptable to everybody obviously, but acceptable enough for Bernie to nearly win the Democrat primary (43% of total popular vote in 2016 primary and and 26% in 2020) and for Trump to win the presidency. And I suspect that in Bernie's case, a lot of Dems voted Hillary or Biden solely for strategic reasons due to the 2-party system, rather than his views being unpalatable to most Democrats. Regardless, if a self-proclaimed socialist can win nearly half the vote in the primary for the country's majority party, that must imply that some level of socialist thinking is within the acceptable part of the Overton window.I think at the national level it probably seems narrow because our government is extremely, extremely inefficient, sort of by design. So in terms of national policy-making, the window for what can actually get made into law is pretty narrow. But especially in local government, you do have legislation passed that is pretty far left or far right. Obviously wouldn't disagree that the window is right-shifted from the generalized Western European one, but I don't think it is hugely so, nor all that narrow.","title":"CMV: Using Europe as a compass for Defining the Orientation of a U.S. Political Party is Not Logically Sound"},{"text":"And $680 Million to Israel.

But I would agree with the overall sentiment that for the last at least 50 years Muslims (typically Arabs) have been dehumanized by politicians, the media, entertainment, and militaries. 9/11 poured gasoline on the fire, to the point where I hear people say absolutely horrifying things about Muslims and Arab people like its nothing. If they changed Muslim to black or Jewish they would instantly see how incredibly racist they were being but somehow dont see it with Muslims. They view them as another species, which is how you can have the western world happily supporting genocide in Palestine.?So again I agree with your basic point. But its not that Muslims have become the Jews. Whats happening is happening all over the world.

Dont start fights you cant win/ finish. Pretty easy concept to grasp. The only media outlet thats calling it a genocide is Al jazeera. Which is based in qatar which funds Hamas directly. Al jazeera, the same news outlet that reported that an Israeli rocket blew up a hospital killing 5k people. Which they caught on their live feed. Which actually turned out to be a rocket fired by Hamas that fell short of its target because Hamas rockets tend to be sewer pipes they ripped out of the ground that was given to them from international aid. Turns out it hit the parking lot and nobody was killed. Hamas literally murdered children in cold blood on October 7th. You can easily find pictures from that day online and on Reddit. Its a lot different killing civilians with bombs than it is to look them in the eyes and shoot them, which hamas did. This conflict isnt about  colonialism  thats just a convenient buzzword co-opted by Iranian propaganda knowing it would resonate with western youth. Hamas wants to rid Jews from their ANCESTRAL HOMELAND. They want Islamic supremacy in the Middle East. Thats what its about to them. Even with the war going on Israel has a better human rights track record than a majority of the Middle East. With How many Muslim and Christian countries in the world. There just cant be one Jewish country. Not to the people that side with hamas, Iran and their allies. People love dead Jews. Ill bet anybody my entire life savings that the Palestinian population will recover easily within the next decade while the Jewish population is still recovering from the holocaust 80 years later. Man, if only those people would actually take into account what the Jewish people have gone through for thousands of years. Long live Israel ?","title":"CMV: Muslims are the new Jews"},{"text":"I am shocked how wrong you are on so many things and then decided to label me as a Neo-Nazi as part of your utter hatred.Now, lets take a history lesson because it seems it is very needed.\\"As the refugee crisis escalated, the British government submitted the matter to the United Nations (UN). In a special session, the UN General Assembly voted on November 29, 1947, to partition the territory of Mandatory Palestine into two new states, one Jewish and one Arab. **This was a recommendation that Jewish leaders accepted** and **Arabs rejected.**\\"The reason they left the territories was because they were told that once they killed all the Jews... they can come back and take everything back. The only issue was that they failed to kill the Jews and lost the war. Instead of what happens whenever there is a winner... the losers of the war were labeled as refugees. Which they then maintained for over 80 years which is unheard of. Had Israel lost the war there would be far more jews in most middle eastern countries, as Israel would not have pressured them to move to Israel in order to achieve its desired jewish majority. Again, another fact that you pretty much are wrong about. Jews wanted to come to Israel because half of them were just wiped out... You understand that there was a holocaust or are you a holocaust denier? Estimates aren't exact but at least 5,000,000 Jews died during the holocaust. Antisemitism was on the rise... like it is currently because, 'We are just treating Jews terribly because we don't agree with Israel' crowd. And the whole hunting of Jews things throughout Europe which is apparently acceptable to some people.Now, this part right here is exactly why I know you are a lost cause...Also you clearly think that the mass killing of over 43,000 people, destruction of whole families, murder of tens of thousands of children, by Israel is no big deal so dont pretend like you care about Oct 7th, where **only 1,100 people were killed**. Only x amount of people died. I am sorry that not enough Jews died to your standard. I am sorry that the unprovoked attack perpetuated by Hamas which attacked Israeli citizens and raped, murdered, and took hostages is just a number to you. Israel has a right to kill terrorists who attack them. Nobody has a right to protect and hide terrorists. You disagree with that sentiment? Hamas as an organization demands the death of ALL Jews. I am sure that doesn't matter to you, but it matters to me. To support them after knowing that is honestly disgusting... yet, here we are.","title":"Biden administration planning $680 million arms sale to Israel - source"},{"text":"Godzilla would be pretty cool.

We can easily take our values for granted but the truth is that a huge amount of the morality that we currently accept as self-evident was based on belief in God, divine justice and the Bible. I was brought up Catholic/Anglican and walked away at a young age and became a long time agnostic/atheist. I now realise that mainstream \\"Christian\\" denominations are (Satanic) counterfeits. It is sad because my upbringing in these false churches led me to think that I knew what true Christianity is. It wasn't until I read the Bible, primarily the New Testament, for myself that I realised this. Read [Matthew ch. 23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023&amp;version=KJV) if you want an idea of what Jesus Christ had to say about the religious leadership.

I think an appreciated factor in this election is the changing media ecosystem. The 2010s saw the rise of text based social media. This drastically changed the media consumption habits for people (for lack of a better term) who like to read. This group is overwhelmingly educated and hence liberal, which is why weve these platform have been left dominated (when allowed to grow organically). The 2020s are seeing the rise of video based social media and the implications of this are only starting to be appreciated. First conservatives saw an opportunity to reach people who would otherwise get their news from television and cable, or who would just not watch the news at all. IMO this was one of the driving causes of 47 winning the popular vote. Now this along with the negative news over MSNBCs financials are causing many on the left to despair. However this also presents an opportunity. If MSNBC is struggling financially thats likely a harbinger for Fox News. In the world where cable news disappears, platforms like TikTok will grow to take their place. The upside of this is the algorithms that decide which videos people see are more politically agnostic than cable news channels. They just incentivize engagement. Right now political social media commentators are largely conservative, but theres nothing stopping liberals from growing their market share. If they do this theyll have more opportunity to reach the type of viewers that would normally be locked into Fox News.","title":"The Perception Gap That Explains American Politics - Americans overwhelminglybut, mistakenlybelieve that Democrats care more about advancing progressive social issues than widely shared economic ones [Gift Article]"},{"text":"Lets hope.","title":"Central Valley Democratic challenger Adam Gray takes lead in last uncalled House race (CA)"},{"text":"He does.

Allah has assigned the Holy Land to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment (Koran, Sura 5 C The Sura of the Table, Verse 21), and We made the Children of Israel the inheritors (of the land) (Koran, Sura 26 C The Sura of the Poets, Verse 59).**I say to those who distort their Lords book, the Koran: From where did you bring the name Palestine, you liars, you accursed, when Allah has already named it The Holy Land and bequeathed it to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment. There is no such thing as Palestine in the Koran. Your demand for the Land of Israel is a falsehood and it constitutes an attack on the Koran, on the Jews and their land. Therefore you wont succeed, and Allah will fail you and humiliate you, because Allah is the one who will protect them (i.e. the Jews).The sheikh added: The Palestinians are the killers of children, the elderly and women. They attack the Jews and then they use those (children, the elderly and women) as human shields and hide behind them, without mercy for their children as if they werent their own children, in order to tell the public opinion that the Jews intended to kill them. This is exactly what I saw with my own two eyes in the 70s, when they attacked the Jordanian army, which sheltered and protected them. Instead of thanking it (the Jordanian army), they brought their children forward to (face) the Jordanian army, in order to make the world believe that the army kills their children. This is their habit and custom, their viciousness, their having hearts of stones towards their children, and their lying to public opinion, in order to get its support.It is worth mentioning, that the above mentioned sheikh visited Israel and met Jewish religious scholars. The Israel in Arabic site conducted an interview with him, in which he said that the reason for his openness towards the Jewish people comes from my acknowledgment of their sovereignty on their land and my belief in the Koran, which told us and emphasized this in many places, like His (Allahs) saying Oh People (i.e the Children of Israel), enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned unto you (Koran, Sura 5 C The Sura of the Table, Verse 21), and His saying We made the Children of Israel the inheritors (of the land) (Koran, Sura 26 C The Sura of the Poets, Verse 59) and many other verses.He (Adwan) added: (The Jews) are peaceful people who love peace, who are not hostile and are not aggressors, but if they are attacked, they defend themselves while causing as little damage to the attackers as possible. It is an honor for them that Allah has chosen them over the worlds C meaning over the people and the Jinns until the Day of Judgment. I made the reasons for Allahs choice clear in my books and pamphlets. When Allah chose them, He didnt do so out of politeness, and He wasnt unjust other peoples, it is just that they (the Jews) deserved this. (Cohen E.

I have many good friends who are Muslims, and from the people I've met, no more seem to have extremist views, than any other religion. I have lots of respect for my many Muslim friends. They care for their communities, and care about their integrity and morality. All that being said, this is my experience in Western countries. I've come across numerous polls from other Muslim majority countries with shocking results. Questions like \\"do you think death is the appropriate punishment for leaving the Muslim faith?\\" usually get a strong majority from samples of the entire Muslim world. Egypt is not some backwards third world country, and 86% of people there support the death penalty for changing religions. Add to that questions about women's rights and free speech, and it's a disturbing picture about a HUGE percentage of all muslims in the world. Britain had a poll that showed over 70% of Muslims supported arresting the Danish cartoonist who portrayed Allah. Sorry, but you don't get to pretend to be a part of the modern world if you believe that, and that's not just a few bad apples. I certainly don't condemn any religion in total, and I have nothing but respect for people who are moderates and Muslims, but I'll definitely say that I think all people of any faith, who are against free speech, against equal rights for women, and support the death penalty for apostasy, are backwards savages with no place in the modern world.

There is an issue with religious fundamentalism being far too common and possibly even the norm in many if not most Muslim communities world wide.There is an exceptional amount of evidence for this now. I will share a small bit to make my case. https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/Back in 2013 pew research center collected a lot of data on attitudes if Muslims around the globe and the results are illustrating religious conservatism and fundamentalism being absolutely normalFor example support for sharia in the Middle East and North Africa averages around 70%In Iraq its 90%That level of support for an obvious medieval law system should be extremely concerning to everybody.- Since 1970 according to https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ (a Maryland university managed database) there has been about 200,000 terrorist attacks globally According to GTD and also to https://www.cat-int.org/?lang=en (a French organisation focused on tracking global terrorism trends) about 50,000 of that total 200,000 have been enacted by Islamic extremists. That is 1/4 of all the terrorism in the world since 1970 that has been enacted by a single religious demographic. For context the rest of the 150,000 was carried out by a myriad of different groups for a myriad if different reasons. I included a list if some of the groups tracked by GTD below.\\t?\\tIrish Republican Army (IRA)\\n\\t?\\tBasque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA)\\n\\t?\\tRed Army Faction (RAF)\\n\\t?\\tWeather Underground\\n\\t?\\tTamil Tigers (LTTE)\\n\\t?\\tJewish Underground\\n\\t?\\tKahane Chai\\n\\t?\\tKu Klux Klan (KKK)\\n\\t?\\tNational Socialist Underground (NSU)\\n\\t?\\tEarth Liberation Front (ELF)\\n\\t?\\tAnimal Liberation Front (ALF)\\n\\t?\\tRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)\\n\\t?\\tShining Path (Sendero Luminoso)\\n\\t?\\tKurdistan Workers Party (PKK)\\n\\t?\\tSikh Extremists (e.g., Babbar Khalsa)\\n\\t?\\tCombat 18\\n\\t?\\tAryan Nations\\n\\t?\\tNational Liberation Army (ELN)\\n\\t?\\tBlack September Organization\\n\\t?\\tSandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)\\n\\t?\\tZapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)\\n\\t?\\tWeather Underground Organization\\n\\t?\\tRevolutionary Peoples Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C)\\n\\t?\\tThe Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA)\\n\\t?\\tRevolutionary Organization 17 November\\n\\t?\\tLords Resistance Army (LRA)\\n\\t?\\tArmy of God (anti-abortion extremist group)\\n\\t?\\tAtomwaffen Division\\n\\t?\\tPhineas Priesthood\\n\\t?\\tNew Peoples Army (NPA)\\n\\t?\\tGreek Revolutionary Organization 17 November\\nSo very very obviously Islam has been incredibly over represented in global terrorism for at least the last 50 years.So Muslims are 1. Massively overrepresented in contributing to word violence 2. Show in general an intensely concerning amount of support for ideas that are contradictory to modern ethics. Now I am just going to stop there because I believe this should be compelling enough to convince you that widespread concern about Islam  is entirely understandable and justified. I am not however denying that there is a small amount if actual Islamophobia occurring but I truly believe you will find that it is massively over exaggerated and that in fact very reasonable criticism of Islam and the culture around it are more often than not being labelled as Islamophobia.","title":"CMV: Muslims are the new Jews"},{"text":"Well, if you accept that the goal of the tariffs is to hurt America and make it abdicate its status as the leading world power, it makes perfect sense.","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"And its pointless to say California should gerrymander like Texas does because even with independent redistricting California sends way more of its majority party to Congress than Texas does.","title":"Central Valley Democratic challenger Adam Gray takes lead in last uncalled House race"},{"text":"Its not the WEF, its dictatorships that want you to win nothing.In a dictatorship, the dictator own you, your family, and your assets.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"Following in Californias footsteps I see.","title":"Democrats win supermajority in Oregon House, Senate, with narrow win in Woodburn"},{"text":"Not sure how old you are buddy, but Trump was president before.

Here's some fun thoughts you might not want to bring up at the dinner table, but are worth thinking about:#Table Talks, Episode 6: What Happens in Vegas Doesn't Stay TherePrevious episodes: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gopn8g/daily_discussion_thread_november_11_2024/lwnngpi/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gr2ama/daily_discussion_thread_november_14_2024/lx59h3i/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gu27i1/daily_discussion_thread_november_18_2024/lxtwwo2/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gwdo3d/daily_discussion_thread_november_21_2024/lybq7bf/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gzgawd/daily_discussion_thread_november_25_2024/lyywogl/)When you read that title, what comes to mind?  Ticket splitting?  Voting trends among Latino voters?  Challenges in polling a city with a transient population that works off-hours?If so...forget politics for just a second.  Las Vegas?  Most people think of the casinos!  The nightlife!  And it doesn't get more Vegas than a round of poker.I hate poker, by the way, and I'm bad at it.  Why?  Because poker has very little to do with the actual cards.  And people don't say what they're really holding.  But master poker players know how to look for 'tells'.  Everyone has a tell - something unconscious that they do that reveals the sort of hand they're really holding.I can't teach you how to win at poker, but I know a thing or two about 'tells' in political conversation.  And once you start seeing them, you see that our whole discourse has a serious problem with including and respecting women.**Tell me more!**One of the biggest tells in politics is what we consider unimportant.  That's not a typo.  People have valid, personal reasons for the issues they care about, and I won't question those.  But the interesting question to me is...which issues get *dismissed*?  Minimized?  Considered worthy of being sacrificed for something else?  Or sacrificed for no good reason?[Stop me if you've read a take like this before.](https://thehill.com/opinion/5004793-democrats-focus-working-class/)  We've got a dude saying Democrats should ditch 'identity politics' and focus on 'practical economics'.  Thankfully, this guy takes the time to describe each of those ideas.  'Identity politics' means 'racial and gender issues', while 'practical economics' means 'building infrastructure', 'partnerships with local industry', and promoting jobs in 'healthcare, IT, and advanced manufacturing'.  Childcare is also thrown in at the end, briefly.If you read Episode 5, you know where I'm going with this.  I should clarify that Democrats are right to focus on every one of those things.  But why do we need to throw out the female-coded issue (gender issues, whatever he means by that) to support the male-coded issues (building stuff, industry, and male-coded fields)?  Can't we do both?  **The fact that the writer thinks we need to downplay women's issues is a tell.**  Because we can and should do both.  But this author clearly thinks women bleeding out in hospital parking lots is a distraction from 'the important issues'.Try looking for these attitudes in highly-upvoted political comments or widely-shared articles.  You'll find a disappointing number of similar tells.**Who matters?**Quick, which voters matter most?If you've been in politics for a while, you know the answer to this depends heavily on where a candidate is running, and what they're running for.  Unless you ask the very smart analysts!If Democrats just *served the working class,* they'd never lose another election, right?  Well...they do serve the working class, actually, and never stopped.  But I won't rant about that again.  Instead, let's ask \\"What does 'working class' mean?\\"  [Thankfully, we have a smart guy here to explain it to us!](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183060/why-working-class-voters-have-been-shifting-toward-the-republican-party)  See, Democrats ran Kamala Harris, who doesn't connect to the working class *for some unknown reason*.  But Joe Biden and Donald Trump do, *for some unknown reason*.  I guess I just imagined all those videos of average people in literal tears getting to meet Kamala Harris, then.  Or maybe those people - mostly women - don't count as working class, *for some unknown reason*.I'm sure you've seen other analyses describing the working class as factory workers, blue-collar workers, etc.  Not as nursing home aides, teachers, secretaries, and service industry workers.  The point is, **when your definition of working class excludes female working class people, that's also a tell.** Those voters backed Harris, by the way, but good luck finding any real discussion on that.  The discourse just implicitly excludes women from the all-important 'working class'.**So what's going on here?**How do people keep spitting out these ill-informed ideas, and how do people keep on falling for them?  This is where things get interesting.  Because sexism isn't always screaming the c-word on stage.  It takes a subtle form, too, and one that almost impossible to escape.[Unconscious bias, sometimes called implicit bias, explains what's going on here.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2018/12/17/here-is-how-unconscious-bias-holds-women-back/)  It's the idea that bias doesn't come from force, but from thousands of subtle, unconscious actions.  Our society is set up in a way that consistently presents women and female-coded ideas as lesser.  It shows up in the roles we assign, the language we use, and the attitudes we value.  And it shows up everywhere.When I talk about 'tells', I'm really talking about signs of unconscious bias.  The guys writing these analyses probably didn't set out to discredit women's views.  To them, it's just a given that women's issues and perspectives matter less, and it comes out naturally.  Same with that 7000-upvote comment saying that Harris' laugh is grating and she didn't come off tough like Trump, and why don't Democrats just listen to the blue-collar workers?  Look for those subtle little dismissals of female perspectives or female-coded traits.  Once you see it, it's hard to unsee.**What you shouldn't take away from this**I'm sure you can think of many examples of tells you've seen.  \\"Identity politics\\", \\"the working class\\" (when it's not made clear that women are part of the working class), \\"forget abortion and focus on kitchen table issues\\", \\"stop focusing on suburban voters (stereotyped as women in many discussions)\\", \\"Democrats need a fighter, not like Harris\\", and other such comments that subtly sideline women are some of the big ones.And here's the scary thing: You might recognize some of these tells in your own rhetoric.  If you're feeling brave, go through your past political comments.  (I did and had an hour-long cringe attack, so be warned).  But there are two **extremely important** things to realize:1. If your comments are full of dismissals of women...that doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.  It means you grew up in a society that dismisses women, and absorbed its values naturally, as most of us do.  The key is whether you stay there, or try and change your views.  If you're still reading this and not just planning your angry rebuttal, that's a good sign!2. If what you took away from this was a list of things not to say, you've badly missed the point.  The problem isn't just the words, it's the attitudes they show and spread.  Instead, take some time to honestly reflect on why you feel this way.  Is it possible you're wrong?  If the idea makes you angry, is there some of that masculine fragility we chatted about in Episode 2?  Bias is never solved by repression; only by honest reflection.Once you're aware of unconscious bias, you see the tells everywhere, like a sexism poker star.  Maybe in yourself, too.  And if you do...that's actually a good thing!  Because once you see it, you can challenge it.  And once you start to overcome it, you can be a part of un-fucking our political system and our society.  If we're going to seriously fight bias against women in politics, it starts with fighting it in ourselves, and in those closest to us.**Questions to consider**1. Can you name any other 'tells' that reveal unconscious biases?  I'm particularly interested in what our female readers have to say on this one.2. When someone you care about is speaking in a way loaded with 'tells', what's the best way to address it?  (It's generally not to loudly call them sexist - see Episode 2 if you're not sure why).3.

So what would have been ideal to do versus what was done is mostly academic. Worth thinking about, but I wouldnt want to say I am advocating for anything presently. Back in 2020 I was on the side favouring targeted isolations, challenge trials for vaccine developments, then in 2021 widely applied vaccinations. But thats a different discussion.Youre right that the vaccine wasnt quite as black or white. I am vaccinated, yet I got infected. But we also have the issue of viral load. For person A to be infected, person A needs to be exposed to a sufficient viral load (which vary from person to person). An infected, but vaccinated person, may still spread less since the amount of pathogens he or she spreads is reduced in aggregate because their degree of infection is reduced. So the variables are in truth continuous, not binary, as I approximated them as.Skepticism is always possible when analyzing retrospective data, because we dont control all variables. When people were vaccinated they might change their behaviour, and the different cohorts are not otherwise entirely identical, so differences in outcomes can always be in principle attributed to other factors. Still, if forced to choose the most likely explanation, based on all kinds of data and arguments on biological principle, I think the mRNA vaccines were very helpful.I did not know about ventilators. Where I live there were concerns about ventilator shortages in early 2021 when a lot of people still were getting infected.","title":"cmv: The COVID19 vaccine was not necessary to lift lockdowns and still not necessary today."},{"text":"Hes blaming him for everything that goes wrong","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"YoU hAvE bRaiNwOrMsiTs NoT aN iNsULtLmao I cant take you seriously after shit like that ??

For your follow up question, I think Trump is pushing the idea of tariffs because he can pick winners and losers in a global economic system.

The more optimistic view is that he will leverage the crisis to put America in a better position to be more competitive among the players in the great power competition. Both exist. The personal and inner circle financial interests and the great power competition.  They arent necessarily mutually exclusive.   But this is to my mind about creating a crisis, whether his supporters know it or not, and time will tell whether he puts country first. Given the relative weakness in the Democratic Party, that hasnt found an effective rebuttal against this stuff, the Republican Party can probably get away with it either way.

Neoliberals could adopt more populist public appearance, except that drives division and political contention which is against their core ethos.But the divisions and strife are already there, pretending it doesn't exist does nothing but drive hate, and soon violence, because by nature it can't deliver immediate solutions or relief to major issues. Especially when those issues are systemic.And whether neoliberalism likes it or not, a less-effective solution that addresses an immediate concern and drives political support is FAR BETTER than a more effective solution that takes a long time to implement, because long-term implementation requires political stability in order for these policies to take effect. If you have an openly hostile opposing party willing to tear down everything you have done, long term solutions become literally worthless the moment the hostile party gains power.The hostile party will simply tear the solution apart before it has a chance to mature, and now you have EVEN MORE problems to fix than you did prior.This is the core of the failure of neoliberalism: is has no effective solutions if any part of the decision-making system becomes hostile.

I truly do not see issue with that (which I'd be willing to kill, maim, or imprison over), so long as they are not risking the life of another individual (i.e. risking pregnancy).

Thats who they are.","title":"The message to Democrats is clear: you must dump neoliberal economics | Joseph Stiglitz"},{"text":"# Legislation to create a two-month-long GST holiday is expected to pass today. The bill was introduced on behalf of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, with the help of the NDP to at least temporarily stop debate on a Conservative filibuster. **The NDP only agreed to support the bill after Freeland separated the GST break from a promise to also send $250 to most working Canadians in the spring.** **The NDP wants that benefit expanded to also go to non-working seniors and people with disabilities who don't have a working income.** Liberal Ryan Turnbull, who is Freeland's parliamentary secretary, said during the debate on the legislation Wednesday evening that the goal is to help Canadians after multiple budget shocks from high inflation after COVID-19 and climate disaster-related supply chain disruptions. [...] The [savings] difference [of between $100 to $200 if somebody hypothetically spends $2,000 on the items exempt from this tax break] is because the four Atlantic provinces and Ontario have a harmonized sales tax with Ottawa, which means the entirety of that - 15 per cent in the Atlantic and 13 per cent in Ontario - will be lifted. Other provinces will only save the five per cent GST unless those governments choose to lift their provincial sales taxes as well. **Canada has not moved to offer compensation to offset provincial revenue losses to match the federal move on the GST.** **Federally the move is expected to cost about $1.6 billion. Ontario said Wednesday it will cost its treasury about $1 billion to remove the provincial portion of the harmonized sales tax off the items, though several things covered by the federal GST holiday are already permanently exempted from the provincial portion.** Alberta, which has no provincial sales tax, will see a five per cent savings. Conservative finance critic Jasraj Singh Hallan said during the debate Wednesday night that the GST break is \\"nothing but a cheap gimmick and something just to buy votes from Canadians.\\" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the bill should pass tonight, even though Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre \\"hates it.\\" \\"New Democrats won't let him win the fight,\\" Singh said. But he said the NDP wants the GST permanently off daily essentials and monthly internet, phone and home heating bills. **The Liberals needed the NDP's help to suspend debate on a Conservative motion that has tied up the House of Commons for nearly two months. The Conservatives refused to end that debate until the Liberals coughed up unredacted documents on allegations about misspending at a now-defunct federal green technology fund.** **This bill is the first new legislation to be debated in the House since the end of September.**Further readings:[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/liberal-mp-says-he-was-threatened-with-consequences-for-opposing-250-cheque-proposal/article_69f3cfa6-acde-11ef-807c-ebe72ea32b06.html](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/liberal-mp-says-he-was-threatened-with-consequences-for-opposing-250-cheque-proposal/article_69f3cfa6-acde-11ef-807c-ebe72ea32b06.html)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t_Rc7IVd0Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t_Rc7IVd0Q) [About that video regarding the savings gained by the tax break]Other news:[https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trade-war-trump-1.7394960](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trade-war-trump-1.7394960)[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tariff-canada-retaliate-trump-1.7394432](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tariff-canada-retaliate-trump-1.7394432)[https://www.policymagazine.ca/beyond-tariffs-reconciling-trumps-demands-and-canadas-interests/](https://www.policymagazine.ca/beyond-tariffs-reconciling-trumps-demands-and-canadas-interests/)[https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ford-pushes-for-more-proactive-border-action-after-trudeau-meets-with-premiers-about-trump-1.7126204](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ford-pushes-for-more-proactive-border-action-after-trudeau-meets-with-premiers-about-trump-1.7126204)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ministers-meeting-trump-tariffs/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ministers-meeting-trump-tariffs/)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trump-tariffs-canadian-agriculture-farmers/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trump-tariffs-canadian-agriculture-farmers/)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-this-is-how-canada-should-deal-with-donald-trump-irrational-actor/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-this-is-how-canada-should-deal-with-donald-trump-irrational-actor/)[https://www.cbc.ca/news/border-trump-crossings-1.7395268](https://www.cbc.ca/news/border-trump-crossings-1.7395268)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-watchdog-to-tighten-rules-on-lobbying-of-ministers-and-mps-by/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-watchdog-to-tighten-rules-on-lobbying-of-ministers-and-mps-by/)[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/these-canadian-cities-are-finally-doing-something-to-fix-the-housing-crisis-almost-none-are/article_de79b6a4-ac40-11ef-bded-5ffdfc6cc92b.html](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/these-canadian-cities-are-finally-doing-something-to-fix-the-housing-crisis-almost-none-are/article_de79b6a4-ac40-11ef-bded-5ffdfc6cc92b.html)!ping Can","title":"Liberals, NDP expected to pass GST holiday in House of Commons today, without $250 rebate"},{"text":"100% agreed.

Now Democrats support an \\"open border\\" by default. Without specifics, voters will fill in their own interpretation. Since Republicans rarely if ever provide specifics, \\"close the border\\" is always up for interpretation. Also, since most voters are low information, even if the Dems generate details, they likely won't be seen or understood, making them the party of \\"open borders.\\"Now Republicans only need to loudly draw attention to a border crisis, whethers it's real, exaggerated, or outright imagined. Now that you have a crisis, you tie that to \\"open border\\" policies. If the border were \\"closed\\" we wouldn't have this issue. With that, \\"closed border\\" policies are now the solution to the crisis.Since the Dems are tied to \\"open border\\" policy and that's what we have now, causing the crisis, the Dems don't want to address the issue, meaning they have \\"no policy\\" for the border. More importantly, since \\"closed borders\\" is vague, low info voters will interpret it in whatever way they prefer. Meaning any attack on \\"closed border\\" policies will be met with claims of misinterpretation.The whole situation has been reduced to a false dichotomy. Apply this process to other topics - tax cuts/increases, gay and trans rights, etc. and you'll see the same pattern. This is of course, predicated upon Republican hypocrisy and lying, among other things.","title":"The message to Democrats is clear: you must dump neoliberal economics | Joseph Stiglitz"},{"text":"Hopefully.","title":"Kamala Harris just made a message to her supporters | I think that she looks like she has been drinking a lot of alcohol"},{"text":"Moreso trump supporters only voting trump and nothing downballot.  \\nAlthough downballot has a much larger impact on our day-to-day lives.","title":"Central Valley Democratic challenger Adam Gray takes lead in last uncalled House race"},{"text":"Interesting that the \\"left\\" is being painted as weak and ineffective when it was the cetnrists/liberals that constantly chickened out in confronting fascists.
