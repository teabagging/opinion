From my pov, it seems like US society like you describe it is still deeply scarred and traumatized by racism. That could mean we could gloat, as Europeans, that we are less fragile, less divided and all that.  I'm afraid that is less and less true though, if it was at some point. But you're right to point out that we are historical based on a monolith culture imposing itself pretty much on others, ignoring them, assimilating them to the main fabric by erasing differences. So there is little to gloat about I guess. It's easy to be one when the minorities have to abide by the majority's rule. However,  I'm still not sure yours is the right way. It seems that grievances and divisions are maintained and the simple fact of saying/ acknowledging \\"my country is a racist endeavor \\" like some say tends to imply you want to break it up and make other countries...not very unifying.

And that only makes sense, because minority groups, especially those that came from formerly colonized countries or are descendants of slavery, have had their identities used against them for generations. It's only reasonable for them to want to take pride in what has historical been a weapon against them.This can go one of two ways though: the majority race in a country like the US can either accept and welcome them as the part of society that they have always been, eventually removing the need for race as a category, or they can perceive this as a threat and attempt to prevent these minority groups from gaining power and agency equal to their actual size and influence in the general population, and reinforce the need for minority groups to coalesce around racial identity.","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/jk6vnhpz3oyd1.jpeg?width=1357&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fcf27d6f8db06e9cf3835926fd050b78d478450mood","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You think being a white man with no college degree is hard?

A way to refer to this idea is 'being color blind', as in 'I just don't see race guys'.On its surface, it seems like the color blind approach is appropriately anti-racist. Martin Luther King famously dreamed about a country where his kids would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. But the problem with this is that the races in the United States *are* treated differently, and a lot of the basis of that is through deep cutting legal discrimination of which the effects are still felt to this day. That's the reason people tend to roll their eyes at 'color blindness'. It's like you're in a marathon, and there is a rule that gives the white racers an hour head start. During the course of the race, the officials decide that it wasn't right to give white people a head start, and so they remove the rule and say it isn't right to make rules that favor a race. Ok, but the black people are still an hour behind. They ask \\"can we maybe have a rule to allow us to catch up?\\" And the officials say \\"Sorry, I don't see race.

I think what you need to understand (not necessarily agree) is that it's a society which was build on racism. It's roots are literally that people belong to a certain race or group of origin that should never mix. Not long ago, having a friend or worse a partner from another group was inimaginable. Even illegal. So overall, the society is becoming less racist. But changes don't take one or two or three generations, it takes longer. Also social is a lot driven by churches, and people choose their congregations based on their belonging to a certain group. They have very few opportunities to mix with people that don't look and think like them. It's just a very different society and culture compared to France. Our view on these topics are diametraly opposed. As for what you say about France recently, i believe this is the influence of American social media on young people and the large financial support from American groups to some groups in France that were completely marginal and seen as extremist and racists in France just a few years ago. Tbh it scares me, exactly as you said it makes me fear a come back to WWII mentalities.

Each of these shaped communities and opportunities in ways that continue to impact people today. Many people hoped that Obamas election would signify a post-racial era, but his presidency revealed how unresolved these racial disparities remain. His election was a symbolic milestone, but symbolic changes alone dont erase deeply embedded societal issues or dismantle the long-standing systems that perpetuate inequality.In the U.S., race is not a biological reality but a social construct historically created to justify exploitation and discrimination. Racial categories emerged to rationalize practices like slavery and segregation, creating disparities that have persisted across generations in areas like wealth, education, and healthcare. Far from being a means to divide people, acknowledging race is a necessary step in understanding and addressing these inequities.Policies promoting diversity, such as affirmative action and representation quotas, aim to address the barriers that have kept marginalized groups out of influential spaces. These policies dont reinforce division; they challenge the unfair advantage that certain groups have historically held by making spaces more accessible to underrepresented voices. Representation matters because, for many years, minorities were excluded from these spaces altogether. This isnt about rigidly categorizing peopleits about providing fairer opportunities and recognizing the benefits of diverse perspectives.The complexity of reclaimed terms, such as the N-word, can be challenging to understand from an outside perspective. In Black communities, reclaiming this term transforms a painful history into an expression of solidarity and resilience. Reclaiming language used historically as a weapon is an act of agency and empowerment, not an attempt to perpetuate racism. Just because certain terms are reclaimed by those they once harmed doesnt mean they arent hurtful or offensive if used outside those communities.The U.S. is often described as a melting pot, but that doesnt mean that unity in diversity comes easily. Race remains a focal point of American discourse because of the unique, interwoven histories of different communities within the country. In some European countries, national identities are often more culturally homogeneous, so race might not appear as central in discourse. However, the U.S. is built on multiculturalism, which requires directly engaging with each groups unique history and challenges.Addressing race openly isnt what fuels racism. Its the structures of inequality that persist despite this openness. Ignoring or downplaying these disparities doesnt make them disappear; it only pushes them further from view. Talking about race is crucial for creating a fairer society. Far from reflecting a rise in racism, Americas focus on race shows an effort to reckon with its history and move toward equity. By facing these challenges directly, the U.S. is not becoming more racist; its working to break down the legacy of racial injustice.","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"Speaking as someone just one state over in Nebraska, farmers fucking hate tariffs and lost a lot of money during Trump's term, billions in exports gone to waste.

Do understand I believe in the importance of having the right to vote, but from a constitutional perspective that doesnt exist. No US citizen has a constitutional right to directly vote for president. The 9th wouldnt apply to the electoral college because its literally in the constitution who elects the president, therefore not an enumerated right thats left out. The 19th again, doesnt gut the electoral college. Its saying if states which to have citizens vote for presidential electors, that both men and women must have that vote. Same with the 26th. For reference, US Senators were initially chosen by state legislatures, just like POTUS/VP Electors. Article 1 section 3 states just that. However the 17th amendment explicitly changed that to senators being elected by the people thereof, and thus the fact that no amendment regarding the right to vote explicitly states that the President shall be elected by the citizens thereof, the right to vote directly for president does not exist under the constitution, and state legislatures can appoint electors however they wish. The 17th amendment was obviously also written AFTER the 9th and 14th amendment, which dispels your argument that it applies retroactively (in this case) and that the writers believed the 14th had anything to do with electing the president, which is just not true. Its a poor, unfounded argument.","title":"How the Electoral College Crushes the Will of the People"},{"text":"The crowd behind him not reacting at all is what really sold it for me.

The government are responsible for the introduction of crack cocaine into black communities and the subsequent war on drugs that were crafted specifically to kill black people. The government are the ones who have continually and at every available juncture prevented effective funding of urban school systems to prevent black children from entering higher education. The government are the ones who introduced gun legislation as a measure to prevent the armed resistance of black people specifically, and the government are the ones who have committed acts of EUGENICS AND TORTURE AGAINST BLACK AMERICANS IN THIS CALENDAR CENTURY AND YOU WANT ME TO TRUST THEM TO NOT BE RACIST THEY!

(interviewer): The whole poison pill is in the current Georgian president. She's French-born, went to school at Columbia University so indoctrinated with US hegemonic foreign policy, and she's the one trying to keep these elections from being confirmed. She won't call her a plant but she's working on the side of the EU and NATO and the US to try and keep Georgia at odds with Russia, a second front.-Blinken came out and said \\"we've warned Georgia of further consequences if the Republic's government doesn't change course.\\" Talk about dismissing democracy; it's \\"you're not doing what we say so it's not democratic.\\" -It comes back to the point in the West where if you elect the wrong party, they'll have to find ways to remove that party and put the government they want in office. Or, even in the EU we had a referendum they ignored; or as happened in the Netherlands or in Ireland they made them vote I think three times till they got the result they wanted.-(interviewer) In Germany they're trying to say the AfD is an illegal organization, they won some elections and we're not going to recognize it, because reasons.

Georgia was the Rose revolution in 2003; a year later there was the Orange revolution in Ukraine. -One of the positive outcomes of these debacles is that more and more people in the West are seeing that democracy is an illusion; they're not prepared to tolerate the people making what they consider the wrong choice. -","title":"Western democracy is dead as Maidan 2.0 looms"},{"text":"Thats what it highlights","title":"Kamala Harris Mocks Donald Trump on SNL Appearance, Urges Americans to Keep Kamala and Carry On-A-La"},{"text":"It would be great if Selzer's polling error was something crazy like 10 points to the right, and Harris actually wins like a boatload of states.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall *abridge the privileges... of citizens*?States have the right to decide how to allocate electors, so long as it does not violate any other clause of the constitution.

I was arguing with someone pro-life on reddit and they were insisting that they knew someone who was going for an interstate abortion of a healthy 7 month foetus. I was sure they were lying or wrong but then they sent me to look at the laws in the state they were going to and holy shit it does indeed look legal there. I think it was Colorado. Im firmly, firmly pro-choice but damn it doesnt help the pro-choice argument if there are actually doctors out there aborting healthy already viable outside the womb foetuses purely for choice. Id love for you to tell me thats not the case. I think most of us have a line somewhere and its very frustrating that that line can be anywhere from Day of Conception to whenever Colorado (i think) finally says no, have an induction or caesarean. At some point there is responsibility to have as early an abortion as possible for choice reasons. I really hope I was being misled.

BLM was millions of people, in numerous cities, over the course of months. January 6th is called that because it was tied to a specific date, at a specific place, for a specific reason - that was when the election of Joe Biden was being certified in Congress. The Jan 6 protestors wanted to stop Joe Biden from becoming president, and this was seen as the last chance because the election results were formally certified that say. BLM protests were not tied to a specific event like that  they were expressing outrage at police violence all over the country.??The French Revolution is a very complex topic but Ill follow your example, the execution of the monarchs. Louis XVI was executed in 1793, after a trial where his lawyers were allowed to present evidence, which was voted on several weeks later by hundreds of members of the legislature. There was an appeal and another vote to give him mercy before he was executed. His wife was executed almost a year later, also following a court process. I bring this up because this is what youre comparing to the BLM protests. A revolution that had formed a government, which was still in turmoil but in control of national institutions like the legislative assembly. The revolutionaries had cabinet ministers and police forces and written laws when they executed the king. And you call this a targeted protest. Is it really fair to compare that to the George Floyd protests? I dont think it is.?","title":"CMV: In terms of execution, the Jan 6th Riot is a better form of protest than most."},{"text":"I'm so glad I was able to see it live.

Probably because he beat their guy last cycle. I think they were hoping that the hatred of Biden would outweigh any concerns women had about voting for the guy who took credit for trying to their bodily autonomy away. But Harris becoming the nominee was a real wrench in their plans, it seems. Not only was she very successful in driving out women to vote for her, but she didnt have nearly the same base of hatred built up against her amongst the population at large. Without that to tap into, theyve been stuck sitting like a lame duck with the abortion issue, and its far too late for them to turn back now. Meanwhile, their unpopular abortion stance gave Harris all the ammunition she needed to turn the race around in her favor, and these clowns just doubled down on the misogyny and racism because its the only plan they had left.

You can argue all day that \\"she's not a leftist so she doesn't deserve my support\\" or whatever, but anyone mature enough to see the bigger picture understands that in order to advance *any* kind of progressive social movements, we need to have the non-fascist in office. One of the two *will* win. One will keep current problems pretty much where they are. The other will set us back significantly, and will risk the actual persecution of and harm toward marginalized groups in our country *in addition to* exacerbating those same current problems. And that second option will make it *much* harder to collectively bargain for progressive policy and actual systemic change.Again, one of the two is going to win. There's nothing anyone can do about that at this point.One is very, very clearly the worse option. If you have any regard for the safety of immigrants, LGBTQ folks, women, and other minority groups, and if you want a snowball's chance in hell of steering us inch by inch in a more progressive direction, Harris is the only option.You can protest democracy or whatever and not vote, sure. But if you've spent your time convincing people not to vote, you've lost all rights to complain when Project 2025 is enacted and what's left of our country's stability crumbles from beneath us. One of the two WILL win. No matter how much you don't like it. One is very clearly a much, much worse option.Stop playing your sanctimonious enlightened leftist game and maybe, I dunno, help prevent us from having a full-on fascist takeover?","title":"I'm Unconvinced by the Leftist Arguments to Withhold Votes from Kamala Harris."},{"text":"Voting on the 6th.

You are probably one of the few people that appreciates Carter for who he was and I am glad to meet you. Jimmy Carter was an amazing man. He was another one that wasn't supposed to win the Presidency but he did because he was a good man. Look what the system did to him. All the qualities you - and I - prize in a leader have been made to look like weaknesses, in case another Carter out there got any funny ideas. So instead, we got a Trump. Sometimes you need a heel. Trump is the most charismatic man I know - he can make you enamored with love or hate for him, and either way he's got you.One final note - our system is made to be turned over to the opposite party regularly. Our system of government works by finding a workable mean oscillating between two ideological poles. Democrats have been ruling now for 12 out of the last 16 years.

She has got every single election in Iowa right in the past 28 years minus two of them, and she's been within five points of being correct in all but one (having overestimated Obama's final margin by seven points in 2008 and predicted D+2 in the 2018 Iowa gov race compared to a final result of R+3). Notably, she was also the only serious polling agent in the entire country who accurately predicted Trump's overperformances in 2016 and 2020, almost to the exact margin. So basically, even if Selzer is off by ten percent for the first time in her entire career, Trump still only takes Iowa by a seven-point margin, which is absolutely shit in a state that's otherwise shifting solid red by the year and probably guarantees that Harris has swept the Midwest.","title":"Iowa Poll"},{"text":"Holy shit, is Michael Moore going to be right again?

Through my findings, I believe Ive uncovered the real intentions behind the United States activities in Antarctica. Can we genuinely trust that Americas focus is solely on scientific research, or is there more to it? Why has the U.S. never officially recognized the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT) or other territorial claims?The Australian Antarctic Territory and U.S. ControversyIn 1933, Britain transferred a large portion of Antarcticaabout 42%to Australia through the Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act. This included areas like Enderby Land, Kemp Land, and George V Land, named after British explorers and whalers. Wilkes Land, however, was named after U.S. Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, who led the U.S. Exploring Expedition that mapped parts of Antarctica between 1838 and 1842. Although Britain declared Wilkes Land unclaimed in 1841, they later included it in their whaling operations and ultimately transferred it to Australia in 1933.However, the U.S. has never recognized Australias claim over Wilkes Land. America argues that Britain did not properly document their claim, meaning they had no right to pass it to Australia. In the American view, Australian sovereignty over Wilkes Land is therefore invalid.Why the U.S. Didnt Claim Wilkes LandThe United States did not claim Wilkes Land primarily due to its preoccupation with other imperial pursuits, particularly the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). Following the war, America focused on acquiring other territories, such as Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and American Samoa. This shift in focus away from Antarctica allowed other nations to formalize their claims in the region before the U.S. acted.Renewed U.S. Interest in AntarcticaIn the late 1920s, U.S. interest in Antarctica was revived through expeditions led by Admiral Richard E. Byrd, such as the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station Expedition (1928-1930). Although Britain had already transferred its Antarctic claims, including Wilkes Land, to Australia, the U.S. remained active in the region. Byrds expeditions paved the way for further U.S. involvement in Antarctica, both scientifically and geopolitically.Even though the U.S. never recognized the British or Australian claims, it continued to explore regions like Marie Byrd Land and the Palmer Peninsula, further entrenching itself in Antarctic matters.The Security Implications for AustraliaThe U.S.s refusal to recognize Australias claim over the Australian Antarctic Territory undermines Australias sovereignty and national security. This selective recognition of territorial claims sets a concerning precedent, especially given the rise of Chinese interests in Antarctica. While Australia has supported the U.S. in conflicts around the world, it is uncertain whether America would reciprocate if Australias Antarctic territory were threatened.World War II and Americas Growing Antarctic AmbitionsDuring World War II, U.S. operations in Antarctica increased dramatically. The most notable was Operation Highjump (1946-1947), one of the largest Antarctic expeditions in history. This mission aimed to map vast areas of the continent and assert U.S. influence. In 1947, Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson declared that the U.S. had not recognized any foreign claims to Antarctic territory and reserved its right to assert its own claims in the future.The Antarctic Treaty and Americas Strategic InterestsFollowing World War II, the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 was established to ensure the continent remained dedicated to peaceful scientific research. However, despite being a leading advocate for the treaty, the U.S. has maintained a reserved claimant status, allowing it to potentially assert territorial claims in the future.The U.S.s continued presence in Antarctica, especially in areas like Wilkes Land, raises concerns about its long-term intentions. Despite Australias formal claims, historical actions and declarations by American officials indicate that the U.S. is unwilling to fully relinquish its ambitions in Antarctica.ConclusionThe U.S.s disregard for Australias sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is alarming. Americas strategic interests in Antarctica, especially through its reserved claimant status, suggest that its involvement in the region may be more about power and influence than purely scientific endeavors. The U.S. has repeatedly positioned itself to assert claims to land it does not officially own, raising questions about its true intentions in Antarctica.Critical Summary:The post presents a compelling argument that U.S. activities in Antarctica are driven by strategic and geopolitical interests, rather than purely scientific research. It highlights the historical context of territorial claims, particularly Australias claim to Wilkes Land, and how the U.S. has consistently refused to acknowledge these claims. The post critiques the U.S.s reserved claimant status in Antarctica, arguing that Americas actions are more about maintaining influence in the region than preserving the continent for peaceful scientific exploration.While the post raises important points about territorial sovereignty, it relies heavily on historical grievances and U.S. foreign policy in other regions (e.g., Mexico, Hawaii) to frame the U.S. as an imperial power. This detracts somewhat from the focus on Antarctica and could be seen as overstating the connection between U.S. global expansion and its Antarctic policy.Moreover, the post emphasizes Australias vulnerability, implying that the U.S. would not support its defense in a conflict over Antarctic claims. This view, while plausible, remains speculative and unsubstantiated by current defense agreements between the two nations.In summary, while the post offers a thorough historical analysis and presents legitimate concerns about U.S. intentions in Antarctica, it would benefit from a more balanced examination of U.S. contributions to the Antarctic Treaty and scientific research, which remain significant aspects of American involvement in the region.","title":"united states true intentions in Antarctica"},{"text":"At the rates were seeing it  all of a sudden , not likely.

These projects will make rail safer, more reliable, and more resilient, getting goods and people where they need to be quickly with fewer disruptions, lower shipping costs and less pollution.Administered through FRAs Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) Program, grants being announced will benefit every region of the country, especially rural communities. Projects in this round of selections reflect the broad array of rail safety and service improvements eligible under this program, such as upgrading track, replacing or rehabilitating aging bridges, expanding rail connections at ports, adding modern locomotives to fleets, and more. The CRISI Program is also the only federal grant program prioritizing smaller, short line railroads vital to the American economy and regional supply chains. This announcement is part of a series of investments the Biden-Harris Administration has made in nearly 300 rail projects and dozens of emerging passenger rail corridors across the country through Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded FRA grant programs. This marks the most significant investment in American rail in more than 50 years.  \\n...  \\nWhile the majority of CRISI grants directly improve rail infrastructure, CRISI investments are also supporting the rail workforce and investing in the hardworking Americans who will help maintain and operate the Nations rail networks well into the future. Federal funding will create new apprenticeship programs, expand training opportunities, establish partnerships with universities, and advance innovative research. For example, one grant awarded to the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen will help develop an effective strategy for integrating wayside hot box detectors to enhance safety and proactively address derailments caused by wheel and bearing failures.  \\n...  \\nSelected CRISI projects this round include:* In Illinois, more than $157 million will be invested in the Springfield Rail Improvements Project Final Usable Segment: Phase VIb: North Grand Ave. and IIIc: Multimodal Transportation Center Project, which will consolidate the Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern corridors into one multitrack corridor through the city and advance the efforts to provide a higher speed intercity passenger rail connection between St. Louis and Chicago. In addition to track improvements and new grade crossing separations, the project will also construct a Multimodal Transportation Center to better connect public transportation options such as passenger rail, local bus service, and intercity bus service. \\n* In North Carolina, more than $105.5 million will be invested in the North Carolina Railroad Company (NCRR) Carolinian and Piedmont Passenger and Freight Improvements Project, to improve the capacity of the NCRRs NC-Line to meet the growing demands of both freight and passenger rail traffic. Upgrades would add over five miles of sidings, reconstruct up to 69 miles of track, eliminate one grade crossing, and improve track geometry. The project will increase on-time performance for existing Amtrak routes, allow for additional passenger trains along the growing corridor, and meet the needs of a growing manufacturing sector.  \\n* In partnership with Amtrak, more than $14 million will help implement a 36-month Mechanical Craft Workforce Development Apprenticeship Training Program to build a skilled mechanical craft workforce for Amtrak to maintain its fleet of equipment. The project will improve safety and service performance by providing Amtrak job opportunities and career paths in various mechanical crafts that are essential to maintaining service and improving efficiency. The apprenticeship program is a collaboration between Amtrak and several labor unions, with programs being offered in Beech Grove, Indiana; Wilmington, Delaware; Washington, DC; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Los Angeles, California. \\n* In Georgia, more than $26.5 million will be invested in Colonel's Island Rail Improvements Project. The project, in partnership with the Georgia Ports Authority, will improve the Myd Harris Yard and construct a new South Side Rail Yard at the Colonels Island Terminal in Brunswick, GA, creating new opportunities to move automotive shipments by rail instead of truck. Specifically, for the South Side Rail Yard, the project will construct four new yard tracks, estimated at approximately 23,735 feet of track, and construct south side auto storage area and a perimeter road, as well as grade separate an existing crossing. Additionally, the project will lengthen and reconfigure tracks at the existing Myd Harris Yard to improve operational efficiency and bring rail switching activities inside the terminal and away from the adjacent neighborhood.  \\n* In Arizona, more than $21.6 million will be invested in the Eastern Arizona Rail Safety, Efficiency, and Resiliency Project, which rehabilitates approximately 34 miles of track, replaces three aging timber bridges, installs two emergency crossings, cuts brush within rights-of-way, and retrofits two tank cars for firefighting. The project will address infrastructure vulnerabilities in a location with a history of wildfires.|\\n* In Michigan, more than $67 million will be invested in Detroit RECHARGED - Realizing Environmental Changes Happening Around Railroads Generating Equitable Development, which will improve and expand the Livernois Intermodal Facility by installing approximately 17,200 feet of new track and upgrading paving as well replacing diesel gantry cranes with new hybrid and fully electric gantry cranes in Detroit and Wayne County, Michigan. The project will benefit local business owners and surrounding residents by improving service performance, enhancing multimodal connections, and reducing negative environmental impacts.In addition to deploying historic funding to modernize and upgrade rail infrastructure, USDOT and FRA have taken unprecedented actions under the Biden-Harris Administration to improve rail safety. This includes finalizing new safety regulations, conducting focused safety audits, expanding a vital safety program to include workers at Class I freight railroads, and pushing freight railroads to provide guaranteed paid sick leave to all of their workers.A link to the full list of recipients and scope of projects is at the end of the press release. Statement from U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg:Todays investments in our rail systems reflect the Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to building a stronger, safer, and more resilient transportation network, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, were funding rail infrastructure projects that create jobs and expand workforce development, reduce costs for consumers, and directly benefit communities across the country. Each project advances a future where our supply chains are stronger, passenger rail more accessible, and freight movement safer and more efficient.","title":"Investing In America: Biden-Harris Administration Announces $2.4 Billion in New Rail Projects to Improve Safety, Strengthen Supply Chains and Grow Americas Freight and Passenger Rail Networks"},{"text":"Operation Mockingbird has been running social media platforms for decades.Now buck up and just accept that our glorious \\"leaders\\" will once again be cutting taxes for trust fund babies and the corporations they inherit.","title":"How The Kamala Harris Campaign Manipulates Reddit (And Breaks The Rules) To Control The Platform"},{"text":"He's been wearing that helmet hair for a long time.","title":"Kamala Harris Mocks Donald Trump on SNL Appearance, Urges Americans to Keep Kamala and Carry On-A-La"},{"text":"Are the refs the electoral college ?  /s","title":"Hey democrats.

Iowa isn't really *in play* but accurate data from the midwest can be useful.  2016 had Trump win Iowa by 9.6 and he narrowly won the blue wall states.  In 2020, he only won by 8.2 and still lost the election.  And Selzer called those very close, when a lot of other pollsters missed.Selzer's polling also was the canary in the coalmine for both Clinton losing support, and Biden not doing nearly as well as predicted.So if Selzer shows erroding Trump support, say Trump +7, that's very worrying for him.  If she shows massive Trump support, say Trump +12, that's very good.The poll shows Harris +3.Does that mean Harris is going to win Iowa?  Probably not, there's a 6 point margin of error.Does this mean the midwest is likely more in play than the pollsters are willing to publish?  Very possibly.","title":"Hey democrats.

The reason Im critiquing this article, despite agreeing with its outcomes, is because this type of hyperbolic, ahistorical, and generally malformed line of thinking can just as easily lead to the opposite and *wrong* conclusion. Because it isnt based on meaningful distinctions, fact, and reason, people subscribing to it are more likely to lead to bad conclusions next time (or even this time).mostly meaningless votes in an oligarchic system designed to preserve the political power of 18th-century aristocratic slavers.Really? Did anyone tell the 19 of 34 states that banned slavery prior to the Civil War this fact? And that why within 1 lifetime, that system grew against slavery so clearly that those slave states broke away, and that Constitutional Republic which was designed to preserve the political power of aristocratic slavers, sent 360,000 Union soldiers to die to defeat the actual aristocratic slavers to their South?Pro-tip for far-leftists: it does you **zero** benefit, in a free society, to try to rewrite history. Eventually the truth sneaks out.The truth is that our system of government and history as a country is far more nuanced than this article gives it credit for. I could go into why but I dont want to create a wall of text. This sounds great! But its a fantasy. Neither the Democrats nor our election system are rational or democratic. Another silly point of hyperbole that completely takes away from the authors main point. Why on earth should I vote in this system if the next point is true:While the GOP had a short-lived introspection following their 2012 defeat, Ive never seen the DNC respond to either voters or common sense.As a consistent Bernie supporter since 2015, this is complete brain rot. I think even moderate Democrats would agree that the progressive movement lead by Bernie made significant cultural changes in the Democratic party such that many of our ideas *are now common Democrat policies* rather than fringe ideas.The Democratic Party has moved left on so many ideas. We did that by voting and activism and making our voice heard in the Democratic Party, and convincing our fellow citizens of the correctness of those positions.Argument #3: We should vote third party to build an alternative to the duopoly.I skeptical of this strategy, simply because Im unaware of an electoral-first revolution.Im not even sure what this means. There have been many revolutions that combined voting for the right candidates with protesting. We did not do that, which is why Harris is campaigning with Liz Cheney instead of Rashida Tlaib. She knows she can entirely ignore us, insult us, support the IOF burning Palestinian patients alive, and still have a path to victory. We, the people who actually care about abortion rights, labor protections, and the lives of Palestinians, need to be brutally honest about how we can change that. That means organizing workers, educating them on the direct link between capitalist and imperialist exploitation, illustrating that bourgeoise democracy is hogwash, and striving to overcome Americas oligarchy through relentless, targeted political pressure.This is complete nonsense, which is why youll continue to fail at your goals. Your plan is to:- Organize workers (good makes sense)- Educate them on the direct link between capitalist and imperialist exploitation (okay so like when the company I work at turns a profit, that has something to do with the US invading countries)- Illustrating that bourgeoise democracy is hogwash (okay so why the fuck am I supposed to vote? Its all rigged anyway. Its all bullshit man!)- Striving to overcome Americas oligarchy through relentless, targeted political pressure (lets flail our arms and call the system rigged as soon as everyone doesnt 100% agree with me)If I believed all the things this author was saying, I literally wouldnt care about voting for Kamala. In fact, maybe voting for Trump is good, since putting a bunch of incompetent dumbfucks like RFK in charge of our Oligarchic non-democracy would make it less effective at Imperialism.Im genuinely afraid of writing down more counter-arguments from this far-leftist POV because the counter-arguments might be more convincing than the article itself. The real answer is that holding extreme and radical beliefs like this can lead to bad analysis and bad outcomes. To remedy this start by thinking critically on how the U.S. system works, how U.S. history actually occurred, and how change typically occurs in our system. Continue to take Bernie Sanders advice, and vote for Kamala Harris.Final note: the Democratic Party is one of the most anti-fascist organizations in history. FDR obliterated Fascism on 2 fronts in a world war, and Kamala wakes up every day to defeat fascism too, right now.

Nevertheless, it still brought the MAGA movement closer to draining the swamp as they call it. The protestors genuinely believed the election had been stolen by this group of corrupt elites in Washington in order to protect themselves. The protest was not just to overturn the election, but to scare these elites and their supporters.\\"scaring\\" the elites and their supporters could easily mean giving them more power since it could mean that more of their supporters will vote in this coming election. ?The attack is broadly considered an act of domestic terrorism by these people, and a large tenet of the democrats election goals is protecting democracy from Donald TrumpIt was an act of terror. You already said one of the goals was to scare or rather terrorize the elites....and again, this seems to be working. Even if you take the most cynical and conspiratorial view possible, which is that the democratic party undemocratically installed Kamala Harris and ousted Joe Biden, people still prefer that to Donald Trump. This is to say that what they and Trump have done is bad even by the poor standards of the democratic party.They believe that he is associated with Project 2025, which will cause another attack on democracy as they call it.Even if he actually is firmly against the policies, the success of other Republicans is highly dependent on Trump's ability to turn out the vote. In this way there is an obvious association. Also, everybody should understand that many things in the Project 2025 are things that Trump doesn't support or reject and he would be fine with allowing other people pass them. That's how his first presidency worked and people should judge this based on his past record. Specifically looking at the BLM protests of 2020, innocents were harmed more than the targets of the protest.The vast majority if not all the violence was done by people who coopted those protests for their own purposes. Both protests have made this defense that they were not at the protest for violence and others were. Try to form options objectively.  Also, in many cases, the BLM protests involved peaceful protesters being attacked and defending themselves. ?Instead most protests happened in city streets and parks, often ending with small businesses and innocent bystanders being attacked, with those they were actually protesting coming out mostly unscathed and unaffected.That was not even remotely a common occurance. It's just the news didn't show the 3000 protests on the same day where nothing happened. Also, they didn't show the pressure that was put on politicians. **We know it worked because laws changed.

Every time the former president and the oil slick with whom hes running are asked whether they will honor this old American tradition, having dishonored it four years earlier, they answer with some variation of assuming that the election is fair, a caveat through which .you could sail the *Nimitz*. I devoutly hope we have one, and I am fairly certain that the Democratic party feels the same way. But why commit publicly to that course of action *now?*And its not like the Democrats are refusing to raise a mob to sack the Capitol.

This was as concerted, world-historical series of insurrections which succeeded in seizing political power for decades and whose repercussions reverberate to this day.The Revolution also killed a *lot* of people, especially if we include the resulting Napoleonic Wars. But even if we just include the French Revolutionary Wars of 1792-1802, we're still talking several hundred thousand dead, and a lot of those were not just political elites - they were soldiers and civilians. Some have even called the War in the Vende (\\\\~200k dead) a genocide - controversially, but still. A lot of everyday people died. The executions during the Reign of Terror are honestly small potatoes compared to the larger death toll.Jan. 6 may well have helped keep Trump out of jail (or at least delay consequences for his actions), but it failed in virtually all of its stated aims. The reality is that at present, mass-protest in the United States has proved largely ineffective at securing tangible political goals. What it has sometimes managed is to sway public opinion and produce shifts in culture. By this standard I'd say that Jan. 6 and BLM both have partial successes.","title":"CMV: In terms of execution, the Jan 6th Riot is a better form of protest than most."},{"text":"The moment musk was summoned to Israel and then came out for trump told me that a deal had been done.","title":"If there was evidence that Trump was on Epstein's list, why wouldn't Democrats disclose it to gain an advantage in the upcoming election?"},{"text":"Twitters dead.

I was salaried but they had a level where a certain salary and above would no longer receive overtime.I LOST or would have lost about $6,000 dollars had I remained working there for the next full year, but I left after 4 months.I talked to my boss, who was nice and understanding, but this didn't come from him, it came from well above him.The VP of Operations came up to my office to shake my hand for my 12% increase and then he left.I told my boss I would have made more money had I not received an increase at all compared to this 12 percent increase.I told my boss I would have made more money even if they reduced my salary by 3 percent compared to what I was going to earn with this 12 percent increase.Again, tis why I left 4 months later.Really glad I did too because my new salary was 72% higher than the salary I had at that plant and I was doing the same work, same field, in another manufacturing plant with the same number reports (indirect and direct).

Prior to this poll's release, pundits were like Trump +3 should mean trouble for him. She would win every swing state with this sort of margin.OK maybe the pollster's having a really bad day, and she's off by 10 percentage points this time, doubling the error of her worst poll. This would put us at Trump +7. Biden won the election with this sort of numbers in Iowa. And we can not overstate how improbable it is that she's off by the much.If the Harris +3 poll in Iowa is right on the money, then Texas, Ohio, Alaska and South Carolina are solidly in play. Even Kansas and Missouri would no longer be considered safe. She could be looking at around 400 electoral votes, which is why so many people are shocked by this poll result.I think also telling is that the poll trend from this pollster. In June, she had Trump +18 in Iowa. In September, she had Trump +4.

The estimates range from 500,000 to 1 million. Additionally, there are the individuals such as those in hospice who lacked access to hospital professionals for long streaks of time. For example, my Great aunt experienced complications with her kidneys. The Hospital had to discharge her fairly early to hospice to make room for COVID patients. Third there are those who were plunged into poverty and lost their healthcare resources. Finally, Trump unilaterally exited the Nuclear monitoring program of Iran. He also allowed Israel to annex additional portions of Palestine. Also, Israel has stated in the past that it will bomb Iran enough to destroy that program if they get too close. The Monitoring program gave both Iran and Israel and out from direct confrontation. Trump pulling out of the Nuclear deal led to Iran supplying more weapons to their proxies Hamas, Hezbolla and Houthi. Iran losing the nuclear deal when they were following it, put them in a war footing. They wanted to present a credible threat to Israel. Prior to COVID hitting the US, Trump even committed an assassination that escalated regional tensions. *Trump pulling out of the Nuclear deal unilaterally, led to Iran and Israel taking more aggressive stances because the diplomatic option was eliminated.*","title":"CMV: George W Bush had worse impact as President than Trump did"},{"text":"The real Daddy is talking... not the fraud named Diaper Don.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/tucker-carlson-speech-trump-spanking","title":"Biden blasts Trump as someone youd like to smack in the aC at Pa. campaign event"},{"text":"??","title":"Harrison Ford support's Kamala Harris ?"},{"text":"That's their thinking?

Its not just about religious doctrine; its about creating an unbreakable hierarchy that can maintain power across borders and through generations. Orthodoxy provides the perfect control mechanism, embedding loyalty and obedience into the fabric of society, which in turn makes it easier to direct populations without resistance.Emphasizing unwavering allegiance to an established order (whether political, royal, or religious), orthodoxy discourages rebellion and independent thought, which are essential for the ruling class to conduct their agendasclient wars, resource monopolization, and maintaining dominance. Like you mentioned, this isnt just a national phenomenon but a global one. With a few dominant players controlling several nations through subterfuge, they can manipulate the system without exposing themselves.Orthodoxy and its hierarchical structure are ideal for this because they reinforce the perception that questioning or resisting the authority is both sacrilegious and dangerous. And for those nations that arent directly part of the hegemony, theyre often left reliant on these powerful orthodox nations, who subtly (or not so subtly) steer their political and economic decisions. The control structure operates like a self-sustaining machine, with orthodoxy as the oil that keeps the gears running smoothly and suppresses dissent within the ranks.","title":"The Eagle and Serpent: An Ancient Rivalry Still Shaping Our World"},{"text":"you guys have to stop drinking the kool aid. harris isnt going to fix anything but neither will trump. its not about democrats vs republicans its rich vs poor. they invented this culture war horse shit to keep us arguing with each other instead of getting any problems solved. the more you guys play this culture war game the worse off we are gonna be. again not stoked on harris shes a lying pile but trump is also a lying pile.","title":"This sums up Democrats"},{"text":"Trump belongs in a museum!","title":"Harrison Ford Endorses Kamala Harris-Tim Walz Days Before 2024 Election"},{"text":"I think it's referring to SNL.

In a red state, fill me in.","title":"House Speaker Mike Johnson handed Democrats another last-minute gift on Friday by saying Republicans would try to repeal the hugely popular, job-creating CHIPS and Science Act"},{"text":"In Gnostic belief, the serpent often represents wisdom, enlightenment, and liberation. The serpent in Gnostic texts is not a deceiver but a bringer of knowledgean agent of awakening who encourages humanity to see beyond surface realities. This aligns with Enkis role in the Anunnaki narrative, where he gifts humanity with forbidden knowledge, symbolized in myths by the Tree of Knowledge. Here, the serpent is a liberator, offering humans the tools to understand the universe, discern good from evil, and potentially become self-determined.The Gnostic worldview views the material world as a place of entrapment, ruled by oppressive forces or Archons who prefer humanity to remain ignorant and obedient. The Serpents wisdom is thus seen as a rebellion against these forces. Similarly, Enkis intervention with knowledge challenges the authority and control of Enlil and the status quo the Anunnaki seek to impose, encouraging humanity to question and transcend imposed limitations.The Eagle as Orthodoxy\\nThe Eagle symbolizes power, hierarchy, and ordervalues often associated with Orthodox doctrines in traditional religions. Just as Enlil represents authority and obedience in the Anunnaki mythology, Orthodox religious systems emphasize submission, structure, and loyalty to a supreme deity, often promoting strict adherence to established doctrines and hierarchies.Orthodoxy in many traditional religions, including mainstream Christianity, can sometimes view questioning or alternative interpretations as heretical or dangerous. This aligns with Enlils stance in the ancient myths; he prefers to keep humanity in a state of dependence and control, punishing those who defy or deviate from his established order. This approach creates a protective barrier around certain truths, preserving divine authority and sustaining a stable societal orderbut at the cost of suppressing individual enlightenment or liberation.The Anunnakis Ancient Legacy in Gnosticism and Orthodoxy\\nKnowledge vs. Control: Gnosticism, like the serpent, values inner knowledge and self-discovery, seeking to free individuals from blind obedience. Orthodoxy, like the eagle, often upholds structured belief systems that emphasize faith, tradition, and loyalty to divine authority.\\nLiberation vs. Obedience: In Gnostic thought, the pursuit of knowledge is a path to personal freedom and spiritual awakening, similar to Enkis philosophy. Orthodoxy, reflecting Enlils values, emphasizes obedience and loyalty, believing that deviation from established beliefs leads to chaos or spiritual downfall.\\nRole of the Divine: Gnostic interpretations often see the divine as accessible and personal, with spiritual truths lying within individuals. Orthodox structures tend to centralize divine power in a singular, unquestionable authority, directing worship toward a distant, commanding deity.\\nIn this framework, the Anunnakis influence might have shaped both pathwaysthe liberating impulse of the serpent/Enki aligns with Gnostic traditions of personal enlightenment, while the hierarchical, order-keeping values of the eagle/Enlil align with Orthodox ideals. This adds another layer to the theory: religious elites and governments influenced by Orthodox beliefs could reflect Enlils worldview, reinforcing control structures and obedience, while suppressed Gnostic traditions might reflect the alternative path of liberation, suppressed yet persistent as a counter-current in human history.Great take.","title":"The Eagle and Serpent: An Ancient Rivalry Still Shaping Our World"},{"text":"Or maybe just have an open mind because you dont know what these freaks are into.

Work that isn't exhausting can't be productive and work that is exhausting must be productive.That the political economy of this is bad has been known since the 19th Century. Schumpeter coined \\"creative destruction\\" as a *criticism* of how capitalism's method of optimizing for efficiency was crude and disruptive. Many socialists early on argued a planned economy would eliminate the need for destruction, smoothing out the bumps in the curve by planning everything so precisely that there would never be a single excessive or frivolous factory built which would need to be later destroyed, or any capital misallocated and in need of reallocation.","title":"How the Democrats Bungled the Politics of Immigration"},{"text":"As president, she would have the power to stop supplying arms along with military and diplomatic support.

The result in this poll is Harris +3 and hints that other pollsters might have been weighting their polls incorrectly and missed some important trends, as happened in both 2016 and 2020 from other pollsters. The leading hunch I heard is that other pollsters are missing movements among non-college educated white women, particularly older white women 70+ towards Harris over Trump. When you look at Selzers granular data, older white women are breaking for Harris 2-to-1.

There is no reason to listen to polls three days before the election, especially when we have actual, empirical early vote data.GOP early vote turnout is slightly above 2020 levels, and is composed largely of low propensity voters.Dem early vote is catastrophically down vs 2020.conclusion: polls are a mess but the actual data says the GOP is on pace for a decisive win. That's assuming two things. First, that the GOP votes on election day like usual (party enthusiasm is sky high so that's a given). Second, it assumes that Dems are not suddenly an election day party who, for no reason, eschewed early voting for a huge election day turnout.there's no evidence to think the reason Dems aren't early voting is because they're waiting for Tuesday. They've been the early vote party from the jump. They have no apparatus as a party to turnout voters on election day. Everything they do is about getting people to the polls as early (and often) as possible.Fact is, the Kamala joy train has stalled out. Their voters are not motivated, and not enthused, at least not to the degree they were in 2020, based on the numbers and raw data.basically, Dems are turning out like it's a midterm. the GOP is turning out like it's a life or death presidential election.GO VOTE AND IT'S A WIN!","title":"Poll: Donald Trump Leading Kamala Harris by 10 Percent In Iowa"},{"text":"Yep.

One house had a very very long gravel driveway in the woods, and I couldn't turn around, so I had to back out while the kinda grumpy guy in the house watched me. That was stressful. :)There is one house I wish I could have back because the lady was not voting for Trump, but their main issue was abortion, but they weren't sold on Harris. I was surprised at that and stumbled a bit. In hindsight, I wish I had mentioned the possible supreme court appointments as a reason to vote for Harris.","title":"Iowa Poll: Kamala Harris leapfrogs Donald Trump to take lead near Election Day.

It had over 700 citations in Google Scholar.You say that you mentioned the paper, but a synonym for that is that you cited it. That is right, citing a paper does not mean that you necessarily agree with it. It could mean that the paper was cited to dispute it. The very paper that you say disputed the first paper had to cite it. They are one of the 700 citations.Of course, the problem here is that you misrepresented what the papers showed. The [first paper said](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913405117): This work is subject to limitations that offer fruitful directions for future research. First, we are unable to observe the mechanism that is driving the observed result, or the selection process of the physician.So they did not say that this was \\"because of the racism of white doctors\\" like you claim. They invited future research to examine this more (just like what happened). Just having [another paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409264121) come in to say \\"hey you forgot to take this additional factor into account\\" is exactly what science is supposed to do - they build on each others work to get a better understanding of our universe.No scientist will ever say that they have all the answers because not only would that put them out of a job, but they know that there can always be a new way of looking at things that could completely upend our understanding of the world. This is a good thing. This is what makes science great and is the reason that humanity of surged in the last few centuries compared to the thousands of years preceding it.But you are coming in and looking at the mechanism of science and saying that just because they don't have all the answers now, it means that we should not listen to what scientists say. The big problem with science comes from those who politicize the whole thing because the answers that scientists come up with do not match their preconceived notions. They cherry-pick individual papers to bolster their claims that scientists don't know what they are talking about - even though they have to cite other scientists to prove this.It is the same as the climate deniers who end up having to admit that maybe climate change is happening, but point out that when scientists first postulated that climate change might be happening that they thought that it could be a good thing. They fixate on the science that matches what they want reality to be, and not what was eventually found after more studies were done.","title":"CMV: Scientists have no one to blame but themselves for the record low trust Americans place in them now"},{"text":"Fly it!!

People would be presumed guilty in the court of public opinion. Epstein had connections to tons of people. Some of those people are completely innocent. Some of those people have committed crimes. For some of those people who committed crimes, there won't be enough evidence to prove they committed crimes. Sex crimes are some of the most difficult crimes to prove. For those who committed no crimes, releasing their names is going to adversely affect them, solely due to a connection to a criminal. Plus, the president, or any politician, likely doesn't have the authority to release documents for an ongoing investigation. Now, the conspiracy side. I find it interesting who has said they'd be open to releasing the documents versus who has remained silent about them. Trump, Musk, and Vance have all expressed releasing them. Biden, Harris, and the Clinton's have remained silent on the issue. I'm not accusing anyone of anything.

We have seen at least 2 women from Georgia and one (or more) in Texas die due to the way the laws have been written as to be so evasive that doctors fear for their careers and livelihood not to mention the health of their patients.Of course women of my age and older remember what happened prior to Roe v. Wade. We were the ones celebrating our victory in 1973. May of us were on the protest lines again, we were the ones with the signs indicating our need to protest again to keep our right to self determination.

Making USA a participant in the genocide, directly ordering it on the ground with the IDF soldiers pulling the trigger, on top of supplying all the bombs and most of the intelligence, satellites, etc.So people like Giuliani and Clinton who are going out there and giving pro-genocide speeches and dehumanizing Palestinians are legally culpable of inciting and participating in a genocide.

The heart breaking this is if they got onboard with ample public funding for birth control and intelligent sex education and easy access to early abortion meds and procedures, and free maternal care and scans to pick up any developing problems, there would be a lot less mid to late term abortions.

The operation has more than 30 dedicated staffers, with an operating budget in the low seven figures, according to a staffer involved. \\"We treat third-party candidates with the same rigor that campaigns treat major party candidates,\\" says Lis Smith, a veteran Democratic operative who runs communications for the war room. \\"We have a full content team, a full press team, a full research team.\\"  For much of the 2024 campaign, Kennedy showed enough sustained strength in public opinion surveys to make both campaigns nervous. But since dropping out of the race in August and endorsing Trump, Democrats' third-party attention has focused on Stein, who is once again running as a Green Party candidate.  A similar strategy helped neutralize Kennedy before her. When RFK Jr. first entered the race, he was leaching votes from Biden, Smith says. But by defining Kennedy as a right-wing fringe candidate, the Democrats were able to drive down his numbers with Democrats and drive up his numbers with Republicans. By the time he dropped out, Smith says, \\"he had no appeal to Democratic voters, he was electorally irrelevant.\\" Democrats do not see West as a serious threat, arguing that he is not running a real campaign that could eat into Harris's margins. To attack him, they say, would only amplify him. If the Democrats manage to thwart third-party drift, the war room the party established could become a mainstay in presidential politics. \\"It's the first time anyone in American politics has had this in a presidential election,\\" says Smith. \\"It wont be the last.\\"","title":"Democrats have a \\"war room\\" funded in \\"the low seven figures\\" just to track and discredit Third Party candidates, most of all Stein."},{"text":"The Younger boomers and gen xrs","title":"Older women voters remember a time before Roe  and theyre rallying around Kamala Harris"},{"text":"2 out of 3 of my family members voted alred/harris.

Here's how"},{"text":" A new survey shows that a significant majority of Puerto Ricans in Florida support Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the White House while holding a negative view of former President Donald Trump. Conducted by the Puerto Rico Research Hub at the University of Central Florida, the poll gathered responses from about 150 Puerto Ricans predominantly residing in Central Florida between October 21 and 30. The survey found that 85% of respondents would vote for Harris, while only 8% expressed support for Trump. Six percent indicated they would consider a third-party candidate. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 8 percentage points. This poll follows controversial remarks made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on October 27, when he called it a \\"floating island of garbage.\\" In response to the backlash over various racist comments made by speakers at the event, Trump downplayed the incident, describing the rally as \\"a lovefest.\\" \\"There's never been an event so beautiful,\\" he said. Hinchcliffe's remarks have since gone viral on social media, prompting prominent Puerto Rican figures such as Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin to voice their support for Vice President Kamala Harris. The poll showed that 88% of respondents had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, while 72% viewed Harris positively. Despite over a million Puerto Ricans living in Florida, the researchers indicated that their impact on the presidential election might be limited, given that Trump remains ahead in various polls with most other demographics. However, they suggested the comedian's comments could influence voters in closely contested states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where there is also a significant Puerto Rican population. About 69% of Puerto Ricans are actively following the presidential race. \\"How ironic it would be that the Puerto Rican vote has the potential to become the October surprise,\\" Fernando Rivera, director of the Puerto Rico Research Hub, told the Miami Herald. Responses were gathered from areas with a high concentration of Puerto Ricans, such as Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and Hillsborough counties. Major issues for the surveyed individuals included education, healthcare, and cost of living. While many respondents identified as Democrats, 85% supported candidates based on reasons beyond party affiliation. The Harris campaign has capitalized on the controversy surrounding Hinchcliffe's now infamous joke, engaging directly with Puerto Rican voters in Pennsylvania and releasing a Spanish-language ad highlighting her policy proposals for Puerto Rico. New billboards, sponsored by Voto Latino and the Oakland Corps, have appeared in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, aiming to inspire Puerto Rican pride and encourage their support for Vice President. At a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday Oct. 29, Trump made his last efforts to court Latino voters amid threats of eroding support among the demographic. \\"Nobody loves our Latino community and our Puerto Rican community more than I do,\\" he said, without mentioning the joke that caused so much repercussion.","title":"More Than 8 in 10 Puerto Ricans in Florida Back Harris After 'Island of Garbage' Line at Trump Rally, Poll Shows"},{"text":"So true.","title":"Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declines to endorse Kamala Harris"},{"text":"You dont know my family.

There exist adults who are less mature than seventeen year olds, and it is sort of fucked to deny them the right to vote as a result, but there also exist a plethora of 17 year olds who are dumb as bricks.This applies to most things that have to do with aging because of that continuum. I think you and I can both agree that adults should not sleeping with minors, yes? But at the same time using your logic, why not? There are 19 year olds who absolutely not mature enough for a consensual sexual relationship, and there are extreme edge cases where the reverse is true, such as Emmanuel Macron who was 100% groomed by his then teacher but managed to cycle that into a happy decades long marriage to her and a successful political career.So why the hard and fast rule? Because 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of cases are not Macron, they're child abuse. Setting a rule, even an arbitrary one, is necessary for practical purposes.

I was going to vote for McCain over Hillary because even though I disagreed with half his stances I thought he was just about as close to an honest person as a politician can be. Then somehow Obama won the primary against all odds so I voted for him.

Selzer is arguably the best pollster in the COUNTRY, she's absolutely nailed Iowa in basically every recent election when no one else was close. (2018 governorship was her only miss, still within her margin of error tho)The margin of error in this poll was 3.4, which doubles because you have to apply it to both candidates. That means in the absolute most pessimistically incorrect error, Trump has a 3.4% lead in Iowa. Iowa has been arguably the furthest right of the Midwest in recent years. If he squeaks out a 49%-46% win there, he almost certainly gets absolutely whomped in the Rust Belt, and is arguably at risk of losing Indiana and OhioNo poll is gospel, but there's no way to spin this as anything less than catastrophic for Donnie.

Just in the last few days the UN, Oxfam and several other agencies have said that the entire population of North Gaza is at risk of death because Israel has since Oct 1 blocked any food from going into North Gaza. After months of reports that Israel was using Gazans as human shields we got confirmation from the NYT and CNN in October that they regularly do. We have corroborated evidence that the IDF shoots children in the head and chest daily. We have estimates that Israel has already liquidated more than 5% of all Gazans.*  We also learned that Israel carries out mass rape and torture at it's prisons for Palestinian detainees.*Both of these from 99 American medical peronsell who worked in Gaza since the start of the conflictWhen asked about this all Harris can do is pivot that voters need to support her anyway because she'll lower grocery prices. Speaking only for myself I feel incredible gratitude towards Tlaib that she would even attend a GOTV rally for a candidate that is at best indifferent to the genocide of her people and extended family.EDIT: This was originally going to be a reply to a poster below but they reply and then blocked me. Editing it into the comment here as it contains sources for the claims made in the original post aboveThis is from American health workers.  Specifically, every one of us who worked in an emergency, intensive care, or surgical setting treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head or chest on a regular or even a daily basis. It is impossible that such widespread shooting of young children throughout Gaza, sustained over the course of an entire year is accidental or unknown to the highest Israeli civilian and military authorities.https://www.gazahealthcareletters.org/usa-letter-oct-2-2024The same doctors also provided dozens of xrays and pictures of children shot in the head to the NYT. NYT then published the x-rays but not the photos as they deemed them too graphic.Here is the NYT documenting how the IDF routinely uses civilains in Gaza as human shields:https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-human-shields.htmlDocumentation on Israel's torture and rape prisons:\\nhttps://www.google.com/url?https://www.btselem.org/publications/202408_welcome_to_hellhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/07/israel-must-end-mass-incommunicado-detention-and-torture-of-palestinians-from-gaza/https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/08/israels-escalating-use-torture-against-palestinians-custody-preventableAnd lastly here is the UN warning that every single Gazan in North Gaza is at risk of death from Israeli policy:https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/north-gaza-apocalyptic-everyone-imminent-risk-death-warns-un-2024-11-01/Hamas the government of palestine is a terrorist organization voted in by palestiniansThis is not relevant to anything I wrote but they last held an election in 2006... an election where they got less than 40% of the vote and  when over half of Gazans weren't born.

This is key. ? ?The federal government brings in around 4.5 trillion in revenue but spends around 6.5 trillion, every single year. The annual deficit wasnt this bad pre-Covid, it makes sense in an emergency to use new debt, but this level of deficit has just recently been normalised during Bidens term. The extent that he has taken it to is a new thing. Theres a strong argument that the economy is doing well precisely because of the increased government spending, but with all the debt it is like a sugar rush.Musk gets a pass for saying what he said, because its true, and even smart people on the left recognise that continued deficits of this size are unsustainable. I even heard CNN anchors saying it was unsustainable. Cuts will happen at some point, and the sooner you do it, the lower the overall pain.?Another key point - much of government spending is wasted.?To use an analogy, when a car mechanic tells you a part needs replacing when it could actually go a couple more years, and you replace it, doesnt that situation annoy you, because it is wasteful? You might argue that it was good for the economy, GDP went up because you had to replace it earlier, and the mechanic benefitted. I wouldnt argue that though. I would argue that it is wasteful spending that shouldnt have happened in the first place, and no real value was created in exchange for the money.

Harris cut it to 4-points in their September poll. Today's is their final poll and she jumped another 7-points to +3. The Harris campaign probably wouldve been happy with Trump +4 again because they werent expecting her to win Iowa (Trump won Iowa in 2020 by 8-points).

I guarantee that. Trump literally said that he doesn't read anything that is more than a few pages.\\nAll he has to do is appoint the people that the Heritage Foundation tells him to, which is what he did before. It's thier plan, they are the ones who will do it.\\nSecond, the whole point of P2025 is that Trump was checked by Congress and the courts his first time. It's an outline of what the executive branch can do without the other branches of the government.

It seems like the polls (and bettors) are favoring Trump right now.What I meant was this: She's probably got a better chance of convincing any remaining undecided voters if she put forward a solid message about how Trump is \\"planning to crash the economy\\" and how she would prevent such a crash. That's a better strategy than what she's been doing, which honestly feels desperate.However, taking that line of messaging has a HUGE potential to backfire. If she commits to that (vote for me, and I'll prevent a crash, while Trump and Musk would intentionally crash the economy), and then the economy DOES crash... She needs to have a ROCK SOLID explanation for why she couldn't prevent it. And she needs to have a very clear, and very effective, plan for recovering that is massively different to what Trump and Musk are putting forward with their \\"planned crash\\".That's the risk, and that's why I think she's not running with messaging about it. Again, my personal opinion is that an economic crash is inevitable. And because of that, if I were in her position, I would not take this line of attack.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk's remark is an October surprise potentially greater than Comey (2016) if Democrats use it"},{"text":"Biden is only mentally competent when spouting party lines.","title":"TURMOIL: Kamala Harris Tells Joe Biden to Take a Hike, Cancels His Campaign Events"},{"text":"Ngl if I was running against Trump, I'd do and say everything he did at his rallies the next day at my own just to see if the media reported on it being disgusting.","title":"We'll never know because she would never - because her brain isn't the warm McFlurry brain of a demented rapist"},{"text":"Exactly, and both sides use it as political propaganda to make their side think all people on the other side is like that","title":"Does anyone else notice this about most democrats"},{"text":"They have weaponized God, patriotism, and the flag!

Wade. To see it dismantled is a heart breaking.","title":"Older women voters remember a time before Roe  and theyre rallying around Kamala Harris"},{"text":"The easy answer to this, is that you are misrepresenting the job of a scientist. A scientist talks about data, how they got theirs usually being at least part of the conversation, and what it means according to the experiment(s) they made. They aren't trying to explain that to a layperson, and in fact, the general scientific illiteracy of the average layperson is what makes their publications less useful to the layperson.Of note, \\"scientific illiteracy\\" here refers to how the average layperson doesn't necessarily understand the scientific process, or what's the difference between a theory and a law when it comes to scientific findings. It does not makes the assumption that said layperson cannot read words and understand them, only that they do not know what they mean in the context of scientific papers. (Just like most people can't quite make out what most Legalese means.)This is why when news sites report scientific findings, they have to misreport. \\"Eating grapes reduces the risk of heart disease thanks to antioxidants\\", become \\"Grapes prevent heart attacks\\", which is not wrong, but it's severely misleading. \\"COVID-19 vaccines will lead to 90% fewer hospitalizations\\" becomes \\"COVID-19 vaccines prevents you from getting sick\\". Etc.This, combibed with the anti-science propaganda of \\"if they didn't get the conclusion right and perfect the first time around, then they are stupid, paid for by people who are pulling the wool over your eyes, and/or sience is always wrong, so why bother?\\"This is often combined with science-heavy TV shows or channels with competent science communicators are still beholden to two restrictions: 1) If the subject(s) being presented is not pulling in ratings, then they will be cancelled quickly. Why bother paying a cash sink?2) Using technical vocabulary, even if you defined it in that show/episode/video, can still be overwhelming. I can see people getting quickly confused by fancy terms like \\"isotope\\" or what the types of radiation, as many people may get confused as to why gamma radiation is different form infrared radiation, and how their harm to you differs.Because of these, the barriers to entry to science is high, and people who pretend to understand, then mess up, are causing harm.Let's make an experiment:Are cigarettes going to give you cancer? If your instinctive reaction is anything other than \\"it increases the risk of cancer in habitual smokers\\", you aren't talking about the actual scientific findings, merely the \\"rehashed for the public\\" version. Cigarette companies will say it doesn't because not everyone who smokes gets cancer. Public health agencies will say it does, because being 20 times more likely to develop cancer because you smoke (or whatever the most recent data suggests, I am not exactly sure if there is more recent than what I found) is still an increase in cancer cases that can be linked directly to smoking.Either way, the science says \\"it increases the risk\\".How often do you hear that version, in contrast to \\"been smoking my whole life/for X many years and I'm still good\\" or \\"I mean, yeah, people who smoke get lung cancer\\"?And therein lies the science issue: When you're precise, people struggle to keep up with you. When you're simple, people don't realize it's simplified. When you strike a balance, you only attract the mildly curiously intrigued people.It's not scientists' fault if their profession is one of details, and it shouldn't be their job to defend the public's disrespect of their profession because they don't realize nuance, a problem bolstered by bad faith actors.","title":"CMV: Scientists have no one to blame but themselves for the record low trust Americans place in them now"},{"text":"There is Bill Murray grumpy and then there's Harrison Ford grumpy.

It delves into the possibility that humanitys past, present, and future are intertwined with the Anunnakiextraterrestrial beings from the planet Nibiruas described in ancient Sumerian and Akkadian creation stories.Key points discussed include:The Anunnakis Quest for Gold: The need for monoatomic gold to repair Nibirus atmosphere led the Anunnaki to Earth, establishing a weigh station on Mars to facilitate the transport through the asteroid belt (the hammered bracelet).Monotheism in Ancient Egypt: The introduction of monotheism by Akhenaten, possibly influenced by Marduk (Amen Ra), aimed to centralize worship and align human governance with Anunnaki interests.Enlil and Enkis Rivalry: The brothers conflicts resulted in cycles of destruction and rebirth, highlighting the repeating patterns in history.Forgotten Technologies: Ancient civilizations may have possessed advanced technologies (e.g., celestial chariots, Me tablets) that were lost or suppressed over time.Symbolism of the Eagle and the Serpent: Representing Enlil and Enki, respectively, their factions allegedly engaged in devastating wars involving nuclear weapons.Religious Narratives and Control: The transformation of Enki into a devil figure in religious texts served to suppress independent thought and maintain control over societies.UAP Phenomenon and Anunnaki Activity: The resurgence of UFO sightings might indicate renewed Anunnaki interest in Earth, with Mars as a strategic base.One World Government and AI: Modern movements toward centralized governance and the creation of AI mirror the Anunnakis hierarchical structures and genetic engineering of humans.The Culling Theory: Societal elites might be preparing for drastic population reductions, viewing the majority as hindrances to progress.Influence of Religious Elites: Governments may be controlled by religious hierarchies that perpetuate ancient agendas, affecting policies and societal norms.The post invites readers to consider whether understanding these connections can empower humanity to break free from repeating cycles of manipulation. It encourages open discussion on the possibility that fragments of truth are embedded within our myths and histories, and how we might forge our own destiny through unity, awareness, and challenging established narratives.","title":"The Eagle and Serpent: An Ancient Rivalry Still Shaping Our World"},{"text":"I was referring to Stacey Williams and Beatrice Keul.

I thought at least one of their stories ended up getting retracted[https://www.thecut.com/article/new-trump-allegation-stacey-williams.html](https://www.thecut.com/article/new-trump-allegation-stacey-williams.html)\\\\ As for the Hitler thing, Trump meets the definition for fascism in all ways. He's not Hitler, but both him and Hitler are fascists.Again, that's fine if you think that. But for people who don't, saying it again isn't going to convince them. That's the point I'm making. There are undecided voters who don't believe Trump is a fascist who's going to implement a dictatorship as soon as he wins, and saying it yet again isn't going to convince them. \\\\ As for the economy, it's actually doing pretty good right now, just not good for all people. The rising ride hasn't raised all boats. The economy is always a driver of votes, but not based on speculation. Instead people ask themselves if they are doing better or worse than 4 years ago. Most are doing better, and those that aren't are probably already Trump supporters.I would say that most aren't. The top... Maybe 10%, who have investments, savings, and who make enough that inflation hasn't really been noticed, yes, they're not doing worse. They might be doing better, depending on the industry/position they're in and if their wages have kept up with inflation. And I suppose if you're talking about literal 4 years ago, November 2020, people might be, because of COVID. But when I hear people talking about how they're struggling financially, it's always \\"before COVID this was never an issue\\". So if you look back to before COVID, I think the number of people who are struggling is a LOT higher.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk's remark is an October surprise potentially greater than Comey (2016) if Democrats use it"},{"text":"A D+7 shift from its previous September poll.

Harris cut it to 4-points in their September poll. Today's is their final poll and she jumped another 7-points to +3. The Harris campaign probably wouldve been happy with Trump +4 again because they werent expecting her to win Iowa (Trump won Iowa in 2020 by 8-points). This is bananas and it's gonna be all over the news.One more thing: [Blue Voter Guide](https://bluevoterguide.org/) helps with YOUR specific ballot. Its great for ballot propositions, as well as candidates without a (D) or (R) after their name (judges, commissioners, dog catcher).

Well, I did not intend that to be a religious statement, I am not religious.  And it wasn't a political statement.  That is simply the nature of being a living organism.  Another example: A male bee's life is practically a slave to it's queen, it doesn't know it, but it is the genetic blueprint behind it's existence.  Without a Queen Bee, the whole colony dies.  What do they work for, or live for?  It wasn't a conspiracy that made it that way, it's genetics whether or not if God made it that way.  A sex life is the drive of a man, maybe it is different for women, though I see many young females who actively date and think about relationships even more then young males.What is tied to full maturity of a human being?  Their sexual development.  Age is a non-factor, that is arbitrary in regards to the amount of time it takes for someone to reach sexual maturity.  The difference in hormones between being 8 years old and 13 years old is astronomical, so if I am being square here... I'd say sexual maturity is pretty damn important.  A male lion without a pride is a dead male, he is not a prolific hunter, but an enforcer and he has a role.  But he also has more stress without female companions.  The lioness' fulfill his role.  It's a simple male and female dynamic.
