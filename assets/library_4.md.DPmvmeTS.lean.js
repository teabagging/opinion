After Washingtons death in 1799, people were anxious to learn about the first President. Weems explained to a publisher in January 1800:Washington you know is gone! Millions are gaping to read something about him...My plan! I give his history, sufficiently minuteI then go on to show that his unparalleled rise and elevation were due to his Great Virtues.Weemss biography, The Life of Washington, was first published in 1800. It became an instant bestseller due to its approachable style. However, the cherry tree myth did not appear until the books fifth edition in 1806.Weems had several motives when he wrote The Life of Washington. Money was certainly one of them. He rightly guessed that if he wrote a popular history book about Washington it would sell.In the 1830s, William Holmes McGuffey turned Weems tale into a childrens story to be included in his textbooks. McGuffey was a Presbyterian minister and a college professor who wrote about teaching morals and religion to children. First published in 1836, McGuffeys Readers remained in print for nearly a hundred years and sold over 120 million copies. It taught the myth of the cherry tree to millions of American students.McGuffeys version of the cherry tree myth appeared in his The Eclectic Second Reader for almost twenty years. McGuffey made Washingtons language more formal, and he showed more respect to his fathers authority. For example, when Washingtons father explains the sin of lying, Weems says Washington spoke very seriously while McGuffey has young George respond tearfully. Follow-up questions at the end of McGuffeys cherry tree story reinforce its message: How did his father feel toward him when he made his confession? What may we expect by confessing our faults?The Cherry Tree myth also appeared outside of books, as the case of Joice Heth shows. Joice Heth was an elderly enslaved woman purchased by P.T. Barnum in 1835. He made her into a sideshow attraction, billing her as an enslaved woman who had raised George Washington. (If true, this would have made her 161 years old.) The stories she told about Washington, including the cherry tree myth, were right out of Weems writing. Many people saw Heth as credible because she was telling stories that people already knew.","title":"Musk and Ramaswamy think they have new power to cut federal regulations.

According to Ballotpedia:  In 36 states, vacancies are temporarily filled by gubernatorial appointment. A special election is then held coinciding with the next regularly scheduled election to replace the appointee. In the remaining 14 states, a special election is required within a certain time frame to fill the vacancy. Of those 14 states, eight allow for an interim gubernatorial appointment.","title":"House GOP margins shrink even more, teeing up paper-thin majority for start of Trump administration"},{"text":"Awesome  when they ask to be taken to your leader Im going to give them Trumps name.","title":"Man who made an AI that predicted the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia says there will be an alien invasion on December 3rd 2024"},{"text":"A one time loan forgiveness isnt lowering the cost of education.","title":"Donald Trump's Favorability Surges by Nearly 20 Points With Young Americans"},{"text":"brush your teeth zen","title":"Man who made an AI that predicted the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia says there will be an alien invasion on December 3rd 2024"},{"text":"Can I grab the data that says Ukrainian is anywhere near the top 3 corrupt European countries?

Ideally, you want Trump's policies to blow up in his face to the extent necessary to create a backlash to Trump and the Republicans and even create the conditions necessary for a policy shift in favor of expanding trade and immigration, ensure his status as a President where many people who voted for him will deny having voted for him, depress Republican turnout, maximize Democrat turnout, swing the swing voters solidly over to Democrats to the extent that the Midterms and next Presidential election become Democratic landslides at both the federal and state level, and have the formative experiences of the generation coming of age be so contemptuous of the Republican party's actions in their youth that they are a heavily Democratic demo going forward.However, you want it to blow up not to the extent that it causes so much acute suffering that the Democrats have to dedicate most or all of their political power to undoing the damage the next time they have power so they can ideally do some nice long-lasting policy contributions like establishing a public option, getting Ukraine admitted into NATO, trade blocs, immigration reform, creating a NATO-equivalent for the Far East with some forward thinking of proactively extend the collective security guarantees of the alliance to areas that are not formal members of the alliance but are deemed to be of strategic importance, establishing a Fed for housing (and, perhaps with mandate from backlash to Trump, remodeling other agencies after the Fed to minimize the influence any individual president can have on them). There is a paradox that likely has a not too large range of possibilities where Trump becomes equivalent to Bush II reputationally without being something where the Democrats have to spend a lot of time and effort doing damage control, economically, socially, and internationally. Unfortunately, given his picks regarding immigration and trade, it seems clear that Trump is absolutely prepared to take us in a direction that will admittedly have a decent chance of alienating most of the voting public but will mean Democrats will have to clean-up the incoming Trumpression, and I unfortunately have a bad feeling that simply lowering tariffs and slacking-off immigration enforcement is not going to be sufficient to recover things economically and we'll have to deal with some Obama-era problems of people being frustrated that recovery is not the instant turnaround to pre-Republican levels that they're gonna want it to be.","title":"The best-case scenario for Trumps second term"},{"text":"*insert Mike Myers:* \\"I like ^**GOLD**\\"","title":"Trump is threatening new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Now, Republicans alone couldn't remove Trump, as it requires 2/3rds of both Houses (equivalent to an Amendment; even higher than normal impeachment and removal, since it requires 2/3rds from the house, not a simple majority). It would require Democrats, but is possible. and as for scotus, they already ruled that he can do whatever he wants without questionAs bad a ruling as it was, in how utterly vague it was, that's not was they said. They said anything that is a core constitutional power exclusive to the President cannot be restrained. Other official acts are *presumed* immune, but it very explicitly says lower courts can make a decision as to whether or not immunity is real, based on whether it would restrict the President's ability to act confidently and boldly, more or less. Of course, any ruling would inevitably make its way back to the SCOTUS for review. However, that's how appellate review works, letting the court of first instance handle fact-finding and then appellate review basically deciding on questions of law, except for the occasional egregiously wrong fact. (Or the occasional fact that is inconvenient, like the *Kennedy v. Bremerton* case, where the SCOTUS majority really just made up an alternate scenario to rule on.)It'd just have been nice for the SCOTUS to not have delayed taking up the immunity case upon appeal, then waiting literally as long as possible to issue their opinion, on the final day of the term, and waiting some time before actually returning the case to the District Court, with effectively no answers on what is or is not immune, thereby leaving tons of work for the trial court.That'd have been great if they hadn't done that. Instead, they did, basically letting the clock run out, and more or less leaving everything unanswered, with no clear lines about what is core vs. non-core, and what sort of infringement would make a non-core duty immune.","title":"House GOP margins shrink even more, teeing up paper-thin majority for start of Trump administration"},{"text":"That's already been going on though.","title":"Man who made an AI that predicted the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia says there will be an alien invasion on December 3rd 2024"},{"text":"Right, but- and I'm genuinely asking- did he enact tariffs at the scale suggested by his (first) campaign rhetoric?

FriedmanIts often said that we live in a time when the improbable has become routine and the unthinkable gets posted on social media before breakfast. So, lets entertain a thought experiment: Could Donald J. Trump, twice impeached and four times indicted, genuinely chart a path to a Nobel Peace Prize?Before you laughor cryconsider this: The Nobel committee has awarded its prestigious peace prize to a wide range of figures, from traditional peacemakers like Martin Luther King Jr. to strategic pragmatists like Henry Kissinger, and even to individuals whose achievements raised eyebrows, such as Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The bar, it seems, is less about sainthood and more about whether one has tangibly shifted the tectonic plates of geopolitics toward peace.Enter Trump.Say what you will about his bombast and divisiveness, but even his fiercest critics must concede one point: The man knows how to dominate the stage. And in an era where global diplomacy often feels like theater, Trumps unorthodox approach to leadership has occasionally delivered outcomes that were surprising.Take, for example, the Abraham Accords, one of the most significant diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East in decades. Trumps administration brokered normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab states, including the UAE and Bahrain. Critics argue these accords were transactional, more about arms sales than peace. But ask an Emirati business owner in Tel Aviv or an Israeli tourist in Dubai, and theyll tell you: Peace is peace, however you slice it.Now, imagine Trump decides to go all in on one audacious, world-changing initiative during his post-presidency years. Lets say its North Korea. During his time in office, his love letters with Kim Jong-un were mocked as bizarre, and his summitry failed to yield meaningful denuclearization. But what if Trump were to leverage his unique rapport with the Hermit Kingdom to achieve the one thing no American president has accomplished: a formal peace treaty ending the Korean War?Or consider Ukraine. While Trumps record on the Russia-Ukraine conflict is controversial, what if he used his self-proclaimed dealmaking prowess to broker an end to the war? Picture a Mar-a-Lago summit where Zelenskyy and Putin hammer out terms over Trump-branded steaks. It sounds ludicrousuntil it isnt.Then theres the wildcard: China. Trumps presidency was defined by his hardline stance on Beijing, from trade wars to tech bans. But sometimes, its the hardliners who have the credibility to pivot toward dtente. What if Trump engineered a grand bargain to cool U.S.-China tensionsan agreement that secures Taiwans autonomy while avoiding outright war?Of course, these scenarios require Trump to embrace a level of patience, discipline, and altruism not typically associated with his leadership style. But if history teaches us anything, its that political reinvention is possible. Richard Nixon went to China. Anwar Sadat flew to Jerusalem. Stranger things have happened.To be clear, this isnt an endorsement of Trumps methods or morality. Far from it. His legacy, defined by chaos and controversy, is not easily reconciled with the ideals of the Nobel committee. But in a world desperate for peace, sometimes the messenger matters less than the message.A Trump Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate ironya testament to a world where the arc of history doesnt so much bend toward justice as it does zigzag unpredictably toward pragmatism. And while such a prospect might seem absurd today, remember: We live in absurd times.","title":"Opinion | Thomas Friedman: Trumps Path to a Nobel Peace Prize?"},{"text":"??","title":"Let me tell the confused redditors what r conspiracy is"},{"text":"I think we all know what Trump is wanting to do:He wants to rule the world.

Awhile back, we had some especially nasty attacks on black-owned businesses in Bellingham. There was an enduring unwillingness to discuss it head on, spread among people and perspectives.      \\nThose of us who refused to budge on the issue also came from a large swathe of our tent.    For me, the tell was that it then, as has been before, the desire to move on when issues of racial, sexual, or other visible/invisible minority issues are brought up.   \\nEven when there is not something *directly* we can do about it, I consider the refusal to entertain the idea a recurrent tell.2\\\\. Same as it ever was, listen. My approach offline is to let people exhaust themselves, and then talk about one or two things they seem to care about. I use the word *seem,* and I really want to emphasise it. Some of these people are winnable; some of them are just 'having a bad day,' and while that never excuses anything, a light nudge can do a lot of good.Others don't run out of steam, because they aren't using tells or dogwhistles but a bullhorn, and what they really want is a platform to enshrine their beliefs to anyone in range.   \\nIn that case, I usually just ask if there is a point to anything they're saying, and figure out whether to try any other approach or move on.3\\\\. Recently, I had someone bring up (of course) Hilary Clinton, and talk about how she was so 'preachy.' I asked what she - the person I was talking with - meant, and she didn't really know, because she hasn't heard Hilary Clinton speak. Not once.   The Hilary Clinton she knows is through 'funny' 'memes' from right-wing sources, and hours of youtube content consumed in a similar fashion to older right-wing voters consuming Fox News.So I asked what she didn't like about Clinton, and she didn't really know. But she was angry at me for asking, because her friends didn't like Clinton, and friends never lie or give bad information.I didn't press the issue; I did mention she might like some other Democrats and their plans for healthcare, which she tentatively agreed on before I described something which she found pretty good - healthcare being a prime concern of hers.    \\nThe revealing that I was talking about, [you guessed it...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993?useskin=vector)Did make her think for a bit, but I don't think she'll change her mind.  \\nWe only see each other sometimes, at events like tonight.    \\nShe will talk to other people, and those people's regular opinions will take precedence.I think, sometimes, issues get *dismissed,* even among vulnerable communities, because admitting people care is difficult.    \\nAdmitting you might have not had a full understanding is difficult, even when people are working with you, and not against you.    \\nThere's no easy way to solve that, either; I don't think it can be solved.   \\nMy *hope* is that our conversation, which never got too heavy, rattles around in her mind into the future.   \\nBut we'll see, as ever; we'll see.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"A reporter asked Trump about the qualifications of Dr Oz.

Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.     \\nAnd yet people listened, and they were enthused.  \\nI do not believe they were faking it.But they cared far *more* about hurting other people.One of the things I've gotten a lot, now, in the aftermath is pushback and anger.  \\n\\"Don't preach at me!\\" \\"Did you want me to swear *FEALTY* to the DEMS?\\" \\"It's Kamala's fault for being the nom!\\" etc.But the places it comes from the most are not Dems, but people who I - again -    \\nSuspected sat out at the end of the day, some of whom have admitted to voting for Trump and/or republicans.       \\nI don't judge them when we're talking, though I do have my feelings.            \\nBut I listen, and treat them like adults, and separate what I firmly believe, and have believed for my entire life.What I will focus on instead, is going over your suggestion.      \\nIn the short term, that *will not work* if people making these decisions care more about hurting someone, even themselves, than helping anyone.In the *long* term, that is what we've done and have had to do.   \\nBut, unfortunately...   \\nThere are a lot of voters who need to feel directly impacted before they're willing to act on the things they *say* they care about.Always, when thinking about this topic, I return to an old acquaintance of mine.    \\nOne I can't jettison, and do more good by checking in on, but a person I think it would be very hard for anyone of us here to call a friend.He does not *actively* hate anyone who is not like himself. But inactive hatred remains hatred -And, whenever his life is good, his #1 value, how he has *always* voted, is against the party in power - Dems -     \\nAnd locally, for whomever he feels is going to cause other people pain.  \\nI am not exaggerating how he thinks, here, either.     \\nWhen he has good circumstances, all he talks about is how 'others' are going to take those away from them, and also how rough he has it.On top of everything else, his union salary is high, and I would argue the reason he *likes* the union he's in because it feels exclusionary to him, which itself seeps over to other members he interacts with. (Which is, itself, a problem.)Now, the caveat; the moment republicans screw over the nation, which has happened every time they're in power, he's willing to vote Democrats up and down the ballot.  \\nThe harsh words are mostly gone, but he is *begging* anyone, someone, to save *him.*   I do not have any delusions he is going to change his mind, but we work with what we have.I'm sorry for going on here, but I wanted to add an older perspective on this one.     \\nThere are a lot of people that *say* they want 'union hall/construction site stump speeches' -    \\nWhile knowing that's an acceptable way to appear, among the company of their more left-wing friends.      \\nThey might nod and agree that the dignity of work sounds like a nice line, but they are not voting for Sherrod Brown, unfortunately.Which gets us back to the long term.   \\nIn the long term, our ability to reach these voters depends on people like you and me.   \\nAnd we can; but a lot of how we reach them is *parties in power flipping.*   \\nObviously, that's not sustainable. However, I think it's just as important to understand that there are a good chunk of voters that -  \\nRight now, in the world we live in -   \\nAre at that place as their starting point, right now.I believe that our long term goal is, unfortunately, doing what we've done since I've started this work.     \\nPatiently working with the voters, but understanding that what they say they want and their actions may be very divorced from one another.        \\nUsing that work - and whatever approach works best with the voters who are regulars - to make them more receptive to our ideas and ideals.      \\nNot only in their words, but in their *actions* as well.*Fortunately,* I do think that's possible, as it has been in the past. Hard, yes, difficult, absolutely.      \\nAnd it will involve a lot of what you write as code-switching (interesting, I've only ever heard that in the context of language!), but also -     \\nRecognising that the people we are trying to win over may seem responsive, may *genuinely listen,* and then -On the night, do the exact opposite of what they said and implied, and blame us, while resting peacefully, without a doubt in their mind.Sorry for going on, I'll sum it up as -      \\nDo what works for you, but *please don't lose hope* if what feels like it should work, what *feels* like it's getting a good response and *is* working...  \\nIs ultimately let down by voters, themselves.    A lot of what we do is not just finding what works best, but enduring through that kind of terrain -   \\nAnd I know firsthand how frustrating that kind of defeat after genuinely good energy and connections can feel.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"There isnt a Speaker election right now.

An estimate by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which assumes a 20 percent tariff, finds that it would reduce the real income of families in the bottom fifth of earners by 5.7 percent, of middle-income families by 4.6 percent, but of the top 1 percent by only 1.4 percent. An analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics arrives at similar numbers.

The EV charging and broadband programs they keep using are examples where state administered programs using block grants are used to avoid high overheads. They have a very long startup time because states have to pass their own enabling legislation and then get their companion programs approved to receive grants. None of that has anything to do with federal agencies having fun with CFRs.Some of the CFR issues are fundamental to the way we regulate safety. NRC exist to make nuclear power as safe as possible even if doing so is impractical and the effect of regulation makes society less safe because less nuclear power is used. FRA is largely the same.Even in cases where regulation and safety are split (eg NTSB and FAA for aviation, FSIS and CDC/FDA/USDA for food safety) safety requirements are still pretty absurd, just not absurd enough to kill industry. To make NRC or FRA suck less requires a profound change in regulation, effectively starting again on how those industries are regulated, beyond anything congress have done for anything in decades.I have absolutely no confidence Trump, Elon or Vivek have the right skills to even suggest how to improve these problems. It's basically lock some wonks in a room for 6 months and tell them to completely redesign regulatory agencies. They would find it extremely boring, and it doesn't agree with how they think government should work; they don't understand it's the detail in USC not the name of the bill that updates USC that matters.  Also, it goes directly against what Trump wants to do, reducing CFR power is reducing executive power as then what &amp; how they do is purely statutory, political appointments become less relevant. Kind of like how FDA is organized for drug regulation where the FDA commissioner is basically pissing into the wind trying to change anything about it, its nearly all statute.The closest we have got to that would be the fed as primary bank regulator but that was more shuffling around existing powers different agencies had and not a great deal of much new. I simply don't believe its possible for congress to pass reform packages like this anymore as it's been about 40 years since that's been done (with a few notable national security exceptions following 9/11).","title":"What the Trump administration might mean for the future of the bipartisan infrastructure law"},{"text":"Bubye Rob #The meathead Reiner","title":"Rob Reiner Deletes X/Twitter Account Following Trump Victory... \\"Another one bites the dust\\" ??"},{"text":"You too, and a safe one as well!","title":"Trump keeps his personal thanksgiving tradition alive with special Truth Social message | \\nThe president-elect has a unique style when it comes to spreading holiday cheer"},{"text":"Devaluation can't occur in a vacuum, it has to be denominated in something you exchange dollars for.

While the devastation of fentanyl deaths demands action, his approach focused on tariffs and punitive measuresignores the complexities of the drug epidemic and the larger social and economic issues fueling it.For example, Mexicos President Claudia Sheinbaum recently fired back at Trumps remarks, pointing out that the U.S. bears significant responsibility for its own drug crisis. She cited statistics showing that the majority of fentanyl trafficking occurs within the United States and through legal ports of entry not across the open border Trump often references. Sheinbaum also highlighted the U.S.s high demand for illegal drugs and insufficient action on addiction treatment as major contributors to the problem. Her response underscores a key flaw in Trumps plan: blaming other countries wont solve a domestic crisis rooted in decades of systemic failures.Additionally, while imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada might sound tough, it would do little to stop the manufacturing and trafficking of fentanyl precursors. Drug cartels are highly adaptable and will simply shift their operations or routes, as they have done countless times before. Meanwhile, these tariffs would hurt American businesses and consumers, straining vital trade relationships without addressing the actual flow of drugs. Mexico, as Sheinbaum pointed out, already works closely with U.S. agencies on counternarcotics effortscooperation that threats of tariffs could undermine.Instead of relying on tariffs and ad campaigns, which history has shown to be ineffective, the U.S. needs to focus on public health solutions and international collaboration. Expanding access to addiction treatment, including medications like methadone and buprenorphine, would address the demand side of the problem. Domestically, investing in mental health care and economic opportunities for at-risk communities would tackle the systemic issues fueling addiction. Internationally, strengthening partnerships such as the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee created under Biden, is far more productive than antagonizing allies and trade partners.The fentanyl crisis requires evidence-based, cooperative strategies, not simplistic rhetoric and policies that risk further economic and diplomatic fallout. Solving this crisis starts with taking responsibility for systemic failures within the U.S., not scapegoating other nations.","title":"Trump says hes planning large-scale ad campaign on fentanyl crisis"},{"text":"This guys is just angry dementia Reagan.","title":"Trump claims a win on immigration after a call with Mexicos president.

I.e. do not just murder/assault/abuse others, don't commit crime, etc. - treat others how you wish to be treated at the end of the day. There are certain things that plain and simple just are bad which no person wishing to live a life of goodness should do, however there is a grey area where good/evil becomes a lot more nuanced and subjective. Good/evil in this grey area, to me, is based on a multitude of personal, environmental, circumstantial, (the list goes on), factors. It gets quite complex and it's quite tough to pinpoint a singular definition of good and evil in this grey area; God/Satan to me is a pretty succinct way to describe some universally good/evil things, but I'll say it doesn't do a good job with the nuances. It's a black and white way to describe the themes; it's as polarized as it can get pretty much.

This boom is record setting in its duration, largely due to massive quantitative easing during the GFC and pandemic, which makes me think that the fall will be steeper and longer as a result.Project 2025 also has, among its many other disturbing policy proposals, the USA returning to the gold standard.This is of course economic madness and favours crypto while hobbling government support of the USD and other interventions in the market.Facilitating the onset of a long overdue and inevitable cyclic economic recession means that the US will be among the first ones into recession and they are gambling that the US will be the first one out.China, the U.K. and many other economies, will be tipped into deep recession should the US economy enter an economic recession. Their plan is to capitalise on the crushing of the Chinese economy and somehow stimulate US manufacturing to change the balance of trade.In Australia we have a saying \\"When America sneezes Australia comes down with pneumonia\\". As a trading nation ,with China as our major trading partner, mainly within the resource sector followed by agriculture and education etc, our fortunes are tied.These are the consequences of handing over the US to self-interested and ruthless billionaires.

Other countries will retaliate. Worldwide economies will suffer. US companies will go bankrupt, farmers will go out of business. The Trump administration will funnel US tax dollars to prop up companies and farmers most hit by the results.Trump will \\"negotiate\\" new trade deals, which will be fairly similar to trade deals previously existing but with minor changes around the edges. Did USMCA differ substantially from NAFTA, and did it solve our trade issues with Mexico and Canada? Nonetheless, Trump will announce these new trade deals with great fanfare and claim he's \\"fixed\\" our trade and immigration issues.Subsequently, the Trump administration will change the processes for reporting trade and immigration numbers and cherry-pick the data to make the statistics look better.  Right wing media will parrot Trump talking points of the great success, and the MAGA faithful will hail Trump as a hero.Meanwhile, the US economy will have lost billions of dollars, our GDP will have suffered, inflation will have shot up, and the deficit will explode due to loss of tax revenue and payouts to businesses and agricultural interests. Great.Edit: I left some other details out. Trump will argue (in fact, he already has) that income from tariffs will be large enough to justify huge tax cuts. The net effect of this will be to replace the income tax with a more regressive sales tax (since tariffs on consumer goods are, ultimately, sales taxes); and giving huge tax breaks to the wealty and to corporations.Later in his administration, when tariffs don't produce significant revenue to replace the lost tax revenue and the deficit skyrockets, Trump will use that to justify cuts in social services: Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, Veteran's Benefits, and so on.","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"Kudos for not spelling it \\"free reign\\"","title":"Zuckerberg dines with Trump in Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Hes such a fucking idiot","title":"Trump says hes planning large-scale ad campaign on fentanyl crisis"},{"text":"Shh. ??","title":"Does the Democrats still want to win 2028?

What is so sad is that isn't even a disparagement, it's just literally the state of affairs according to adult proficiency test scores in various cohorts.In fact, 54% of American adults read below a sixth grade level; 21% (1 in 5) of American adults are illiterate. How on Earth could we expect that audience to understand the policy implications of social welfare programs or renewable energy? How can we expect people who can't even tell you what the difference between race and ethnicity is, about whether they should vote for education reform on the basis of those concepts?I guarantee you that some huge plurality of MAGA voters genuinely believe an area in their town is not safe, not because of crime, socioeconomic conditions, education, etc., but because a given ethnicity of people appear in that area. Some people literally believe that being a certain race preordains you to act a certain way; this is literally debunked Nazi eugenics stuff. These people are unapologetically operating from misguided, racist, and sexist assumptions about society because they lack the incredulity or literacy to examine those assumptions in any serious way.MAGA voters will tell you they don't think a female should be president. They will tell you they don't think a black or brown person should be president. Then, they will spend hours commenting on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook about how identity politics has nothing to do with why people voted for Trump. Ridiculous.These people are not serious. They want what they want, and what they want is to not see a female president telling them that their tax dollars should fund social welfare programs, even the ones that support their livelihood, the livelihood of those near them; because that would be woke and wokeness is bad. Classic example is the 2017 study showing a sizable minority of Americans did not know Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act were the same. In the survey, 35% of respondents said either they thought Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act were different policies (17%) or didnt know if they were the same or different (18%). This confusion was more pronounced among people 18-29 and those who earn less than $50,000 - two groups that could be significantly affected by repeal.Or, a more recent study (2024) showing that Americans indicated that lowering the cost of goods and services should be the Trump administration's highest priority, that they favored placing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, but agreed that tariffs on goods imported from other countries would make prices of goods and services more expensive.So, lemme get that straight: Americans said they want lower costs for goods and services, favor placing tariffs on imported goods, and agree that tariffs on imported goods will raise the cost of goods and services. WTF? This is nonsense, it is just plain ignorance. How can we expect an audience that can't multiply decimals with pen and paper to make determinations about economic policy or international trade agreements?Thousands of pages have been printed since the election, pondering why Kamala Harris lost after running a great campaign. MAGA voters will tell you it's because of sex change operations, Liz Cheney, blue-haired liberal LGBTQ teenagers, wokeness, LatinX, etc., but at the end of the day millions of Americans used their vote to endorse a six-time bankrupt, adjudicated rapist, and felon that tried and failed to overthrow the government as their leader.American people are either willfully ignorant, misinformed, or dramatically without a moral center, to arrive at a choice like that. They made a horrid, self-interested decision that they will now have to live with and will shape the lives of their children and their country forever.","title":"Sharon Stone Says America Is Naive and Ignorant and Arrogant After Donald Trump Win: My Country Is in the Midst of Adolescence"},{"text":"I'm beginning to think there's some kind of outside force acting on us like super intelligent AI or aliens, or fate is real, or we're in a simulation, because I have routinely run into these kinds of interactions with people - I had a grown adult co-worker recently tell me that the state and federal government are actually the same thing, In a patronizing voice.?","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":"We're all those things, but dont forget depolorable and trash. lol.

Highlights from a call with my MAGA dad:- The Dept of Ed has to go so states can make education better and pay teachers more - Ukraine was the aggressor, and Russia didn't invade, but it's too complicated for anyone to understand; we shouldnt give them money or arms- Russia has the best economy and way better than the US- We need to look at the background of politicians and who backs them so we can tell who we are voting for, but Trump is different because he had a dream- Well get so much money that I will be celebrating Trump when he abolishes the IRS.- Tariffs will force China, Mexico, and Canada to stop cheating, and Americans can now start buying American-made, and the prices will drop everywhere- Mass deportation to stop illegal voting and weaken the cheating Democrats- downsizing the government and removing programs and departments will finally have a functioning government- oil prices are going to be at their lowest when Trump opens up our oil reserves, and we wont rely on foreign oil anymore- asked about Social Security and Medicare (both my folks benefit from these) and what he would do if they took that away. I wont be around long enough when that happens.

Not in the slightest, and Im in agreement with you about so much. Usually these are so insightful and interesting to me.But even though the working class includes nurses, teachers, and less stereotypical workers, I wonder what we can do to get the hard hat vote back into our column. Like obviously we cannot stop talking about race, or LGBTQ and womens issues, but due to societys implicit bias against women this group of predominantly male laborers is difficult to appeal to through our current tactic. Like they see us as feminine coded and feminine coded = bad to them.Any politician does this, but I feel like its maybe a good idea for future candidates to lean even more into creating a union hall/construction site stump speech that differs from the high school gym/generic community center stump speech. Obviously Im not saying to lie, but if I were to run for office I am sure as hell going to play up my plan to protect social security when meeting union members, while maybe playing up my plan to protect a womans right to choose if Im a candidate at a standard forum would be a better choice.Again, I think that most savvy campaigns do this, and the Harris campaign did, but code switching/message tailoring I think really needs to mastered to appeal to a broad coalition. You cant be everything to all people but you can meet people where they are.That isnt really an answer but the beginning of one. Maybe someone could build this into a really cool idea.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"\\"No more dynasties!\\"?\\n~Cult45","title":"Ron DeSantis slows the process to fill Marco Rubio's Senate seat as pressure grows from Trump world | Consideration centers on whether to appoint Lara Trump to fill the Senate seat being left by Rubio, who has been tapped for secretary of state, but other names are on the shortlist."},{"text":"All the while voting for a guy who hasnt coherently articulated a thought years.","title":"Trump Mocked After Mexico's President Blows Up His Brag About Their Call"},{"text":"My wife made my dinner.?","title":"Joy Reid sends message to Republicans ahead of Thanksgiving: 'Make your own dinner, MAGA'"},{"text":"Does he think people are intentionally taking fentanyl?

What a fascinating concept!It's true, the echo chamber itself begins to act an entity unto itself. I was thinking about this after the election, that there's an issue with affirmation biases and in-grouping, but because of the difference of epistemic standards, one side can weaponize it while the other is hamstrung by it. When a group reaches a consensus, anything challenging that consensus will be met with vitriol and the group will rally around the consensus. The difference between right vs left is that the left actually has a rigorous standard as to how consensus should be reached; this standard is not always evenly applied and sometimes outright fails to reach truth, but it's a standard outside of the individual. The right, on the other hand, sees shared personal belief as rigorous enough to form consensus.This means a misinformation campaign targeting right wing voters just has to spew the same lie enough that people believe it, and a consensus can form around that new belief. But one targeting leftist voters has to come with some sort of fact or actual truth behind it. It's much easier to dissuade voters with such truth, and it makes compromise from extreme positions impossible (since they feel their views are objectively verified).

More American owned factories, more jobs, more cash flow over the course of time.Bringing jobs and locally made products back to America will be good for the economy down the line but the effects won't be felt for years.Or you know, keep on importing and American businesses and jobs leave.That was my understanding but of you'd be able to offer a better understanding or what you think is the goal I would definitely like to know :)","title":"The contradictions of Trumponomics over tariffs lie exposed"},{"text":"there's a lot of diversity in this sub in terms of the content and depth of argument.

Well yes this is exactly what people want when they go on distinctly opinioned subreddits. It's your personal responsibility to interact with different types of people if you truly want an unfiltered environment evenly distributed personality environment. Think of subreddits as different communities much like in person.    I am an athiest but I love volunteering. I go help feed the homeless with a catholic volunteer group. For a whole lot of reasons I disagree with these people. However when I am in their community on the basis of volunteering I stick to the topic. I don't feel particularly ostracized for not wanting to lead the prayer for the day or whatever and me being an athiest isn't a secret, but I don't find it appropriate to share my views on religion with that group. Sure I should have freedom of speech but if I constantly expressed my personal issues with christianity without being asked while participating with them, I wouldnt be surprised if one day they said please dont show up (even if i did so in the most polite way possible). That is the reality of things. Spaces are ruled by the majority opinion. Of course there may be a single Catholic who thinks it's great that I bring up my differing opinions, but if the majority are made uncomfortable, I get it.  Think of the moderator like the organizer for the event. He may or may not have a personal issue with me, and if he sees that many others have an issue with me, it is well within his right  to ask me not to show up. Now let's say there are multiple organizing groups thay I can volunteer with. Perhaps one is a non-relgious group but they just don't meet often enough and they group is small and occasionally inactive. I can express my opinions freely there but it doesnt exactly feel like a consistent group where my voice can be heard. Now there is another major group that gets a bunch of donations but the organizer is known to be really strict and intolerant and has a burning hatred for everyone outside his religion. However all the members of the group love him because they are indifferent to his hatred of outsiders but also love his charismatic manners towards those who he likes AND they appreciate his extreme commitment to keeping the group together, active and happy. I can certainly try to join that group, but I would definitely have to conceal information about my beliefs if I don't want to be kicked out. I could possibly try to covertly join, befriend everyone and try to make them less indifferent to their leaders bias but I risk making everyone uncomfortable and my protest against his behaviour is honestly a waste of time.  Especially considering there is yet another slightly smaller volunteer group, that while still religious is slightly less intense. I can also choose to become an organizer myself if none of these spaces suit me but then I must put in the effort to grow that community.  Even if that community is based on accepting everyone no matter what, that's just going to be unrealistic as it will end up being an amalgamation of the average boundaries of the most active members in the group.  \\nThis is life. Not every stage is an open mic, and not every establishment wants you there. Theres is no such thing as a community welcoming to everyone. It can be welcome to most but not everyone. It can seem welcome to everyone if the focus is something specific like group of people who like miniature model airplanes as long as everyone sticks to the topic. But no place is without boundaries and made for you. Reddit does not have a moderator problem. People always have a varying intensities of opinions and form different boundaries for their growing communities everyday. Each and every community forces you to conform to some degree, but you never know how much you truly have to unless you personally deviate greatly from the norm.","title":"CMV: Reddit has a moderator problem"},{"text":" But since you're so adamant about defending them, go volunteer.Sir, the 1st 2nd and 3rd Reddit Keyboard Divisions are ready to go!Lmao at all the internet tough guys.

We can easily take our values for granted but the truth is that a huge amount of the morality that we currently accept as self-evident was based on belief in God, divine justice and the Bible. I was brought up Catholic/Anglican and walked away at a young age and became a long time agnostic/atheist. I now realise that mainstream \\"Christian\\" denominations are (Satanic) counterfeits. It is sad because my upbringing in these false churches led me to think that I knew what true Christianity is. It wasn't until I read the Bible, primarily the New Testament, for myself that I realised this. Read [Matthew ch. 23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023&amp;version=KJV) if you want an idea of what Jesus Christ had to say about the religious leadership.

Their idea of winning however is to come back into circles of those on the losing side and being petty just to inflict more pain.  Taunt them with \\"I told you so isms\\". And gloat over the unpleasantness the future likely holds for them.   Their idea of celebrating is to relish in the fact the other side lost and to take joy in the fact that the losers are hurting.  Kicking a man when he's down is the party worthy of celebrating.   And that IS what they are doing en masse everywhere you look.  The absolute pervasiveness with which they are doing it is yet again telling if the type of cult mentality they have surrendered to.

The Commerce Department has noted that threats to national security may include fostering U.S. dependence on unreliable or unsafe imports or fundamentally threatening the ability of U.S. domestic industries to satisfy national security needs.This is not what the Constitution intended, and Congressional power has slowly been ceded to the Executive branch. This erosion started in the 1930s under President Roosevelt and got a major push in 1962 when President Kennedy signed Sec 232 into law. This is the part of the Trade Expansion Act that allowed Trump to impose the tarrifs that started the first [trade war with China](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/more-pain-than-gain-how-the-us-china-trade-war-hurt-america/) and it's the power that he will use to enact his expansive tarrif plan this time around.

However, it's safe to say that there is no political appetite to tackle this issue in the near future...if ever.","title":"How to persuade Donald Trump that tariffs would Make America Weak Again?"},{"text":"Thanks for nothing, Joe, wish in one hand and shit in the other end see which fills up faster.","title":"Biden on Trumps tariff plan: I hope he rethinks it"},{"text":" I assume this was intentional sabotage, but maybe it was just a blunder.

Here's some fun thoughts you might not want to bring up at the dinner table, but are worth thinking about:#Table Talks, Episode 6: What Happens in Vegas Doesn't Stay TherePrevious episodes: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gopn8g/daily_discussion_thread_november_11_2024/lwnngpi/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gr2ama/daily_discussion_thread_november_14_2024/lx59h3i/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gu27i1/daily_discussion_thread_november_18_2024/lxtwwo2/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gwdo3d/daily_discussion_thread_november_21_2024/lybq7bf/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gzgawd/daily_discussion_thread_november_25_2024/lyywogl/)When you read that title, what comes to mind?  Ticket splitting?  Voting trends among Latino voters?  Challenges in polling a city with a transient population that works off-hours?If so...forget politics for just a second.  Las Vegas?  Most people think of the casinos!  The nightlife!  And it doesn't get more Vegas than a round of poker.I hate poker, by the way, and I'm bad at it.  Why?  Because poker has very little to do with the actual cards.  And people don't say what they're really holding.  But master poker players know how to look for 'tells'.  Everyone has a tell - something unconscious that they do that reveals the sort of hand they're really holding.I can't teach you how to win at poker, but I know a thing or two about 'tells' in political conversation.  And once you start seeing them, you see that our whole discourse has a serious problem with including and respecting women.**Tell me more!**One of the biggest tells in politics is what we consider unimportant.  That's not a typo.  People have valid, personal reasons for the issues they care about, and I won't question those.  But the interesting question to me is...which issues get *dismissed*?  Minimized?  Considered worthy of being sacrificed for something else?  Or sacrificed for no good reason?[Stop me if you've read a take like this before.](https://thehill.com/opinion/5004793-democrats-focus-working-class/)  We've got a dude saying Democrats should ditch 'identity politics' and focus on 'practical economics'.  Thankfully, this guy takes the time to describe each of those ideas.  'Identity politics' means 'racial and gender issues', while 'practical economics' means 'building infrastructure', 'partnerships with local industry', and promoting jobs in 'healthcare, IT, and advanced manufacturing'.  Childcare is also thrown in at the end, briefly.If you read Episode 5, you know where I'm going with this.  I should clarify that Democrats are right to focus on every one of those things.  But why do we need to throw out the female-coded issue (gender issues, whatever he means by that) to support the male-coded issues (building stuff, industry, and male-coded fields)?  Can't we do both?  **The fact that the writer thinks we need to downplay women's issues is a tell.**  Because we can and should do both.  But this author clearly thinks women bleeding out in hospital parking lots is a distraction from 'the important issues'.Try looking for these attitudes in highly-upvoted political comments or widely-shared articles.  You'll find a disappointing number of similar tells.**Who matters?**Quick, which voters matter most?If you've been in politics for a while, you know the answer to this depends heavily on where a candidate is running, and what they're running for.  Unless you ask the very smart analysts!If Democrats just *served the working class,* they'd never lose another election, right?  Well...they do serve the working class, actually, and never stopped.  But I won't rant about that again.  Instead, let's ask \\"What does 'working class' mean?\\"  [Thankfully, we have a smart guy here to explain it to us!](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183060/why-working-class-voters-have-been-shifting-toward-the-republican-party)  See, Democrats ran Kamala Harris, who doesn't connect to the working class *for some unknown reason*.  But Joe Biden and Donald Trump do, *for some unknown reason*.  I guess I just imagined all those videos of average people in literal tears getting to meet Kamala Harris, then.  Or maybe those people - mostly women - don't count as working class, *for some unknown reason*.I'm sure you've seen other analyses describing the working class as factory workers, blue-collar workers, etc.  Not as nursing home aides, teachers, secretaries, and service industry workers.  The point is, **when your definition of working class excludes female working class people, that's also a tell.** Those voters backed Harris, by the way, but good luck finding any real discussion on that.  The discourse just implicitly excludes women from the all-important 'working class'.**So what's going on here?**How do people keep spitting out these ill-informed ideas, and how do people keep on falling for them?  This is where things get interesting.  Because sexism isn't always screaming the c-word on stage.  It takes a subtle form, too, and one that almost impossible to escape.[Unconscious bias, sometimes called implicit bias, explains what's going on here.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2018/12/17/here-is-how-unconscious-bias-holds-women-back/)  It's the idea that bias doesn't come from force, but from thousands of subtle, unconscious actions.  Our society is set up in a way that consistently presents women and female-coded ideas as lesser.  It shows up in the roles we assign, the language we use, and the attitudes we value.  And it shows up everywhere.When I talk about 'tells', I'm really talking about signs of unconscious bias.  The guys writing these analyses probably didn't set out to discredit women's views.  To them, it's just a given that women's issues and perspectives matter less, and it comes out naturally.  Same with that 7000-upvote comment saying that Harris' laugh is grating and she didn't come off tough like Trump, and why don't Democrats just listen to the blue-collar workers?  Look for those subtle little dismissals of female perspectives or female-coded traits.  Once you see it, it's hard to unsee.**What you shouldn't take away from this**I'm sure you can think of many examples of tells you've seen.  \\"Identity politics\\", \\"the working class\\" (when it's not made clear that women are part of the working class), \\"forget abortion and focus on kitchen table issues\\", \\"stop focusing on suburban voters (stereotyped as women in many discussions)\\", \\"Democrats need a fighter, not like Harris\\", and other such comments that subtly sideline women are some of the big ones.And here's the scary thing: You might recognize some of these tells in your own rhetoric.  If you're feeling brave, go through your past political comments.  (I did and had an hour-long cringe attack, so be warned).  But there are two **extremely important** things to realize:1. If your comments are full of dismissals of women...that doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.  It means you grew up in a society that dismisses women, and absorbed its values naturally, as most of us do.  The key is whether you stay there, or try and change your views.  If you're still reading this and not just planning your angry rebuttal, that's a good sign!2. If what you took away from this was a list of things not to say, you've badly missed the point.  The problem isn't just the words, it's the attitudes they show and spread.  Instead, take some time to honestly reflect on why you feel this way.  Is it possible you're wrong?  If the idea makes you angry, is there some of that masculine fragility we chatted about in Episode 2?  Bias is never solved by repression; only by honest reflection.Once you're aware of unconscious bias, you see the tells everywhere, like a sexism poker star.  Maybe in yourself, too.  And if you do...that's actually a good thing!  Because once you see it, you can challenge it.  And once you start to overcome it, you can be a part of un-fucking our political system and our society.  If we're going to seriously fight bias against women in politics, it starts with fighting it in ourselves, and in those closest to us.**Questions to consider**1. Can you name any other 'tells' that reveal unconscious biases?  I'm particularly interested in what our female readers have to say on this one.2. When someone you care about is speaking in a way loaded with 'tells', what's the best way to address it?  (It's generally not to loudly call them sexist - see Episode 2 if you're not sure why).3.

But norms are a prerequisite for deep conversations to occur. /r/science would be much worse if anyone could just post anything and we let the upvotes sort it out. The ability for mods to establish and enforce norms are required to have the good subreddits. If you dont like the rules of the whales book group, youre free to go start your own book group at your house (/r/truewhales).
