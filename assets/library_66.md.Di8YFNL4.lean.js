We've seen already the current Supreme Court doesn't really make decisions based on precedent if it doesn't suit their ideology. Do I think its likely they would make a rulling saying only the children of lawful immigrants can be given birthright citizenship? No. I do think its a possibility though when even 4-6 years ago I would have outright rejected it as even possible, which is terrifying.We're essentially relying on the good faith and honest interpretation of law of people I have no trust in doing so.","title":"You Are NEVER Going to Repeal Birthright Citizenship"},{"text":"I message a friend of mine everyday (since last Wednesday) when is the going away party.

At best case, they will do exactly what the administrations are doing today, and at worse they will either not act (permitting bad actions), or pass laws that are unscientific (actively allowing things that should not be). However, laws are written by politicians and lobbyests, whereas administrative rules are typically informed by staff scientists and engineers.  That is an implicit guardrail, allowing qualified technical people to be involved in the process without requiring an act of congress.With a Trump administration being headed by bad actors, at worse case will be allowing bad things during his tenure.  However, because those bad administrative rules could be undone by a following administration, I would argue that is much better than having an ignorant or captured congress fix bad policy into law.  Thus, there is implicit guardrail that exists by the lack of permanency of an administrative rule.","title":"John Thune Voted New Senate Majority Leader  Despite MAGAs Opposition"},{"text":"Clearly a personality hire.","title":"Trump taps Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary"},{"text":"Oh theres a difference?","title":"The Trump closing of the hands.

He doesnt have a solid grasp of the issues or policiesjust big ideas that are either impossible to implement or wont work the way he thinks they will.So the real opportunists, who are smarter than Trump, are doing everything they can to curry his favor and get their policies in place. Mostly, this means tax cuts and deregulation, but there could be even more radical measures, such as Project 2025.

You can't just vote Trump and expect that will drain the swamp when you literally vote to put the swamp back in power in congress now consistently for 8 years even after they've been exposed. Fact is majority of Americans couldn't even tell you who the senate majority leader is they just vote for whatever name they recognize which is who the elites on their TV and phones tell them to. Trump broke through all that but he's one person and only one branch of government. Much harder to break through it at the local level where the candidate is different for everyone, as long as we have a corrupt media that works for the swamp instead of we the people.It's not all doom and gloom though. Trump has many ways to give them the finger and break their toys now. So if they want to play games let them. They go too far and they will absolutely go the way of Liz Cheney, especially when we have those like Elon Musk on our side and the power and transparency of X to expose them like we couldn't before. Worst case Vance can take back the senate and oust Thune. I anticipate that will happen if Thune tries any funny business this time. We'll see.

To add why even players in the segment dont like refineries that much, its to do with the mechanics of the financial aspect to it. With drilling, you just have to cover your drilling costs. With refineries, your crack spread (price of selling your refined product, minus the cost of buying your crude/feed) has to cover your fixed costs (which are high), and are incredibly volatile (its two moving parts vs drilling where its 1), and it can quite often get into negative territory.

We illustrate these conventional approaches by applying them to the tariffs introduced by the Trump administration during 2018. In the wake of this increase in trade protection, the United States experienced substantial increases in the prices of intermediates and final goods, dramatic changes to its supply-chain network, reductions in availability of imported varieties, and the complete pass-through of the tariffs into domestic prices of imported goods. Therefore, the full incidence of the tariffs has fallen on domestic consumers and importers so far, and our estimates imply a reduction in aggregate US real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We see similar patterns for foreign countries that have retaliated with their own tariffs against the United States, which suggests that the trade war has also reduced the real income of these other countries.\\"","title":"The Trump inflation shock could be worse than the last inflation crisis, Larry Summers warns"},{"text":"Itll be the dudes like Rubio and Waltz who are gone first.

The fundamental problem was that the Congress wasn't willing to fund crewed spaceflight enough to actually achieve the lofty goals, but was wedded for a long time to the Space Shuttle. The Shuttle was very expensive to operate, when its original design goal was exactly the opposite, to provide affordable access to space. It never did, but it worked as a jobs project for certain states, so those contractors had to be included. They are still making the SLS.Arguably the Shuttle should have been completely redesigned in the 1980s already,  when its serious flaws became evident. There was no sufficient funding for that, either. NASA cancelled a single-stage-to-orbit project in the early 2000s, just when it was ready test a miniature version of the craft. And yes, the SSO design was overly ambitious and had multiple wishful design choices that didn't pan out well in hindsight.What the Obama administration did to circumvent the problem was to start the Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply programs that eventually led to SpaceX, Boeing and Sierra Space getting the contracts. SpaceX developed the Dragon and the Crew Dragon, Boeing fucked everything up, and Sierra was excluded at one point, but is now going forward with their space plane.The broader problem is that NASA's human spaceflight program has been more and less mismanaged since Apollo, mostly because of congressional meddling. Apollo was a massive crash program that had enormous funding that was only possible by involving as many states and political districts as possible. This is why NASA's centers are spread all over the map to this day. The whole thing had a clear purpose, to win the race to to Moon, and the funding to do it. Both the purpose and the funding have been half-assed ever since, and the problem was compounded by the expense of the Shuttle, which led to a lot of good money getting thrown after the bad. So yes, the Obama administration proposed a head-scratching plan for human spaceflight that didn't go anywhere, but so did three previous administrations. The Obama administration also got the thing that is actually working now started.","title":"Heres What Trumps Win Means for NASA"},{"text":"It often goes like in Germany.

The remaining question is how big the R majority will be. 219C222 are still realistically on the table, with the smart money being on the middle of that range (220 or 221). If I had to guess on the median outcome at the moment, and I could only pick one number, I would say Rs end up with 221 seats.This is a good chart: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/results-house-races-tracker.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Zk4.G3UB.LZK3GaK4vmMg&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare.But remember that most of the outstanding California seats are slowly trending D, as the remaining ballots are counted.

You can reasonably expect all 3 of these to go to the Rs.On the other side, considering races where Ds lead, Kaptur is going to a recount, I believe. But again, its unlikely to change the results. Golden still needs the RCV tabulation. This one is actually the most likely to flip of all the ones that have a current D lead. That being said, its probably still lean-Golden.

In 1988, after a particularly hot summer, oil corporations began to plan their public relations strategy for climate change. In an internal memo in August of that year, an Exxon spokesperson advised leadership to emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions and work with key government agencies, including the United Nations, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency.In the following decades, fossil fuel companies would run advertising campaigns, write policy, and influence scientific reports to hide the link between fossil fuels and extreme weather. That climate denial is still happening today, as oil giants spend billions delaying any action that will phase out fossil fuels while greenwashing their polluting projects. As recently as 2015, internal emails obtained by The Wall Street Journal revealed that Exxon executives were still asking scientists to cast doubt on climate science and its connection to natural disasters. Last year, fossil fuel companies sent a record 2,456 lobbyists to the United Nations annual climate summit to influence negotiations. And most recently, the U.S. Senate Budget Committee found that the fossil fuel industry is still misleading the public about its efforts to mitigate the climate crisis, while privately admitting it cant meet its net zero emissions goals.These tactics successfully blocked policy over the past 50 years that could have helped prevent climate catastrophes like Milton. Half of U.S. states, including Florida, recently passed laws prohibiting methane gas restrictions, even though its a highly-polluting fossil fuel. Fossil fuel lobbyists have also prevented a global resolution ending fossil fuel use, which experts say is necessary to preserve a livable climate.","title":"Trumps Climate Plans Are Such a Disaster Even Exxon Is Worried"},{"text":"53% can't read past a 6th grade level but okay.(That means they can barely comprehend The Hobbit)","title":"Top Pick To Be Trump's National Intelligence Director Is Former Democrat: Report"},{"text":"Meantime, the real world implications are so serious:- Putin continues to play with his puppet and gets what he wantsOr \\n- Putin actually has an end-game which he executes, and it does not include being friends with Trump.

Aren't you generalising?What you are trying to do is clever manipulation, unfortunately I will not fall for it. we are not dealing with individual cases here we are talking about the general process. trying to reduce this to an individual level combined with accusations of racism is nothing more than trying to avoid uncomfortable questions. unfortunately for you from my statements so far my racial prejudice is not evident, nor is my negative suggestion about your colleague. nice try using racial accusations to your benefits.In reality we probably both know that it is impossible to consider phenomena on a scale of the entire society without certain generalizations. we are not considering here individual examples of individual people, but the whole phenomenon on a broad scale.but if we use the individual example of your colleague, this only shows how different the nature of the phenomena of emigration to the USA and to Europe is. while people from all over the world come to the USA with different levels of education and different cultures, this multiculturalism and all variations make it easier to blend into society. At the same time in the case of the EU, we only deal with people from sub-Saharan Africa, often without education, knowledge of the language, firmly embedded in their cultural framework very different from European culture.  unfortunately, such are the directions of migration that we have nowadays. it is naive to claim that both cases are the same, treating migration as one identical phenomenon, you yourself are making a great generalization.there are certainly exceptions when it comes to Europe, like a certain percentage of Asians among immigrants, but they choose other migration routes and often a legal way. When it comes to illegal ones, very fact that people who cross the border illegally go straight to Germany is a significant argument. nobody looks for a place in Greece or Spain which are the first country on the EU border, because there the social support is much lower. it is still worth noting that by using accusatory accusations of racism, you are trying to avoid answering how actively you help immigrants in your location, and what support will there be for those who are not successful in the future, are they supposed to join the homeless masses, can they count on any support in a situation where the US does not even support its own citizens?","title":"CMV: Left-wing parties should challenge right-wing parties on mass deportation (because right-wing parties can't actually do it)"},{"text":"This man won't step foot in the White House.

By cooking the books for a singular client they are just undermining their own business unless their entire business relies on fabricating results for this singular client. But just about every poll had the same trend line running through it. And our elections are so decentralized that you'd not only have to hack each state individually, but you'd have to hack each county locally. The size of the hacking operation would have be so huge. And there simply isn't any evidence of that and there's about zero chance that anyone would be able to keep that large of an operation secret. The situation wasn't complicated in my opinion. The dem party is not a cohesive group. It's a bunch of small factions with varying levels of liberalism. You lose a handful of those smaller factions and you lose the election. And that's what happened. A few small factions decided to hold America hostage unless they got their idea of policy perfection. Compromise was not in their vocabulary. They told us that to our faces. So they thought they'd teach the dem party a lesson by shooting the hostages and letting the situation get worse just like they promised. Harris got more votes than Clinton but less than Biden. The dems where back sliding when all they needed to do was maintain bidens level of voters, meanwhile Trump simply found more people to vote for him. He increased his vote share with every single demographic except for white college educated women. The house and senate dem candidates did better than Harris because Trump found a bunch of dingdongs that only voted for Trump and left the rest of the ballot blank.

This bill has nothing to do with due process. It doesn't change the process of removing non-profit status at all. The process today is as follows: the IRS finds evidence that a non-profit is violating the law. The IRS notifies the non-profit that it plans to strip non-profit status if the law-breaking activity doesn't cease. The non-profit can file an internal appeal within the IRS, and there's an extensive review process. If that review does not change the original findings of the IRS, the non-profit can sue the IRS in federal court to maintain its non-profit status.The bill in question does not change that process. It gives the IRS access to state department and classified information, information which *would be shared in court* if the non-profit sues the IRS.Again, I need to emphasize that an organization does not need to be charged with a crime in order to be stripped of non-profit status. This has *always* been an administrative process. No prosecutors involved. If an organization doesn't like the outcome of the administrative process, they sue in federal court.","title":"Full List of Democrats Who Voted for Bill That Gives Trump Admin More Power"},{"text":"Not going to his BBQ.","title":"Trump Defense Secretary pick Pete Hegseth proudly boasted of never washing his hands: Germs are not real | \\nGerms are not a real thing."},{"text":"Ah yes, but muh eggs tho.

A few thoughts:\\n1. If you have social media, a simple post showing support can go a long way, especially if your social media isn't a progressive bubble.2. Write your representatives (local, state, federal) to expressive your support and urge them to push back on anti-trans policies.3. If you're not trans, read trans voices, learn about trans issues, learn the arguements supporting trans rights. ACLU, transequality.org, Erin Reed (https://www.erininthemorning.com/), them.us are places to start.4. Gently engage in person and online with people expressing skepticism over trans rights, particularly those who are otherwise democratic, progessive, or otherwise not too far down the rabbithole. ? Key word is gently. Don't call them transphobic or insult them. Most of their undersanding probably comes from right wing propoganda.

They're not exactly top of the genius food chain, here. They couldn't even replicate the _idea_ of competency in literally the highest form of government - in an environment they had nearly total control over, and you expect them to go all-in on executing a man that they never even took seriously, to their hilarious detriment? _Twice?_They didn't try hard to assassinate him becuase they put more effort into covering their own asses than they did into it being successful. If it failed, they'd try something else (which they did, through lawfare and a second assassination attempt,) and if all of that failed (which it did,) they'd just work the votes like they did in 2020 - which they attempted, but failed at due to some pretty strong observational oversight planning on the part of the States and the Trump campaign.You're seriously not paying atttention if you believe these people are competent at anything other than covering their own asses. Incompetency comes naturally to them. This is just another example, and thank God for that.Money does not immediately equal an ability to accomplish a goal. It just makes that slightly easier, assuming the people putting it into effect are at all competent. Which they aren't, thankfully, though I personally believe there were reasons beyond their incompetence that kept Trump safe.The fact that you don't think them attempting it in this way was possible says way more about you than it does about people who believe it.

But keep in mind that the Treasury already has the ability to dock non-profit status from these organizations if they suspect illegal activity. That's not new. What this bill does is enable the sharing of information (particularly classified information) between departments. That *will* result in more non-profits being flagged, I have no doubt. But why are they being flagged? Let's be real, a lot of these aid organizations need to bribe foreign terrorists in order to operate in conflict zones. They need to bribe Hamas to operate in Gaza, as an example. The CIA knows that these bribes take place, but they can't share information with the IRS. This bill would change that.So if we want to get down to brass tax, the real moral quandary is this: is it okay for American non-profits to bribe terrorists in order to disperse aid in conflict zones? I don't think that's an easy question to answer. Non-profits are against this bill because they feel the bribes are worth it, obviously. That's a valid opinion, IMO.this bill removes necessary red tape and safeguards and throws them into court with less means to defend themselves than through current procedure.No, it doesn't do that.

I remember parents threatening to put bible verses on my school's doors when word got out that there was a trans kid. I remember having to provide testimony for the Grimm court case because I wasn't allowed to use the same bathrooms as my peers, and I was having to go entire school days with no bathroom breaks. I remember having teachers openly laugh in my face when I asked them to use my preferred name - and they did this in front of my classmates. When I came out at school, the first thing they did was call my parents and out me. I suffered horribly at home and at school until I graduated and left at 18. My senior year, we had a school shooting threat from a kid who frequently made instagram posts publicly mocking me and a couple of our LGBT classmates. While we sat in lockdown, someone directly joked that I was probably \\"a prime target\\" for the kid who made the threat. Do you know what going through that kind of thing fucking does to you? To your ability to trust others? Do you think someone would go through this frivolously? Does that seem like something ANYONE would put themselves through, if repressing transness worked? I implore anyone reading this to imagine how fucking exhausting it is to be trans and trying to mind your business right now. Like, fuck, we're literally just people. I wake up, go to my job, come home, make dinner, and spend time with my loved ones. Republicans act like we're some kind of hypothetical animal that spends 24/7 foaming at the mouth inflicting anarchy on the streets. Jesus Christ. It feels like a never ending uphill battle when people will still happily bring up insanely spun bullshit, like the school litter box story. I frankly don't know how to cope with the fact that so many people see cutting support for us as an acceptable loss - both liberals and conservatives. I'm tired of people throwing us under the bus because they dont think there are enough of us to matter (but also, inversely, that there are simultaneously too many of us?).  I mistakenly assumed the social attitude towards this would get better as I got older. My own parents stopped financially supporting me at 18 because I was trans. I lived in dogshit poverty for years while I tried to get back on my feet. I went to college to teach, worked my ass off to achieve my dream, and then ended up having to leave the career for my mental wellbeing after a kid physically threatened me and multiple parents complained about me after I was outed (against my will! I didn't even want to be out!). I am so, so, SO tired of feeling like everything I do just results in having the floor pulled out from under me if I happen to unluckily encounter someone with power over me who hates trans people. I hate having to accept shittier living conditions and shittier jobs just to avoid being in spaces that are openly hostile to my existence. And half of the public's knowledge on trans people comes from wildly exaggerated scenarios milked by rightwing media to get views and spark outrage. It feels like talking to a brick wall when I try to correct a non-trans person on some wild misunderstanding involving transition. I am so motherfucking tired. I feel horrible for trans kids right now. I've been through absolute Hell over this, and it still somehow seems to be getting worse. I don't know how I would've survived this same social climate if I were still a teenager. It's bleak. I'm sorry this is long... just... please see us as people. That's all I ask. I don't give a shit how woke or informed you are, just please ask yourself \\"is it objectively cruel to say this about another human being\\" when you speak of us. Anything.

Our collective failure to avoid that result now gives Trump an opportunity to exact revenge on them. President Joe Biden, in the remaining two months of his term in office, can and must prevent this by using one of the most powerful tools available to the president: the pardon power.The risk of retribution is very real. One hallmark of Trumps recently completed campaign was his regular calls for vengeance against his enemies  Biden has the unfettered power to issue pardons, and he should use it liberally. He should offer pardons, in addition to \\\\[Liz\\\\] Cheney and \\\\[General Mark\\\\] Milley, to all of Trumps most prominent opponents. A presidents authority to pardon is pretty much without limitation as to reason, subject, scope, or timing. Historically, for example, Gerald Ford gave Richard Nixon a full, free, and absolute pardon for any offense that he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974. If Biden were willing, he could issue a set of pardons similar in scope and form to Trumps critics, and they would be enforced by the courts as a protection against retaliation.There are, naturally, reasons to be skeptical of this approach. First, one might argue that pardons are unnecessary. After all, the argument would go, none of the people whom Trump might target have actually done anything wrong. They are innocent of anything except opposing Trump, and the judicial system will protect them.This argument is almost certainly correct; the likelihood of a jury convicting Liz Cheney of a criminal offense is laughably close to zero. But a verdict of innocence does not negate the harm that can be done. In a narrow, personal sense, Cheney would be exonerated. But along the way she would no doubt sufferthe reputational harm of indictment, the financial harm of having to defend herself, and the psychic harm of having to bear the pressure of an investigation and charges  Biden owes it to Trumps most prominent critics to save them from that burden.... A second reason for skepticism involves whether a federal pardon is enough protection. Even a pardon cannot prevent state-based investigations. Nothing is going to stop Trump from pressuring his state-level supporters, such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, to use their offices for his revenge. And they, quite surely, will be accommodating.But finding state charges will be much more difficult, if only because most of the putative defendants may never have visited a particular state. More important, even if there is some doubt about the efficaciousness of federal pardons, that is no reason to eschew the step. Make Trumps abuse of power more difficult in every way you can.... The third and final objection is, to my mind at least, the most substantial and meritoriousthat a president pardoning his political allies is illegitimate and a transgression of American political norms.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/UFtOdzkf](https://theatln.tc/UFtOdzkf)","title":"Pardon Trumps Critics Now"},{"text":"\\\\TDB specifically used the words \\"squad\\" and \\"Firing\\" in their headline to lead the reader to a conclusion, and make an exaggerated implication.You have evidence of that?","title":"Trump Plans Squad to Fire the Generals He Hates"},{"text":"He is not joking but he can say he was just joking and cover his diaper for his supporters while doing it anyway.","title":"Trump Makes Chilling Joke About Staying in Power Forever - Donald Trump isnt so sure about the two-term limit."},{"text":"let's see if they allow Trump to be inaugurated first.","title":"If the deep state is indeed legitimate certain questions must be asked about why exactly they decided to allow Trump another four years as president?"},{"text":"Biden is a class act.","title":"Trump and Biden meet at White House"},{"text":"Trump was able to destroy his own non-profit without any special bills.

As were going through this wildlife sanctuary, we realize that theres like no animals there. I have pictures and videos from that day, and you can hear my boyfriend continuously apologize because I dont know why theres no animals buddy, Im sorry we ended up going in to feed the salmon, because there was nothing else to do, so, as were walking down the road, we realize that theres a double gate, like the ones in sallyport in prisons. And I remember making a joke like this is creepy as fuck why is this here? So as we walk towards the salmon, spawning thingy, I realize that it looks exactly like where you at hoard, cattle, or people. I have pictures of it, its super long, and at the end of it guess what? Theres a fucking road. Thats not behind the gate or anything, so there was no reason for that sallyport, unless it was going to be secured in the future for some reason. Im sick to my stomach.

While the subject matter of his commentary was one of the most horrific periods in world history, its instruction applies equally to present day events.I did not speak out when I heard earlier this summer a continuous chorus of sentiments about being a DEl Hire when our present democrat candidate for president was named. I knew that a demeaning statement like this was not being applied to me. I then listened to a cable news commentator make a statement that if VP Situation oct, the whira was Sickened i way deplorarin the expression, it did not apply to me. Then, yesterday, I read a post from the Republican candidate for president who made reference to two historic female political figures and made reference to a particular sex act and how it impacted their trajectory. My blood boiled but again it did not apply to me.But it is time for me to state my piece or be complicit in the depravity.It matters not whether you align with the left or the right. It matters not whether you are a faith-driven person or an atheis matters not whether you are old (me) or young (many of you). ! it does matter if your chromosomes are made up of XY. It matters even more if your skin color is characterized as white Caucasian.More than others, we...the white males...must rise to meet the sentiments of Martin Niem?ller. We must speak out. We must those within our circles of influence that this shit must stop. NOW! We cannot allow our female colleagues to feel as i they stand alone when there are those who may intimate that ti ascension was anything other than based upon exceptionalism. We cannot allow our colleagues who identify a being a person of color to stand alone when there are those n claim that their ascension was an equity hire rather than base solely upon exceptionalism. We no longer can stay silent mere because others are exercising their right to free speech we, have that same right and must exercise it.I have been quoted in the past as saying that just because you have the right to say something does not make it right to say it. This IS NOT RIGHT. And we must make that declaration in the clearest and most unambiguous terms.I strive to live by the Zulu philosophy of Ubuntu (seeing he humanity in others). If we allow these horrific comments that are now seemingly part of normal discourse, we fail at seeing the humanity of others. When we fail to see that, we cannot possibly stand by others. When we cannot or do not stand with others, the words of Martin Niem?ller are no longer a historic reference to the atrocities of WWil, those words describe the present.*meme of a woman saying so jump down off that soapbox shall we?*Yes, I shall.Aug. 30:Earlier this week I allowed my passion to cloud my judgment and sent an e mail using this as my forum. After reflection, I have come to realize that this was not proper use of this forum. I sincerely apologize to anyone put off by or negatively impacted by my lapse of judgment.","title":"Judge overseeing 'fake elector' case recuses himself after defense accuses him of anti-Trump bias"},{"text":"Why are you ok with Elon using money to swing elections, but not Soros for doing the same thing?","title":"Soros lost nearly $1 billion after Trump election.

That can be a lengthy process. Intelligence agencies took weeks to review Mr. Hurs report.But in the case of Mr. Smiths final report, most of that vetting has already been done, so officials expect that step to take little time.The big question now, assuming Mr. Smith finishes the report on his current schedule, is whether Mr. Garland will release the findings before he leaves office, or defer the release to the Trump team, which might not make its contents public.A spokeswoman for Mr. Garland declined to comment.Obviously if the report isn't released before Trump takes office, it will never see the light of day.
