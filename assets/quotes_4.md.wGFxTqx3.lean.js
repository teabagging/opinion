YES!Just a side rant about the comment section thing you just pointed out. Have you noticed how many bots in the Instagram comment section bring up Zelenskyy and the Ukraine aid money? (Not trying to debate that subject, just pointing it out) They try to relate it to every meme, news article, anything. Its always being brought up even when its unrelated. And these comments always get thousands of likes. Its almost like subliminal brainwashing. After a few years of seeing an Ukraine aid comment once or twice a day, some people might start to think that way without directly realizing it. I have this false belief that I am communicating with the world on here. When I view a comment section, the top comment is the most commonly shared view amongst everyone that interacted with said post.When you bring bots into the equation - you now have the power to give people an entirely false sense of reality. You can program someone to believe something by putting it in front of them enough times throughout their life. On top of that, they appear to be overwhelmingly popular opinions thru the guise of fake (botted) likes.Incredibly concerning.

After that it's Congress impeaching Trump if he replaces them anyway and dares Congress to do its best.Both of those actions by Congress are essentially not going to happen for the next 2 years no matter what Trump does.

We hope and wish that under the present leadership, the German people will successfully conclude their fourteen-year-long, persistent, and sacrificial struggle for freedom and the resurgence of the German nation.We do not deny that times of crisis require special measures, and we have therefore repeatedly supported enabling laws and emergency decrees. We understand that the current Reich government is seeking extensive powers to be able to work without disruptions. Nevertheless, we feel obligated to express our concerns, assuming that even the current government will not reject objective and loyal criticism of its measures.We find that the proposed law lacks explicit guarantees for the constitutional rights of the people and the fundamental principles of civil law. Above all, the independence of the judiciary, the rights of the civil service, the right to freely exercise a profession, equal civil rights, and the freedom of art and science, as well as their teaching, must remain inviolable. These values, ladies and gentlemen, are fundamental elements of any community life in an orderly constitutional state. They were safeguarded by the Weimar Constitution, drawing from both old German and old Prussian state traditions, and they must not be endangered today as they were fourteen years ago.In the interest of the people and the fatherland, and in the expectation of lawful development, we will set aside our serious concerns and approve the Enabling Act.","title":"NL Elects the 1930 Weimar Republic Elections"},{"text":"Fuck trump.

But I honestly don't see Democrats aggressively doing this any time soon. We can urge the Dem congressperson who seems like going to the other side to stay with their conscience. Trump is bidding on nobody challenging his inhumane policies that targets a small group of people. It looks like devastatingly effective. I am an immigrant and we know that if an immigrant community is in a quote niched category, which means if they can single us out without pissing off a large group of people, then they pretty much can do whatever they want to do. Like with the Muslim ban. He usually won't target a country that is large enough that their immigrants can turn against him effectively. For example the Indian immigrants - he is giving them hard time but he doesn't dare to declare a traval ban to a community of this much impact.\\nOne way that I think might help is to sow on the social media. Same sex marriage saw a decade-long period of cultural change. It waited until the poltiical change is ripe. So trans rights might be able to do the same thing and start with the culture. I hope they won't ban all content related to trans people, but even China is not doing this much.?\\nI apologize if my comment is immature.

You are already a US citizen and you will not lose it even if you move abroad. At least keep it that way for a few years until things become clearer.

They talked to the RMV who stated their ID would simply be invalidated and become void on February 21st, along with their amended birth certificate (Bottom surgery) They will need to request a new one, with their old name, and then a second copy with their new name (apparently because they changed their name and gender marker at the same time so have no copy of the birth certificate with their new name but with the \\"correct\\" gender marker). and bring both of them to the RMV to have the gender marker change reverted and THEN they can request a second appointment to actually renew the license. Right now their waiting list is almost 6 months. So as of the 21st of next month they will simply have no license and be unable to drive for an indeterminate amount of time.I Do have new information, for clarity having talked with them more. Their license expires in February already. They aren't revoking the license they just won't renew it and are requiring it to be treated as a \\"new license\\" because it has to change. Oklahoma says you can only change your gender marker on your ID if it matches an amended birth certificate which is the real issue  \\nThe RMV says their current amended birth certificate will not be valid after the 21st of February.   \\nThey don't live in the state their birth certificate is from. They were born in Texas  \\nIt's not a new \\"state\\" policy but OK RMV has full discretion on whether they accept information and they say they won't accept the current amended birth certificate because it won't be \\"federally accurate\\" thus doesn't work for the (2 forms of government ID and 1 proof of address) requirement.   \\nTexas will only give them their unmodified original birth certificate with their original name and won't just amend the F back to M for some reason. so they need to request an original copy, then use it to request A copy with their out of state name change documentation. They probably could have gotten away with it by keeping their mouth shut and not asking the question. But Tulsa USED to be relatively liberal so I guess they thought they would get a better answer if they just asked the question rather than just stay quiet.

What can you do about it?The problem with then giving benefit of the doubt even if there are no evidence to legally accuse someone is that you are only looking at it from the *allegedly* victim side. If you grant the benefit of the doubt there is basically no win situation for the accused; If you are found guilty you are guilty, if you are not found guilty is not because you didn't do it, but because I couldn't prove it, but you should still give me the benefit of the doubt and believe me.You are basically implying that the accused walk out free of charge while in fact he is a criminal, which of course would be bad if she is telling the truth.But what if she is lying? Then a innocent man will find himself in a lose lose situation: if they somehow convict him he is done for something that he didn't do, if he walk about but people still believe what the woman said, he still have the stain of abuser on him.And let's say the truth that no one is willing to say: *there is no repercussion for woman lying about this stuff.*Proving that an allegation is false is even harder than proving one is true: to prove one being false you basically can only do it with a clear statment from the accuser that she was lying. Let's say an accuser say an over the top and unbeliable story, like he chased me for 10 km on x street at hour y, but the camera footage on the street show nothing happened at all at that time. *that is still not a fake accusation*.Basically if a women is willing to be malicent and never admit anything about it, there will be literally no repercussion for her.

If there actually had been witches around that wouldve justified their suspicion then it probably would be discussed with a bit more nuance. Therefore since we know that rapists exist today and are actually pretty common, its not too accurate to compare them to witches.(I kind of expected someone to reply with this so its honestly my mistake that I wasnt more specific.)Sure but you still need evidence to tie that person to the crime. Lets also stop assuming the perpatrator is automatically male.Im mostly using gendered language because this thread is about sexual assault as a gendered problem. There are of course female rapists and male victims. If it makes you more comfortable then I dont mind using gender neutral language because that doesnt really affect my specific point.Anyway, unless were in a court house I dont believe anyone needs evidence, necessarily. If my friend tells me that they were raped then I wont be demanding evidence.

That is, why must someone who has a deep belief in democracy just accept that the majority decision is the best decision? That's an extremely narrow definition of democracy that isn't followed anywhere in the world, and aligns with the idea of tyranny of the majority. If the majority of the population were to band together and for instance decide that a certain segment of the population should be executed, vote for that political policy, and then put it into play, is it anti-democratic to oppose that action? I would say, again, it would only be anti-democratic under a narrow view of democracy that is actually harmful to society. Democracy, in most definitions, is more than just majority rule; it also encompasses respect for the rights of individuals and minority groups. When the majority enacts policies that violate these basic rights, it crosses into tyranny or mob rule, undermining the foundational principles of democracy. Opposing such an act is not a rejection of democracy but a defense of its deeper ideals and ethical framework. Should they oppose that mob-rule by force? Well, that would depend on the circumstances of the mob-rule. In an extreme situation, like I describe, I would suggest that the democratic course of action, as well as the moral course, would be to fight back hard against that extremism, any possible way. For instance, in WW2, the French democratically elected government signed a 1940 treaty with the Nazis. By a large majority (569 votes to 80, with 20 abstentions), it granted Marshal Ptain full powers to draft a new constitution. Thus, in some respects, this type of government can be seen as democratic. Would it make it undemocratic to have been in the resistance?Now, in the case of executing this specific CEO and the support seen for that execution, I can't say that's a very democratic action, since the USA is extremely democratic in general terms, with one of the most free and most fair election processes in the world. But would it be anti-democratic for a Jew in 1942 to have murdered a CEO of IG Farben, for instance? I wouldn't think that label would apply.","title":"CMV: People dont care about democracy as much as they like to say"},{"text":"We had our Beer Hall Pusch.

The immigration surge of the past few years has been the largest in U.S. history, surpassing the great immigration boom of the late 1800s and early 1900s, according to a New York Times analysis of government data. Thats a faster pace of arrivals than during any other period on record, including the peak years of Ellis Island traffic, when millions of Europeans came to the United States. Even after taking into account todays larger U.S. population, the recent surge is the most rapid since at least 1850: About 60 percent of immigrants who have entered the country since 2021 have done so without legal authorization,  The combined increases of legal and illegal immigration have caused the share of the U.S. population born in another country to reach a new high, 15.2 percent in 2023, up from 13.6 percent in 2020. The previous high was 14.8 percent, in 1890. Several factors caused the surge, starting with President Bidens welcoming immigration policy during his first three years in office.  After taking office, his administration loosened the rules on asylum and other immigration policies, making it easier for people to enter the United States.You and I might be able OK to live with this, but this 'laissez-faire' approach created a back lash which is now predictable in hind-sight and ignoring it will only make the pain  longer and worse.","title":"Why Ruben Gallegos Laken Riley vote is a warning for Democrats"},{"text":"Yeah, mostly just facts.

They were the good punks, who stood up to the Nazis and would counter their attempted brownshirt activities. Really, if you knew them, you could call them out to help disperse skinheads causing trouble. Everybody hated skinheads because they went around beating up LGBTQ and POC (Nazi Punks, Fuck Off). They got their asses kicked on a regular basis. They were pariahs, as it should be. I can't believe any of these kids think this is punk or cool. I wish they'd watch American History X. They'd probably think Edward Norton was the good guy, but they're being suckered in the same way as Edward Furlong. Are we in hell?Anyway I'm not calling for people to be SHARPs.

Not because I think protecting trans folks or overthrowing capitalism is somehow secretly a winning issue per se, but because of the nature of our coalition.Simply put, we are a coalition of different issue groups whose primary bond is the idea that moving forward on the issues of one of the groups will ultimately be beneficial for advancing the other groups. Each group only has the power it has because it has worked, however remotely, in concert with the others. As soon as you start pruning issue groups, you are literally pruning your manpower for the remaining groups.We differ on initial perspectives. I acknowledge the dem party is built on a coalition like you however I think it is time to overhaul that specific aspect of the party. No coalitions, no factions. There is a party agenda and the machine supports those running the agenda. This explains why we lost the Muslims, Hispanic and Black voters and why they resonated with the Trump platform. They didnt say youre Latinx so this what well do for you I believe this was a rejection of that factionalized mentality. But all that was just one thing you were wrong about. The other thing youre wrong about is more implicit: that you only need a political party with the right attitude. Our strategy must be bigger than that. We are going to need to conduct no less than medium-scale economic warfare. We need to organize general strikes and tax strikes. (Yes, I am saying that we need to get a critical mass of people to risk the wrath of the IRS. I know how nuts that sounds, but were up against literal Nazis, so settle down please.) It may be necessary to organize covert societies, just like the days of liberal organizing under the heel of Metternich in 1848 or the Romanovs in the late 1800s. If Trump really invades Canada or Panama or another ally, we may need to be willing to attempt to physically stop military vehicles, knowing the risk to ourselves (but with the organization to have our comrades nearby, capturing the video in order to spread it widely).I just dont see how convincing and mobilizing voters en masse to carry out general strikes and tax strikes is feasible compared to actual policy at the local level that wins hearts and minds.","title":"Dems need a strategy overhaul + sanity check?"},{"text":"Thats great and all, but we just need .7% swing in 3 swing states to take back the presidency.?Do what you must, including lying against your opponents.?","title":"Dems need a strategy overhaul + sanity check?"},{"text":"Sinema Part Two.

Even if it doesn't result in anything, it overall is more stable than it being bottled up within an individual. Expression allows the opinions to be reflected and refracted upon in which if it is unpopular it will be deterred or if popular promoted\\\\- Having the belief that someone is actually fighting for you prevents a person from taking direct action on their own. The managing principle here is that single direct action is chaotic, and thus offering a reasonably functional alternative helps steady disciplined change. \\\\- The amenities are really what make people not commit crimes if you think about it.

It cant ever be removed from racism because the very existence of those labels invents nonexistent commonalities and differences that only exist to further discrimination.)By insisting on categorizing people based on race you are implying that there are commonalities and differences defined by those categories, but the actual truth is that what defines certain groups isnt related to their given race, but based on things like culture, religion, ethnicity, etcIn a country like America, you can argue that race has been a kind of useful category. Black people in the US, due to the slave trade, have historically had a pretty uniform culture, so calling them black hasnt really been too disastrous, for example. But globally that word has no practical usage outside of racism, a Somali and a Nigerian are very different. You can argue that they share a similar shade of skin and that black just communicates that, but this would then imply that south Asian populations are black and that so are aboriginals. It would also mean that light skin black people arent actually black.I mean, would you call a Moroccan black for being a part of Africa? No, probably not. They dont look like subsaharan Africans which racial biologists agreed on, so they were categorized as caucasoid or Caucasian  white  but they dont have much in common with white Europeans either. So what purpose would their racial category possibly serve except for communicating stereotypes that arent actually based on what shapes that group?This is especially obvious with any people from the SWANA region. Arabs have been forced to mark themselves as white in the US for a long time even though theyre not really seen as white in the US at all. So what does their race tell us about them? It can inform us of their arbitrary standing in a racial hierarchy (if youre racist) or it can make us assume things about them based on the equally arbitrary category theyve been forced into.To solve this, should we define them as Asian instead? The same problems would arise. We could argue that race might work if we create enough small categories, but that would just reverse engineer things like ethnicity and culture, so what would be the point?Even if we ignore the people who dont neatly fit into those boxes, were still left with problems. Polish people are white, and so are Finns, but theyre certainly not treated as white in many parts of Europe. The Sami are a white indigenous population from northern Scandinavia, and while theyre phenotypically diverse, even the white southern Sami were deemed racially other because they were inferior.","title":"CMV: The Concept of Race is Inherently Harmful"},{"text":"Thats not one I have muted because I appreciate the reach across the isle but every comment from a trump supporter gets downvoted even the majority that are in good faith","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"This is the real reason for the following thing.","title":"Instagram hides search results for 'Democrats'"},{"text":"I remember $1 a dozen.

Significant ones.The rough \\"eh, it's a fish\\" categorization by visual inspection works and matching that, \\"it's a fish\\" means you can *predict* things about it like gills, or a lack of tentacles.The differences between human groups are tiny, typically decorative (skin color), and often just culture being mistaken for biology. East Asian people aren't genetically better at going to college, they're raised more often in cultures that stress achievement at the cost of other things. African people in 1400 or 1500 weren't more \\"savage\\" than Europeans--many Islamic cultures exceeded European traits--but farming and Christianity and meant you were advanced compared to an Islamic person in the largest library in existence Eurasia or a tribe that chose a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. **Because you were white.**Statistically, there's a larger variance within any group than between the groups on average. The Bambuti tribe in the Democratic Republic of Congo averages 4' 6' in height whereas the Dinka (Sudan) and Tutsi (Rwanada) people average 5' 11\\". That's vastly more than the difference on average between white and black people (in fact, there isn't a major one). The worldwide height average is 5' 7\\" and both of those groups are at least one standard deviation (2.5\\") from that but also \\"both African\\".Africa is the most linguistically diverse human continent (we've been there longest) and to the people who invented race it was \\"just \\\\[insert slur\\\\], who cares?\\"Let's take an octopus, a fish, and a dolphin, and compare it to what white scientists decided were white, African, and Asian races. Which is hilarious because those last two continents have way more *internal* variation in what people look like than in the comparatively tiny, genetically similar Europe. (Also worth noting that \\"white\\" isn't even a meaningful category because it's basically defined as \\"not the things we call black\\" and doesn't hold still. Which is why things like the one drop of black blood rule in the slave era US existed or why Polish or Irish people didn't count as white in the US in the early 20th because they weren't *privileged as white.*)1. Vastly different intelligence? (octopi and dolphins are *crazy smart* compared to fish)\\n2. Different propensity for tool use? (octopi use tools, fish don't)\\n3. Different capacity for learning? (dolphins seem to approach human intelligence, octopi routinely outsmart their zookeepers on mischief)\\n4. Different social systems? (marine mammals are highly social, octopi aren't, fish societies are not complex)\\n5. Which race of humans breathes air, but others breath water?\\n6. Does one race have a different number of limbs?\\n7. Does one race possess awesome LED color change camouflage on the skin and others don't?\\n8. Is one race venomous?Because people have absolutely taken skin color and tried to divide humans nearly as far as we can actually divide dolphins and trout.

Mar 18, 20226 min read\\nHow Government Propaganda Was Legalized: The Smith-Mundt Modernization ActOriginally Published July 26, 2017 4:50 pm by Investment Watch by Pamela WilliamsH.R. 4310 passed into law when it was signed by the President Obama on Jan 2, 2013.  There is an ongoing controversy surrounding the Bill. I want to start this report with a video: Congressman Dennis Kucinich opposes H.R. 4310 C National Defense Authorization Act for 2013.However, Kucinich does not oppose it for the reason that most people are against it.  Many people feel it legalized the use of propaganda on American audiences.  It is being said it allowed the material produced by the State Department and the Pentagon to strike the ban that had been in place on domestic dissemination of propaganda.In laymans terms the news media/government can broadcast propaganda to the American people as they please.  However, I will leave it to the reader to make the judgment him/her self.  However, it has been signed into place, and there is nothing that can be done about it at this time.  RELATED: Truth Proof ?? The CIA is Responsible for Fake News - Operation Mockingbird:  The greatest worry is that the the Bill essentially neutralized two previous actsthe Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1987that had been passed to protect U.S. audiences from their  own governments misinformation campaigns.I, myself, do not trust the government period, so this does not affect my beliefs to any great degree.  I take most of what they say as propaganda.Here is the simplified description of the amendment:Amendment No. 114Reps. Thornberry (R-TX) and Smith (D-WA):The amendment would amend the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (known as the Smith-Mundt Act) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 to clarify the authorities of the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to prepare, disseminate and use public diplomacy information abroad and to strike the current ban on domestic dissemination of such material. The amendment would clarify that the Smith-Mundt Acts provisions related to public diplomacy information do not apply to other federal departments or agencies (including the DoD).What most people refer to as propaganda material, the amendment refers to as public diplomacy information. The text of the amendment to Bill H.R. 4310 was a difficult to track down, but here it is  with the  change that concerns so many:AMENDMENT NO. 114 OFFERED BY MR. THORNBERRY OF TEXASAt the end of title X, add the following new section:SEC. 10__.

In response to that though, I think hes starting to drop his pointless defense of the indefensible Democrats.He should leave and join the DSA or PSL and uplift them, while directing people to vote third party. Trying to be left in the Dems is like trying to be left in the GOP at this point. Its a waste of money to spend thousands/millions to primary a right wing dem when you can just run third party in the general &amp; spare yourself the wasted expenses. That Sanders doesnt do that is part of the reason hes not liked by the left very much, &amp; why a lot of the zoomer progressives radicalized by him in 2016/2020 are now further left than him.The idea of a left-Dem coalition is a myth and Jamal Bowman being destroyed by AIPAC **with support from Establishment Democrats** is proof of that bc Bowman wasnt even left wing. There is no place for the left. Better off running third party and using that opportunity to draw the connection between GOP donors/lobbyists and Dem donors/lobbyists and how thats directly tied to nothing ever *significantly changing* when the party in power is switched.**There is no left wing future with the democrats.

I did not consider that some of my \\"opinions\\" implied that the accuser is lying, which means I did not give them the benefit of the doubt, which I gave to accused. That means I will more often conclued \\"I dont know\\". Although I also implicitly gave little benefit of the doubt to the accused in other cases, where I dismissed their \\"defense\\" and believed the accuser. It is just a messy thing, when it is not investigated by professionals, and I think I will refrain from discussing these things publicly, because I believe adding a not very informed opinion to an argument can do harm as well.Your cmt was what made think about about the 2nd part of the above paragraph.

I don't think I'm going to change your mind. And for what I'm not trying to. I think when I read your post and I read a lot of comments a lot of people aren't understanding there's a difference between legally and socially. There's plenty of examples out there you can find with small internet celebrities with bigger celebrities where legally we found out they did some stuff you know pill Cosby Donald Trump etc and through the law that either settled or went through due process. Then we have socially which is worse because during the #Me2 movement and post movement we saw the slogan that came with the movements \\"Believe Women,\\" I mean absolute worst that the movement did do. We had many young women who are not in the right mind or not an adult make accusations against young men on an unprecedented scale. I'm not saying all of the me too movement was an issue but it readily became a social issue specifically for men because once again we had a problem that divided the genders. One that quickly became vilifying men. While there was obviously people that the movement was intended to out who have been doing things to actresses for many. We also saw how it affected people who wanted to be in the spotlight lie plain and simple.If you don't believe me I implore you you can look all over YouTube there are plenty of cases of lying accusers accusing random people maybe they barely knew so they could get attention. Again wasn't about the proposed purpose of Me2. Post movement we even saw the decline in dating we saw the decline in single women being able to find dates we saw the decline in marriage we saw a decline in a lot of areas where you would expect men and women to be doing things together. We saw a decline in hiring women in many different fields mostly White collar jobs. So when we bring up a topic about believing accusers and believing the accused we're not looking at this from a legal point we're looking at this from a social point from a court of public opinion point.I can give you a one gigantic case some people will hate this some people not but judge kavanaugh &amp; Christine ballsy Ford was one of the most absurd hearings I have ever had the displeasure of watching live. By the end of this everyone supporting Christine Ford had either backtracked lied during oath or their story was so unbelievable out there that all the other evidence compiled to go against Ford from kavanaugh's side made her accusations insane. And I'm not even a judge kavanaugh supporter of any kind. And none of this hearing had anything to do with legal convictions of any kind. It was some lady that was just given the right to speak in front of the American people live and throw people under the bus a bus that didn't exist.

You as an individual are not a court. Your analogy suggests that you are. The poster asked if you or your family would still be friendly with someone who may have murdered someone.That is a subjective vs. objective perspective problem. Subjectively speaking, I would not want my daughter going out with a person having a 3% chance of being a serial killer, but objectively I would not condemn them to being a serial killer. And I don't think we want to live in a society, where this is subjectively decided.?In your example however, the answer might still be yes. People have and will continue to be convicted of murder based on circumstantial evidence.That is a half-truth. Yes people will be convicted based on circumstantial evidence. But not if it is a 50-50.But you are not a court. You are not taking away someones liberty. You are making an assessment based on interpersonal dynamics and limited evidence. Which is why you can, and should, weigh external factors when making a determination of who to believe and why. For example, general statistics about false accustation rates should be a factor.?I never said I am a court. I specifically argue \\"the line\\" of someone reasonbly being fired vs. actually being crimnically convicted is different.When people say believe women they mean a lot of things - but what they generally mean is that sexual assault and harassment are not uncommon. The estimate is that between 1/4 and 1/3 women will be sexually assaulted in their life time. It is likely that people you know have been assaulted or will be assaulted. Given how often this happens when you hear of a friend or an acquaintance who has been sexually assaulted - the chance that it happened is high. That should factor into how you assess any given accusation of sexual assault.You are severly misrepresenting my view.I specifically said:I want to make it very clear, that I am not saying that I do not believe any accusation, I am saying that I do not believe some accusations with varying degrees of uncertainty based on the evidence/plausibility. So that a reasonable conclusion is \\"This were 2 messy break-ups where all parties did fucked up stuff, and neither should lose their job about it\\".I am using \\"some\\", maybe I should have used few. I have no statistical data about my \\"decisions\\", but I believe the majority of accusers, and am only doubtful in very contested/messy cases or in cases where there is a significant gain for the accuser. In the cases where I am doubtful, it is usually not an outright dismissal, it is more like, I'd need more to think the person being guilty, and in even fewer I thought he for is not guilty at all, and she is just making it up/misrepresenting it severly (which has to be a valid concluasion in some cases, because it is also the reality in some).And please don't look at this and think I am playing being court. I am not, these are decision or view points I reach for myself. Which just mean that I might find a certain consquence of the accused might be too harsh, too light, or unfair.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Call it whatever you want.

But the things you're making an analogy of must be meaningfully similar. As I said at the beginning, doctor amputating a leg vs jealous boyfriend hacking his girlfriend's leg off.

It's not close enoughAnalogies have use, it's a nice way to simplify things, but if at the end of the day your analogy isn't close enough to actually match then the analogy will do your point more harm than it can ever do good. Which is why the extreme ones get shelved. Holocaust, slavery, rape, genocide. Because it immediately ups the stakes in a way most of the time the person making the analogy will utterly fail to justify and end up making them look a fool. While you say we went nowhere on the slavery/overtime argument, Id say the opposite. Id say that someone who reads your first comment comes out with a much better understanding of the problem of forced overtime than someone who doesnt. And the analogy, even when you disagree with it, was what made this happen.That's where I disagree. You could have just asked my views on mandatory overtime and I would still be able to give them to you absent slavery. That's my point. Absent slavery I could have made the exact same argument.

What power would AOC have in a progressive party who won two or three seats? And would she even get a seat after the progressive party leadership decided who would get a seat after people voted for the party. Absolutely nothing is preventing more parties in our political system other than people not voting intelligently and for their own interests. We have third party representatives right now at all levels of government. People don't even know who their Mayor is or their policies. And a Mayor has vastly more control over their everyday lives than the President of the US. They just hit D or R and pat themselves on the back for voting. You seem like you might be progressive.

However, leaving the above aside, democracy does not mean that the government should only make decisions based solely on public opinion. Sometimes unpopular solutions among citizens are advisable. I will not insist that this is also the case with TikTok, but there are situations when it would be necessary to introduce a law that the public opposes.

With that out of the way, Id say youre correct in stating that analogies elicit strong emotional responses, and I understand that that could be both very detrimental to a discussion and a tool for rage bait (even though that was never my intention). Ill give you a delta for that. But I still think that analogies can have a purpose apart from that. To further my point, I do think Singers syllogism could stand without an analogy to illustrate it (the main analogy he uses is of a child drowning in a pond in front of you), but his point would certainly be less clear if he didnt use this illustration as a starting point to bring out exactly what is similar in both situations. What you did in your first comment is precisely what Singer does in his paper, but in reverse: while you brought up the characteristics of slavery and forced overtime and said they were different, he brought up the characteristics of the hypothetical pond situation and not donating money and said they were similar.The guiding hand in his paper was the analogy he presented at the start of it. If he hadnt presented it, it would have still been an acceptable paper, but certainly one that wouldnt be as clearly formulated or understood.While you say we went nowhere on the slavery/overtime argument, Id say the opposite. Id say that someone who reads your first comment comes out with a much better understanding of the problem of forced overtime than someone who doesnt. And the analogy, even when you disagree with it, was what made this happen. Because even though you think that slavery is wrong for different reasons than forced overtime, your justification included the aspects of both of them and differentiated them, which, in spite of not settling the debate, already helps.I do agree that analogies alone are vague. Which is why they must be accompanied by an explanation of the elements that they are trying to group together. This may be the main point of miscommunication between the two of us. I never said analogies should come alone  I think they must be a tool for further explanations.!delta","title":"CMV: Theres nothing wrong with comparing mundane things to much worse events like the Holocaust or slavery"},{"text":"Im in Delaware and its not blocked for me.

Yes i think it is the case, that if you have an high number of people accusing someone, and all of them are unable to gather any type of proof, they are most likely lying.How can a guy accused of 30 people that are telling the truth not have any contradiction while saying his side of the story, timing not matching, you were supposed to be here instead you were there, stuff like that.How likely is that with 30 people you can't get any type of incongruency that actually lead to something more that lead to the guy being actually caught in some lie in his story if he  actually done the crime 30 damn times? or 50 times? or 100 times? the more accusation without any evidence you have, the more they are unlikely to be truth, or you would find something in at least some of them.If someone was suspected of shoplifting, and 30 other shopkeepers all said they had reason to believe he stole from them too, we wouldnt decide that all of the shopkeepers are liars. We would decide that it may not be worth prosecuting, but he might well have a system for evading detection.funny that you bring this example, because one would logically think that if 30 shopkeepers had reason to believe this guy was stealing, you would think that at least one of them would have some footage from the security camera, or a report from item bought and sell and what is supposed to be there, or i don't know i'm not a detective, you get my point.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Yeah, partly because the Democrats laugh at stuff like this instead of being angry.","title":"Hillary Clinton laughs as Trump announces Gulf of America order"},{"text":"But there are parts of our society in which men *brag* about rape.

If someone looks at me and says \\"overtime is just like slavery\\" I am no longer taking them seriously as an equal in this discussion. That is such a painful oversimplification that, whether I agree with you or not about overtime being bad when used as a standard, the only thing I'm now actually thinking is \\"How much of my own time am I willing to spend teaching this person?\\"Because anyone who can use such a bad analogy completely misunderstands all issues at hand. They completely misunderstand what slavery is, completely misunderstand what mandatory overtime is, and completely misunderstands why both are bad. The fact the analogy fails in the specifics is what makes it useless in its entirety. We went nowhere because at the end of the day we're still at the same place we started. Which is asking you 'why is overtime wrong?' You can't avoid that specific answer with a vague wave at slavery that cannot answer that questionWhen you say Not taking action to alleviate suffering isnt the same inflicting suffering, youre making a valid point that is directly contrary to the point the article was trying to make (that is, that not taking action to alleviate suffering IS as immoral as inflicting suffering). You see how productive the analogy was in this case to question and reveal the underlying beliefs and suppositions that you and Peter Singer disagree on?And yet Singer's syllogism can achieve that without the analogy at all. His syllogism holds up fairly well all alone, and I would still disagree that passive observance is not, and can never be the equal of, active inflicting. Both can be morally wrong, but to make the two the same I just can't see how you make that hold up. Which again is the problem. Singer's syllogism concludes you are a bad person and his analogy concludes, you're as bad a person as a genocider. One I can see how he backs, the second I don't see how he backs (though I've yet to read the paper)Therefore, the analogy he used had precisely its intended effect: it sparked debate and brought previously unexamined assumptions to the surface, even if you think his assumptions are wrong.I feel like this is more accurate to what you want to say. You don't think bad analogies are useful for making your point, you think bad analogies annoy people into talking to you so you can then get into nuance. Why not just say that?

For instance after AOC was elected, they created a policy to black-list any political consultant working on a campaign to primary against an incumbent Democrat, making it career suicide.And even after AOC was elected, recently Nancy Pelosi acted to prevent her from getting a committee position which would have given her power to push a progressive agenda within the party.And first-past-the-post voting makes it virtually impossible for a third party to gain any real political power.It's an overly-simplistic to blame the voters when the system is structured in a way which protects incumbents, and incentivizes those incumbents to align their interests with donors and special interests more so than the will of the people.","title":"CMV: The fact the TikTok ban was signed into law shows the US is not functioning as a democracy"},{"text":"If this day has proven anything, it's that the ACA's days are numbered.

You see how productive the analogy was in this case to question and reveal the underlying beliefs and suppositions that you and Peter Singer disagree on?The purpose of analogies, as seen in the Singer example, isnt to assert that two things are exactly the same: its to highlight a hidden shared principle. While you fundamentally disagree with Singers premise, the analogy successfully forced you to confront your ethical framework and articulate where you draw the line, and to show exactly where his analogy failed. Therefore, the analogy he used had precisely its intended effect: it sparked debate and brought previously unexamined assumptions to the surface, even if you think his assumptions are wrong.Your argument about how overtime differs from slavery  fair points in terms of the specifics actually reinforces just how effective analogies are to dissect moral problems, as long as people dont abandon the discussion as soon as they hear one.","title":"CMV: Theres nothing wrong with comparing mundane things to much worse events like the Holocaust or slavery"},{"text":"It will hurt Texas and Florida's electoral power far more than they realize.","title":"Trump rescinds Biden's census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps"},{"text":"Not a glitch!https://preview.redd.it/dtkxiynjybee1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69f2073fdcd2b98c5581dd9b5168d502b7f42b9dThis is from this morning, using the app.","title":"HAPPENING NOW: Instagram is now blocking pro-Democrat, anti-Republican hashtags.

In a lot of SA cases, the perpetrator is an acquaintance, not a random stranger. This makes the process to determine the truth very difficult because the testimonials can be overwhelmingly against the victim. When asking their circle of contacts, many people express their disbelief that the perpetrator A does SA, or perhaps, no one will believe that A does it. A is not necessarily a repeating offender. Victim B may be the only one that makes A so crazy to commit SA. Or victim B has some traits that makes A believe that no one else can detect him committing the crime and no one will believe B's word. SA is also very hard to be reported in the workplace because of the power dynamic. Way before the Metoo movement, people were still loyal to their job and jumping jobs was not the norm. Executives and managers hold a lot of power and some abused their power to harass female employees. Some women knew how to ride the momentum and used the cuddle to advance in the corporate ladder. However, many women were not. There are people who can strongly object to that behavior. Some know how to avoid it without causing trouble. And there are very passive women who do not know how to resist. Some are threatened that if they object to the idea, they will be in the manager's blacklist and so on. This can be very common in big organizations and places with toxic working culture.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Do you have any evidence of content manipulation?

Being falsely accused of shoplifting and theft is not in the same league as being falsely accused of SA. No one wants to be falsely accused of committing any crime, but there is no man out there with a sane mind who would prefer to be falsely accused of SA than to be falsely accused of shoplifting and/or theft, because the personal and legal consequences of SA are much more deeper.I personally place SA in a similar league to child abuse and murder, because it's that serious. SA is such a serious crime that in some cases (during wartime) the UN has labeled rape as a war crime! Women demand that men should take SA seriously and not to be dismissive of women who accuse men of SA. That's more than fair from my perspective, and most men (including myself) would have no problem with that. However, what many men find to be troubling is how dismissive society (especially some women, but not all women) can be about false accusations.This isn't some trivial like shoplifting or a speeding ticket, but a serious offense that can drastically change a man's life. The worst punishment that the Law can impose on someone (aside from the death penalty) is to take away their freedom and imprison them for years. False accusations can mean that a man may be sentenced to spend years, if not decades in prison for something they didn't do. Another way to understand men's reaction to false SA accusations, is to imagine if you were accused of other types of serious crime. For example, how would you react if you were accused of child abuse or murder? My guess is that you would react differently than if you were being falsely accused of shoplifting or theft.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Thank you very much!","title":"CMV: People dont care about democracy as much as they like to say"},{"text":"Finally!

Simply stating that such expectations are unethical and illegal isnt a very good argument, logically speaking. On the other hand, if I bring up a common element to slavery, this, by induction, makes my point much stronger (if youre familiarized with analytical philosophy, the comparison to slavery would lead to a syllogism in the form of This thing is like slavery, Slavery is bad, therefore This thing is bad. This allows for arguments to be made referencing This thing is like slavery, which is much less abstract and much easier to discuss than a simple moral affirmation. The fact that Slavery is bad is already an established moral truth massively facilitates talking about other moral issues, as it serves as a moral common ground).But this just doesn't work. It's a peak demonstration why it doesn't work. Slavery generally is composed of 3 things. A) Uncompensated, B) Forced, C) Labor. In comparison overtime is  A) Unpleasant, B) Difficult, C) Labor. So already the only core thing they have in common is labor. Boom. Suddenly the conversation has shifted from \\"is excessive overtime bad?\\" to \\"what is this shit analogy?\\" That's what you're going to spend the next 30 minutes arguing about. Your syllogism fails out the gate because the things about slavery that we dislike; the fact it is forced, the fact that there is no compensation, the fact that a person is regarded as mere property are all absent from your overtime analogy. Does overtime suck? Yes. So does coal mining, construction work and working as a cashier. None of those people are slaves. Shit babysitting my cousin after she had a tooth removed was terribly unpleasant, am I slave to my cousin? So I would absolutely and fundamentally reject the notion that overtime is in any meaningful way like slavery. Which leads us right back to the argument you wanted to avoid, why is overtime bad. You're right by the way. Simply stating that something is unethical and illegal isn't good enough. It's your job to explain why. It is illegal because \\\\[cite statutes here\\\\]. It is unethical because \\\\[add ethical framework here\\\\]. You have to expand a lot more than simply stating it. Taking the lazy way out of slavery is just going to make you seem ridiculous. At most the only way you can liken overtime to slavery is that if you don't do it you end up without a job so it's a form of coercion. But at that point everyone is a slave and the phrase holds no meaning anymore. I'm a slave. You're a slave, the overtime guy is a slave, and slaves are slaves. Intentional or not you've diluted that word to death. Now when we talk about actual slaves we have to pick a new word. Nonetheless, Id say most people overreact and get mad whenever such comparisons are done over the fact that x isnt exactly like y, even though the whole point of analogies is to bring out the similarities in things that are, in fact, not the same.Because the analogy is stupid. Doctors are evil. Why? Well they inject me with needles. And when you think about it injecting someone with needles is kind of like stabbing someone. So you can see my point right? No? Exactly. Just because two things are analogous does not make them equal morally. The doctor who amputates a gangrenous limb is not as immoral as the guy who hacks off his girlfriends leg so she'll never leave him. They are similar but the core thing to which we object is not the same and so the analogy fails spectacularly. Additionally, these types of analogies are widely accepted in the academic sphere, but not anywhere else. Ive read papers that state that not donating most of your money to starving children is similar in some ways to genociding them. But this sort of statement would get societal censorship if pronounced in any other medium, even educated ones like newspapers.I haven't read such papers. But I would almost certainly disagree with them aggressively. And I would do so because I draw a line. Not taking action to alleviate suffering is not the same as inflicting suffering. Especially if the requirement to alleviate suffering opens one to suffering. I was without work for the better part of a year. If I had given every last cent to the homeless rather than saving a rainy day fund for myself I'd have been with them on them streets. I find that notion equally in poor taste.","title":"CMV: Theres nothing wrong with comparing mundane things to much worse events like the Holocaust or slavery"},{"text":"It doesn't.

It's a social construct designed to create groups. Once groups are created, it's natural to start looking at the pros of your own while nitpicking the cons of another, which obviously results in \\"othering\\".The barriers are so nebulous, that not even all that long ago, Italians and Irish weren't considered \\"white,\\" so it's not even truly based on skin color, which is a rather arbitrary determinant to begin with, considering, as you said, that humans are all biologically the same species, regardless of appearance.That being said, it's a bit like Pandora's box. Once the box is opened, it can't really be closed. Even if racism and discrimination were to magically disappear, a lot of people consider race a key part of their identity, and to take that away from them would be akin to taking away a portion of their existence.The reason why race has become a key point in society is because it's 1) extremely obvious, and 2) modern society, especially in countries like the US, are ethnically diverse in a way that never existed historically.In ancient times, there likely would be no concept of race, simply because you lived in your tribe, and said tribe would probably be ethnically homogenous. But grouping would still have occurred, and social status would still be determined by those groups, just that the dividing line wouldn't be skin color. Grouping appears to be an inevitable part of human nature. Just like how even small children might pick on a peer for some random reason, they find a reason to exclude him from the group.Now, this is not to say that there is no good that comes out of grouping. Humans are social creatures and being able to identify oneself with a smaller group under the umbrella of humanity (family, tribe, etc) gives them a sense of community and a support structure that would have been absolutely crucial for survival in the tribal era. When you have excess resources, you share them with your group, and when you lack resources, your group shares their bounty with you.If you can't find a good reason for grouping, you make up one. It doesn't have to be a good reason or a rational reason, just look up the eugenics movement.

I am advocating for the treatment of women that are SA accusers to be more similar to the treatment of men that are SA accusers. Moreover, I am pointing out that there remains a social context to the converse of believe women that is disbelieve women.  And that this social context is longstanding, entrenched, and has historical legal precedent. You can see it in action every time a rape case is made public. And it isnt just during the discovery phases. We still have judges mitigating the sentences of men *found guilty* and fretting about the impact that the rape might have on *them.* and thats after guilt has been determined. Yes, being accused of rape has social implications that may turn out to be unfair in light of the evidence. But being falsely accused of anything can be horrendous, and we dont have thriving online spaces for people falsely accused of theft that happen to also be full of shoplifting apologia like we do for SA.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"I believe its executive orders","title":"Trump rescinds Biden's census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps"},{"text":"thank you this sub was starting to make me feel insane","title":"This is what you call hook, line and sinker America.

And part of the problem is that the legal process allows for all sorts of morally questionable smearing tactics. And while it's unfortunate, I'm not sure how you fix issues like this with something like a narrow slogan or activism as burden of proof and character assessment is a question far beyond rape/sexual molestation. In general, burden of proof falling on the prosecution makes a lot of sense - do you really have a problem with this concept in the first place?That being said, I don't think the slogan of \\"believe women\\" is actually about the legal realm at all. To me, the slogan is clearly meant to be for the court of public opinion and I really disagree with you here. The accused stands to lose a lot in the process even if found not guilty, etc. And while I still totally agree with the principle that you state initially, that women have the right to be heard and have their testimony taken seriously, I believe a catch phrase like \\"believe women\\" is an oversimplification that does not help achieve that and just perpetuates a non-nuanced mudslinging approach.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Definite minority and massive echo chamber.","title":"President Biden pardons family members in final minutes of presidency"},{"text":"They trusted the guy who did Muslim airline bans?
