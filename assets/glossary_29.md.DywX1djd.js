Under such a scenario, the deadline would move back to April, providing additional time without a ban while the Supreme Court weighs the case. In theory, TikTok could announce the commencement of negotiations with a potential buyer and urge President Joe Biden to grant the 90-day extension before the ban takes effect, experts said. Such an outcome is unlikely, since ByteDance has shown little appetite for a sale and it would be difficult to establish credible negotiations in just a few remaining days, Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, told ABC News. **Kreps added that the law gives leeway to a sitting president in setting the threshold for negotiations that would warrant a 90-day extension. Trump, who opposes a TikTok ban, could grant the extension after he takes office with scant evidence of negotiations, temporarily reversing the ban, Kreps noted**.https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tiktok-avoid-ban-experts/story?id=117694328","title":"Trump considers executive order hoping to save TikTok from ban or sale in U.S. law"},{"text":"Turner will still suck the Orangemans cock.","title":"Speaker Johnson removes Mike Turner as Intelligence Committee chair"},{"text":"Wow mike pence is actually not the oh yea nvm","title":"Mike Pence Defies Trump, Comes Out Against RFK Jr. for Health Secretary"},{"text":"No. This isn't a soft paywall, it's \\"subscribers only\\"Also, do you *really* want someone who can't even properly manage a nonprofit to be managing the US military?!?","title":"Why Pete Hegseth is a perfect fit to be Trumps Pentagon chief"},{"text":"Stop telling the American people what's \\"Best\\" for them.

Examples can range from microaggressions to straight up violent hate speech. The thing that frustrates me with the uproar is that these groups historically have never had access to free speech at the same level white, cis men have. Before the 21st century, gay men would be punished for mentioning his boyfriend at work, women would be punished for talking about books or divorce, black Americans would be punished for speaking back to a white person, indigenous folks punished for speaking their own language instead of English, etc etc. This \\"free speech\\" argument only ever seems to be used to defend folks higher up in the power hierarchy, and only ever to defend them from using words that belittle and tell lies about historically oppressed groups. Even today these same proponents of \\"free speech\\" want to shut down conversations about Pride, abortion, critical race theory, pro-Palestine. Heck, people to this day still yell at people to speak English and not their native language. So, in my mind when people make comments like \\"I disapprove of what you have to say, but fight for your right to say it\\" is disingenuous, because in practice most people are hypocrites and ignorantly flaunt doubly standards. The \\"free speech\\" argument also always conveniently ignores the past few hundred years of brutal discrimination and only seems to be used to defend the privileged.Edit: I also want to mention that I initially included the T word (rhymes with Brans Tender), but the use of the word isn't allowed here...

While loyal to the Union's cause during the Civil War, his policies and actions during Reconstruction were viewed at the time, and are now well understood to have been sympathetic to the South. President Johnson favored a quick restoration of the seceded states back into the Union without providing protections or reparations for newly freed slaves and no prosecutions of war criminals  and traitors. His approach led to significant conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, and ultimately resulted in his impeachment. He was acquitted by just one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Lincoln's assassination has had significant, protracted and tragic ramifications for the country.

Trump has been mulling ways to save the day for the wildly popular video app, talking through unconventional dealmaking and legal maneuvers such as an executive order that would unravel the law passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support, according to two people familiar with the deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. Trump has expressed a keen interest in being seen as rescuing a platform on which hes been told hes widely admired, leading political aides and business allies to scramble for options that would allow him to deliver on his campaign promise to save TikTok, as he has said repeatedly on his more than 14 million-follower TikTok account. I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, Trump said last month. The main question is how. A law signed by President Joe Biden last year calls for the apps owner, the Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, to sell the app by Jan. 19 or face an immediate ban. The Supreme Court, which considered TikToks challenge of the law last week, is expected to allow the law to proceed as planned but has not yet issued a ruling. The law is aimed at addressing Justice Department concerns that the Chinese government could covertly use the app to spy on Americans or broadcast propaganda. Trump, one of the people said, is eager to be seen as making a deal and signing an executive order soon after the deadlines passing  just one day before his inauguration  would give the proceedings a cinematic flourish. But the strategy of using an executive order  the kind of presidential decree that Trump dashed off in rapid fashion at the start of his first presidential term  has fueled doubts among some legal observers, who argue the presidents word cant entirely overcome a law that Congress approved with overwhelming bipartisan support. Executive orders are not magical documents. Theyre just press releases with nicer stationery, said Alan Rozenshtein, a former national security adviser to the Justice Department now at the University of Minnesota. TikTok will still be banned, and it will still be illegal for Apple and Google to do business with them. But it will make the presidents intention not to enforce the law that much more official. Trumps political allies have worked to build him up as the lone man qualified to rescue TikTok, saying in a filing to the Supreme Court that he alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform. Though he tried to ban TikTok during his first presidential term, Trump has in recent years celebrated the app as a way to undercut tech companies he despised, such as Meta, and reach young voters at viral speed. He was shadowed during the campaign by a young TikTok specialist who made videos for the app. TikTok chief Shou Zi Chew, who lives in Singapore, flew to Trumps Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach last month as part of the companys last-ditch attempt to save the app in the U.S. Shortly after, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social a collection of data showing that Trump is a star on the platform, with TikTok videos from Trump and his campaign having been viewed nearly 4 billion times  more than Kamala Harris, Fox News and Taylor Swift. Why would I want to get rid of TikTok? Trump said in a separate Truth Social post this month. Trump transition officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To undermine the law, Trump could push Congress to repeal it  a tough proposal, given it was one of Capitol Hills few bipartisan points of agreement last year. He could also direct his attorney general not to enforce it, effectively pretending it doesnt exist; Pam Bondi, his pick for the job, declined to say whether she would commit to enforcing the law during her confirmation hearing Wednesday. But some in Trumps orbit have floated options that would involve carving off pieces of the company for sale to satisfy the law, give American companies a slice of the business and let him take credit for sealing the deal. The law says the app will not be banned if its foreign owner executes a qualified divestiture, a type of transaction that it gives the president broad leeway to define. Some suitors have made the case that Trump should help them take over the company and run it as an American enterprise. During Trumps first term, he pushed to force the sale of a large stake in the company to corporate giants such as Oracle and Walmart, as long as the U.S. Treasury got a cut of the proceeds, and one of the people involved in the recent discussions suggested Trump may pursue a similar option during his second term. But one of the people familiar with the discussions said such a sale is extremely unlikely, given the political risks and the stratospheric price tag, which analysts estimate at around $50 billion. Some have also questioned whether TikTok remains as attractive of an asset as it did four years ago, given the flurry of short-video copycats from companies like Instagram and YouTube, and the fact that the few buyers and investors who could afford the costs may also face antitrust scrutiny or legal risks. Bloomberg reported this week that Chinese government officials had discussed Elon Musk buying TikToks U.S. operations, but TikTok has rejected the report as pure fiction. The multi-business billionaire already faces heavy debts from his last purchase of the social network now called X. One person familiar with ByteDances thinking dismissed the Musk proposal but said that the idea TikTok could be part of a big bargain or a big negotiation between the U.S. and China was legitimate. Kevin OLeary, the Canadian businessman known from ABCs Shark Tank who posted a selfie Sunday with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have said theyve crafted what theyre calling the Peoples Bid to take over the app without its underlying recommendation algorithm, which China has blocked from being sold. Both OLeary and McCourt have tried to reach Trump through media interviews praising his dealmaking prowess, and OLeary recently said the president-elect could use TikTok as a negotiating tool for his discussions over broader trade issues with China. But in the end, TikTok is Trumps deal, OLeary told Fox News on Monday. Hes not giving it to anybody else. A person familiar with TikToks thinking said OLearys proposal was a nonstarter and a fairy tale. To resolve lingering security concerns, Trump allies have also floated the idea of reviving Project Texas, the $1.5 billion corporate-reform package that TikTok unsuccessfully offered to the Biden administration in exchange for staying afloat, one of the people said. The proposal would have given the U.S. government insight and veto power over TikToks hires and programming decisions, as well as a kill switch if federal officials determined the app had crossed a line. But Bidens Justice Department declined the offer, saying it would not satisfy the apps serious national security risks. Several of the high-profile China hawks Trump named to his Cabinet and the administration at large have a long history of panning TikTok as a threat to national security. But some of them have more recently recast their views to match Trumps friendlier stance. His secretary of state pick, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), who introduced a law in 2022 to ban the [Chinese Communist Party] puppet app that is collecting data on tens of millions of American children and adults every day, deferred to Trump when asked last week about his efforts to save the app: If Im confirmed  Ill work for the president. Trumps pro-TikTok allies have worked to frame the issue as one in which he can further undermine Bidens regulatory legacy and take credit for eradicating an increasingly unpopular ban effort. The share of Americans who support a TikTok ban plunged from 50 percent in 2023 to 32 percent last summer, a Pew Research Center survey said.","title":"Trump considers executive order hoping to save TikTok from ban or sale in U.S. law"},{"text":"They're cosplay for cops.","title":"Canada sending Blackhawks, drones to border as the clock to pacify Trump ticks down"},{"text":"Great fucking post!","title":"Is \\"MAGA\\" and Libertarianism compatible?"},{"text":"I don't believe that Trump won.

Both sides of the coin in this country, are technically right wing. So when the right calls the left communists, it's sort of uh, retarded.

One dem was found to not live in his district amd was dqed by state judges as bejng ineligible to run, so now republicans have a one vote majority. Dems hatched a plan to not show up on day 1, which is presided over by the Dem Secretary of State, so that he could state that there arent enough members present for quorum and adjourn the session (something which repubs in certain other states try to do regularly to try to block bills that dems have the votes to pass). Plan is to do it basically daily for the next 2 weeks until a special election can be held to elect a replacement rep, which will probably be a Dem because the dq'd rep won by 30%. Republicans counterargued that based on their interpretation the quorum is determined based on # of elected reps rather than seats, and because there is 1 less rep than there are seats, they actually had quorum. They also cpunterargued that dems didnt show up to be sworn in, so the GOP present constitute the full extent of the legislature until Dem reps show up. In actuality, Dems met in private in advance of the first session to secretly swear in so they didnt have to show up on day 1 and could maintain the boycott, which repubs maintain is invalid or illegal. So despite being officially adjourned, repubs stuck around to conduct business and elected a speaker to a 2 year term without half the reps present to vote. They are suing to basically override the adjournment while dems are suing to enforce the adjournment.","title":"Republicans in Minnesota have just completed a coup."},{"text":"Long term, the maga wants to control the Artic from just past Greenland (perhaps Iceland) to the Bering Strait.","title":"Canada could cut US energy supply in reply to Trumps tariffs"},{"text":"Eh.

Why the focus on programs that currently prevent starvation, infant mortality and lifetime disabilities when there are much safer ways to begin the process.Overall though it is clear that being a libertarian only means you want to see a free market.

When you factor in all the other provinces and the amount of damage that will done to US business on account of retaliatory tariffs, its going to be a bloodbath on both sides of the border. Thing is, the super-rich arent going to take much of a hit at all from this. Its pretty much small and medium businesses that are going to struggle, and if the US thinks the Canadian government isnt going to hit them in the balls after this stab in the back, theyre wrong. Trump will get to swing his little dick around and institute tariffs, regular people on both sides of the border will suffer, small and medium businesses will go under and get bought out by big business, and then if anyone sane ever gets elected to office in the US again, it will be too late. Canada will not forget this, and will find new trading partners. Just like that, our remarkable economic relationship and partnership will be in tatters because of one octogenarian idiot who wont have to live with the consequences of his own policies.","title":"\\"Shocking criminal scheme\\": Raskin says Jack Smith's report shows Trump is an authoritarian threat"},{"text":"Here's the neat thing, Trump promised them that the US would stand by while they destroy Gaza silently.","title":"Is that a joke?\\": Biden bristles at Trump receiving credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire"},{"text":"Just be prepared to take a detour transporting it the the contiguous United States.

Libertarians hold a wide variety of opinions and often disagree with each other.Starting with Entitlement Spending will save more than cuts at the pentagon, and most libertarians favor a kick ass military we just want it kept at home for self defense.  (See disclaimer above.)I honestly think lobbying has a place in government.  Politicians arent experts.  But if we expect congress to pass a law concerning/affecting heart medications one day, and genetically modified cells the next, and AI use and privacy the day after that they are going to need to hear from a variety of experts on a variety of topics.  Id say we need to preserve and expand access to that knowledge while also separating or eliminating the campaign/money part.  Congress should absolutely hear from both small dairy farmers selling raw milk and big dairy orgs.  Big dairy should not be controlling the debates and de facto writing the laws because they have money to give.  How you fix it, I dont know.Im not sure libertarians want to get rid of the safety net.  I think we just envision a different approach.  One with much more local control and charitable based.  LA for example doesnt have the same issues and needs as Cincinnati.  So why rely on multiple bureaucracies forcing one size fits all solutions?  State and local orgs can cut out a lot of middle men and red tape.Question- in what ways do you see corporations raiding the coffers?  Like how would you describe that process happening?  Libertarians are generally concerned with corporate behavior as well, but most of us see the problem in terms of regulatory capture and rent seeking.  Take away the governments ability to grant these kinds of protections and advantages, and the problem starts to solve itself.Abortion is a hot debate within the party and among many libertarians.  There are good arguments being made in good faith from a variety of perspectives.  If you want to vote strategically at the state level based on womens rights, by all means do so.  Its your vote and no one elses business how you cast it.  I always vote for the libertarian in any race because the margins in my state are large enough that my single ballot isnt going to change the outcome.  My preferred candidates arent going to win, but my vote helps keep ballot access and lets both parties know I dont like their offerings.In any case start telling people youre a libertarian around election time, and youll get to experience the joy of casting a Schr?dinger Vote!Anyway, I think of libertarianism as a path more than anything.  Are you on it?  Only you can decide.  And remember, the Libertarian Party and libertarian philosophy arent always the same thing.  Theres a lot of room under the philosophy tent.  Id say the only hard and fast disqualifications are using force to impose your will, beliefs, politics, etc. on others.  And violating the NAP.  Everything else seems up for debate, and boy howdy are libertarians up for the task!Its real easy to tell when you are a libertarian though as soon as another libertarian tells you that youre not a real libertarian welcome aboard.ETA:  Thats an excellent reading recommendation above.

She has said some stuff that is much, *much* worse than the example I put up, to the point where the person that was crying left the bar and never came back that night, or the next few nights.

Changed statute of limitations, she lied about being funded by a very vocal democrat billionaire Reid Hoffman, didnt know even close to when it happened, said she wore a coat that wasnt in production etc. So based off this now we KNOW people will sue him with baseless allegations but hey playing devils advocate 26 cases is a lot.So only 2 of those cases were brought forward before 2016. Then 24 cases were brought against him once he started running for president. Huh thats odd. Lets look into the 2 before.Jill Harth alleged Trump assaulted her a few times and just couldnt get enough of her. She also alleged the mfer STALKED her. So for years, Trump was obsessed with getting in the chicks pants while he ran however many companies and tv shows? Yah okay. Then in 2015 she tried to get a job working for his company. Like CMON MAN. Ivana is the other one and shes come out saying the story holds no merit and that the tension was high during their divorce and it got carried away. I mean theyre on good terms and she says its fake but Ik youre gonna think he brainwashed her or something.Again you completely brush past the fact it shouldnt have been a felony and it was obviously targeted. You also glossed over the fact the judge donated to his political enemy. Like quit being an asshole for 5 seconds and put a democrat in trumps position. Youd be fucking LIVID that the judge donated to Trump no matter how much. Rules for thee not for me. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63000691.ampI saw you talked about the charities. This is an article about Letitia James who was the AG and made Trump pay for the charity stuff. Shes holding an anti Trump sign on the opening page isnt that a fair and unbiased judge lmao. From what I can tell she made him pay because his campaign team worked with the foundation to set up a fundraiser for veterans and he couldnt do that and say he did that to help his campaign. So theyre mad he raised money and used it to help his political campaign which I mean ig but again this is headhunting. https://apnews.com/general-news-united-states-government-7b8d0f5ce9cb4cadad948c2c414afd57","title":"Trump was convicted and he was still elected.

It not only establishes birthright citizenship, but was also created to negate the Dred Scott decision, which is considered by some as the worst Supreme Court decision in US history.That being said, it does make sense for Republicans to target the 14th considering it's been cited in literally thousands of cases, many of which have sought to protect American's civil rights.Which is why it has earned itself the label of \\"the cornerstone of civil rights in the United States.\\"Some constitutional scholars argue that it is one of, if not the most consequential amendment in our constitution.As many of you may know, decisions made in cases like Brown v. Board of education and Roe v. Wade invoked the 14th.Now, any attempt to amend, repeal or alter this amendment will be met with a score of legal challenges, but that certainly won't keep Republicans from trying.Almost every clause belonging to the 14th protects rights or privileges that Republicans have threatened to invalidate over the years.There's the citizenship clause...There's also the due process clause, which has been referenced often throughout this country's history, and extends protections for Americans from say, a far right, authoritarian regime intending to deprive them of their \\"life, liberty or property\\" without \\"due process of law.\\" Then there's the equal protection clause, which has been cited in countless cases and has also been the basis for many landmark SCOTUS decisions. As it suggests, the clause ensures equal protection under the law, or in other words, it makes sure that no person or group is denied the same protections under the law that others benefit from, while many of the decisions invoking this clause have addressed things like discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual orientation, as well as broader civil rights protected by the constitution. Hmm, I wonder why Republicans might want to challenge this one in particular.Then of course, there's the part of the 14th amendment about disqualification from office. It prohibits individuals, like Trump for instance, from holding office if they've engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. Wow, it's looking more and more like a no-brainer for the GOP.There's also the privileges or immunities clause. Which is, I suppose, a lesser known part of the fourteenth. Its original aim was to ensure that citizens of each state were entitled to the same privileges and immunities as citizens of other states. Once you put all this together, it becomes obvious why Republicans like Bondi might want to \\"study\\" this part of the constitution.That being said, let's look more closely at Pam Bondi.This is the second time Bondi has been picked as an \\"alternate\\" so to speak. The first time she was chosen to replace Corey Lewandowski as head of one of Trump's super PACs after he got caught sexually assaulting women during a charity event. Bondi is just another example of the rampant cronyism and conflicts of interest we've come to expect of Trump's nominees.She was involved in a scandal where she basically took a $25,000 bribe while she was attorney general of Florida, and shortly after, decided not to pursue a lawsuit against Trump University.She also has ties to the Church of Scientology, if that ain't a red flag...Bondi is also a hardcore election denier, and promoted a great deal of misinformation and propaganda about the 2020 election.Not to mention, she's been part of a Republican-led legal effort that has piggybacked off of Trump's election fraud lies to pursue lawsuits that restrict voting rights and access to the vote.Then there's the fact that she defended Trump during his first impeachment trial.She obviously has close ties to Trump, and has shown favoritism towards him in the past. Under normal circumstances, her conflicts of interest would disqualify her from the position. But it's precisely because of these conflicts that she's been chosen.It's because of her unflinching dedication to Trump and her willingness to take bribes, it's *because* of her previous positions as head of a pro Trump super PAC and litigation chair for The America First Policy Institute, it's *because* of her belief that the 2020 election was \\"stolen,\\" and it's because of the roles she's played in the past as a legal advocate and defender for Trump, that she's been selected to carry water for him. She will not hesitate to fall in line and pursue whatever action is demanded of her, however corrupt, unconstitutional, or unjust it may seem.While just like Gaetz, Bondi is an ideal choice for the next Trump administration if they decide to follow through on their threats against their political enemies, immigrants and marginalized groups.","title":"AG Nominee Pam Bondi Says She Will 'Study' Birthright Citizenship in Hearing After Trump Floated Abolishing Practice"},{"text":"And he admitted it publicly??","title":"Utah's Owens backs Trump's Panama Canal buyback plan"},{"text":"Im sure Hamas will attack again during trumps second presidency and the cycle will repeat itself","title":"\\"Gaza ceasefire deal: Biden won't give him the credit - but this agreement wouldn't have happened now without Trump\\" | World News | Sky News"},{"text":"\\"A diplomat briefed on the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas credited progress in the talks in part to the influence of President-elect Donald Trump, saying it was 'the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.'\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/15/israel-war-gaza-ceasefire-hostages-news-hamas/#link-RO4YL25X2ZB6DJP3TWPCCUIFTEhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-01-13/ty-article/.premium/trumps-mideast-envoy-forced-netanyahu-to-accept-a-gaza-plan-he-repeatedly-rejected/00000194-615c-d4d0-a1f4-fbfdce850000https://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-official-trump-envoy-swayed-netanyahu-more-in-one-meeting-than-biden-did-all-year/This reddit is full of disinformation.

Former cult members have stated that SIF's goal is to put their people into high-level government positions so they can influence society around them.  It's really a true cult, where they view their leader Chris Butler as a living god.  Tulsi refuses to speak about her current ties to SIF, but the people she hired while she was in DC were all SIF cult members.  If Tulsi is asked about her religious ideology, she comes out swinging, claiming persecution because she's \\"Hindu\\", and leaning on \\"freedom of religion\\".  It's a tired playbook, which she will use in her confirmation.  Once she's the head of US Intelligence, she will fuck up so many things.

The distinction is obvious and the argument of That is not an opinion; that is a falsehood. is often raised as to why it's not included.Which is where the whole I disagree with you. ties into. It's hard to agree or disagree with facts.I do actually, as a matter of fact, believe in limitless freedom of opinion. I believe that no opinion whatosever should be illegal to voice publicly or publish and I also don't really believe in the so-called harm of these opinions. That they're harmful implies one or two of both:- They can convince a significant number of persons: so there's some merit to it.\\n- People can be convinced of things without merit, we're all lost anyway.Ban this opinion, and they'll just find something else weird to be convinced of. I don't believe opinions are banned because they're harmful but because they're offensive to whoever decides they should be banned, which may or may not be the majority.Like, most famously where I live an organization that advocated for abolishing the age of consent was banned because of this dangerous opinion, but what's the danger of their saying it? The way they said it probably only achieved the opposite of what they wanted and they weren't convincing anyway and no one took them seriously and most people were disgusted by them. I really don't see any harm in letting them continue to exist; they weren't achieving anything with their messages whatsoever that they wanted to. Of course, the real thing was that the supreme court was just sufficiently disgusted by their gospel, not that there was any real threat by their saying it; they weren't influencing anyone.Falsehoods are of course different.","title":"CMV: \\"I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will fight for your right to say it\\", is a good principle for society."},{"text":"Never forget he got rich because he created an app where [he and his little incel buddies](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/) could rank their classmates on [whether or not they were hot](https://www.thoughtco.com/who-invented-facebook-1991791).

When tariffs drive up those costs, it doesnt just make imports expensiveit can force businesses to cut jobs, raise prices, or even relocate production overseas.So, while the intent might be to encourage buying American, the reality is more complicated.

The TLDR version is that this studio, which many major western game developers used to outsource their games, was revealed to basically be a game development sweatshop run by a wannabe cult leader. The abuses committed by that studio against its employees were absolutely horrendous and it was all made possible by big corpos who decided that saving a few bucks on development costs and meeting deadlines was worth ignoring serious human rights abuses.# It can incentivize dishonesty:Similar to the first point, a goals- focused perspective can incentivize dishonesty regarding the accomplishment of smaller goals in service of the larger end goal. At both an individual and organizational level, a focus on metrics- based goals can encourage what would be most accurately described as fraud.Whether it's Wells Fargo account manager creating [fake accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_cross-selling_scandal) to pad their numbers or a company [reclassifying its debts as capital investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCom_scandal#Fraud_revealed), it was all done in the name of creating that someone was meeting their benchmark goals in service of the Main Goal, which is making a profit.","title":"CMV: Result is much more important than the process"},{"text":"Huh?

The American economy mostly benefits, while Canada's economy mostly suffers. The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy to match the booming US economy, while the Canadian government is left without one of its most powerful tools to prevent a recession. Especially if it was integrated with a free trade border and a common labor market.I don't know, but this seems like a very theoretical exercise given that both US parties are against free trade, and Canadian parties might not be hot on the idea either.Discussing this whole \\"economic union\\" idea through free trade/movement assumptions that the US is openly against, while the US threatens annexation, is a bit weird.

Reports suggest he may invoke a national economic emergency to activate special presidential powers.And he has spoken of using economic force to effectively annex Canada, as part of a broader strategy of territorial expansion (potentially including Greenland, Mexico and Panama). Trumps aggressive and unpredictable approach means Canadians must take these threats very seriously.Trump claims that the bilateral U.S. deficit in merchandise trade with Canada amounts to the United States subsidizing Canada. This claim has no economic merit whatsoever.Trump literally makes up numbers and ignores fundamental precepts of economic theory. In reality, the United States benefits from the bilateral relationship at least as much as Canada does.Trumps claim that Canada is subsidized by the U.S. through this bilateral deficit is laughable  and his economic team surely understand that. They are many things, but they are not ignorant. Rather, they are trying to drown out rational discussion of this issue in a barrage of threats and bluster.?

Vought is a major Project 2025 figure who is being considered again for director of the OMB, a position he held under Trump's first term.The GAO, or the Government Accountability Office, determined that Vought overstepped his authority last time as the OMB's director after he violated federal law by withholding congressionally approved funds for Ukraine.Vought has also spent time working for the lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation.He has spent years organizing a plan to restructure the government in a way that grants Trump unitary executive powers. Mr. Voughts role in Project 2025 was to oversee executive orders and other unilateral actions that Mr. Trump could take during his first six months in office, with the goal of tearing down and rebuilding executive branch institutions in a way that would enhance presidential power.In an interview, Vought laid out his plan for eliminating the independence of several government agencies in order to give the White House direct control over them.  What were trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them,\\" he said.Vought said that Trump has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle the power of federal agencies and civil servants. \\"We have to solve the woke and the weaponized bureaucracy and have the president take control of the executive branch.Oh, another \\"anti-woke\\" fanatic, what a surprise.Vought also helped publish a legal framework for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops on domestic soil in order to quell protests.In terms of his so called \\"fiscal policy,\\" Vought has supported budget cuts in the past, arguing in favor of slashing funding to entitlement programs and domestic spending. This includes cutting access to Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.Vought is just another example of the rampant cronyism we've come to expect of the MAGA movement.Trump has already nominated several Project 2025 and Heritage-linked followers to positions of power within his new administration. Their agenda to establish a unitary executive is already underway.The goal will be to consolidate power for the party and concentrate as much power as possible in the hands of Trump. This will allow them to exploit Trump in order to cripple the independence of most government agencies, especially regulatory agencies, while stripping protections from civil servants, giving the Trump administration the authority to either clean out or eliminate these agencies altogether, deprive them of their autonomy and/or install MAGA loyalists into positions of power once reserved for non-partisan civil servants and educated staff members whose job security didn't previously depend on their level of allegiance to Donald Trump.","title":"The Most Terrifying Answer in Trumps Budget Chief Hearing | Donald Trump nominated Russell Vought to run the Office of Management and Budget."},{"text":"Played a role yes, but neither currently or oncoming can take \\"full\\" credit for this.Ex from the article:\\"Witkoff was not the only figure working to get a deal.

Its easy to prove the relationship between speech used to target someone specifically and said target being materially impacted. Its not so easy when its speech targeting a much larger group, and a relative few people within that group are materially impacted. However thats the reality we live in. There are unfortunately numerous examples of public hate speech being a contributing factor towards members of a protected class being targeted, and unfortunately there really isnt anything anyone in that targeted class can do about it until escalation to a personal attack occurs. By setting a hard line between personal libel/attacks and wider hate speech, a social contract is formed. That social contract essentially states that society is willing to accept the possibility of non specific people being targeted, so that society is allowed to publicly use hate speech.Where people fall on this topic typically reflects how much they can stomach random people being harmed to pay for the ability to use these kinds of speech. Its a spectrum, with absolute free speech and highest chance of harm on one end, and no free speech and no chance of harm on the other. Most people know the extremes are insane, so they pick somewhere in the middle. Im probably further towards minimizing harm than you on that spectrum, because Im okay with some rhetoric being censured once a line of extreme prejudice has been crossed despite how ugly censoring can be. I think a perfect society would be able to work at different points along this spectrum for specific cases based on the nature of the speech and the results from it. I think a good one seriously understands the implications of picking a point along this spectrum, and gives both free speech and harm reduction proper due diligence.","title":"CMV: \\"I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will fight for your right to say it\\", is a good principle for society."},{"text":"I mean Dick Cheney and all the war mongers wanted Harris.

What Citizens United also did was place core fundraising operations squarely outside the major parties themselves. This had the effect of further minimizing their role in the nomination process and campaign strategy (a process that began with the empowerment of popular primaries in the 1970s). This is important because parties, and conventions in particular, once functioned as, essentially, elaborate vetting operations. To win nomination for any office required you to win support from various factions, show you have local support and/or backing from leadership, align yourself with a partys core policy goals, and so on. A partys leadership has to like you, and believe youll have a good shot of winning in a general election. Now much of that seems to be gone, at least for the time beingwhich is exactly how a party like the RNC wound up with Trump, despite pissing off leadership, donors, prominent media, and so on.

Hopefully we can agree that following someone around and screaming curse words in their ear is a form of harassment. What about instead of screaming and cursing, it's just following someone around saying \\"na na na na\\" at a normal level? Also antagonizing, right? What about if it's racial slurs? What about if it's just one racial slur? What about someone says a racial slur to their coworker? Or a boss that makes a sexual joke or advance towards an insubordinate? What about someone that refuses to call someone by their preferred name? I'm not sure I advocate for making \\"hate\\" speech illegal per se...but I also think we have to acknowledge that hate speech, racial slurs, sexual speech, etc are forms of harassment. Harassment is not just \\"being annoying\\" or repeated unwanted contact, it's speech that is being weaponized to intimidate, antagonize, and terrorize others. It's a way to shut down other's ability to exercise their free speech. Slurs/hate speech is not a legitimate type of viewpoint that contribute to the marketplace of ideas...it's the equivalent of walking into the town square and blaring white noise on a megaphone to drown out viewpoints you don't like. Under the strictest interpretation of free speech...blaring white noise is a form of speech but that doesn't mean we should have to tolerate it the same as we do with legitimate speech.In the U.S. we do treat many of these as a harassment in certain situation...like the workplace, education, providing housing, etc. But many argue that these protections should be removed in the name of free speech.

Theyre a little too cute.The mother says, Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us.The agent says, OK. OK. Ill take a look.The show starts with my son and daughter playing with our dog. The dog is old and hes missing all of his teeth, so the way we feed him is that he sucks off my son so long till my son cums and ejects his sperm into the dogs mouth. The daughter is there to suck my sons balls and his anus so that my son gets a little extra out of this feeding ritual as well. After the dog is fed, my daughter gets down on all fours and licks off the dogs saliva as the dog fucks her asshole. My wife comes up, singing the collected hits of duo Platin. The second she sees the dynamic trio, she gets down on her knees and starts rubbing her old, wrinkled pussy. My daughter stops sucking his brother and moves over to her mom. She stands in front of her, pissing all over her mothers face and naked breasts as my son fucks her in the ass. The dog is running around, licking the urine that drips all around and as my sons cums in his sisters ass, he crawls underneath them and licks the dripping anus. My wife is now standing up and is dildo fucking her daughter from behind, as my son is fucking my wife in the ass. The dog is humping my son and they all move by the tune of Mary had a little lamb. Suddenly my son stops and grabs my mother by the throat, starting to choke her. She turns purple, then blue as her veins burst and her eyes pop out of their sockets. The daughter shrieks and runs away, only to be caught by me. I recently had a tetanus shot and something went wrong since my dick is bloated like a balloon. I grab her, throw her in the air and virtually run her through with my cock. At the end of it, theres her uterus with a little fetus as she was two months pregnant. I walk over to my wife, still with my bleeding daughter hanging on my cock and she takes her off, eating the fetus. My son licks the blood off and my dog finishes what is left of the uterus. We are all very tired and the last thing I manage to say is So, I see you all got your lunch. I think Ill have a burger! I walk over to the fridge, grab a burger, while my son is feeding off her sisters carcass and my wife is finishing the uterus, pop a beer on my way and sit down to watch a football game. After the game is over and my daughter finally dies with her stomach penetrated and blood gushing all over the stage, the rest of the family gets up, takes a bow, kicks the dog in the ass, making it topple off the stage and into the band pit, takes another bow and gets off the stage, dragging the body of my daughter behind them, leaving a bloody trail. We all come back one last time to take our last bow.For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, Thats a hell of an act.

My personal belief is that I can tell others I'm a doctor.No I can just read, the definition i explained is in the UNs universal declaration of human rights of what freedom of expression is and is defined as such:Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression*; this right* includes freedom to *hold opinions without interference and to* seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.","title":"CMV: \\"I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will fight for your right to say it\\", is a good principle for society."},{"text":"Sounds about right.

There is a strange strain of antisemitism going on right now, but that seems to be just as infectious in the left as the right. Trump being on a path to fascism is a more legitimate critique. Even if you like what Trump is accomplishing, the tools he has used or tried to use are more in keeping with someone who does not like care much for our branch of powers. The 2020 election is the best example of this. If any other world leader tried to work the electoral system in the way that he did and then tried to delay the certification of those votes, I think all people would recognize that if the president is subverting the processes of his own election, he has too much reach and is creating a pattern of centralized power. I would define fascism as a form of government that centralizes its power around the head of the state. This does depend on your definition of fascism, but whether you call it fascism or not, you don't want that behavior in a country that has such a robust and orderly system of balanced powers. It would quickly become that our federal judicial powers interpret law according to the people that elect them rather truth and the legislator are overruled by presidential order. Beyond that you see that the judges that Trump elected have continually made the president and presidential orders more powerful. I don't think you are wrong that people are exaggerating, but with that, Republican's should be cautious of Trump's tendency to try and win at all costs and increase the presidential powers. Any power that is given to Trump will be used against the USA in later administrations. This is not an issue unique to Trump, but his personality and distain for bureaucracy gives me little faith in his ability to temper the presidential office.","title":"I don't see how Trump could be a fascist"},{"text":"At the time of that campaign, the group was led by Raphael Warnock, who was later elected to the Senate as a Democrat from Georgia.  \\nThis is fine","title":"Nonprofit Founded by Stacey Abrams Admits Secretly Aiding Her 2018 Campaign - The New York Times"},{"text":"Thank God the only person presenting this argument is a reality TV presenter.

Its also kind of a tandem right in that its both the right express oneself in public discourse, as well as other people's right to decide if they want to listen to it. And the human right makes no distinction between public and private censorship.So its not just a right to scream into the void, if you get in the way of someone who wants to listen, or prevent someone who hasn't chosen if they want to listen to said expression of an idea that is censorship. But getting back to your examples, if a business chooses to fire you bc they by themselves found out about something you said, that isn't censorship. However if some 3rd party tracks down that person's employer and tells them \\"how dare you support x y or z, how havent you fired them\\" so essentially coercing them through bad press that is censorship.
