Abortion is a hot topic here in the U.S. mainly due to politicians passing legislation that bans the ability for a woman to get an abortion.American Libertarians are divided on this issue, there are those who are pro-life and those who are pro-choice. One of the core positions of libertarianism is that your body is not the subject of government intervention and that you are in full control of what you do with it. So abortions should therefore not be banned because some lousy politician or political think-tank says its \\"immoral.\\"The fetus is apart of the womans body, they can choose to abort it if they feel it is the right thing for them to do. Women should be the ones in-control of their own bodies. OP, you may take issue with the fact that a woman would wish to have an abortion, and thats fine, but what you have to remember is that those women may have felt that the embryo and/or fetus was nothing more than a parasite, especially when it comes to the traumatic experience of rape.My stance is that women should be able to do whatever they wish with their bodies. We should be able to have a healthy and productive conversation about it if a scenario involves two consenting adults in an intimate relationship, from where the original plan was to have children, but the potential mother having second thoughts, if the pregnancy was unintentional, or if there was any health complications that either affects the mother or potential child.Edit: removed a segment of my final paragraph along with some positional changes in terms of how my this response was meant to be directed for OP. The \\"parasite\\" comment comes from Rothbards own comments on abortion, so do with that as you will. Most of what I say would align with Rothbard.

The nearly 900-page document outlines proposals to consolidate executive power, dismantle diversity and equity initiatives, and enforce policies rooted in white Christian nationalist ideology. Key elements include mass deportations, restricting LGBTQ rights, banning abortion medications, and embedding ideologues into civil service roles. Critics argue that these plans aim to undermine civil rights gains, erode democratic principles, and impose a regressive social order.The article emphasizes the overlap between Trump's \\"Agenda 47\\" and Project 2025, highlighting shared goals such as expanding presidential authority and reshaping federal governance to reflect ultra-conservative values. It also draws attention to the broader implications of this movement, including its potential to marginalize vulnerable communities and redefine the cultural landscape in ways that critics view as authoritarian. By linking these policies to global far-right trends, the piece underscores concerns about the erosion of democracy and civil liberties under such an administration.","title":"Trump unhinged plans called the restoration of white supremacy"},{"text":"first its a joke, then when it happens they'll say its a great idea, and when he fails they'll say he was sabotaged by the dems","title":"Trump refuses to rule out using military force to take Greenland and Panama Canal"},{"text":"Fuck this wretched traitor bitch, the American public deserve to know the truth, RELEASE THE REPORT ANYWAY ASAP.","title":"Judge Aileen Cannon blocks release of special counsel Jack Smiths final report on Trump investigation"},{"text":"Sure Jan","title":"Trump warns 'all hell will break out' if Gaza hostages not released by his inauguration"},{"text":"Is Donald an r/noncredibledefense shitposter?","title":"Trump Says NATO Nations Should Spend 5% of GDP on Defense"},{"text":"His own professor said hes the dumbest motherfucker hes ever dealt with","title":"Trump seeks to block 'imminent' release of special counsel Jack Smith's report"},{"text":"They need to find a way to break the delusion that right wing boomers and young men have for Trump.

The issue has to do with voters who registered  many years and election cycles ago  using a form that predated the federal Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, of 2002. The pre-HAVA registration form did not clearly mandate registrants provide the last four digits of their Social Security number or their driver's license number.Griffin has also protested the counting of ballots submitted by some absentee military and overseas voters who did not provide photo identification, even though [state administrative code](http://reports.oah.state.nc.us/ncac/title%2008%20-%20elections/chapter%2017%20-%20photo%20identification/08%20ncac%2017%20.0109.pdf), in accordance with federal law, explicitly excuses such overseas voters from that requirement.Additionally, Griffin has alleged some ballots should be discarded because they were cast by ineligible voters who live overseas. These protests claim children of overseas voters  for example, missionaries and military personnel  who had never resided in North Carolina, should not have been allowed to vote, though such voters [are eligible under state law](https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside), again, in line with federal laws protecting the voting rights of overseas citizens.Credit to North Carolina Public Radio - [https://www.wunc.org/politics/2025-01-06/griffin-riggs-north-carolina-supreme-court-election-states-rights](https://www.wunc.org/politics/2025-01-06/griffin-riggs-north-carolina-supreme-court-election-states-rights)","title":"Republicans on the NC Supreme Court block certification of the Democratic incumbents election"},{"text":"Because you or someone you know has certainly never shoplifted anything ever before right?

But at around 15 weeks and ultrasound showed the child, the fetus had severe spina bifida.The doctor said you have two choices.  You can abort the child now, which means we will induce birth, and the child will die without pain because its central nervous system has not fully developed to feel pain.  Or you can carry the child to turn, and then the child will die with pain because it is viable for birth, but it is not viable for a survival.  They chose to induce birth at 16 weeks.  It tore them apart.  The choice was the child could be born and die without pain or the child could be born and die with pain.

If a politician didnt do the thing that is liked, then voters can replace them in the next election. But they instead sat at home. And a few of your points are misinformed. I blame the democrats not even trying to appoint a new supreme court justice in the last weeks of Obama. tHEy Go lOW, wE gO hIGh.Didnt have the votes. The democrats only had super majority needed for that for about 70 days and even then after a few weeks 2 senators were hospitalized and couldnt vote. The Voters could have made sure that democrats retained power in 2010, but republicans got control of house and senate and democrats were gridlocked. I blame the democrats for just sticking to establishment (corporate) media.Harris was literally on non-established media. I blame the democrats to constantly shift to the mainstream opinion instead of using their platform to credibly put forward their opinions. Grow a fucking spine.They literally went to every townhall and every interview and spoke about their oppinions, but the people didnt listen and the billionaire owned media didnt repeat and replay it instead they focused on whitewashing Trump because they were going to profit more under trump, while being taxed more under Harris. I blame the democrats for constantly sticking to boomer candidates for decades now instead of letting younger (progressive) people replace them.Only 15-20% of people vote in primaries, some primaries have as low as 8% turnout. Again voters at fault here. Remember Feinstein? She won by around 1-2m difference of voters while over 9m eligible voters didn't even vote. Then everyone went online to bitch about how she got elected... Yes I blame Trump, his cronies and Maga for lying to make everything worse for everyone except their billionaire friends. But no I dont blame the median voter.The median voter is in charge. And the median voter sat at home, in 2022 when the democrats had presented a 2 month long breakdown of jan 6th, and still over 150m didnt vote over 80% of 18-35 didnt vote, and in 2024 when over 90m didnt vote.You might not blame the voters, but the blame lies with voters.

Wait until you hear his new name for the Gulf of Mexico."},{"text":"If the judge grants an interim stay, it might effectively scuttle any chance of sentencing Mr. Trump. A full panel of appellate judges might not have time to take up the matter before Friday, and the window to sentence Mr. Trump is rapidly closing. Once he returns to the White House, Mr. Trump cannot face criminal prosecution.Even if the appellate judge denies his request on Tuesday, Mr. Trump is not out of options. He could turn to a federal appeals court that is already weighing his request to move the case out of state court. And if that court declines to intervene, the president-elect could also try to persuade the Supreme Court.The approach reflects one of Mr. Trumps favorite legal tools: delay.After being indicted four times in four jurisdictions, Mr. Trump leaned heavily on that strategy, making a variety of appeals and other filings to run out the clock until Election Day.When he won the election in November, the strategy paid off: The federal special counsel who had brought two of those cases  one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Florida  shut them down, thanks to a Justice Department policy prohibiting prosecutions of sitting presidents. And in Georgia, where Mr. Trump is accused of trying to overturn the states 2020 election results, an appeals court disqualified the local prosecutor who brought the case, delaying it indefinitely.In New York, Justice Merchan delayed the sentencing numerous times. He first postponed it in July to weigh Mr. Trumps effort to have the case thrown out based on a recent Supreme Court decision granting presidents broad immunity for their official actions. The judge punted again in the fall to accommodate the presidential campaign, and after the election, Justice Merchan paused the sentencing once more to consider the president-elects argument that his electoral victory should nullify the case.But in recent weeks, Justice Merchan picked apart Mr. Trumps legal arguments.On Dec. 16, the judge denied Mr. Trumps request to dismiss the case in light of the Supreme Courts immunity ruling. While the high court granted former presidents broad immunity for official actions taken in office, the New York case concerned a personal and political crisis that predated Mr. Trumps presidency: a hush-money payment to a porn star during Mr. Trumps 2016 campaign. (Mr. Trump, the jury concluded, orchestrated a plan to falsify records that covered up the arrangement.)And last week, Justice Merchan rejected Mr. Trumps claim that his election victory should shut down the case altogether, concluding that overturning the jurys verdict would undermine the rule of law in immeasurable ways.Mr. Trump is now formally challenging those decisions with the appeals court, filing a so-called Article 78 petition against Justice Merchan. It is unclear when the court might take up Mr. Trumps petition  a special proceeding used to fight decisions made by New York State agencies and judges  but it most likely wont happen until after Mr. Trump takes office.Before the election, Mr. Trump was facing up to four years in prison, though legal experts predicted that he would spend no more than a few weeks or months behind bars.\\nIn the ruling last week, Justice Merchan signaled that he favored a so-called unconditional discharge of Mr. Trumps sentence, a rare and lenient alternative to jail or probation. Unlike a conditional discharge, which allows defendants to avoid punishment if they pay restitution or hold down a job, an unconditional discharge would come without any requirements at all.That sentence, Justice Merchan wrote in an 18-page decision, appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality.","title":"Appeals Court Judge Refuses to Halt Trumps New York Sentencing"},{"text":"You want it to be even more illegal for a minor to unlawfully use an adults gun?

Trump on Tuesday intensified a last-minute effort to avoid his criminal sentencing in New York, urging an appeals court to intervene and halt the proceeding.In a filing with the First Department of the states Appellate Division, Mr. Trumps lawyers sought an emergency stay of the sentencing, which is scheduled for Friday, 10 days before his presidential inauguration. The lawyers argued that Mr. Trump was entitled to full immunity from prosecution, and even sentencing, now that he was the president-elect.To go forward with a sentencing, with its inevitable threat of stigma, opprobrium and potential criminal penalties, would pose risks to Americas vital interests that are intolerable and unconstitutional, wrote one of the lawyers, Todd Blanche.The appeals court could act swiftly. The emergency request was assigned to a single judge, Ellen Gesmer, who held a hearing at 12:30 p.m. and is expected to issue a ruling before the end of the day.At the hearing, Justice Gesmer appeared highly skeptical of Mr. Trumps arguments, asking Mr. Blanche whether he had any support for a notion that presidential immunity extends to president-elects?Mr. Blanche conceded that he did not, saying: There has never been a case like this before.Steven Wu, a lawyer representing the Manhattan district attorneys office, which prosecuted Mr. Trump, added that Mr. Trumps claim of immunity was baseless and that there was no support for an automatic stay here.Mr. Trumps effort will not stop with the emergency request. He also filed an action in the appeals court against the trial judge overseeing the case, Juan M. Merchan, challenging two of his recent decisions to uphold a New York jurys verdict against Mr. Trump.The filings marked an escalation of Mr. Trumps long-running effort to fend off sentencing and unwind his conviction, to avoid becoming the first felon to occupy the Oval Office. Ever since the jury convicted him in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal, Mr. Trump has attacked the verdict on various fronts, including demanding that Justice Merchan throw out the case.But the judge declined. And after numerous delays, he scheduled the sentencing, infuriating Mr. Trump, who has attacked the judge and his family since the onset of the case.\\nAlthough Justice Merchan signaled that he would spare Mr. Trump jail time or any other substantive punishment, the former and future president vowed to fight the sentencing. And after the judge on Monday declined a final request to cancel it  concluding that Mr. Trumps lawyers had recycled arguments that had previously failed  the president-elects hopes shifted to the New York appeals court.\\n","title":"Appeals Court Judge Refuses to Halt Trumps New York Sentencing"},{"text":"SS: \\"Most peaceful president\\" seems to think the threat of military action against an ally is okay.

The Polar Empire. Trump, who will most certainly not live to see this come to fruition, has almost completed his chores for Putin, and solid red (ironic color coincidence) zone has bifurcated the US. The liberal coasts are now isolated and may not survive. Trump is being fed what to say, as he and his presidency are the result of a a massive propaganda effort. The end game? Look at the world from the top and you will see that the US and Russia already dominate much of the polar regions, but pesky Canada and Greenland are in the way. The goal? Canada and Greenland will be devoured by force or compelled by sheer will to surrender their sovereignty and their resources. The US/Russo powers then can even expand south into much of, if not all of Mexico and central America to the point where they can effectively control immigration to the north. Panama anyone? China knows this and they will attempt to do the same with the far east. Europe will remain, for the time being, as a power center, but all bets are off if Russias propaganda efforts continue to erode from within. South America, and Africa will largely be resources to be exploited with no regional power able to coordinate a defense. Australia and New Z will be Resort Homelands\\" for the oligarchs and elite rich if needed to avoid the dangers in the rest of the contiguous world. Antarctica can wait until the ice melts. Then it will be carved up by the surviving superpowers. You can trust few in the coming US government. Russians are already most certainly in myriad places of influence in the US and thanks to FOX and other propaganda outlets, they will appear to be Americans to the idiocracy. Why dominate the north? A warm north means the petrochemical wealth machine will have a major extension into the 21st and 22nd century. As the permafrost melts, untold wealth will be unearthed but it must then be sold, so Trump, (obeying his master's orders) and Russia are working very hard to undermine any departure from a fossil fuels. This is why Trump has been told to attack green energy sources. But the rising seas and scorching heat will cause problems too. The equatorial regions, the Middle East and large portions of the middle latitudes will become unlivable during some parts of the year and those who live there now will be very keen to move north. That is why the Trump was directed to build the wall to fortify the United States' southern borders. Mass migration of undesirable (in Russia's eyes \\"brown\\") people moving north is a challenge but, for Russia and the US, geography is on their side, but only if they can control the population of the former \\"United\\" States. So far American Democracy, for all its failings has kept Russia at bay, but now, with Trump consolidating power, dismantling institutions, weakening the courts, neutering congress, and controlling the media and free speech, America democracy is destined to be converted into a facade much like in Russia/Hungary/Turkey etc. There will likely not be another election in the US that is not a farce. Its over. Without ever fighting the US directly, by utilizing the power of social and corporate media, by grooming the mass moronisphere to believe that Putin is somehow better for them than Obama, Biden, Clinton or Harris, the Cold War has been won by Russia.","title":"Trump Actually Seems Serious About Buying Greenland and Canada - Donald Trump is starting to take his preposterous joke seriously."},{"text":"Can someone explain this to me like I'm an idiot (because I am)?

As if tying all Jews to their Nazi project in Palestine &amp; their holocaust against the indigenous who live there wont result in rising antisemitism.Truly this article is disgusting in how casually it clearly poses believing Palestinians shouldnt endure genocide is antisemitic. Theres nothing about hate crimes. For an article about antisemitism with American Jews all it talks about is Iran &amp; Palestine. Nothing here at home, you know, where American Jews actually live, which tells you all you need to know about the antisemitism (antizionism) being discussed here.Especially considering Elon Musk, a known antisemite who boosts antisemitism on his website, isnt mentioned here once.

The Holidays talking with Trump supporting relatives was incredibly blackpilling not just because the bigotry was so much more in the open because they felt safe to do so, but also because they kind of know its a grift.  This country has been gripped by a sort of shiftless narcissism of people who think that if they ride the Trump train, theyll be on the right side of the rug pull.  Its like a modern crypto scam where everyone knows its going to crash, they just think that because theyre in the discord theyll be given the inside scoop on when to sell.  Its not a new tactic, a scam called the Romanian money box reminds me so much of the psychology of contemporary politics.  The legendary con artist Victor Lustig would convince someone he created a perfect currency forging machine that could never be detected by basically having a box where you could insert a bill and some blank paper and your bill plus an identical fresh bill would pop out.  There was no currency duplication, it was literally just another bill stored inside.  Lustig would sell the mark the box after demonstrating it, and the mark would then try it only to realize that it was literally just a box with a banknote in it.  The scam might seem obvious, but the trick was that Lustig convinced the mark not that there wasnt a scam, but that there was a scam and they were on the inside of it.  The median voter thinks they got one over on the rest of us, that tearing this country down will somehow benefit them personally because they support Trump, not realizing that theyre the actual mark.","title":"Trump threatens economic, not military force, to annex Canada"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/s5ig49y3fmbe1.jpeg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e44a759197ed3cb3ef4be6e5958ab83aff3ed8d7","title":"Trump will start WW3"},{"text":"Schrodinger's Douchebag","title":"Trump Wont Rule Out US Military Taking Greenland, Panama Canal"},{"text":":: yawn :: if this is the best y'all have to hit Trump with, it's going to be a glorious four years.","title":"So Trump is just a one world government guy, eh?"},{"text":"England and Canada are toast.
