The concept of gravity is only a theory, but we accept that gravity exists because the theory makes sense. This is complete nonsense. Subjective literally means \\"based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions\\". None of that describes a fact. Using gravity is a theory as an argument is silly. Partly because it doesn't seem like you have any idea what that means. Yes that is exactly my point. Democracy cannot function properly if the people are poorly informed and largely incorrect or incompetent. That leads to unqualified leaders and officials who act out of spite as opposed to acting out of virtue.Democracy doesn't guarantee qualified leaders, why do you think that? The only requirement for democracy to function properly is for the citizens to be able to cast their vote in a fair and accurate way.Not if youre acting in good faith it isnt. Climate change isn't a moral issue. It's an observation of data. The only debate is over the quality and breadth of the data *and* whether or not the analysis of that data is anomalous or not. Yes, by qualified experts. Not by your conspiratorial neighbour who believes vaccines cause autism. One allows for good faith critique and discovery. The other leads to the degradation of faith in scientific inquiry and the rise of anti-intellectualism.Science can be validated, or refuted, by anyone. You're confusing actual science with having opinions based on science or some misunderstanding of science. The rule of science is that any conclusion needs to be consistently repeatable by anyone who follows the same steps. If it is not, then it was a bad result. That's it. That is exactly the crux of my point. Democracy fails to function properly when people who refuse to understand how anything works get a hold of power and begin breaking down the system and procedures.That's not democracy failing. If the person was fairly voted into power, that is democracy working. Just because the person in power makes bad decisions or decisions that you don't agree with does not mean democracy is failing to function. No they dont. They have a problem with believing facts that cause them to have to reevaluate their understanding of the world. If it was merely a problem with untrustworthy actors, then nobody would believe Trump at all. But he has a cult that believes him despite famously being a pathological liar.You're likely not describing facts here. And you're also refusing to reevaluate your understanding just as much as you accuse others of not reevaluating theirs. Elaborate on this point if you think I'm wrong. I would have said money in politics and out of touch politicians. I have no problem with someone who has made politics their career as long as theyre honest and virtuous like Bernie Sanders. Either way, the US already has all of those things and theyve gotten exponentially worse during the Trump era.I like a lot of stuff Bernie says but I also dislike a lot. I also agree about money in politics is a problem. Why did you not mention the $1.5 billion that Kamala blew in 90 days? That's a staggering amount of money. I'd be curious how many politicians would actually still want to be politicians if they made zero money doing it. Not sure what you mean about things being exponentially worse in the Trump era. Funnily enough, nations do well with more immigration. Especially developed nations, since the more nations develop, the lower their birth rates fall. So a steady income of young labourers is vital for a functioning society. The problem comes when corporations exploit immigrants to keep pay low. That causes severe economic distress.There are other levers to pull to encourage increases in birth rates. Either way, illegal immigration is *very* different from legal immigration and should not be confused.","title":"CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only"},{"text":"??

That's why I put work in quotations. It really depends on what the end goal is. If you go by traditional metrics of \\"an economy that functions\\" (which for 99.9999% of cases, this is the definition of \\"work\\"). You mention that:Every business and state in America would suffer horribly if Cali decides to be self sufficient and gives Trump the finger.This would be terrible, if the goal of trump was to be a competent president, or to get re-elected, or care about his party's standing into the future. You know, all normal president considerations. The question is, would that be trump's definition of success? Judging by 2016-2020, no. This is even more the case now that he doesn't have to worry about the bruised ego of losing re-election (I do not think he'll actually run for a 3rd term, but hey, at this point anything can happen). My conjecture is that Trump's version of success is measured by three metrics:1. How rich can he and his friends get? This is particularly important for him now that his finances are much less stable than they were in 2016. He needs to rebuild that nest egg of his once he leaves office, if he makes it there.2. How can he leverage his new term in office to escape any potential legal troubles and setbacks? Things are already on the upswing for him here.3. How can he make himself look/feel good while sticking it to his detractors/enemies? This goes back to his ego thing, and his potential push for vendettas. If he goes through with it, it will likely crush the national economy, but that isn't something he truly cares about, as long as he and his own can still exploit it. That will be the true tipping point, as he'll pull back if his rich friends complain to him, but not for anything else.So back to your point, if/when Trump sees the effect of his war with California, his first thought will be, \\"how can I blame this on someone else, and not make my friends mad?\\" If he squeezes through, then it will have \\"worked.\\"","title":"Sen.

The conviction stemmed from a 15-year scheme where top executives received off-the-books compensation, enabling them to evade taxes on substantial portions of their income.\\n   * **Outcome:** The Trump Organization was fined $1.6 million, the maximum penalty allowed under New York law for such offenses. [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/verdict-reached-trump-organizations-criminal-tax-fraud-trial/story?id=94508551&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com)\\n2. **New York Attorney General's Civil Fraud Lawsuit (2022C2024):**\\n   * **Overview:** In September 2022, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, and three of his adult children. The suit alleged that they engaged in financial fraud by inflating asset values to secure favorable loans and insurance terms while deflating those values to reduce tax liabilities.\\n   * **Outcome:** In February 2024, a New York judge ruled against Trump and his co-defendants, imposing a $364 million penalty. With interest, the total amount exceeded $450 million. Additionally, Trump was barred from serving in top roles at any New York company for three years, and his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, faced similar restrictions for two years.

Initially, in 2008, Trump reported a $658 million loss. Subsequently, in 2010, he transferred ownership of the property to another entity he controlled and claimed an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade.\\n   * **Potential Outcome:** If the IRS determines that these deductions were improper, Trump could face a tax bill exceeding $100 million, excluding interest and penalties.

Its the nurse who cares for your aging parent as they are going through health trial after health trial at the VA.She also notes that the federal workforce is the one that does research to create not just cures but vaccinations. They are the people who stop terrorist attacks; theyre the people who keep us safe at the airports. Blindly slashing government means hurting Americans who rely on these workers. This attack on the federal workforce is also an attack on the very institutions that serve the American people, Spanberger says, and on Virginias population.If she can persuade voters sick of politics to listen to her common-sense appeal, Spanberger stands a good chance to win. When Trump comes after many Virginians jobs and critical services, her calm under fire might be essential in staving off the onslaught.","title":"A model for Democrats comeback?

She's had consistently great takes for democrats and wasn't afraid to say Biden shouldn't run again since 2021.Over the past few decades, after a presidential election, Virginia usually has elected a governor from the party opposing the one that gained the White House. If that holds next fall, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become the states first woman governor.Instead of running for reelection in Virginias 7th Congressional District, Spanberger decided to run for governor. So far, shes the only Democrat running, a sign of her political strength and fundraising ability. With three terms in Congress, a national security background (as a CIA case officer), and a reputation for pragmatism and moderation, she seems well-suited for Virginia.I spoke with her on Capitol Hill this past week. In the six years since I met Spanberger during her first run for Congress, she has honed her skill set to succeed in partisan politics. She peppers her comments with anecdotes and detailed data about the state. Her canny ability to get things done with unlikely allies might hold her in good stead with Virginias famously moderate electorate. I had bills signed into law by President Trump and bills signed into law by President Joe Biden, she tells me.In her constant travels around the state, she hears a familiar story. If I can sort of boil it down, its the overall concerns about the cost of living a daily life, she says. That might be prices at the grocery store or the pharmacy counter or the cost of buying a house. Regarding the latter, she observes, Like so many places across the country, weve got an issue with overall housing supply.  Virginia needs to kick it into gear.She knows that voters are frustrated with politics, tired of negativity and distrustful of politicians promising to fix their problems. Persistently sunny and in solution mode (a mindset perhaps attributable to her national security background), she tells me that although a general sense of unease might continue, In times of that unease, discomfort and challenge, theres a lot of opportunity for fixing problems.The current political climate poses an electoral challenge for Spanberger: She had expected to be running for governor with a Democratic president in place, promising to build on the partys record of achievement. Instead, she will need to present herself as a check against Donald Trump  without coming across as another negative name-caller. Her best bet might be to present herself as someone to step into the breach  without drama, chaos or contentiousness  when the federal governments dysfunction threatens to spill over the Potomac.Spanberger certainly can point to her record working across the aisle, even during hyper-partisan times. Often rated as among the most bipartisan representatives, she recalls her work for rural hospitals, in coordination with Republican Rep. David B. McKinley of West Virginia  a lovely, lovely representative, Spanberger says of the former congressman. They teamed up to hold drug prices down for hospitals and protect rural hospitals. I have no idea what McKinley did on other issues, she says, but I knew based on numbers that he had real challenges not so dissimilar from southwest Virginia in his state of West Virginia.","title":"A model for Democrats comeback?

The letter of the law and spirit of the law are separate ways to dish out justice.

A law no one else has ever been convicted of, and we all agree is and was not a threat to anyone or harmed society. So if Hunter broke the letter of the law, but not the spirit of the law, and convicting him only causes harm to society, why shouldn't Biden right that wrong?And I know you said you don't care that others are or aren't doing worse. Which I agree with. But there is a point it becomes absurd. If I'm literally the only person being convicted of a crime, and it's obvious it's because of unrelated circumstances, i.e. that my father is a politician and they're using me as a way to get to him, then how is this not an absurd perversion of justice? How could anyone believe in a system like that and not become disillusioned?How many times have you ever broken a crime like jaywalking? If we could count those times up, and they resulted in years of jail time, which by letter of the law they probably would, then should you spend years in prison?

I assume you meant (or would otherwise want me to substitute) Lawrence v. Texas in 2003. Lawrence, imo, was rightly decided as well. So we have two cases 50 years apart that overturned relatively major precedents. I think that sounds about fair. Then, since 2016, we have Loper Bright (2024) overriding 40 years of precedent in Chevron; we have Dobbs (2022) overturning 50 years of precedent in Roe; we have Hyatt (2020) overturning 40 years of precedent in Hall; Rucho (2019) overturned 30 years of precedent in Davis; Janus (2018) overturned 40 years of precedent in Abood; Trump v. Hawaii (2018) overturned 70 years of precedent in Korematsu. And those are just the cases that were at the time noted for both seriously contravening the precedent in a major way.

Regarding bathrooms and locker rooms, many places have adopted gender-neutral options to respect privacy and safety for everyone.

Literally if someone *owns a gun* and *smokes weed, ever*, they are guilty of the same offense.","title":"President Biden pardons his son Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Hunter Biden was politically targeted.  Fuck off, NY Post.In reality, few people fitting Mr. Bidens profile  a first-time, nonviolent offender accused of lying on a federal firearms application, who never used the gun (in his case, a Colt Cobra .38 that he held onto for less than two weeks five years ago) to commit a crime  get serious prison time for the offenses charged in the indictment.Just bringing the charges is out of the ordinary in some ways, former law enforcement officials say, and the legal basis of the prosecution is under constitutional challenge...A substantial percentage of those accused of lying on a federal firearms application, like Mr. Biden has been, are not indicted on that charge unless they are also accused of a more serious underlying crime, current and former law enforcement officials said. Most negotiate deals that include probation and enrollment in programs that include counseling, monitoring and regular drug testing.It is rare as a stand-alone, said John P. Fishwick Jr., who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 2015 to 2017. These charges are usually brought against convicted felons who illegally possess a gun or who commit a violent or drug-related charge.Prosecutions for lying to a dealer are relatively rare, averaging fewer than 300 per year. There were some 25 million to 30 million background checks performed annually around the time of Mr. Bidens gun purchase, according to statistics obtained by The Washington Post.Charges of illegal firearms possession are much more common. But they too are most often used as an add-on, to leverage plea deals or to ensure that a defendant is convicted on at least one charge if there are doubts that they will be convicted on an underlying charge, Mr. Fishwick and other former prosecutors said.In May, for example, when more than 20 people in Savannah were sentenced to from 10 months to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to illegal firearms possession, all of them had criminal records or were caught in the act of committing another crime.When officials with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reviewed Hunter Bidens gun application several years ago, they believed the case most likely would have been dropped if the target were a lesser-known person  because the gun had not been used in a crime and Mr. Biden had taken steps to get and stay sober, according to a former law enforcement official familiar with the situation.[The Gun Charges Against Hunter Biden Are Unusual.

Most negotiate deals that include probation and enrollment in programs that include counseling, monitoring and regular drug testing.It is rare as a stand-alone, said John P. Fishwick Jr., who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 2015 to 2017. These charges are usually brought against convicted felons who illegally possess a gun or who commit a violent or drug-related charge.Prosecutions for lying to a dealer are relatively rare, averaging?[fewer than 300 per year](https://archive.ph/o/XkhpL/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22015885-glenn-kessler-records-re-922a6-prosecutions). There were some 25 million to 30 million background checks performed annually around the time of Mr. Bidens gun purchase, according to statistics?[obtained by The Washington Post](https://archive.ph/o/XkhpL/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/09/lying-atf-gun-purchase-form-yields-few-prosecutions-new-data-shows/).Charges of illegal firearms possession are much more common. But they too are most often used as an add-on, to leverage plea deals or to ensure that a defendant is convicted on at least one charge if there are doubts that they will be convicted on an underlying charge, Mr. Fishwick and other former prosecutors said.In May, for example, when?[more than 20 people](https://archive.ph/o/XkhpL/https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/multiple-defendants-sentenced-or-enter-guilty-pleas-federal-firearms-charges)?in Savannah were sentenced to from 10 months to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to illegal firearms possession, all of them had criminal records or were caught in the act of committing another crime.When officials with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reviewed Hunter Bidens gun application several years ago, they believed the case most likely would have been dropped if the target were a lesser-known person  because the gun had not been used in a crime and Mr. Biden had taken steps to get and stay sober, according to a former law enforcement official familiar with the situation.[The Gun Charges Against Hunter Biden Are Unusual.

The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Courts decision. This decision deals a devastating blow to reproductive freedom in the United States. It will have an immediate and irreversible impact on the lives of people across the country. And it will be greatly disproportionate in its effect C with the greatest burdens felt by people of color and those of limited financial means.  The ability to decide ones own future is a fundamental American value, and few decisions are more significant and personal than the choice of whether and when to have children. Few rights are more central to individual freedom than the right to control ones own body. The Justice Department will use every tool at our disposal to protect reproductive freedom. And we will not waver from this Departments founding responsibility to protect the civil rights of all Americans.https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s","title":"CMV: Gorsuch is as good or better of a SC justice as Garland would have been"},{"text":"Love her! ??https://preview.redd.it/12xat0wncc4e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e766e6e51d74de7e69731ac2bbfbc57125d08a6a[https://x.com/Acyn/status/1863397315807170964?t=L7lzD6D0xM7jA1vqMZVL3Q&amp;s=19](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1863397315807170964?t=L7lzD6D0xM7jA1vqMZVL3Q&amp;s=19)","title":"Cue the MAGA global meltdown! ??"},{"text":"Lying to obtain a firearm is a serious crime.It's shocking how many people condemn the illegal conduct of Trump and excuse this bullshit.","title":"Biden Pardons His Son Hunter Despite Saying He Wouldnt"},{"text":"Can't wait for Trump to say a Democrat's pardon doesn't matter because reasons.","title":"Joe Biden pardons Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Wtf why would you want fauci to be pardoned.

This is because COVID-19 was new at the time and there was no data.However, we all know that we should not be standing near those with an infectious disease.Its true that scientists now know that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, spreads through a mixture of large and small dropletsincluding extremely tiny?[airborne droplets called aerosols](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-coronavirus-spreads-through-the-air-what-we-know-so-far1/)?that can travel farther than six feet. And the six-foot rule was never really characterized as a precise threshold for stopping exposure to the virus. But the notion that distancing was not based on any science is simply not accurate: the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person drops the farther one is from that person because the concentration of the virus gets diluted by the surrounding air. And like many respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread by larger droplets from coughs or sneezes: these drops tend to fall to the ground relatively quickly, and six feet of distancing was widely seen by experts as a reasonable benchmark for avoiding that type of exposurea recommendation that was fairly easy to remember and estimate by eye.[The Science Behind COVID's Six-Foot Rule | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/marjorie-taylor-greenes-attacks-of-fauci-over-covids-six-foot-rule-not-based/)Only a moron who thinks horse dewormer is a cure for COVID would want to convict Dr. Fauci for this.","title":"Biden Pardons His Son Hunter Despite Saying He Wouldnt"},{"text":"Of course he did.

This mode of critique disrupts the illusion of naturalness or inevitability that power structures depend on, making space for alternative ways of thinking and being.

This would be done with private agreements via contract in a libertarian scenario, not with the State.
