Im not familiar enough with the Trump ruling, but if the U.S. Supreme Court reached all the way back to British common law origins to substantiate the presidents role against the legislature, South Koreas president could be referring to that. The president could also be using the U.S. as an example of one of the oldest and more established common law countries and how they interpret the powers of the president there.Edit: I see SK is civil law so the argument is probably less persuasive or applicable.

Gavin Newsom issued an executive order on Friday attempting to limit access to ultra-processed foods, a directive he cast as a continuation of Californias nation leading nutrition and health standards.

California has been a leader for years in creating healthy and delicious school meals, and removing harmful ingredients and chemicals from food. Were going to work with the industry, consumers and experts to crack down on ultra-processed foods, and create a healthier future for every Californian. The order directs state agencies to develop recommendations to limit the health harms of ultra-processed foods and calls for proposals to reduce the purchase of candy, soda and other unhealthy foods made with synthetic dyes or additives by recipients of government food benefits. The move comes weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office for his second term, with iconoclastic former environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, but he has been a vocal critic of ultra-processed foods and promised to radically overhaul the countrys food system. Food dyes, pasteurized milk and seed oils are among the common items he has criticized, sometimes making health claims that are not backed up by science.","title":"Newsom aims to limit unhealthy food in California, getting ahead of Trump administration and RFK Jr."},{"text":"He's an idiot.","title":"Steve Scalise bizarrely blames 'DEI' and 'wokeness' for New Orleans terror attack"},{"text":"Did they blame the price of eggs on Biden for being president, like he sits in the Oval Office each morning deciding how much eggs should cost, or were any/many of them actually looking at the possible causes in terms of the farms affected by bird flu that had to get new machines or additional drugs to keep chickens healthy, and that maybe the government could have done more to stop the spread of the disease?

Not to say other countries do not have these values as, again, I cannot speak from experience, but it is very evident that generally European, white, countries are based upon democracy and equality, while countries based upon very different cultures might not be.?\\nThis means that white countries are generally the countries that actually recognize racism as an issue, while I cannot speak for other countries on that, but apparently it is not as much.Secondly, white countries are generally the most developed countries. In less developed countries, there is generally less attention to racism, as it is usually a minor issue compared to other problems. For example, India, which I have read somewhere to be the most racist country (although I cannot verify this, and feel free to correct me), is generally not a very well-developed country, with big flaws in its democracy. A direct result of this is almost no attention towards racism.Lastly, white countries have experienced some of the worst racism (the holocaust, slave trade), which we have agreed upon to be horrific events. Although other countries have also experienced genocide, not in all cases has it been agreed upon to be something negative.

Let me break down why.First, youre way off about military capabilities. The U.S. military absolutely dwarfs Chinas in terms of combat experience, technology, and power projection. The U.S. has 14,000 military aircraft versus Chinas 2,800, and the U.S. planes are far more advanced. Americas nuclear arsenal is over 7 times larger than Chinas, 3,700 warheads versus around 500. Sure, China has more missiles, but quantity isnt everything.Your manufacturing argument misses some key points too. While China makes more stuff overall, they seriously lag in advanced military manufacturing. Most Chinese factories make consumer goods, not weapons. The U.S. actually has better military manufacturing know how, when you need complex injection molded parts or precision machining for weapons, America has the edge. Chinas manufacturing advantage is mainly in cheap consumer goods, not advanced military hardware.The morale argument is just wrong. China hasnt fought a real war in decades. Their military has zero combat experience. Meanwhile, U.S. forces are battle tested. In a real conflict, China would face what Iraq did in the Gulf War, their massive but inexperienced military getting decimated by superior U.S. technology and tactics.You also ignore Americas biggest advantageallies. The U.S. has five major treaty allies in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, Thailand) with military bases spread throughout the region. China has...North Korea? U.S. allies are increasing defense spending and strengthening ties specifically because they fear China. In any conflict, China would be completely isolated.The Nazi Germany comparison is backwards. China is the one with quantity over quality, while the U.S. has both. America outspends China militarily by a huge margin and leads in critical areas like AI, quantum computing, and aerospace. Chinas military modernization is impressive but theyre still decades behind in key areas.Your view seems based more on headlines than hard facts. The reality is that Chinas military, while improving, still cant challenge U.S. dominance. They know this too, its why they focus on regional capabilities rather than trying to match America globally. A war would be devastating for both sides, but Americas advantages in technology, experience, alliances and power projection mean China isnt close to winning one.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"You mean the bottom line of their billionaire-run companies isn't the same as the economic well-being of the entire country?

But I do think its important to call a spade a spade  a lot of the ignorance is folks voting for bad, racist, fascist things because theyre ignorant to the history and context of those things. Yes, I am talking about people who are largely checked out and not plugged in like you and I. I know a ton of checked out people who voted for Trump.

They do not care what that change is or if it benefits them just that if things are bad for them then they will roll the dice and try something new. For many the economic issues of the age (rising prices, general poor prospects for owning a home, and general feeling of not getting ahead) all of these things would push someone to vote for change because the see the current situation is not benefiting them. Its why people see Bernie and Trump in similar ways both were the change candidates during the same period in different sides of the spectrum 1 just so happened to win a primary and the other lost. Harris was weighted down by Biden and by coming out and saying she would carry on Bidens policies and change little she completely handicapped herself as an agent of change. Once that happen the election becomes do you want stuff to change or not Trump was a vote for change and Harris was a vote for no change and unless change is risky (like in a major war) or things are going great (see the Clinton or Reagan economy years) people will mostly vote for change.","title":"In the GOP Civil War over Immigration, Both Sides Are Racists"},{"text":"I feel like this is a trick question.

We should not be thinking about their in-fighting as them about to crumble or being dysfunctional, we should think about it as them constantly climbing a collapsing ladder that does not have an endpoint. That instability is how they draw in their ruling members and how they entice power hungry people into staying on a perpetually sinking ship of hatred. The constant rotation of hateful power is integral to fascism and far right ideology. When you have power that can slip in and out of peoples fingers you get a lot of manipulative bastards joining forces because they share a common goal of spreading their hate onto the world and it becomes tangible for anyone in the clique to seize power. That cycle of enticement is what keeps beasts like this moving and keeps distractions on being out for blood. The in-fighting is a formality, and how this party remains more dangerous than people realize.

It is about hope.  Everyone who voted for Trump still voted for a guy who tried to violently retain power.  Even if Trump had been a perfect angel for the preceding 4 years, even if things really had been better for America during those 4 years, this is such fucking nonsense that Trump getting a second term is a demonstration of failure at every single fucking level.Ignorance is the default state.  And the tricky part is the way you find out youre ignorant is by becoming less ignorant.  Ignorance of some of the weird minutiae of Trumps bullshit, like making military vehicles refuel somewhere he profits from?  Thats not a crime.  And, look, keeping track of everything this asshole has said and done since 2015 is EXHAUSTING.  My mental is worse than its ever been because Im re-enacting that William Shatner Twilight Zone episode.  Screaming about the self dealing and corruption and racist shit and people just dont seem to give a fuck.  But I understand not plugging in to that degree.  I get not following each and every action.  This is innocent enough.Things are not helped by the Fox News types.  Weve got a lot of people being told by people who wear the veil of legitimacy that Trumps crimes are either entirely made up by people playing politics or not nearly as extreme as the left pretends they are.  Ignorance of the truth when you are being actively lied too is, again, the default state.  You and I, who are plugged in at levels that are hazardous to us, know those sources are bullshit, but the only way you find that out is by fact checking.  And most people do not know how to do that.  Theyll search for confirmation, not disproof, theyll find millions of other sources paid by the same bad actors to give the same bad facts and assume consensus.  Or theyll write off one side arguing from verifiable reality and another arguing from made it the fuck up and write it off as partisan disagreement.  These people are victims.Now, there are those that are willfully ignorant.  Theyve got a world view they like and actively avoid anything that makes them question it.  These are the assholes screaming woke every time theyre confronted with a perspective that isnt their own reflected back towards them.  If they follow up on the lies told by Right Wing News, its explicitly to find more supporting evidence.  These people are making a conscious, deliberate choice and should be held accountable for that.Throw in the people who hear all of Trumps nastiness, say wow, just like me and thats the Trump electorate.Since he got in, Ive seen a lot of doom posting about how America having 77 million Nazis prowling the streets.  And, look, as Ive said so many times before, you break bread with a guy you know is a Nazi for any purpose other than changing his world view, youre a Nazi.  I dont care how good the conversation is or how many good jokes they know.  Pal around with Nazis, youre a Nazi, even if only by results.But not everyone who voted for Trump even (if the buyers remorse articles Ive seen are any indication) seems to have realized what they were voting for.  Results based reasoning, Trump still got in, and thats the harm we need to be minimizing, but America does not have 77 million Nazis.  Some portion of that is people who were just massively under informed.  Some of those are people who were lied to.  The correct number of Nazis is zero, and even if ONLY Trump shared his beliefs, that would be one person too many.  But some portion of those that voted for him can be reached out to, they can be given better information, they can be given information.  The misinformation paragraph above is a problem with a solution.  Some of those people who voted for Trump are good people making a bad decision, and the moment we give up on reaching them and bringing them over to the side of angels, we push them deeper into Trumps base.If youre queer, or black, or a woman, if Trumps economic policies threaten your livelihood, you do not owe Trump voters forgiveness.  Im not saying that you need to have weekly dinners with your aunt that keeps buying you dresses and refers to you with some nonexistent womans name.  But it is important to know that there arent 77 million just like her, there arent 77 million just like Trump, and that some of those 77 million can still be brought over to the resistance BEFORE things go too far.","title":"In the GOP Civil War over Immigration, Both Sides Are Racists"},{"text":"Honestly, if that really is the feeling in this country, maybe well get to see our first president removed from office.

Liberals own mainstream broadcasts because they happen when the broadcast decides they happen. People are busy, so they don't have time to set aside for long content at a specific time.

Podcasts can be played when people have time for them and can be started and stopped and started again later, so people have time to digest and understand the content as well as think about it in between sessions. Therefore podcasts lend themselves better to conservative ideas. This is why Rush Limbaugh dominated talk radio. His topics all fit within a person's 30 minute lunch break strung out over 3 hours so all American time zones had a chance to listen to one complete topic while reading in their car.

China had one-child policy for decades. You think parents are enthusiastic about their only boy being sent off to go fight a war.. especially against the USA? Think about it.

China relies largely on russia for its oil, at this time. And **war requires lots of oil**, especially if you intend on transporting millions of fighters and supplies across the Pacific Ocean. And if china even tried to, well just interrupt their oil supply chain from their rear. So lets just be honest, it would be the other way around. China gets invaded.The US navy begins by blockading chinas coastlines along the pacific, south china sea &amp; sea of japan. Yellow river and others leading to ocean. And **war requires lots of money**, especially if you intend on fighting superior military. So this blockade ALONE will restrict chinas commercial trade ports, making it difficult for china to continue financing a war. Meanwhile : American military personnel and supplies will start being delivered in great numbers building up in taiwan, japan, south korea, philippines and malaysia, awaiting orders to prepare for amphibious &amp; paramilitary invasion of proc mainland. Dont worry, well bring our own oil. We got plenty. We kinda produce a lot of the stuff actually.

Is it actually a fantasy? Because we truly didn't see the Allies fielding jets and rocket planes in combat at numbers. Nor we saw them shooting ballistic missiles over hundreds of kilometres. The answer is yes. It is a myth and we will list a few reasons why.Which is only the beginning of a number of long comments elaborating on exactly how German aerial technological superiority is overstated, as well as branching out into other realms of technology such as tanks, and also discussing the practical limitations even in cases where there was clear technological superiority (such as the V-2, which was indeed far beyond Allied ballistic missile tech, but was still incredibly inaccurate and not cost-effective).  There are also links to yet more threads discussing these and related topics in detail.r/AskHistorians doesn't allow answers to be short and lacking detail and nuance for a reason: too much understanding is lost when trying to boil down complex subjects to a couple sentences.

Many of the skeptics come from the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, which has spent the last year pushing their leaders to curtail government spending, or else.To win the gavel on Friday, Johnson needs 218 votes if all House lawmakers are present and voting for a speaker candidate by name. Because of the resignation of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida) last month, House Republicans will start the year with just 219 seats, meaning Johnson can afford to lose just one GOP vote. Rep.

I feel like the full report (it's on foreign and security policy) would interest you a lot, check it out: https://da.uni.gl/media/4bwb5ict/survey-report-leander_ackre-n_final.pdfAnd interesting statistic is [Figure 3](https://i.gyazo.com/6c67ea4d65a2b3c80997c3f5b2f3edc1.png), which covers cooperation with other countries and organisations, in which you'll see that Greenlanders would like to cooperate less with the US compared to 2021. To be fair, the trend of lower enthusiasm for cooperation is visible across the board with nearly all large countries on the list (the US, China, UK and Russia), but it still doesn't support the idea that Greenlanders would join the US in a referendum. And keep in mind that this report was conducted back in spring 2024, so way before all this new rhetoric from Trump.You'll also notice that Canada is one that hasn't declined by as much, and is not only more popular than the US, but the top country overall too (with Iceland). Denmark is also the country that has declined the least, and the EU is the only entry on the list where enthusiasm for cooperation has actually increased. Also, I have to be honest and say that your account activity can come across as very suspicious to a lot of people. You were only ever active in anime subreddits, before having no activity for 4 months into suddenly creating 9 posts and writing literally hundreds of comments about Greenland for the last 5 days.Anyways, the report should interest you greatly considering this is your new-found passion!","title":"CMV: Trump is right about Greenland acquisition being a necessity to the United States of America.

I'm fortunate to get Medicare after working my way up to SSDI. I'm now working for myself and it's going really well. But I require my parents' financial support, bc most psych providers don't take Medicare. It's only bc I've been able to receive the right treatment that I am now able to be so productive. If we made Medicare for ALL and raised the reimbursement rates, we could require all providers to take it and finally give us mental health parity.Additionally, America is supposed to be the land of opportunity and innovation, but so many people are unable to pursue new businesses and opportunities bc they are tied to their job for health insurance. If we have universal health insurance, people could be empowered to quit their jobs to create new businesses and ultimately create more jobs and products and services and fuel the economy more. Employers should like not having to pay for health insurance.

We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality.\\" C Robert Anton WilsonThe idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation biasthe human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the \\"one true objective reality\\", each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

The first point is that you are free to say nearly anything you want to anyone you want for any reason you want in public. So, responding to something someone says in public is obviously permitted, but presumably thats not what you mean. What youre asking is whether or not it is a social norm and would be viewed as acceptable by others. The answer to that is going to depend on the situation. Id draw a distinction. First there is a person truly declaring something for those who are present, as a public statement of some sort, in the sense that theyre speaking to the room. That definitely invites public comment. The person has inserted themselves into a space and attempted to get everyones attention. They should be prepared that some of those people may respond to that. But the scenario you offer isnt like that. The speaker is making a statement to one other person in particular, and you just happen to be standing there. So, by responding to them it is actually you who is inserting yourself into the situation in order to get *their* attention. They werent seeking your attention. So, in that case, youre free to insert yourself and attempt to get a conversation going with them. But theyre also perfectly free to refuse to engage with you, which is basically what the person did in your scenario. I wasnt talking to you didnt mean that it was wrong for you to respond because that violates some social rule. It was them saying I dont want to talk about this with you at this time. Thats their right, they dont owe you an ongoing conversation in the line at a coffee shop.","title":"CMV: If you make a statement out loud in public, you invite comment."},{"text":"My politics normally: I just think that Trumpism is a fundamental threat to our democracyMy politics during the Speaker vote today: If Massie, Spartz, and Gosar have the courage to do whats right, they can save this country!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 3, 2025"},{"text":"Just tell him the brown guy was here on H1B visa.","title":"Trump Maintains He Was Right About New Orleans Terror Attack After Wrongly Insisting It Was Tied To Immigration"},{"text":"Good thing all the Arabs stuck it to Kamala by choosing not to vote.","title":"Steve Scalise bizarrely blames 'DEI' and 'wokeness' for New Orleans terror attack"},{"text":"First of all, theyre wind turbines.","title":"Trump calls to 'open up' North Sea, get rid of windmills"},{"text":"Would you feel the same way if one of your relatives had been killed?

As in a cult, the willingness to repeat lies is a show of loyalty to the leader, proving his power over his followers and strengthening it by further disconnecting them from reality. The supplicants typically believe they are empowered by shamelessly lying. Just look at Johnson's ever-present smirk. Trump's followers receive his lies as an intoxicating promise: that they, too, can be released from the duty to be honest. That they, too, can claim reality is whatever they want it to be, and relish how much it \\"triggers\\" the liberals to keep insisting on a lie in the face of countervailing evidence.\\n \\n For GOP leaders, there are rewards in being disinformation parrots, as evidenced by Johnson securing his speakership with a Trump endorsement this week. But that example also shows the dangers. Johnson's power is largely an illusion, dependent entirely on the mercurial whims of his master. If Trump decides tomorrow that he's displeased with Johnson's supplication, he can call for the end of Johnson's career, and congressional Republicans will immediately throw the speaker out.","title":"New year, same Trump: MAGA pounces on New Orleans tragedy to spread disinformation"},{"text":"Can MAGA take the trash out already?","title":"Trump calls to 'open up' North Sea, get rid of windmills"},{"text":"Why not link the vid?","title":"Theory: Both NOLA &amp; Trump Vegas Drivers Were Already Dead, The Electric Trucks Were Remote Driven By US/Israeli Intelligence"},{"text":"Link the vid...","title":"Theory: Both NOLA &amp; Trump Vegas Drivers Were Already Dead, The Electric Trucks Were Remote Driven By US/Israeli Intelligence"},{"text":"Reagan emptied out the asylums.

They had superior tactics - which the USA might, also, as its military apparatus has been more sophisticated, for longer - but the myth of Nazi technological superiority has been post-facto generated to, among other things, explain the rational for operation paper clip.Not really. They had better tech in plenty of regards, they just largely lacked the ability to manufacture it. I am not talking about unmanufactured weapons but the stuff they actually made.  Operation Paper Clip for instance was over the V2 rocket, and the V2 rocket was truly unparalleled. ...but they didnt have the resources to manufacture rockets in large enough quantities to do anythingThe T34 was hardly a technical marvel either, the Nazis could have manufactured those at any time. They were in strategic alliance with Rheinmetal setting up the Butast shell company in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1941 specifically for involvement for tank weapons systems. The T34 was a pretty simple tank too. But the Nazis had a different mindset for producing the tanks - higher quality less in number - and the T34 was largely only a program in the Soviet Union due to American support - most of the fuel for the T34 came from the USA up into the end of the war, a large chunk of the steel came from the USA, and they didnt actually make that many until the later years of the war so the American lend-lease program was necessary to defend the supply chains to get the program going. The Germans had massive steel and fuel shortages, a tank based around producing as many as possible as fast as possible is fundamentally based around a plentiful supply of steel, so it just wasnt a viable idea for the Germans. If you want to see the practical level of difference in technical ability, go look at the sheet metal stamping on the M3 grease gun vs the STG44. The Russians only started doing stamped receivers on AK47s in 1957 despite that being the intent since 1947, and that is a much simpler stamping than the STG44.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"More that California Law keeps them acting on it.","title":"GOP just Killed Net Neutrality... but California saved it."},{"text":"Have you got a link?","title":"Theory: Both NOLA &amp; Trump Vegas Drivers Were Already Dead, The Electric Trucks Were Remote Driven By US/Israeli Intelligence"},{"text":"DonQuixote?","title":"Trump calls to 'open up' North Sea, get rid of windmills"},{"text":"*Pinkerton enters the chat*","title":"Trump points to Gilded Age to push tariffs.

A lot of the time we do the programming on military reservations with people from Langley. Demerol is key for a lot of the programming, but we do have a variety of applications to choose from chemical wise. It's roughly 25 minutes for each dose, since that's the effective time period for the segments of programming that we do. We make them repeat back the phrases word-perfect, otherwise we won't have the control we need and desire. They need to get it right.

We can induce as many alters as we need for as many programs that we need. It's easy to access them once the programming has been completed.

Its a risk that Im personally briefing the incoming team on, Mr Sullivan said, adding that he had consulted with US ally Israel.He said that given Irans weakened state, Mr Trump could also persuade Iran to commit to dismantling its nuclear capacity.The president-elect is reportedly?considering airstrikes on Irans nuclear facilities?when he returns to the White House later this month.Mr Trump has told Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, in recent calls that he is concerned about Iran achieving nuclear capability,?The Wall Street Journal reported.Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, Mr Trumps nominees for secretary of state and national security adviser, have consistently taken hardline stances on Iran.Mr Netanyahu has long called for Irans nuclear programme to be stopped in its tracks but has faced resistance from Israeli military officials and Washington.**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/02/biden-discussed-plan-strike-iran-nuclear-trump-inauguration/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/02/biden-discussed-plan-strike-iran-nuclear-trump-inauguration/)","title":"Joe Biden 'discussed plans to strike Iran nuclear sites before Donald Trump's inauguration'"},{"text":"The UK is an immigration based country?

It almost looks intentional, except that the US has such a huge and diverse patchwork of education systems, mostly locally governed and administered that we'll never be able to pinpoint how the large scale degradation happened. It's not just money either because some school districts spend quite a bit per student and still the average is dismal (even as the the gap between the top and bottom level increases). I used to put the onus of the blame on the university education departments, some of which have been truly off the chart in stupidity (just check out that new New math rubbish that several states have been pushing and /or what they call \\"discovery science\\").Still, we CAN see some patterns. Here's the key conundrum: study after study has shown a strong correlation between parental education level and children's school achievement. It's almost 1 to 1. And higher educational level correlates, in turn with higher socio-economic standing, hence the add'l correlation between parental wealth/income and educational achievement.So the failure of education overall really boils down to the endemic, ever increasing inequality in this country. One that cannot be remedied without tackling the inequities of the Capitalist system we are under.","title":"Why all the Musk hate!

It could really help recoup his reputation among those who condemn him for his actions following the January 6 insurrection. You add to that the assassination attempts against Trump and them calling the murder of the Health Insurance CEO an attack on terrorism and Trump has the opportunity here to really make a decision that will boost his popularity rating among all voters. Either way I think it's going to be media circus for the next 4 years ... cause that's what Trump does best.

Imagine spending your life interacting with people of colour and learning about how not to be racist and your country's atrocious history of racism and still KNOWINGLY being racist, to various extents, even to hating them so much that you intentionally hunt them down to kill them. The worst and most violently hateful racists are definitely found in one of these countries. But because of education, the least racist person is also most likely found in one of these countries. Racism is systematic in western countries like the US, from school systems (ex. black students getting disciplined more harshly, racist enrollment practices), systems of justice (police brutality, judges' discriminatory sentencing etc), workplace (ex. overrepresentation of white people in places of power), healthcare (ex. poorer care of POC patients), government policies (ex. lots) media representations (ex. using the word terrorist for Middle Easterners but not for white people) and on a day-to-day basis (ex. normalization of racist jokes, mockery of other cultures) - it ranges from racist microaggressions (very common) to much worse. Western countries and racists alike want to present as not racist and humanitarian but that just means people hide their racism better and it just shows in less obvious ways. Just because no one's turning POC away at the door and being racist in obvious ways doesn't mean a country/its people are less racist.Racism found in non-western and racially homogenous countries largely involve believing in diluted stereotypes that trickled down from western media since they have had no reason really to organically come up negative beliefs about certain racial groups, since these groups do not really live in their country and most people have never interacted with nor will they ever interact with a person of those racial groups. It's ignorance about how to respectfully interact with people of other races including navigating topics that might be sensitive, not being aware of the inaccuracies of stereotypes, not knowing what constitutes racism. Many of them are like blank slates and will never even think about what someone of those other racial groups is like, because why would they need to? Sure, it's not all ignorance and there are definitely those with the intention to be racist, but it's FAR from being a widespread systematic issue as you say. How can it be systematic (i.e. racism found in institutions and policies affecting an entire society) when these places barely have any people of those races? They don't have anti-racism laws not because they are more racist, but there's no systematic need for those laws. At the end of the day, it would be very rare to find full on HATE in these countries. Many of your examples could be attributed to xenophobia or simply not knowing how to deal with foreigners. Your view isn't very nuanced, and is based on rather limited anecdotes and interpretations that skew in favour of your view.Just because a government has anti-racist policies doesn't mean a country is not racist. Canada has anti-racist policies but continues to treat its Indigenous people HORRIBLY. Just because a government does something against a minority group (ex. China) doesn't mean it's something that its citizens widely agree upon - isn't it known that Chinese citizens don't get a say when it comes to government decisions? And in this case it's not about racism but about political control. Japan is notoriously a closed culture (with xenophobic leanings), and for the rare places that turn away foreigners, they turn away ALL foreigners including white people. It's often because they are worried about having to speak English. A western country accepting immigrants doesn't mean it's less racist, western countries are predominantly capitalist - for an economy to grow, more workers are neededYour own post exposes racist microaggressions (showing how casual and common racism can be in western countries - they add up over time): \\n1) Lumping together all \\"non-white\\" countries as if these countries of very different histories, cultures, policies, government systems, social values and racial makeup can be lumped together and treated as one\\n2) Calling countries like the US, Canada and Australia \\"white\\" countries when they have never been white countries. It just perpetuates this idea that POC citizens are not a full part of these countries when they very much are full and equal citizens\\n3) Using limited anecdotes that don't portray a whole or realistic view to back what appears to be your own need to view white people as better and less racist than POC countries","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"Misreading?

Second, if a stranger says \\"I wasn't talking to you\\" generally unless you think they're actually threatening or harassing someone, you should definitely disengage. Failure to do so is probably the moment when you are breaking \\"civility,\\" and refusing or blatantly missing a clear \\"social cue.\\" There are a few exceptions here. The first being the aforementioned harassment. If you're in a public place and someone is making racist / sexist / threatening comments to an employee or another patron, yeah you have some justification to step in and challenge them. It might even be your civic duty depending on the situation. Also, I'll give you another situation where let's say you're at a gas station and you overhear one person ask for directions and another person give those directions, but the person giving the directions is just plain old  incorrect. It's not a terrible thing to chime in and say \\"hey you know I live around here or whatever, you really want to take this street or that street instead.\\" Or something similar. Be polite but. If it's a factual question and it's being discussed loudly in public it's not the worst thing to weigh in. Again it might even be welcomed. Key here is that just because you hear someone say something out loud, it doesn't mean that they are obligated to engage in a conversation with you on the topic to your satisfaction.","title":"CMV: If you make a statement out loud in public, you invite comment."},{"text":"Were not MAGA for fucks sake.

Most of them have colonial histories and nowadays more open to immigrants. White people there have long histories of dealing with different races, but East Asians are not like that. In East Asia, people are not supposed to interact with faces that look \\"foreign\\" or speak foreign language if they just stick to their own communities.There are different types of racism in East Asia (I'm from Hong Kong so the examples are mostly focused on Chinese):1. Chauvinism / extreme nationalism\\nThis is actually a global thing, but nowadays explicitly expressing white supremacy is a taboo in the West. While in HK, Chinese History textbooks are full of Han centricity and chauvinism. Students are taught that the historical foreigners around Han regime were all savages, unless they were sinicized. Due to westernised mind, young people in HK rarely give a fuck to this kind of Chinese centric shit, but extreme nationalism is still popular in China.2. Inferiority of dark skin\\nTraditionally, East Asians see light skin as an important part of human beauty. They wouldn't enjoy being tanned if they can choose to stay at home to avoid sunlight, especially females. They may even call the relatively south ethnic people as monkeys, such as Northern Chinese to Cantonese, or Chinese to Southeast Asians. Plus the influence of white countries, and the impression of Southeast Asia being less developed. That's why both whites, blacks, Indians are foreign but they are usually treated differently.3. National feuds\\nAs I have said, extreme nationalism is still popular in China. Mainland Chinese nowadays still periodically make use of the historic feuds decades ago to spread hatred. Mostly against Japan, but USA, UK, South Korea, Vietnam, Philippines are also commonly hated by a lot of Mainland Chinese for some reasons.As I have observed from my hometown, despite being a well known international financial centre for many years like NYC and London, it is not as diverse as Westerners may expect. Ordinary HKers barely interact with anyone not with Chinese descent. There have been more South Asians in recent years, but they are not likely to be able to integrate with the major demographic. It's still common that Chinese locals intentionally avoid interaction with them, or even hate them. Even for first generation HK immigrants in Western countries, their communities are in general more conservative and less conscious about racial issues than other demographic.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"You wouldnt believe it, but a lot of work that skilled tradesmen get is from when white collar duds try their hand at renovations, plumbing or electrical work.Me?

If the comment could be seen as rude/offensive, especially when about those around them and/or loud, like \\"ugh, these Mexicans are always so disruptive\\" or \\"god, I hate people dressed like that\\", I would say they are inviting comment. Don't dish it if you can't take it, and all that.However, if the comment is simple personal preference, like \\"eh, I don't think I want Chinese food tonight\\" or \\"I personally like that plushie more\\", and especially if it's relatively quiet, then I think it'd be rude to try to argue with them. Imagine, for example, if a couple was discussing their upcoming wedding plans at a cafe. Just because they're there quietly discussing who to invite doesn't mean they are inviting those around them into a discussion.This is a spectrum, of course, and even benign comments about current events, especially controversial/divisive ones, might illicit responses. But then you have to ask yourself why you're responding in the first place and how disruptive your own response is getting. A single comment on what was said is usually fine, but trying to engage this woman in a full debate could be what was considered rude. As a member of a minority who used to be constantly roped into arguments about said minority simply for existing, there are times when you just really don't want to debate about something, even casually. While the woman might have been a bit inconsiderate of others to bring up the topic, your attempts to debate her were obviously not something she wanted, and if the topic/comment is controversial enough to illicit comment, a continued discussion of the matter was likely making others around you guys uncomfortable. And let's be real, if the woman feels confident enough in her controversial opinion to voice it in a crowded public place, you aren't going to get her to see the flaws in her view from a simple two-minute conversation while the barista makes your coffees.","title":"CMV: If you make a statement out loud in public, you invite comment."},{"text":"You really dont know anything about me or my work, so youre speaking in a vacuum.  Im quite willing to pay above average and have gone as far as paying more than I make myself.  Ive got enough problems with my own accounting department because I *wont* cut corners.  If you think bringing someone in from Belgium or Germany is cheaper than hiring from the US, then you are an idiot.  I dont want or expect people fresh out of college to have *experience*.  I expect them to have a desire to learn.  College doesnt teach you to do the job.  If youre a graduate and think you know what your doing, then you are not simply a fool, youre a damned fool.  Nothing you experienced in class has you ready for a 3 year, $7MM project.  Hopefully, it *has* taught you **how** to think and given you the discipline to be an engineer or scientist.  What I *do* expect is your college years have given you the tools you need *in order to learn*.  And the humility to realize that.  Im over 60 and while Im still amongst the best in my industry segment, Im also at the age where I need to pass on what I know. The bottoms line is that where technical expertise is concerned, our universities cant give me the qualified entry level that I need.  Far too many graduates have a vastly over-inflated estimation of their worth compared to their peers that have put in some time in the business.  The biggest place where is find the kind of people I want has been people who are in their 30s and making a career change.  Theyre motivated, competent, **willing to learn**, and worth top dollar of the entry level price range.  Finally, I would suggest you learn a little bit about economics.  The *value* of labor - especially for the jobs I try to fill - is inherently high and that value hasnt changed in a very long time.  Nor is it going to.  A bunch of wet behind the ears kids demanding $120K for work whose actual value is more like $60-70K isnt a matter of being cheap but understanding the value of the job and the worker.  I want you to advance into that higher compensation, but the work and the employee have to both be worth it.  Otherwise, this is just another parallel to the minimum wage effing up the economy by driving pay rate inflation.  Oh and I would add that I have never farmed out a job to India and have no plans to.  Ive fought it tooth and nail for *years*.  A big part of that is that for other reasons I dont consider them qualified for the jobs I have, either.","title":"Do we like H1B now? I am confused"},{"text":"Yeah definitely.

You might not expect privacy - others might overhear you, but that doesn't mean you're invited. People have to exist in public. The idea that simply going into public invites others to comment on everything you say and do is a bit ridiculous. Remember, expression is more than just speech. The space is shared. That means everyone has a right to use it, but that doesn't mean you're all equally involved in everything going on there. And keeping in mind who something is directed at is appropriate. Just because you exist in the space doesn't mean it's directed at you.
