Time, what we know"},{"text":"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)By Adrian WalkerFor maybe a month, Vice President Kamala Harris seemed poised to win this election  maybe, handily.Democrats  so downtrodden after President Bidens disastrous June debate performance  suddenly had hope.Joy, even.But it wasnt to last. Instead, we are now left to reckon with the worst possible outcome.?[Trump II: The Revenge Tour](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/06/nation/donald-trump-president/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).The loss is not just Harriss. Its Americas.This country had an opportunity to finally put years of racism, misogyny, and division behind it. Instead, it chose to embrace it. Make no mistake, the haters won.How else to describe the appeal of a man who trashes women, people of color, and immigrants, and yet prevails?If Biden was the problem  and he certainly had become a problem  Harris looked like the solution. Overnight, she consolidated the party and energized the base. She raised hundreds of millions of dollars. She absolutely crushed Trump head-to-head on the debate stage.And, in the end, none of that mattered.Many will rush to attribute Harriss defeat to the sluggish economy, the apparently unbearable agony of high-priced eggs. Perhaps that is a piece of it, but I dont think it explains returning a president to office who might otherwise have been headed to prison.You can adopt the rhetoric of the GOP that Harris didnt fix the border problem. But entries through the border have been declining for a while.One might argue, more plausibly, that Harris erred by never putting any daylight between herself and Biden on any issue. Would she have done better if she had, say, decisively broken with Biden on Gaza? But that level of disloyalty clearly is not in her. She was, to the end, true to the man who put her in the position to run for president in the first place.None of those explanations work for me. What I see Wednesday is a nation that still cannot wrap its head around the idea of a woman president, much less a Black, Asian woman president.Harris couldnt break with being Kamala Harris. And, that, ultimately was her undoing.No one can say we dont know what were getting now. Donald Trump, the once and future president, no longer bothers to conceal his contempt for the rule of law. He neatly divides the world into supporters and the enemy within. He has absolutely no plans, no ideas, and no intention of governing for the good of the country. Hes solely in it for him.If you care about equity, or climate change, or education, or a womans bodily autonomy, good luck to you. Because Trump cares nothing about any of it, as he has made abundantly clear.Weve been here before, and not long ago. But that was before a Supreme Court Trump shaped ruled that a president really cant break the law. That was before the Republican Party had completely become a subsidiary of Trump Inc. That was before even billionaire media barons began to salute and get in line, as the once-mighty Washington Post did just recently.None of this is to say things are hopeless. The Democrats still have a chance at holding the House. More importantly, the millions of Americans who opposed the rise of this bully and buffoon will not just go away. The resistance is real, if understandably shaken today.But theres no getting around the notion that this is an inflection point. A man stood up and basically said, I plan to be a tyrant, and a majority of this country said, Fine.Dont tell me this isnt who we are, because its exactly who we are. Hes won twice.","title":"Kamala Harris didnt lose. America lost."},{"text":"Based on your username and photo, your brain has been irreversibly damaged by the mainstream media propagate.

We know the COVID vaccines were effective, but that lack of clarity in the public sphere allowed anti-vax and conspiracists to gain a foothold. In contrast, people are used to getting a yearly flu shot, and many have done so for their entire lives. People already have an understanding of how the flu shot works, that its only effective for certain strains, and that its very low risk. Hardcore anti-vax people will turn it down, but even folks who were skeptical of COVID vaccination will likely be ok with flu shots. Were also much better at quickly manufacturing flu shots, which means the massive social disruption we saw with COVID, which helped fuel public distrust and disinformation, is less likely with a flu pandemic.

Profoundely prophetic as well. These issues exist in Europe as well, the (centre-)left has no \\"story\\", just progressive policy proposals and without the support of civil society (in particular trade unions, which are declining anyhow), its an empty shell of itself. FDR had a New Deal, LBJ had a Great Society, Biden has a list of bills. In the Netherlands Den Uyl had Keerpunt '77, Timmermans has a green program.Regardless the article probably wont do too well here since its (rightfully) blaming neoliberal policies and thinking. My only fear is that building organisations from the ground up is basically impossible in the current age. Even looking at the history of my country - the Netherlands - there was a period where every ideological current had its own organisations; Catholics, Protestants, Socialists/Social Democrats and Liberals. This period is called verzuiling (\\"pillarisation\\") and is basically what this article is arguing for. Historians generally agree that the reason Dutch nazis did so badly compared to the rest of Europe was a direct result of pillarisation, which also shows that this article is right.Yet, 80 years later, all pillars have been broken down. First the protestant and catholic ones fused together in the late 70s and fell apart in the 2000s. Similarly, the Socialists reached their peak in the late 70s and then slowly broke apart, while the Liberal one was always the weakest one and since they also were against pillarisation (since they are in favour of individualism), they profited from depillarisation until the far-right was able to surge. There are still traces of pillarisation in Dutch society, the newspapers, organisations etc but they are not linked between each other and to larger movements anymore. My worry then is that people are not willing anymore to link themselves to organisations that have a clear slant because they dont want to be \\"associated\\" with them or worse yet be expected to behave a certain way. How can politicians change such expectations? Can they do that? I dont think so.","title":"The Death of Deliverism"},{"text":"Civil war wont help if trumps alreay in office.

Even when Joe Biden won in 2020, he won by a smaller margin than polls were generally predicting.In the post-mortem following those two previous elections, some polling experts thought that Trump was attracting voters who didn't consistently vote and so weren't sufficiently captured by pollsters as likely voters. Polling experts also talked about the possibility that a relatively large number of Trump voters are more suspicious of institutions, and that might carry over into less willingness to respond to polls. And polling experts said some Trump voters might be reticent to say they are planning to vote for Trump. The pandemic could also have factored into problems with 2020 because Democrats may have been more likely to stay at home and respond to polls.For the 2024 election, many polls tried to correct the previous undercounting, for example by adjusting polling results to take into account how people responding to polls say they voted in 2020. (It was a technique to try to make sure the polls were capturing a more realistic number of Trump supporters.) Some even thought the adjustments this time around could mean polls were now overestimating Trump support.What will the post-mortem on polling look like for the 2024 election?

I already pointed this out.Right the history does that. And like I said Zionism starts with the idea that they need to be eradicating natives as told by Herzl, jabotinsky, Ben Gurion etc. and Israel was founded on an ethnic cleansing. So the history is clear on that point. constantly under attack, it puts you on edge. Which makes you more likely to make mistakes.Ok let's agree on that. As I pointed out Palestinians are attacked more than Israelis so let's also dismiss all of your anti-Palestinian talking points. Because Palestinians are also allowed to make mistakes. But seriously these \\"mistakes\\" are not forgivable and become less so when it's a pattern of mistakes. If the IDF was moral these mistakes would not be tolerated. The story of hind Rajab is a great example. They knew they were killing a 6 year old girl. That is not a defensible mistake. Rachel Corree was knowingly run over by a bulldozer during a peaceful protest. That is not defensible. And they decided to put the Jews there. So are you agreeing with me? Israel only exists as a European colonialist plan. Israel needs to abandon its European history and embrace it's middle eastern history. The Jews were much safer and wealthier than they were in Europe. There was no Holocaust in the Ottoman empire; that was Europe.

Neoliberalism privatized risk, catalyzed alienation, and cultivated feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth for the 99 percent. But the fact that neoliberalism is a primary cause of unhappiness does not mean that the implementation of progressive, redistributive economic policies alone will lead to rising happiness. Bad economic policy has produced knock-on effects of increasing drug use, homelessness, and mental illnessrealities that have come to dominate the mental landscape of voters who nonetheless may not see economic policy as a source of solutions. There are many other related causes contributing to the unhappiness wave, including corporate social media, the impending sense of doom brought about by the climate crisis, and the social and cultural aspects of neoliberalism such as the dramatic decline of peoples attachment to institutions like work, unions, and churches. Loneliness and social isolation are major drivers of unhappiness. We are experiencing a crisis of what French sociologist mile Durkheim called anomie, or normlessness, arising from the dizzying pace of social, economic, political, and technological change in our times and the weakening of institutions that foster social cohesion.This is just generic \\"neoliberalism is bad\\"EDIT: also, pro unionbut it can support the rebuilding of social institutions, like community organizations and unions, that create opportunities for connection.

But right now my answer  as boring as it might sound  is that Harris didnt lose because she did something wrong. She lost because Biden is historically unpopular (58% disapproval rating); because the current America is on the right track number is historically low (just 26%); and because voters associated Trump with change.To illustrate this point, the political scientist John Sides charted presidential approval ratings in June of an election year  going all the way back to 1952  against the incumbent partys final share of the presidential vote a few months later. He found that Bidens paltry approval rating was consistent with the Democratic candidate  in this case, Harris  winning 48% of the vote.  \\n  \\nHarriss current share of the popular vote? 47.5%.This doesnt mean Harris ran a perfect campaign. And it certainly doesnt mean people will stop floating other explanations for why she lost. But as Sides?[tweeted Wednesday](https://x.com/johnmsides/status/1854194919310799239), Trumps gains were widespread, so explanations should start with the broadest factors  not with bespoke stories about states, cities, counties, and groups.I would add campaign strategy to that list.","title":"We are reporters from five newsrooms covering the 2024 election results.

NZ isn't perfect in the respects you mentioned but from an objective standpoint they are comparable to blue states.

Losing again. Yes, I voted for Hillary, Biden, then Harris.   \\n  \\nSome background. I immigrated here just under 25 years ago, gained citizenship just under 15 years ago. I work in higher education, I live in Texas.(might be moving, who knows?) I have been involved in polling, I have been an election volunteer, I go to local meetings, speak at my local boards. Before you read this. Some of it is obvious, but it's clear that our leadership hasn't gotten it through their thick skulls. We. need. to. change. The voting population is changing, so if the party is to survive and make the USA a more progressive place, we must take the longer road of winning back moderates again.   \\n  \\n!1. Stop treating young cis people like trash. There are so many that want to be allys but are off-put by the \\"#killallmen\\" type rhetoric. Allys come in a spectrum too, shitting on someone for being \\"not enough of an ally *yet*\\" pushes them away forever. !&lt;  \\n!2. Black Americans are not assured votes. A significant portion of the Black population are some combo of religious, gun-loving, and anti-immigration. !&lt;  \\n!3. Not all Latinos are ok with *illegal* immigration in particular, a big issue in this election, and being soft on it is losing votes. So many struggle to come here legally, just to have someone jump the line through some program that isn't open to them. Yeah, cool, this didn't feel great to me either. I watched people get their citizenship faster than me who came here illegally. Gotta tell ya, it is not a great look. !&lt;  \\n  \\nFor the sake of other issues we need to find a new platform that will be fucking popular. what do democrats going to do in the next few years preparing for midterms and the next presidential election?   1. Tougher platform on immigration, prepare to filibuster the fuck out of the fed, and actually pick a candidate through the primary system this time. It was perfectly legal to put Harris in the spot, but foolish. If we wanted her to be president so bad then Biden should have retired at midterm to give her a 2 whole years to earn the public's trust that way. Instead, she stayed in the invisible VP seat. what do democrats planning their top issues for the next decade?   1. Gun Control, reproductive freedom, and labor rights are still the path forward, in conjunction with a more popular (restrictive) position on immigration. With any luck, President Felonious Maximus will change things too quickly, people will feel the hurt, and push back hard. We need to be there to guide the pushback. and the most controversial one, what kind of presidential candidate are the dems looking for? its seems like america isnt yet ready to have a woman president.   1. Harris needs to never run again for federal office, first off. Help in the background. She is poison at this point. \\n   2. Pete fucking Buttigieg, or someone like him. Start looking at the Harris VP pick list. Kelly is another great option. Seriously, any one of them might have done better in the primary than Harris, but we will never know.

Not to mention all Bidens votes came in at 3am and were counted out of view from poll watchers.There were literally dozens of cases and testimonies about voter fraud, and they jailed the whistle blowers! Then threw out the cases without even hearing them on standing which means the whistle blowers should not be allowed to report, because they were not the ones hurt / effected by their voter fraud.(You cant legal report a crime for someone else. I cant go to the cops and tell them someone stole your car, and sue the thief)This is the logic the democrat appointed judges used to throw out all the voter fraud allegations and jail whistle blowers.Dems cheated 100%, people need to stop backing down on that, I respect Trump and JD Vance for never admitting Trump lost the whole election cycle and I hope they open a proper investigation into the 2020 election and the truth is revealed.","title":"Did 15-20 million democrats just stay home?

But the Supreme Court's July 1 presidential immunity ruling may also protect Trump from that risk. The conservative wing of the court ruled that Trump was absolutely immune from prosecution in his federal election interference case for his alleged conduct involving discussions with Justice Department officials. Maybe that means a president/former president can't be charged with obstructing justice for ordering the DOJ to drop a prosecution against him?Trump could also try to pardon himself in his federal criminal cases. Legal experts differ over whether that's allowed. The Supreme Court hasn't ever ruled on the issue.Those are two options Trump doesn't have in his New York and Georgia state criminal cases. But his election will still be good news for him on those fronts, too. Trump's lawyers can now argue that going forward in the Georgia case, or sentencing him on Nov. 26 in the New York case, is unconstitutional because it interferes with his responsibilities as president-elect and potentially later as president.??Because Trump is the first president-elect in this situation, we don't know how that argument about the state prosecutions would go. But the Supreme Court's immunity decision talks about not wanting the judicial branch to interfere with the executive branch. Trump's lawyers can say that means state courts shouldn't interfere with the presidency. And they can also point to a clause in the U.S. Constitution that says federal laws take precedence over state laws (the supremacy clause), and say that means state courts/prosecutors aren't allowed interfere with the presidency.C Aysha","title":"We are reporters from five newsrooms covering the 2024 election results.

The only group of conservative Democrats that lost their seats to other Democrats were pro-life Democrats in districts where you didn't need to be pro-life to win, because pro-choice voters saw the Trump administration and congressional Republicans coming after abortion rights and wanted someone who would actually fight to protect that right, and knew that they could safely get that person.---Or I guess perhaps there's a difference, that this article doesn't really get at, between the *voter* tent, and the *politician* tent. Has the voter tent shrunk? I mean it obviously did this election, through a combination of people flipping to Trump and Democratic voters not showing up. And so Democrats will need to run someone who can rebuild it, win them back, etc. But has the *politician* tent shrunk? I don't think it has. And if someone comes along and says \\"I can get those voters back and I'll have to make compromise X and Y to do it\\", Democratic primary voters have shown basically unlimited appetite for that.","title":"Matt Yglesias: A tale of two machines: Democrats need to stop shrinking the tent"},{"text":"Im Muslim and I can confirm","title":"A Democrat here.

Republicans started them back in 1980 with Reagan and they continue to win with identity politics. Republicans won't change because it still works for them.Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism.

They have no real power or real decision making abilities. Unfortunately, most American's don't have the slightest clue. Most Americans couldn't tell you the three branches of government, and don't care that Kamala has worked in all three. Trump played the fear card very well. He told people what he wanted them to believe, and they believed it. He scared the hell out of them and then put himself up as the only option to fix the fear he was creating. Its just a sales technique. He told them that Kamala failed at her job and they, the American's who follow Trump, are in no position to make an educated assessment of his statements so they just eat it up.

I'm not making a prediction, but I think we're closer than we've ever been to a victory in this area.I disagree with your view on Presidential immunity, however. It is the job of Congress and the courts to keep Presidents in line and this has always been a political matter; if Presidents feared criminal prosecution by the next administration (which, given the wide ideological swings we have experienced over the past few election cycles, isn't too far-fetched) they would be effectively paralyzed. Perhaps you think that is a good thing, but the President does have certain legitimate powers that he needs to be able to exercise.The Supreme Court did not rule that Presidents are above the law, only that actions taken in the course of their \\"core constitutional powers\\" have absolute criminal immunity and that other acts taken as part of a President's official duties carry a presumption of immunity.

While it reasonable to be concerned about the pandemic-causing potential of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, a pandemic from this virus is not inevitable.First, I would quickly summarize the main reasons to be worried: (1) H5N1 is extremely deadly in mammals, with a higher human case fatality rate than COVID-19, (2) H5N1 presently in dairy cows rapidly kills ferrets, the main animal model for studying influenza, even those inoculated with only a small infectious dose, (3) H5N1 is widespread in US dairy cows at the moment, and it's in wild birds all around the world, (4) prolonged transmission between mammals makes it more likely that the virus will acquire mutations that allow it to spread to humans, (5) the worst ever influenza pandemic, the 1918 \\"Spanish\\" flu, was caused by an avian lineage influenza A virus that spilled over into humans.However, before you freak out, there's some cause for optimism:(1) H5N1 was mostly confined Asia, but a particularly successful variant (clade 2.3.4.4b) spread to wild bird populations in Europe in 2020, North America in 2021, as well as the global south (even including Antarctica in 2024). Despite spreading really well among wild birds, especially waterfowl, H5N1 has so far caused only several isolated outbreaks in mammals, suggesting it may still be missing some properties that make it an ideal candidate to transmit between mammals, (2) humans already have adaptive immunity against influenza, as most of us have been exposed to H1N1 since it re-emerged in 2009, which offers some degree of protection, (3) anti-influenza drugs like oseltimivir (Tamiflu) work well at limiting virus replication and preventing severe disease if taken within 48 hours of symptom onset, (4) we know a lot about how to make flu vaccines, and even rapidly produce loads of mRNA flu vaccines in less than 12 months if there was an emergency, (5) so far human H5N1 cases haven't caused a high number of onward transmission events, suggesting that even those viruses in mammals have not yet got the right mutations to cause a human pandemic (although this one could potentially change).","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"The Women's Health sub has the fear mongering down pat with posts about having to get their tubes tied because if they have complications with their future pregnancies, they'll end up dying.

Theres also definitely some blame on the Democratic Party as a whole and how they handled the Biden situation and the subsequent placing of Harris.

I've heard it has a 54% case-fatality rate among humansDoesn't this basically disprove your point?H5N1 isn't very contagious, so even with a high case-fatality rate, it was barely a blip. Guessing that it will become more contagious in human is nothing more than a guess... it's not historically what's happened with bird flu variants. It's almost always transmitted from birds to humans that handle birds a lot. Human-to-human transmission is very uncommon. Also, it's not an airborne virus, mostly. It's almost entirely spread by fluids, which are much less likely to cause pandemics in industrialized countries. However: I am quite worried about our bird populations. It spreads rapidly in birds.

If voters vote, first and foremost, on their pocketbooks, then Biden (and then Kamala) had an uphill battle. And rightly so.These media moments are important, because they gave stark reminders of what was behind each side.  Simply replacing Biden with Kamala, after the primaries, told voters that their votes didn't really matter.  It also was an announcement that the Democrats were beholden to DEI-style racial politics.  And voters didn't like that.The Butler assassination attempt sent two messages: that the federal government was not serious about protecting the opposition candidate, but also that that candidate did not fear danger to his life.  As those agents gathered around him and were pushing him off the stage, Trump pumped his fist, called the American people to fight, and signaled that he was not afraid, and that we shoudn't be either.  It was a true call to the American people, and it was the one true image of the election.In my opinion, had Biden remained on the ballot, Trump not been literally shot, and the 2024 election progress without these moments, I'm of the mind that Trump would have won anyway.

If they were innocent and there was truly nothing to see then they would have wanted to talk about it because 1) it would have been a win for them to debunk Trump on the merits to his face in front of his supporters and 2) it would have reduced tensions in the country for people to feel their concerns were taken seriously instead of dismissed without any real investigation, media coverage, public debate, or trial on the merits. Transparency in elections is important if you actually believe in democracy, and they did everything to prevent transparency after 2020 which tells you all you need to know. People who think they are innocent do not act that way.They ignored sworn testimony under penalty of perjury and didn't even bother to look into it. The media declared immediately with nothing but blind assertions and argument from authority that it was \\"debunked\\" and \\"baseless\\". \\"We 'investigated' ourselves and found we did nothing wrong\\".What makes it even worse for elections is that we don't have access to a lot of info that only the government does and if they prevent access to it we can't verify claims from poll workers and validate integrity of the process. I personally still believe the main way they cheated in 2020 was with mail ballots and that if they properly ignored those with mismatched signatures as required by law the democrats would have easily lost. It's why to this day not a single state allowed us to check signatures after the one 100 ballot random sample the Arizona court ordered showed between 5% and 11% didn't match. The judge ruled that because the ballot still had personal info that matched the voter on it like their phone number that was enough... even though they didn't follow up to actually see if that person really voted, not to mention that's not the law. So yeah, 2020 was a joke and their response to our concerns about it is what should have given it away to anyone who was on the fence.","title":"Are you telling me a whooping 18 million Democrat voters stayed home this year, as opposed to 2020"},{"text":"The Obama clone you're looking for is called Josh ShapiroAnd he lives in Pennsylvania","title":"We need to clone Obama"},{"text":"I wish you lots of courage and I send you my best support from France.

I suggest you pick up a few good books on these fraught periods covering the aftermath of the Civil War and the Jim Crow era when thousands of blacks were lynched because they wanted to vote or efforts by Republicans to appease Adolph Hitler in 1939.

Fatality doesn't equate to higher incidence. So even if it is actually more deadly than COVID, that doesn't mean it will be a more widespread problem. Also, keep in mind that the primary challenges of COVID was that the disease was novel, meaning that we had literally no idea what to expect from it, and had no real protocols for containing it. The six feet thing was just made up because it sounded reasonable, for instance, not due to any objective metric. At least not at the start. Then there was a problem with how infective it was. It spread quickly and overwhelmed healthcare capacity. That was what truly made COVID awful. A combination of uncertainty for treatment, prevention, fear as to mortality, and the novel and infectious nature of the disease is why COVID was so bad. I don't know that these will all hold true for bird flu, which we have a routine scare for. Bird flu treatment is fairly well researched, we broadly know what to expect (though this varies with the strain), and we have fortified our healthcare system to better deal with pandemics in the future.

Approximately 40% of the lower class will become middle class in their lifetime. 55-60% of university students are democrat and go to college in hopes to make a good living. They vote democrat because they get indoctrinated by college campuses to believe the right is bad. You never hear positive things being spoken about republicans in schools. They also believe the policies in place now and proposed for the future will continue to create financial prosperity for them by getting jobs through diversity hires and college degrees.Republicans make up about 22% of university students and typically believe that hard work and merit / competence are the main factors needed to become financially successful, this is a passed-down belief through generations of the majority of labor workers being republican (85% of farmers are men in red areas).This explains why the vote the way they do. The middle class is the closest to 50/50 in terms of belief and voting trends, it boils down to how they lead themselves to their own successes and how they believe they can maintain it by voting one way or the other.","title":"How the Democrats became the party of the elite"},{"text":"Any other hypothetical propaganda you want to add on?","title":"Biden should pardon Trump"},{"text":"And Scott Presler","title":"Don't Forget to Thank Musk, Rogan, and Kirk"},{"text":"She fell short because young people cant be fucked to vote.

I don't want to see them throw Harris under the bus like they did Hillary. I don't want to hear them nitpick at every single sentence she spoke and laugh she made and state she visited. I don't want to hear about how brilliant the Trump campaign was in courting misogynistic young men and men of color to their racist ranks. As far as I'm concerned, this election proves only one thing and that is that a woman cannot be elected president in this country now. It doesn't mean it won't happen within the next century. It's just that we are a nation that as a whole does not value women's lives, leadership, and contribution to society. And, that of course, includes many women themselves who do not value themselves and others. The only other takeaway from my perspective is that we have already become an oligarchy and we just didn't know it. Elon Musk and billionaire bros' money played a huge role in unseating Democrats in the Senate and in bribing young men to vote for Trump. In no other time in our nation's 248 years would Musk have been allowed to give away $1 million to male voters. And he even says it wasn't a lottery. They personally called all the guys who signed up and vetted them before deciding which ones would get the money. In other words, they knew whether and for whom they had voted.","title":"I Want to Share Words of Hope and Positivity and Encouragement"},{"text":"The first and most important guardrail is not to vote for people who test the guardrails.I'm not too confident in the rest.","title":"Are you ready to become a guardrail of democracy?"},{"text":"A water main break that turned out to be a leaky urinal.","title":"Did 15-20 million democrats just stay home?

For example, immigration. It became apparent that people wanted illegal immigration under control. So even Harris started adopting some of Trump's rhetoric. But since the election just happened, my mind is in election analytics mode. Theres clearly some different camps within even the Republican party now. Theres more \\"establishment\\" Republicans that may lean towards not voting Trump even. These politicians include people like Jeb Bush, Nikki Haley, and McConnell. Suburban voters of bigger cities tend to favor these types and as a result, during these elections, Trump's numbers dropped there compared to say Bush's. Theres a constituionalist minded conservative side. These include people like Cruz, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and DeSantis. This group is easier to get to vote with Trump's crowd. Theres even a libertarian esque camp with the Paul's, and honestly Vivek reminded me a bit of it. They are also a bit easier to go with Trump's crowd.Then obviously theres the newfound MAGA crowd. Excluding the classic Republicans/conservatives who will pretty much vote for whoever is the Republicans nominee. MAGA had a new bunch that has completely turned Ohio red, and put usually blue swing states completely into play and even going his way. This is states like PA, MI, and even WI. He grabs blue collar workers like no tomorrow. He's turned the image of the Republican party from a fiscal conservative for the rich party, into a working class party. Lots of union members who always go blue have went red. Rural areas have always been more Republican, but theres been some rural counties that had blue history, and now they've gone for Trump the last few elections. He's grabbed more African American votes, more Hispanic votes. I haven't seen numbers on this one, but it sounded like more Muslim votes too. Groups that don't traditionally vote Republican have more with him. We'll see if this stays this way, and if the republican party will continue down this MAGA road. Vance seems popular, and if they stick with him after, they may keep this group. If they go with someone thats not a MAGA esque candidate, im curious to see if some of the never trump suburban voters will come back, and if we lose some of the new Republican voters.","title":"What's your take on Trump's impact on American politics?"},{"text":"Forget endorsements, we should NOMINATE Liz Cheney in 2028, thatll really swing over imaginary white suburban conservative voters and noble Republicans!Edit: I swear to god if this actually happens in 2028 im going to jump off a cliff","title":"Maybe if the Dems just paraded Liz Cheney around more!"},{"text":"I just wanna be a space pirate.

Trump has unprecedented minority- and young-men support--probably due to the lack of success of young men in this country.

But that's because a lot of women empowered themselves when they didn't feel like they were getting their fair share by voting. It seems men are starting to do the same. This is my main takeaway from this election.That said, I think it's hard to say a white man would have lost too. I think if a man on the dem ticket was virile (not Biden) and persuasive enough (not Biden), they probably could have convinced some young men that Trump was bad for them.I think Kamala is a prosecutor and a damn good one. She excels in situations like the debate. But she's not great with conversations that don't have conflict where she's just giving her elevator pitch about what benefits people. I think she's too honest to speak in platitudes like that. So when Trump ran away from more debates with her, her town halls were rough and her speeches were nothing special--and she kept repeating her same points in all of them so the excitement around her dissipated pretty fast.Someone probably could have made the case as to why their lives would get better under them and worse under Trump.

They don't know how to drive a point home to let everyone know that he was the reason for it.  They should have been repeating all the time we are fighting the inflation that is a result from the Trump Administration's actions and then just continue to label the exact actions that caused it. The shity thing though is that full economic impact of decisions they make takes three to five years to affect the general public usually so he's going to ride out the coat tails of the good stuff that Biden did do, take credit for it, and brag about it the way the Democrats should have. Entire investigations should have been opened by the Democrats for the price of groceries going up 20 and 30% when inflation was only around 9.1 at peak. The general public needed to see that they cared more instead of just offering words and hope. They did do a lot but most of it was quiet in the background bureaucracy.I am ashamed of my fellow countrymen and not paying enough attention to know what kind of a threat Donald Trump that he himself says he is, to have not just voted for her no matter how they felt about her but yeah I do agree that the Democrats definitely could have done more over the last 4 years to actually motivate people also.","title":"We know now why we lost: the Democratic Elite picked our candidate instead of letting the Democratic Rank and File pick them in the primaries."},{"text":"Fuck you Joe for doing this to us, and fuck you to the DNC for not running a primary.

Pathological commitment to demand side growth, even in an inflationary environment. Im such a doomer on this issue because neither party has demonstrated an interest in addressing the national debt. Up in the air re Trumps tariffs: China is export bombing the world atm and that is a very real threat to local manufacturing in Europe and the US (and at a time when energy costs in EU are already shuttering factories, weakening the industrial base of our most important geopolitical allies). Thus, tariffs might be necessary for certain strategic industries. Remember, much as it pains me to say it, Trump was right in 2016 re Chinese systematically stealing American IP. 3.

So that means...$30,000 + 14.2% income tax = you have $25,740 to spend, which means you will spend about $4,012 on imported goods which means you will have $21,728 left for everything else.$30,000 without income tax = you have $30,000 to spend, if you buy the same $4,012 worth of goods as above, with the 50% tarrif increase, you are spending $6,018 which means you will have $23,982 left for everything else, $2,254 more than when you were income taxed!It's basic math my friend...","title":"How the Democrats became the party of the elite"},{"text":"Agreed.

When the other part of the country's vision for a better tomorrow is literally to kill the other side, mass deport them and take away their rights and don't really care about the Constitution/laws, there isn't really much of a \\"shared vision\\" there. Those are two extremely opposed sides. These aren't merely \\"differences\\" as you try to paint them. Those are like Civil War level type differences. Part of the country wants authoritarianism and the other side does not.Like Biden said, \\"You can't love your country only when you win.\\" Today, all of us who are members of the Democratic Party are now getting the opportunity to put those sentiments to the test.Wtf.

The real question is now where do they go from here, when the next four years means mass deportation, abandoning Ukraine, cozying up to Putin, undoing healthcare, undoing affordable education, harsher abortion and the republican government will pick and choose if a state will get aid during a disaster based on their politics? Your sentiment that onus is on Democrats to always take the high road (AGAIN) as if they hadn't before is utter bsgetting through these upcoming four years, and coming out of them stronger as a result, with a stronger resolve to keep fighting for the values we believe in, and to keep striving to make the country that we love a better place.You're wrong. Trump's first term literally left the country and institutions battered. The SC has never had this low of an approval. Federal agencies now are no longer controlled by experts in their field but will be subject to the whims and random politicians and their donors. More important regulations are on the chopping block. And you think that somehow by some magic the country is gonna be better in four years after mass deportations? Wake up dude. The next four years are gonna suck and not sure how the country will fare. The only silver lining is places like New York and California should be able to hold out for four years simply because they're pretty much their own mini countries and have giant economies. But the rest of the country is kinda fucked. If you're in the midwest/south/swing states and are minority, recent asylum migrant or lgbtq+, the next few years are gonna be hell.

And I went to ridiculous extremes to disappear. First it was the war on drugs, then it was the AIDS Crisis, and then drug policy, homelessness, lgbtq and civil rights, race and recovery, jail and prison reform.

If things had been working right in the first place none of this would even be happening, but this has all been in motion at least since the 70s, and we actually lost the fight a long time ago, we just werent paying attention, or rather, enough attention to it.

The best alternative, in my mind, is to maybe play the same game. Ignore the attacks and simply always attack elsewhere, never play defense, literally just ignore them and return with an equivalent whataboutism. If we can get comfortable with Dems acting like the GoP, and straight ignoring taking solid policy positions, and instead act as a vehicle/validations for people griences,  it will probably serve them better.Voters simply don't care about governance, they want to be told their problems are #1 Valid. #2 Not their fault, and #3 will be fixed by attractive approachable/relatable man.

The general losses for D's leads me to believe that this was not just a Kamala Harris problem, unlike 2016. By and large, people simply were not happy with the democratic party.3. The right has taken over media - fox news, joe rogan, twitter, are where millions of people get their news, and 24/7 cable is dying.4. Connecting point 2 and 3, it doesn't actually matter if the dems did good or not. If they can't message that where voters are, or they make themselves look incompetent, they've lost.5. Gen Z men are not going to be the generation that bucks the trend a la leftward shifts. Gen Z women will be interesting to see develop: it's a bit of blackpill for both female candidates to lose to the same guy, and I could see them give up or get downright nasty in 26/28.6. Latinos, especially Latino men, are going the way of the Irish and the Italians. I.e., in the next 20 years, we'll just call them white. Trump's rhetoric against Latinos didn't stick because they don't really think it applies to them, especially working class Latinos. And they may be right, actually.7. The economy, stupid.8. Voters are selfish, and empathy is overrated. If we can't frame things in a way that makes the average american citizen feel like it affects them personally, it doesn't matter how anyone else fares. Messaging needs to reflect this.9. There may be a need for a completely new rebranding. The Democratic party holds more baggage than the GOP - if you're older than the Grand Ole Party than people are going to have preconceived notions. Party swaps and realignments happened more frequently in early america, and by reaffirming their support for trump, Americans clearly want a radical change in the system.10. It makes me vomit in my mouth to say it, but Trump taps into a coolness factor that resonates with young men. GOP is the party of bravado, strongmen, of Hulk Hogan and Elon Musk. I don't see the appeal, but it's clearly there. Dems, meanwhile, are the exact opposite of sexy.11. Liberals and leftists have a self-persecution complex that needs to be rooted out. Republicans like to martyr themselves too but they do it collectively.12. If the dems put up another bland centrist candidate in 28 they will lose. The status quo is gone.

While they all still live under the same societal pressure to excel and provide. Trump fed them a line of bullshit, and because we stopped teaching critical thinking skills, basic economics, and history that isn't a patriotic jingle, they bought it hook, line, and sinker.

Kamala's campaign had very clear blind spots when it came to demographics she needed to win on Election night. So much of her campaign focused on how terrible Trump was/is, combined with the usual anti price-gouging and \\"he'll cut taxes for rich people, I'll cut taxes for **you**\\" palaver. Trump's campaign tried as hard as they could to tie Harris to the Biden administration to take advantage of anti-incumbency sentiment. **That** is the message the Harris campaign needed to repudiate, and you can't sit there and tell me with a straight face that they did a good job in that department.Was she correct about Trump being awful? Yes. Did she hammer it effectively? Yes. But in the end, was she telling people what they already knew? Also yes. The campaign focused on giving people reasons not to vote for Trump, and less on giving people reasons to vote for her. That doesn't work with an electorate easily swayed by populism. The theory for why Harris should focus on bread-and-butter issues instead of Trumps autocratic ambitions is simple: Nine years after Trump launched his first presidential campaign, voters already know what they think about him. And if undecided voters still arent convinced that Trump is an authoritarian menace, they probably cant be persuaded on that point. After all, Trump-curious voters remember Democrats issuing apocalyptic warnings in 2016, yet did not personally suffer nor witness any political repression during his time in office. To the contrary, they tend to recall life under Trump as utterly normal  at least, before the worldwide pandemic for which, in their view, he had little responsibility.

Biden has freshly granted immunity to take whatever action he deems appropriate and he absolutely has to.  MAGA have called for war if he isnt reinstated - Dems have to take the same approach to prevent it.  Biden cannot do nothing.  He cannot uphold his oath to protect the constitution and knowingly put the nation in peril by handing the power of the position to someone known and proven to wield that power against the nation itself.\\nBiden has a duty power provided by the constitution to refuse the transfer of power into the hands of a twice impeached convicted felon.
