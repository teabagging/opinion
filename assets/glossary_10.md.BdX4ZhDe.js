Reynolds, a senior attorney and former US Attorney who supervised the prosecution against Peltier in the appeal period following his initial trial. In a letter to the United States Department of Justice,[60] Reynolds wrote that clemency was \\"in the best interest of justice in considering the totality of all matters involved\\". In a subsequent letter to the Chicago Tribune, Reynolds added that the case against Peltier \\"was a very thin case that likely would not be upheld by courts today. It is a gross overstatement to label Peltier a 'cold-blooded murderer' on the basis of the minimal proof that survived the appeals in his case.\\" ... On July 9, 2021, Reynolds wrote a letter to President Biden in which he stated: I have realized that the prosecution and continued incarceration of Mr. Peltier was and is unjust.

The ruling class almost always fights  they overestimate themselves. And it almost always radicalizes more of the public.

The denaturalization campaign that began under Trump, and which close advisor Stephen Miller now promises to turbocharge, is an attack on the fundamental principles of fairness, stability, and equal rights that citizenship represents.\\nThe denaturalization initiative, which began under Trumps first administration, involved investigations into naturalized citizens, often based on minor discrepancies in immigration paperwork or other technicalities. Critics argue that these investigations are a way to intimidate immigrant communities, as they are seen as attempts to revoke citizenship for reasons unrelated to criminal or national security concerns. Advocates argue that these tactics are rooted in a vision of exclusion rather than the principles of justice and equality.\\nMillers statement comes on the heels of discussions around Trumps new Project 2025, an agenda that includes aggressive immigration policies aimed at curbing both legal and undocumented immigration. Advocates fear that with Trump back in office, millions of immigrants who have legally earned their place in the U.S. could see their rights come under threat, creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty among naturalized citizens.With the political landscape rapidly shifting, immigrant advocacy groups are preparing to confront policies they view as discriminatory and un-American.

While it doesnt explicitly endorse him, the way it frames his actions and impact is deeply concerning. The article acknowledges his controversial nature but ultimately positions him as a force of history, someone to be reckoned with rather than challenged on the substance of his actions.This kind of framing normalizes his behavior, presenting it as a defining feature of American politics rather than something to critically evaluate. The article describes his resilience, communication skills, and political instincts in a way that risks overshadowing the very real harm his rhetoric and policies have caused.To me, it's reminiscent of how history has sometimes rebranded dangerous leadersfocusing on their influence rather than the consequences of their actions. We have to be cautious about language that shifts the conversation from accountability to inevitability, as if his impact is simply something we have to accept rather than question.Just because the article doesnt explicitly praise him doesnt mean its not lending credibility to his approach in a way that could desensitize people to its dangers.","title":"Time to Admit It: Trump Is a Great President.

There is a backlog created by the Biden Administration in the processing of security clearances of individuals hired to work in the Executive Office of the President.  Because of this backlog and the bureaucratic process and broken security clearance process, individuals who have not timely received the appropriate clearances are ineligible for access to the White House complex, infrastructure, and technology and are therefore unable to perform the duties for which they were hired.  This is unacceptable.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order:1.  The White House Counsel to provide the White House Security Office and Acting Chief Security Officer with a list of personnel that are hereby immediately granted interim Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances for a period not to exceed six months; and2.  That these individuals shall be immediately granted access to the facilities and technology necessary to perform the duties of the office to which they have been hired; and3.  The White House Counsel, as my designee, may supplement this list as necessary; and4.  The White House Counsel, as my designee, shall have the authority to revoke the interim clearance of any individual as necessary.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.","title":"Trump wants a faster security clearance process, too"},{"text":"He was probably like \\"damn Protestants\\"Which is fair, as much as I'd like to deny it","title":"Bishop Gives Trump, Vance Woke Lecture on Immigrants: The People Who Pick Our Crops"},{"text":"IMO WHO is definitely compromised and dropped the ball big time, but withdrawing from the WHO is a HUGE mistake.

Contact an immigration attorney for details and exceptions\\nParents naturalized before May 24, 1934: You derive citizenship if either parent naturalized prior to your 21st birthday and you held a green card at the time. You must have been a biological child, not adopted or a stepchild.Parents naturalized between May 24, 1934 and January 12, 1941: You derive citizenship if both your parents naturalized prior to your 21st birthday and you had a green card at the time. If only one parent naturalized before you turned 21, you derived U.S. citizenship if you already had a green card for five years at that time.\\nParents naturalized between January 13, 1941 and December 23, 1952: You derive citizenship if you held a green card and both parents naturalized before your 18th birthday; or one parent naturalized but the other parent was dead, or your parents were legally separated and the parent with legal custody of you naturalized.\\nParents naturalized between December 24, 1952 and October 4, 1978: You derive citizenship if you were unmarried, received a green card before your 16th birthday, and both parents naturalized. Or, if only one parent naturalized, you can derive citizenship if the other parent was dead, or your parents were legally separated and the parent with legal custody of you naturalized. You must have been a biological child, not adopted or a stepchild.\\nParents naturalized between October 5, 1978 and February 26, 2001: You derive citizenship if one of your parents was a U.S. citizen when you were born, never ceased to be a citizen, and the other parent was naturalized before your 18th birthday; or the naturalization of both parents occurred before your 18th birthday; and you were unmarried and held a green card at the time.Parents born in U.S. or naturalized between February 27, 2001 and the present: Under current law, you derive citizenship if one of your parents was born in the United States or if one of your parents naturalized prior to your 18th birthday and while you were living in the U.S. in the legal and physical custody of that parent, provided you already had a green card (lawful permanent residence). Both biological and adopted children qualify under this law. (See 8 U.S.C. 1431.) This allows some children to become U.S. citizens the minute they receive a green card through a U.S. citizen parent.Applying for Proof of U.S. CitizenshipAlthough derivation of citizenship is automatic, you will probably want to have some proof of new status as a U.S. citizen.To apply for such proof, the child or the naturalized parent needs to fill in USCIS Application for Certificate of Citizenship or Form N-600, along with various documents. The form, instructions, and the latest fee can be found on the N-600 page of the USCIS website, or you might wish to hire an attorney to help.The child can also apply to the U.S. State Department for a U.S. passport. But it's sometimes easier to get USCIS to issue the certificate first.\\nHope this helps \\n[i had to look it up this is what i found](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/citizenship-children-naturalized-citizens.html)","title":"Trump sued by pregnant women and civil rights groups over flagrantly illegal birthright citizenship order"},{"text":"If you believe the stuff Ive seen in your feed, youre a Nazi.","title":"Trump warns he'll drop economic hammer on Canada next week"},{"text":"Widespread celebration.","title":"Trump terminates John Boltons security detail within hours of taking office"},{"text":"Go back to high school.","title":"18 States Sue to Stop Trumps Birthright Citizenship Order"},{"text":"The one bright spot in the whole affair is that there are way fewer conservative trifectas than there were last time.","title":"22 states sue to stop Trump's order blocking birthright citizenship"},{"text":"So much for the states rights bullshit.","title":"Trump Sneaks Dangerous Rights for Fetuses into Executive Order"},{"text":"I doubt Bolton gives a shit about them.

The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense, the statement reads.Its a key example of how enforcement is going to be different under the new Trump administration from the Biden administration.Immigration and Customs Enforcement set a policy in 2011 preventing agents from making arrests in sensitive locations. The Biden administration put out similar guidance. Immigrant advocates have shared concerns over stripping that policy, arguing that doing so would stoke fear in immigrant communities and keep children from going to school or people from seeking care at hospitals.The second directive includes the phaseout of parole programs that allowed certain migrants to temporarily live and work in the United States. Republicans have repeatedly said the Biden administration abused the parole program by extending it to multiple nationalities. The statement doesnt clarify which programs will be phased out, but says the program will be returned to a case-by-case basis.The Biden-Harris Administration abused the humanitarian parole program to indiscriminately allow 1.5 million migrants to enter our country. This was all stopped on day one of the Trump Administration. This action will return the humanitarian parole program to its original purpose of looking at migrants on a case-by-case basis, the statement says.","title":"Trump says ICE can arrest people at churches and schools, directs agency to use common sense"},{"text":"Trump is actually a pretty rational down to earth guy, what he does is act like a lunatic on purpose to make everyone think they are dealing with someone unhinged.

The idea is that our interpretation of the laws is generally set by judicial precedent (case law) rather than a clearly defined set of statutes. In reading the 14th amendment there a key qualifying phrase \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" [the United States] in determining natural born citizenship. How we interpret this phase was determined by the case US v. Wong Kim Ark.With that background let me address your question:Can someone explain by what mechanism this gets enforced?Trump's order prohibits federal agencies (like social security) from issuing documents some people born in the US. He is not directly denying citizenship to anyone. While president's generally have the authority to order federal agencies to take lawful actions, this order violates the equal protections clause.However, it only violates the equal protections clause under the interpretation of US v. Wong Kim Ark, and this may be the ultimate point. To stop his order from going into effect, others will have to sue. While the lower courts will likely rule against Trump (citing Wong Kim Ark), the US supreme court may opt to hear the case and reinterpret the 14th amendment. If the supreme court decides to hear the case with the intention to reinterpret the 14th amendment, this would violate the principle of stare decisis (judicial precedent) which is central to the principles of common law. This court has on several recent occasions violated this principle, and I doubt they will hesitate to do so again. However, such action would be judicial activism, it would be effectively legislating from the bench, and it would violate the separation of powers built into the constitution.","title":"ACLU sues over Trump order aimed at ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Lmao its like a Mad Libs game of buzzwords.","title":"Im a Democrat and people are usually surprised when they learn this about me.

Not really a union because there is no collective bargaining, but definitely some collective standards and oversight. Lawyers are generally private citizens and the practice of law is governed by a specific part of state law. The bar helps enforce ethics rules and maintains a registry of who has passed the bar in the state, who has completed their continuing education and who is in compliance with the ethics standards for the state.  Judges on the other hand are state or federal employees. They are governed by a separate section of state law and/or the constitution and do not have to be a part of the bar association. The bar doesnt represent or regulate judges. Judges dont actually HAVE to be lawyers. Stanley Reed was on the supreme court from the late 30s to the late 50s and never had a law degree. There really isnt a governing body for judges. Generally issues with judges have to be resolved by the state legislature or congress.

[...] A large majority of justices almost certainly do not want to destabilize American law in this way, abruptly eradicating a right upon which millions have come to rely.I don't see why that is such an outlandish idea. Dobbs overturned Roe v Wade after 49 years. And that certainly was a \\"right upon which millions have come to rely\\". After what time does a right become \\"ancient\\"? The Roberts court has repeatedly proven that they're happy to shit on precedent from a great height if ordered to do so by their masters. The Heritage Foundation that every one of the conservative justices is beholden to, has [made it very clear](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/birthright-citizenship-fundamental-misunderstanding-the-14th-amendment) that they believe the 14th Amendment doesn't say what it says. Which leads to the second reason we should expect the Supreme Court to block this executive order: What Trump seeks to do here would sow chaos on the ground. Oh yeah, Trump famously wouldn't want to sow chaos. As a stable genius himself he's all about stability in his policy decisions. /s And again, overturning women's right to bodily autonomy also sowed an insane amount of chaos on the ground. That wasn't ever a consideration for SCOTUS. That brings us to the final incentive for the justices: Trumps order gives them an easy opportunity to demonstrate their independence at the outset of his second term. The court does not want to look like a lapdog for the president; indeed, it knows that it derives its power from public confidence, which will plummet to dire new lows if it rubber-stamps Trumps entire agenda.Firstly, SCOTUS' approval rating stands at 38% and [has been underwater for years](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/supreme-court/). That's never stopped them before. Secondly, none of the Justices seem to have any particular interest in showing their independence. I think Slate is falling into the same trap as all the other media outlets (or rather the ones who aren't directly owned by the oligarchy), who still believe that the institutions will save you and that checks and balances work, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. As the saying goes, there are none so blind as those who refuse to see. They'll be in for a rude awakening once the penny finally drops.

The 14th Amendment was written to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their descendants, not to address modern immigration. Back then, there wasnt even a concept of illegal immigration like today. The key phrase, subject to the jurisdiction thereof, excluded people like foreign diplomats, and its fair to argue that those who enter the U.S. unlawfully dont meet that standard of full jurisdiction as the framers intended.Immigration was far simpler in 1868, with almost no restrictions, so illegal immigration wasnt a concern. Today, we have complex laws and enforcement challenges that automatic birthright citizenship undermines. It creates incentives for people to cross the border illegally because their child gains citizenship, even though the parents are here without permission.Citizenship should be based on mutual consent between individuals and the government. If at least one parent is here legally, its a different story, as theyve already been accepted under U.S. law. Without that lawful presence, its hard to justify birthright citizenship legally or practically. The Supreme Court should revisit this issue, as Wong Kim Ark never dealt with children of undocumented immigrants in the first place.","title":"GAME ON: Trump Takes a Hammer to Birthright Citizenship, Says 'People Have Wanted This For Decades'"},{"text":"Imagine the marketing behind this.

He made them male and female from Genesis 1 which is both not fully accurate as we know intersex people exist, AND which is from a chapter where poetical dichotomies are used repeatedly which are not treated as proscriptive binaries; the separation of day and night for example does not preclude the existence or concept of twilight).  At worst, its just plain old circular reasoning.  See the hes known you from the womb arguments  which are often trotted out, but only really applies if you start from the assumption that only your assigned sex at birth is valid.  Similarly, appeals to OT crossdressing prohibitionsaside from coming from verses sandwiched between shit no one cares about anymorerequire you to first settle what gender someone is before you can even determine which clothing is appropriate. So often, the arguments are actually just cleverly designed to essentially sidestep the entire conversation and read the Bible through the assumption of a conservative worldview.  The most damming thing, though, is that in the OT/NT the closest thing to a trans person youre likely to encounter is a eunuch: a person assigned male at birth, who likely has had physical alterations to their genitals, and whose occupies a social role that is outside the boundaries of what is acceptable for men. In other words, they occupy a social role outside the gender binary.Its obviously not the same thing, but its about as close a cognate to the modern concept of trans folks as youll find in the Bible, though not necessarily ancient societies more broadly.In Matthew 19 Jesus explicitly blesses Eunuchs who follow God, while acknowledging some are made that way in the womb(see again, the painfully stupid application of he knew you in the womb as an argument) and some make themselves Eunuchs.  None are denounced, and while its not a blanket blessing of ALL eunuchs its clear that being a Eunuch is entirely permissible and not a specific sin or stumbling block.  ETA: One very direct consequence of this passage is it blows up the whole defiling the body God gave you with surgery BS, as its clear Jesus doesnt see a difference between born and made Eunuchs.We see this blessing of holy Eunuchs put into action in Acts,where an Ethiopian Eunuch is the first recorded gentile convert to Christianity, who is baptized without any special issue made by Philip of his status as a Eunuch.There really is just no basis on which to deem being trans as being anything particularly sinful.","title":"Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Rolling Back Many Transgender Rights &amp; Protections"},{"text":"Yikes ?? it just keeps getting worse and worse","title":"Republicans Suddenly Illiterate After Trumps January 6 Pardons"},{"text":"Aaaaaand today's hoax is that Trump's perfectly normal housecleaning somehow isn't normal. ??","title":"Donald Trump purges thousands of White House staff who are not aligned with MAGA and warns thousand more 'you're fired'"},{"text":"Crazy how the constitution all of a sudden is not a holy and untouchable document to conservatives when something other and the 2nd amendment is discussed.","title":"Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship to any babies born after February 19,"},{"text":"Well it'll be 8 years by the end of his second term.

It is not a legitimate democracy.If one can't talk about issues that threaten the elite, it's oligarchy and plutocracy.However, Chinas achievements to date have made such pronouncements look remarkably naive. Not only has liberal democracy not arrived in the Peoples Republic, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has developed a distinct economic model that has lifted nearly a billion people out of poverty and transformed the country into one of the worlds largest and most dynamic economies. Somewhat ironically, it is Western governments that have had to adapt to Chinas model C not the other way around. In recent years, Chinas successes have forced Western governments to pivot away from free market orthodoxy and resuscitate muscular industrial policy, which had long been banished from Western policy toolkits.The big issue is that the US works for the rich, while China is lowering inequality and works for the people.","title":"How Trump 2.0 Could Herald a New Age of Authoritarian Capitalism | naked capitalism"},{"text":"Eh all those maps and such are updated on a certain basis.

The citizenship is that family's ace in the hole, a card to be played in the future if needed. It is used to bypass the substantial and time consuming requirements for immigration. It's a cheat using the 14th Amendment as a loophole.

Wong Kim Ark and 3) extends to people in the USA with a lawful visa not just those without a lawful visa. For these reason, it will probably be quickly struck down quickly by lower federal courts. It's hard to say if the Supreme Court will take up this case.

They also describe the tendencies of man during the end times. And that there will be an increase in wars, famine, disease, natural disasters, false teachings, and messiahs. Ultimately, the majority of man will turn from the truth. The truth being the teachings of Jesus. They never describe the antichirst or where he comes from or how he acts, any of the coming signs you describe outside of Revelation. It's been a topic of contentension amongst biblical scholars and theologians since its inception. It was added four hundred years after the New Testament was written. The \\"Jonh\\" who wrote this gospel is not John the Baptist. The whole thing can be applied to so many different points in history, and has been because it is very vague in its description of the times and places. It's a book designed to allow people to graft their concepts onto the antichrist and the end times because of its vague nature. People thought the plague was the green horse of death during the black plauge and that Napoleon was the antichrist. There's been so many other times it's been done. Not to mention, apocalypse and Armageddon at the time of Christianities inception had a totally different meaning. Apocalypse meant something along the lines of the destruction of an old paradigm. As in a new way of seeing things. It did not mean the literal destruction of things. Armageddon is thought to be a literal place.\\nAre we in the end times? It sure seems like it. But it's seemed like it many times in history. Does that mean we'll know the antichrist by the signs described in Revelation? It's doubtful.

Which would indicate it is just a misspoken statement.I submit that in 2018, when President Trump Met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Trump praised Spain's efforts in fighting terrorism and mentioned that the United States had a strong relationship with Spain. He also acknowledged Spain's role in various global issues, though his comments were more generally focused on the broader relationship between the U.S. and Spain rather than specific political or economic details.This indicates Trump knows damn well that Spain is not a BRIC Country. Which means your complete argument that he is a moron because he DIDN'T know is a complete fabrication.What's it going to take for you to acknowledge the likelihood that he just misspoke?I think what's going on here, is that you are holding onto your belief that he is a moron, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary for various reasons, such as emotional attachment to your view, cognitive bias, social influence, or a lack of willingness to trust evidence.What's now clear to me is that your cognitive bias, like a confirmation bias, has potentially led you to interpret any evidence to the contrary in a way that supports your existing belief, even in the face of the contradictory evidence.  For example, you might be readying a reply that clearly he's a ;moron because if he knew it in 2018, he should remember it now.

On the right you get the anti-intellectual fascists, and on the \\"left\\" you get people who cosplay as intellectual socialists, but fundamentally are not really different.I know it is gatekeeping, so I am not being totally serious here, but I really want to exclude them from being part of leftist thought. If your policy does not push for freedom, equity and human thriving, and instead just supports the same heirarchical systems of the right, then you are at best an anchor holding down progress. They just seek a different heirarchy, not the flattening of them.I do not know what to do about it though. The problem is that the intellectual people who push right wing ideas actually *want* heirarchies of power (See everything Jordan Peterson ever says.) and so are absolutely in lockstep with their \\"We like Nazi's because they are fashionable/christian/strong\\" followers. On the left, people who attempt to make practical decisions to make meaningful change, those who pretend to make said decisions but uphold that status quo, and those who want radical but utterly impossible change are all struggling in such a way that makes it so those who are just on the team end up seeing whatever other groups exist as being opposing teams as well.And since it is about the team, and not the policy, they constantly consume themselves over time. Without some kind of unifying force they slowly descend into infighting until fascists gain enough support to take over again. And because they want to \\"win\\" and have their heirarchy imposed, it is absoltuely fine to lose as long as the other leftists lose too.","title":"Trump to lift pause on 2,000-pound bomb supply to Israel, Walla News reports"},{"text":"Is sending them back home under any proposed method treating them like they are \\"less than human?\\"  Because if so then it's a disingenuous argument to begin with.","title":"Bishop rebukes Trump at service, asks him to have mercy on LGBT people, illegal immigrants"},{"text":"thats cool and all but they literally are a nuclear power.

A company changing their policies to negatively affect people as long as it's fine legally is within their right. The problem lies with health insurance being tied largely to your job.

This aren't my words:*Good faith reply, I need to do more research but this is my two cents on why some will applaud this. I dont necessarily share all these opinions, but wanted to give the case for this, per request.I dont think it has to be a perfect red/blue split either, it reads off as populism vs globalism imho. Trump represented populist ideals and campaigned on it. The WHO is an example of the opposite of this. He argues we pay too much, when we pay over a billion (18% of WHO funding), despite being 1 of 194 members.No one in the organization is voted on by the public. The directors, leaders, and members are all appointed. Heck, there isnt even an impeachment process to remove leaders, if theyre found to be incompetent or if they acted in bad faith. Many people are unaware of how it works, how much influence they have, and due to the appointments/no public voting/no impeachments, there is limited accountability.There are recent concerns because WHO member states are now negotiating a legally binding Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Accord. The legally binding part is new, and is worrisome combined with the issues above. Basically, how much centralized power is the world comfortable with, particularly when none of the members are voted in or have a formal process for removal?Covid: Many thought Covid protocols were handled badly. WHO endorsed the 6ft rule, now admitted to not be based on science by everyone, including Fauci.WHO was denied entry to China in Jan2021 to investigate origins. In 2023, WHO abandoned plans for a crucial second phase of the COVID-19 origins study in China, citing challenges in obtaining necessary permissions and data from Chinese authorities.WHO downplayed the lab leak theory, which hampered international efforts to identify the origins and mitigate future issues. WHO supported animal crossover, even though our final Covid reports (Biden admin) lean towards lab leak as most likely.WHO initially echoed Chinas claims that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, which delayed early precautions.WHO advised in March2020 that masks were unnecessary for the general public unless they were sick or caring for someone who was sick. When evidence emerged of airborne transmission, WHO reversed its guidance in June 2020, leading to public confusion and lost trust.Others will also argue that countries extensive differences (urban v rural, connected v isolated, wealthy v poor, varying population density) make for a poor one size fits all approach that the WHO generally applies.Overall/TLDR:Were paying the lions share (18%) being 1/194 members. Multiple examples of poor handling with Covid. Lack of origin investigation, parroted China talking points, now debunked 6ft rule, reversal of mask guidance. Arguments that the appointed members lack oversight, have too much power, and limited transparency. WHO is now negotiating legally binding agreements for its members, previously recommendations. Arguments against universal approaches, when countries vary significantly.","title":"Trump Withdraws U.S. from World Health Organization"},{"text":"The Trump-voters effected by this will either find a way to blame Biden or twist themselves into a weird logical pretzel where Trump making their meds more expensive is actually good for them.","title":"Any republicans on insulin?"},{"text":"Original brics founding members are in the name.

Potato potahto.","title":"POV: Republicans reacting to different things"},{"text":"I've seen a point made, by people with a much better understanding of the history and precedent of the Citizenship Clause, that gives an avenue for this order to be upheld...One historical exclusion was for foreign invaders. People invading and occupying the country wouldn't be provided citizenship for their children. Even the existing legal precedent for who is covered by the Clause excludes such persons:the exceptions or qualifications...of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory...The only exceptions to this principle \\\\[of common law *jus soli*\\\\] were children born to foreign diplomats and those born to alien enemiesSo the existing legal precedent is that children of alien enemies and occupiers do not qualify for birthright citizenship.And Trump has declared an invasion.The Court will likely consider that factor in their decision. If the law says that the President has authority to declare an invasion (which it does), why can the Court decide it's not? The majority isn't going to accept any argument they can. So if the President has the authority to decide what constitutes an invasion, and who is among the invaders, then how does the existing legal precedent denying birthright citizenship to that group work out? They'd have to overturn that precedent and decide that the Clause does apply to that group. Which the majority on the Court will never do because it goes against centuries of common law interpretation.That is a possible \\"out\\" for the Court to take in allowing this EO to stand. The only thing that works against this argument, I think, is that nothing in the Order actually invokes this precedent or argument. But hey, it's not unlike the conservatives on the Court to pull in their own arguments and reasoning to rule in favor of the GOP.","title":"Why Trumps Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship Will Backfire at the Supreme Court"},{"text":"And a major part of Latino Americans voted for Trump","title":"Washington National Cathedral Bishop Calls Out Trump to His Face"},{"text":"Our country doesn't allow it either.

Since 2021, the number of Americans living in poverty increased by 67%, while the number living in food insecure households jumped 40%. The child poverty rate more than doubled from 2021 to 2022, the biggest year-to-year increase ever recorded. As rents rose faster than wages, the United States experienced a 12% increase in homelessness between 2022 and 2023. Since 2023, 31% of Medicaid recipients have been disenrolled from the program nationwide. At the same time, over five million children lost their healthcare coverage through either Medicaid or CHIP. By March of this year, the number of Americans living paycheck to paycheck reached a historic highpoint of 64%.Amid this suffering, corporate profits as a share of national income have increased by 29% (the main contributor to inflation), while the combined wealth of U.S. billionaires??already the richest people in human history??has skyrocketed by more than 87% since the start of the pandemic.\\"He promised wealthy donors before being elected that, \\"nothing would fundamentally change\\" from the first Trump presidency.

Until we figure out a WW carbon tax and reduction scheme crippling our economy while the rest of the world does not is just plain stupidity.  The current path the Paris accord advocated for ends in energy poverty for me and you and energy abundance for the ruling elite.  Well that's just going to end in blood shed at some point in time.   Cold, tired, hungry people are NOT nice people.  When the global elite start to act like their carbon counts then we can talk about my carbon.  And carbon indulgences are not a thing, they just made his royal highness Prince Al Gore rich.Infact the only way out of this carbon mess involves creating a carbon free source of energy that is cheaper than coal.

This is common in the Americas.[6] - Jus sanguinis (\\"right of blood\\") is a regime by which nationality is acquired through descent, usually from a parent who is a national.[7] Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania grant nationality at birth based upon the principle of jus sanguinis.A person who has neither parent eligible to transmit nationality by jus sanguinis is \\"born stateless\\" if born in a state which does not recognize jus soli. For instance, a child born outside Canada to two Canadian parents who were also born outside Canada would not be a Canadian national, since jus sanguinis is recognized only for the first generation in Canada. If that child were born in India and neither parent had naturalized yet, then the child would be stateless, since India confers nationality only to children born to at least one Indian parent.[8]Oh huh, this is a lot more common than I thought?

He says that it only applies to children born in the US to US parents. Nothing more, nothing less.But the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.  The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not subject to the jurisdiction thereof.  Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendments text.  And what's even more wild is that if I'm reading things right the definition he's picked (8 U.S.C. 1401) has 8 meanings of what it takes and the very first one is to be born in the US and be subject to the jurisdiction, nothing about parentage I assume because, well, the constitution says don't care about that. And that's made doubly clear by the other 7 definitions which include lineage for when you're outside of the US(If you include parents in some definitions and not in others it must be a variable that matters in context). So I think all he did was give good a good case for non-constitutional law saying that birthright citizenship is legal.I'm kind of wondering who helped him with his homework because I think they might be working against him. It's a good lesson for the kids about looking up your sources before signing off on things(Or maybe I'm misreading things of course.

Teitelbaum was criticized for making such remarks about parents while they were mourning their children.\\nHe also said that he wants to establish a Satmar community in Romania.\\nIn a historic first, during the 2024 United States presidential election, he shifted from the Satmar long consistent stance with the democratic party to endorse Donald Trump over Kamala Harris for President, a Republican Party (United States) candidate.He is one of two competing factions rabbis in a 33,000 people village in Orange County, New York, where 99% speaks Yiddish at home.

If the US was a corporation hed be instantly fired by the board. This has nothing to do with knowing an acronym and everything to do with understand who we do and dont have trade relations with and what form those relations take, adversaries or partners.You keep making this about an acronym when its about a fundamental difference in how we interact with various countries based on existing trade deals and geopolitical policy based on those treaties.
