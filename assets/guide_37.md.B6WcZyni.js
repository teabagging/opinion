They're too busy gambling with their money and devising ever-more coercive methods of extracting rent to bother with something as 19th century as 'manufacturing'.And it apparently never occurred to them that manufacturing is an essential part of a healthy, innovative society, because innovation most often comes from the factory floor, and requires the manufacturing base to get it right.

They point out the revisions in said numbers eventhough revisions are and have been a thing since the BLS started keeping track.They talk about the low GDP growth eventhough the growth under Trump and Obama was essentially the same.They give credit to Trump for the stock market saying it was his re-election that led to these historical numbers, ignoring the fact the market has been setting records for 10+ years now.Trump will take over, the job numbers will be real again, the market will all of a sudden be great again, egg prices won't matter, he'll talk about inflation being around 2.5% saying he did that and his base will eat it up.None of it matters.

Hospitals and other health providers in rural areas could face the greatest strain from proposals Trump has embraced to slash spending on Medicaid, which provides coverage to a greater share of adults in smaller communities than in large metropolitan areas. And small-town public schools would likely be destabilized even more than urban school districts if Trump succeeds in his pledge to expand school choice by providing parents with vouchers to send their kids to private schools.Resistance to such measures in deep-red rural areas could represent one of the few obstacles Trump would face from a GOP-controlled Congress over implementing his agenda, Brownstein writes. Still, the most likely scenario is that elected Republicans who represent rural areas will ultimately fall in line with Trumps blueprint  His second term may test whether that deep reservoir of ideological support can survive policies that threaten the material interests of rural America in so many ways.

For example:The biggest issue, high prices really bring out a lot of frustration, rightfully so.  Frustrations pointed towards who is in charge.  There is some simple logic there in that emotion.  1. People in charge *i.e. President*, have an affect on things. \\n2. Things aren't good. \\nTherefor change is needed. There's a lot of nuance and systemic things this reasoning ignores of course.  Most people don't follow/know much of the innerworkings of government, economy, how it all works, especially together.  I wouldn't so much as call this stupid, ignorant maybe? But simply put, people are busy, focusing heavily on getting by, and what free time they have, they aren't going to spend it on following politics/economics.  Those topics aren't interesting, and are often stressful and frustrating to most. This leads to a bad combo of frustration + overly simplistic logic + ignorance that equals an advantage for misinformation and oppositional forces to thrive.  Big part why things seem to swing so much back and forth.

There is valid reasoning and frustrations there to be found in that decision. Basically not all that vote Trump are lost per se.

Political parties are private organizations that can run their internal elections however they see fit as long as they are within the laws governing the individual states.

Technically Democrats and Republicans don't have to have primaries. The Green Party doesn't have a primary, the Libertarian Party doesn't have a primary, they select their candidates. Does that make them anti-democratic parties?Primaries are good for the party as it drums up support and early donations and can signal what candidate may perform well in certain areas, but there's no requirement to have a primary to get on a ballot in most states.You're arguing nonsense by trying to state that not being involved in the election of the presidentIal candidate is somehow against democracy as a whole.","title":"Donald Trump behaves like a toddler.

The FDIC pays depositers up to the insurance limit (currently $250k), per depositer, per insured bank, per ownership category/account type.\\n2. The FDIC trie to find another bank to purchase the failing one, and sees to it that every accountholder's balance is preserved (see #1) up to the insured limit, and all cards/checks are replaced with new ones under the new bank.\\\\-  If a bank can not be fond to acquire the failed one, then the FDIC pays the depositers by check itself -  usually within a few days3. The FDIC sells the bank's assets to maximize their value and settle the bank's debts.So, without the FDIC, it's a free for all.    People would be hesitant to put their money in a bank if their deposits were as at risk as they are in an investment.   Depositors with smaller balances simply wouuldn't have any  recourse.Oh, you're an upper middle class worker in STEM with  checking and savings balances of $100k, trying to buy a house this summer, and your bank fails??  Well,  that $100k is gone, without the FDIC.   Too bad, so sad.This happened to millions of people during the great depression.  9,000 banks went out of business and 9 million savings accounts were wiped out in the process.  Just... gone.Edit:  Honestly, I'm not sure what the proper thing to do without the FDIC would be, as an individual depositor.   Maybe limit account sizes to 2 or 3k?   The more accounts you have, the more overhead involved in the financial system.   It's not a good thing to have a system where  hundreds of millions of people can't trust a bank with 5 or 10 grand deposits. That's trillions of dolllars at stake and it's all protected by the FDIC, currently.","title":"'The Next Recession Starts Here': Trump Team Weighs Abolishing Bank Regulators | \\nThe president-elect's advisers are reportedly discussing plans to shrink or eliminate key bank watchdogs, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."},{"text":"Elon is an ass.","title":"Elon Musk thinks Trump's plan for expedited permits is 'awesome'"},{"text":"It's not anywhere near as settled as you're pretending it is.

Yet if you do things they like, they dont reward the party, they just look for another topic to try to prove moral superiority. Which is counterproductive to their own ends.Look at immigration. Biden didnt put the clamp down on immigrants because progressives would have been upset. But they didnt vote to keep a pro-(reasonable)immigration candidate in office. So now both legal and illegal immigrants are in for a rough time.Unions are an even better example. Biden heeded the Auto Unions and didnt invite Tesla to a major auto-summit. Which, if you are pro-union, is wise, since Elon is vehemently anti-worker. Elon buys twitter, a key cog in this cycle for the right wing, which hurt us. So called pro-union progressives stayed home. Further, lets look at the striking dockworkers earlier this Fall, who Biden supported en route to a win for the workers. Were we in a normal cycle, Biden championing unions (which he has done many times during his administration) would have led to pro-worker surge behind him. Instead, progressives and leftists spread the tremendously dishonest narrative that Biden screwed the rail workers, and stayed home.?And this all comes down to social media, where people can build their own reality. The Democratic Socialists at my University spread the rail story on fliers all over campus, and the sad thing is I wouldnt be surprised if that rather than being intentionally malicious, they just didnt bother to fact check something they read.And if someone thinks this is a centrist against progressive thing, look no further than the Democratic Socialist national chapter refusing to endorse *AOC* for not being progressive enough for them.

Also not one sign of scaring.I'm also honestly not convinced there was a major injury there.  Allegedly it was a shard from the teleprompter that hit his ear and they bleed like motherfuckers so it looked bad but was barely much after it scabbed up.  He 100% butterballed it up for the cameras after the fact. Why do we know more about Luigi than we know about that shooter ?The simple answer is that they killed the shooter on the spot, and the little info we did get after the fact was that it was a conservative leaning individual ... IMO a Libertarian-type ... so GOP buried it and focused on the attempt itself rather than the motives of the shooter.  And with Trump still alive it's easy to just air-time him talking about the traumatizing incident and focus on him rather than the shooter and why they did it.We know more about Luigi because he's still alive.  There's a \\"whimiscal media mystery whodunit\\" that they can milk for views and because it's so low-stakes politically people dug in to see what it was all about and who it could possibly have been.  No one cares about the CEO so people can distract themselves postulating about the shooter.So IMO, that's the difference.  Targets were different people with different optics around them, and of the shooters one died on the spot and the other got away with it for a few days.  I guarantee if Trumps attempted assassin took a few shots, fled and got away for a time there would be massive snooping into that person's life because it takes the spotlight away from Trump as the target and focuses it on the \\"shooter at large\\".","title":"Rep.

The only limitations are a small render size of 1920x1080 (with a watermark) and the inability to export your scenes into other software. If you want to take 5 years to familiarize yourself with the software you can do so without pirating. For those that don't know Houdini is the industry leader for special effects like destruction, smoke and fire simulation and fluid dynamics. It makes sense for a trial version to restrict your ability to export your creations for rendering elsewhere. SideFX also offers an indie license for $200/year for budding studios making less than 100k/year. Their regular perpetual license in comparison is $7000 + the cost of version upgrades. And it's worth every penny.I have nothing but good things to say about SideFX buuutttt...- Autodesk's trials are 30 days, which is the same as they've always been. They also have no limitations on what you can do. \\n- Maya and 3dsmax also have \\"indie\\" licenses with similar stipulations to Houdini's. \\n- I don't think the purpose of any trial is to master the software.\\n- Houdini's trial limits outputs to 720p, not 1080p. It also can't be used with third party renderers, which depending on your situation could be a total deal breaker to even meaningfully test it. \\n- If Autodesk's policy around trials and licensing don't give users adequate opportunity to see if the software is for them, that sounds like their problem. Subscriptions make crewing up and down much cheaper, they make using multiple versions at the same time much cheaper and make ditching a piece of software and then re-subbing later if you need it viable. Whilst there's nothing about subscriptions that preclude the existence of permanent licenses as well, IMO, they aren't fit for purpose in today's CG Pipelines because...- Taking on a big project that will require 20 freelance FX TD's becomes an enormous capital expenditure. \\n- The choice on which software version to use inevitably ends becoming at least partially financially-driven rather than functionality-driven, because uplifting all your five-year-old permanent licenses to Maya to the latest version in order to use a new feature that will really help on a new project will cost a fortune. The temptation then exists to only uplift a certain number (based on how many people will be on that project) but then you have to juggle different license availability across the studio. \\n- This becomes an even bigger headache - and the main reason I say they aren't fit for purpose _now_ - due to interoperability; Your render engine or plugin doesn't release builds for your old DCC version anymore? You're fucked. Your version of Houdini was built against a different version of MaterialX than your version of Maya? You're not seeing any viewport shaders on USD Prims! Your third party python library compatibility is limited to your DCC version's interpreter. USD versions, Alembic versions, PySide/Qt versions...I'm a Pipeline TD with 15 years experience and the above issues are always a giant pain in the arse but if you're able to choose your software versions you at least have a fighting chance. I'm currently writing some tooling to get geo and shaders out of 3dsmax and into Houdini. If you want your VRay Materials to come across properly via USD, there's a highly specific set of software versions you need to use between Max, MaxUSD, VRay for Max and Vray for Houdini. Chaos Group actually have a handy matrix on their website to demonstrate compatibility - but its only helpful if you can actually install the versions you need. If we had to pay tens of thousands of pounds in license fees to uplift everything to the necessary version, would we? I don't know, but these questions should be decided by the needs of a project rather than how far through this financial year's Capex budget we are This is a tiny example in an ocean of similar situations - \\"permanent\\" licenses are either a) like attaching handcuffs to your pipeline or b) you pay the annual \\"maintenance\\" fee to avoid this and then you still have an ongoing subscription only with an enormous up-front cost which limits your flexibility. But all this is largely by-the-bt: The idea that a business would look at the lack of permanent licenses and determine that it was therefore *ethical* to pirate the software is entirely without justification. We aren't talking about stealing food to feed a starving child or stealing medicine to cure a sick person, we're talking about software we use to slowly render robots fighting each other for a Hollywood studio. There is no ethical justification for us to take something without paying for it!","title":"CMV: It's ethical to pirate some software."},{"text":"Well, I for one hope that she manages to recover from her brutal handshake injury. ??","title":"Rep.

Cutting funding will only weaken the agencys ability to tackle tax evasion and enforce the law. The nomination of Billy Long as the next IRS commissioner raises even more eyebrows. Why appoint someone with ties to a 'scam-plagued industry'? It feels like another step toward undermining the agency instead of improving its efficiency.

I used to work in the community association/HOA industry. When a development company would produce a new community association development, and start selling units, It was just a known thing in the industry that there would be massive lawsuits after enough units sold and the association was turned over to a board of directors from developer control. (Meaning The developer sold enough percentage of houses that the rules and regulations and governance of the association would now be conducted by the owners of the homes, instead of the developer that was selling the units.) And we all knew (know) that the developers made so much money, and they allocated a big part of their budget to settling and losing those lawsuits. Many of those homes are really crappy construction, so things would fall apart after the sales, and the developers knew that they would lose the lawsuits, so they just budgeted for it. It was cheaper to do that than to build the homes well. So are your example makes a lot of sense to me and it makes sense that other industries would do this too. Thank you.","title":"Gov.

First of all, that's a very cold and analytical question you are asking.  I guess you have it in you!Nah, you're still avoiding the question. *You* want us to make peace with GOP voters who are big on culture war bullshit. I'm asking you to acknowledge that you can't use people's inherent rights as a bargaining chip just to win elections, which you apparently seem fine with. I'm pretty obviously opposed to dropping either, but you seem to keep focusing on the idea that we have to make peace with people who have no intention of making peace with us. Trump voters aren't just voting for Trump because of his economic policy; the social policy is what's firing up the base, and they know that. (The price of groceries is more important than whether or not there's a trans kid on your daughter's basketball team, but one of them takes up a vastly disproportionate amount of energy for the GOP specifically because they know it creates an exploitable fear in a way that a dollar on the price of eggs doesn't.)You seem desperate to ignore the social quarrels as though they're not important to GOP voters, but they very much *are*, and we cannot give up on things like trans rights or immigration rights or abortion rights as Democratic platform policies even if it guarantees us a win. It doesn't work like that. It *can't* work like that, or what's the point?And I largely agree with you about wealth imbalance being a focus -- I'd *love* to see a more left-leaning Democratic party! -- but there's two big problems with that: firstly, the kind of changes that you need to make aren't going to be the big, sexy changes that get people to the polls (especially in the short term, when systemic change can either be a bit wonkish or take a while to pay off), and secondly, the GOP are fine just lying about it anyway. (Just look at the recent business with Trump and his 'I'll bring down the price of groceries' nonsense, suddenly backtracked when it became his job to fix it. They just *lie*. That's what they do. They'll make up any old nonsense because they can get away with it, which leaves the Democrats in the position of having to come up with actual policies that will make people's lives better while the GOP can just promise them a pony and never deliver.)That puts us in the same problem as when it came to throwing one minority or the other under the bus: how far do you want your Democratic party to just lie in order to get the win? Because whatever policy they come up with, the GOP will lie about how it's terrible and people will believe it. It's like I said before: you're calling for us to win people over from their side to ours, but their side is willing to say anything and do anything regardless of decency, morality or reality in order to get the votes. If we promise them ten grand off their taxes, they'll promise them twenty; if we promise them twenty, they'll promise them fifty and say that Mexico will pay for it.","title":"I'm Anthony Fisher, senior editor at MSNBC Digital.

I think thats where the democrats blew it this time. They focused almost solely on their donors and pretty much left everyone else out to dry.Edit: and I also think there was a fair amount of election interference.Edit 2: the Uhleins ARE old money conservatives, and the true conservatives have been actively trying to destroy anything remotely leftist since the Bolshevik Revolution and FDRs New Deal. Most of the world steered left after WW2, pursuing the Democracy that America represented in the world, but the conservative elite dedicated itself instead to sabotaging any Socialist or Communist movement anywhere it popped up. In Central and South America it was relatively easy to use the CIA to organize opposition movements, topple democratically elected governments, and install extreme right dictators and train and equip their cops, armies, and death squads to suppress the people there.In the US it was a little different, and their most effective strategy has been to pump cash into anything remotely leftist. Since no effective left has ever been established domestically (or anywhere else, really), when someone or a group of people actually start to gain momentum, the sudden infusion of cash causes an almost immediate implosion. The CIA created the guns for drug schemes in support of our dictators and regimes who were friendly to our corporate interests. These drugs have been intentionally used to undermine civil rights, destroy movements and communities, and create the largest prison industrial complex in the world.I think that the conflict between the old establishment conservatives and the new money liberal elite is going to play out between the pres-elect and the VP. I think both sides think that theyre going to play the other. The corporate pirates think that they control shit and are going to grab all they can get while the old guard is actually interested in implementing P2025 and their quasi-Christian order that controls everything through a council of Churches so in order for anyone to be able to participate in any part of society, have a job, etc, they must participate in the church, and the only path for any advancement is within the church order. Thats the movement that Amy Coney-Barrett represents. The pres-elect and his crew could give a fuck about any of that, but he has benefited by the image of respectability that their executive orders and suggested appointments (like Barrett) have provided for his empty head. They obviously view him and the other criminals and miscreants he surrounds himself with as useful idiots who are setting things up like bowling pins for them.This may also be the right time, and possibly the only time for a long time, to get a real functioning Left together, but it means that we have to actually do the work and not just bicker and complain on social media.

He highlighted the troubling trend of labelling certain discourse as \\"hate speech,\\" drawing parallels to practices in British and European nations where authorities have historically penalized individuals for speaking out, even when their views oppose the government.

The president-elect is talking about getting rid of electric cars but thats one of Elon the clowns businesses and I havent heard how theyre working that out. Getting rid of subsidies so only rich people can buy his shitty cars? Also, having the richest fuck in the world, who isnt even from here, telling the rest of us poors *with glee* that we need to tighten our belts and be prepared for some hard times seems to me to translate into plain English as fuck you.Im not a Democrat or a Republican, and Im fuckin tired of the status quo American hegemony and the liberal elitist policies that insist that the economy is thriving while the bottom is falling out for everyone who isnt rich while talking a good game about freedom or whatever while exporting fascism and genocide in support of our corporate interests. But pres-elect is a conman and what I see is the looming failure of the worlds wealthiest country, and on the precipice of total economic collapse the 1% are about to take control and attempting to close the door on their fucking little club. As in, no more opportunity for the bottom 99% because theres nothing left to own in order to generate wealth. Theyre attempting to fix the game once and for all.Remember, most of these rich people dont have any actual money. Only assets. Were a debt based economy. Most of their wealth is generated by our debt. They even consolidate and buy and sell debt, and theyre going to consolidate the resources that are tied up in government spending, then split and leave us with the bill. Or auction us off to the highest bidder. America is just about the only place where rich people can declare bankruptcy and still be rich, or sell just enough property or something that they bought on credit to show a loss that means they dont owe any taxes. Elon the clown is rich but had to borrow money to buy twitter by putting up his stock in Tesla, so he actually doesnt have a whole lot of actual cash, he has worth, and while he brags about how ever much money he paid in taxes last year, which is a big number to most of us, it actually represented about 1 and a half percent of his US income, compared to the rest of us who pay a full third of our income.Anyway, pres-elect knows how to bankrupt and drive businesses into the ground and emerge unscathed with the money and leave others holding the bag, while totally avoiding any accountability. Thats his special talent and why hes at the center of this hostile takeover. Him and his whole clown show of charlatans ARE THE LIBERAL ELITE that they claim to be the antidote to. This is the natural consequence of decades of policies both domestic and international that have used the Constitution to define corporations as people whose voice is money. They are neither Republicans nor are they conservatives. Their individual behavior alone is proof of this. It wouldnt surprise me one bit if the Democratic elites were part of this big final sell out.","title":"Someone In Power Seems To Be Really Afraid Of Trump's \\"Second Bite At The Apple\\""},{"text":"This post is an invitation to discussion.

He was on the KGB's radar from the moment he married Ivana, and was a regular visitor to the Soviet Union, then Russia, starting in 1987. It's well-known what sort of methods the KGB were using to gain kompromat on their targets, and of course Trump, who was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein for more than a decade and a half, had no personal reservations about the age of any \\"nice girls\\" sent to his room.I doubt that would sway Trump's base for moral reasons (they have no morality), but let's just say it's highly unlikely such a video would feature anything to reinforce his manliness. He's lacking in ... raw materials to work with, and the ... functionality ... of such materials is probably highly suspect. The wrong sort of video would puncture the image of manliness that he relies on.And of course it's not ever going to be just any one thing. The primary purpose of kompromat is to use it as the means to get more kompromat. Trump was in deep with them for decades. They have financial leverage, blackmail/extortion leverage, personal leverage up the wazoo. It's *very* likely they gave him Melania as a present after things so publicly exploded with his second wife.His base is fanatical but they *will* turn on him given the right stimuli.

The wrong image and they're gone.Edit to add: also consider that Trump's popularity is in large part due to the bombardment of Russian propaganda across all forms of online media.

Many others, from Rosenthal to Moore, have exposed these layers of corruption and greed for decades. At this point, it isnt a matter of awareness; it is a battle over power.

A democratic candidate that wasn't so closely tied to the current administration had a much better chance. Kamala failed to convince a lot of people that she would be meaningfully different from Biden. Dems needed a candidate that could critique Biden and didn't have an unpopular history. Kamala performed horribly in the 2020 primaries. Her running on abortion meant nothing when she was VP in an administration that *could* have done more for abortion rights and didn't. Dems also ignored a lot of their base by not backing popular policies that appealed to key groups in swing states. Her positions on Healthcare weren't strong enough (she referenced building off of Bidens presidential success, a sentiment that means nothing when people saw rates still rise consistently), she underestimated Arab voters, who historically are an active group of voters, with her views on Gaza virtually the same as Biden (which also alienated younger voters), and for issues she had more thought out plans on, she didn't focus enough on them. Not many people knew of her plans  for investing in housing, which likely would have been more popular, because she spent too much time focusing on Trump being the \\"big bad\\". She catered to groups that would already have voted for her no matter what, and not enough on voters that were either indecisive on who to vote for, or didn't feel enthusiastic enough to vote.Had Democrats run a candidate that could appeal better to groups that didn't like Trump, but felt unrepresented by Bidens administration, they had a fair chance. Trump is popular because he speaks out against status quo politics. That was the same reason Bernie was so popular despite DNC attempts to suppress his campaign. Kamala wasn't even less popular in most polls. A lot of people preferred her. But they just didn't vote. Whereas Trump knew how to get people enthused enough to actually go out and vote, which is what matters. BTW, I think both parties are corrupt. Also, because I know it's a critique, I use Kamalas first name because her last name autocorrects to Harry's and takes too long to keep correcting.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"That is absolutely not true and I don't know how that got in your head.

Now he says it's too 'hard' to bring down costs."},{"text":"Change my viewThe only thing that I see changing your view is if you accept the premise that campaigns have an impact. Everything else from there sort of builds from that premise. First - polls do a lot of analytic lifting for you. But, the thing about polls is they're usually a snap shot, not pre-destiny. So, if we think that campaigns have persuasive impacts, then we know that the analysis should then, not be what the polls were, but what campaign strategy changes the snapshot. Second - to be more specific on what a candidate can do, they can present communications to the public on the pressing issues, right? Exit polls wills ay, for instance, \\"the top 5 issues were X\\" but there's a feedback loop between the candidates on what issues should be pressing and then the exit polls show the reaction. People think immigration is an issue with no small part because Trump's campaign has made that message and highlights events to create the confirmation in the public's mind. Third - to evaluate which candidates could win, we'll have to make assumptions about their assumptions on what wins campaigns. I think the conventional wisdom is that Dem strategists think there's a bucket of \\"swing voters\\" that will switch votes, so they focus a lot on persuasion. That creates the need to balance how much you sell yourself and your vision and how much you attack. But - when we zoom out a bit. The evidence for swing voters are \\"county X votes for Obama then Trump.\\" If the electorate, including at the county level is static, then we know people changed their minds. If the electorate is dynamic, then what's happening is the type of mind changing is between \\"Do I vote?\\" or not - so it's different people voting. The evidence we have is that most voters don't consistently vote in every election. We can call this second model the mobilization model.What we know about mobilization is you want to suppress likely voters for the other side and maximize likely voters for your side. Negative partisanship does this. When you zoom out even more, what we see is Dems lose in 1980, 1984, 1988. They win in 1992, 1996. Lose in 2000, 2004. Win in 2008, 2012. Lose in 2016. Win in 2020. Lose in 2024. When we look at what Bill and Obama have in common. They aren't democratic insiders, aren't bound by conventional wisdom, their primaries shock because they're unconventional. And distance themselves from the Dems in important ways. Bill had the third way, Obama had the opposition to the war in Iraq. I haven't studies Bill's campaign in much detail and '92 and '96 election materials are gonna be more scarce. What we know from Obama in 2008 and 2012 is he ran a ton of attack ads. His campaign was super smart on mobilization. Their data collections and quality engagements are off the charts. Since the people responsible for those campaign tactics largely didn't take up spots in the DNC, they went to his foundation or private practice, the Dems lost that edge. What we know from all of the Republican wins is they also engaged in a lot of negative partisanship. Lee Atwater, then Karl Rove, are among the best. They have won elections because they know the real model for winning is the mobilization, not persuasion, model - and that's why they also invest in widespread voter suppression tactics. So to boil this down: If you have a Dem that has the intuition to buck conventional wisdom and spent $$$ on tons of attack ads, then they could have won. If you have generic Dem using generic Dem advice from all the losing campaigns, then you'll have a really classy concession speech, again.You can see someone like a Gavin Newsom, or Josh Shapiro, or Pete Buttigieg be able to effectively attack Republicans and mobilize the likely Dem voters.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Haha.

This is a glass ceiling that really requires a \\"only Nixon could go to China\\" moment almost always. How does that apply more specifically here?The messaging between Clinton, Biden, and Harris were not significantly different. Their charisma was not significantly different (all pretty bad). The economy wasn't really even *that* significantly different. Their opponent was the same person each time, and everyone with a brain knew he was an unqualified douchebag running as a populist each time. The difference? Biden was a white male. The demographics that Trump supposedly \\"won over\\" in this election? That's bullshit. He gained very few votes over 2020. What happened was that several traditionally reliable Democratic demographics stayed home... in both elections where a woman was the candidate, and came out to vote in the one where a man was. And those demographics are among the more statistically sexist ones (and racist, but that's likely a smaller factor). Any charismatic Democratic white male candidate would have had at least a substantial chance of victory with any reasonable messaging, against a historically hated opponent even whose own party was skeptical about. Note: I'm not saying these demographics were all sexists or anything. Ultimately, it doesn't take very much to have lost this election. It was quite close by historical comparison to actual \\"landslide\\" elections. Only a few percent needed to stay home because they refused to vote for a woman, probably less than 10% of the demographics that stayed home... which is exactly what we saw... in both 2016 and 2024.It already was practically a coin toss who would have won, according to all polls and poll aggregators.

Particularly he was in office during the 90s and the 00s, where you pretty much *had* to vote for some unsavory bills. Bernie's strategy, because he's an independent, has always been to sneak riders into bills and that's how he gets stuff done. Furthermore, leftists differ from liberals in that they actually like guns because that's who the fascists usually kill first. Bernie, being a socialist has a record of being pro-gun. This has changed, though. Kamala Harris shouldn't have hired the same idiots that made Clinton lose. She shouldn't have campaigned with Liz freaking Cheney. She should have fired everyone who told her to stop the \\"weird\\" rhetoric.

Puntland has withdrawn recognition of the Federal government twice and are still refusing to recognize it, Jubaland recently also pulled recognition of the central government, and things are getting better, but apparently at the cost of the consent of the states.

It wouldnt introduce more stability into the rest of Somalia, it would introduce more instability to Somaliland.

It also didn't help that there's this undercurrent that most famous athletes are closet (or sometimes wide open) conservatives. Liz and Tulsi are probably thought of similarly by each party, but there was no similar person to RFK jumping from Ds to Rs and what caused him to jump is pretty rough for Ds. Ds would be REALLY well served to just finally run a normal primary. They haven't had a normal primary since Obama. Since then, it's essentially been party elite rigging it for their favored candidates. Ironically, Rs have been helped by their inability to do the same. Rogan is an oddball but his reach and following are unequaled and he's a self-proclaimed liberal who felt that the damage being done by Ds was not outweighing his agreement on other issues. And honestly, all the parties have swung so far left, his \\"liberal\\" stuff is no longer strictly against Rs.I think it may show some blindness on your side that you think those issues are things that poll well with Rs. Abortion? Definitely not. Weed? Somewhere between don't want it, but will hold our nose to neutral. Tax INCREASES, even if on the wealthy? No and I don't know how you could think this would be a winning issue for Rs. Trump is not saying rich people are bad. Trump is saying people rigging things is bad. Rs believe in opportunity and that someone who realizes opportunity shouldn't be unfairly punished.Assistance for first home purchases just feels like ineffectual pandering. I think most Rs (and many Ds, honestly) don't think that would have worked as intended. The Ds have been throwing money at problems for a few years and that's how inflation happened. Housing prices would just go up by close to the amount offered. First-time home buyers are too large a pot for it not to become an issue.Small business startup money? Total pandering and kind of too little too late to try to suddenly become pro-small business. On stuff like this, Trump's campaign was unbeatable. He pulled out this oddball no tax on tips issue that was needle moving just in NV. That's someone who has his ear close to the ground. Kamala's campaign sucked in comparison. Hate him all you want, but Trump was born for campaigning.The main point though is that Ds alienated a lot of people by pushing what are, essentially, internet-popular talking points to a huge group of people, many of whom are not chronically on the internet.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"\\"Hard times make strong men!\\"Everyone was wrong when they thought they wanted to bring America back to the 1950s.

In short, the theory states that the six regime archetypes that the Greeks identified and which we still use today (monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and?*ochlocracy*?or mob-rule) each represent different stages of one long process of political evolution.\\"?\\"According to our interpretation of his model, the cycle proceeds as follows. Political communities are first ruled by kings. Kingship is eventually corrupted into tyranny. The last tyrant is deposed or forced to share power with an aristocracy. Aristocracy degenerates into an oppressive oligarchy. Occasionally, an independent middle economic stratum C a middle class C emerges;?*hoi mesoi*?in Aristotelian terms. If this middle class is entrenched, democracy emerges. In time, however, a plutocracy emerges, stratifying society between opulent and dependent. The hopes of the dependent masses fuel an intensifying competition among their political patrons, transforming democracy into mob-rule, perhaps better described as rule by **demagogues**. This tournament of demagogues rages among a narrowing field of popular leaders until a single champion arises victorious, dragging political society back to some form of monarchy, thus completing the cycle.\\"Trump is a Demagogue -**a leader who makes use of popular prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power**.

I don't pretend to be an expert on your country, a place I've likely never been to, and ask the same favor of you.From the first time stepping foot in the New World, Europeans C including the English C were real assholes to the Natives. The entirety of America is built on that premise, and it's only gotten a little better in last couple decades or so.And this is why I can't take you seriously. The relationship between natives and the colonists was a complex and subtle creature, sometimes adversarial, sometimes cooperative, depending on a web of relationships between different groups of settlers and hundreds of tribes. The same man could be a hero to one tribe and a demon to another. Just waving it as \\"America's whole premise is being an asshole to the natives\\" reflects much more about your ignorance than it does about actual history. And the crack about the present day is just bullshit. I actually grew up on a reservation. I spent 30 years of my life on a reservation. I had 4 years of a native language class in school. My best friends are natives.So again, unless you are actually part of the community and have some greater claim to knowledge and experience than I do, don't use my friends and kin for cheap internet gotchas.

You'll get your whole contribution back before you hit 79.Now the big complaint is \\"but if I'd invested that myself, I could have millions!
