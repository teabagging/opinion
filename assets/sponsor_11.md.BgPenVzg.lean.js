Both candidates should have viewed this as a monumental opportunity to reach an audience that has sworn off legacy media.  Only one campaign did.

These strategies are inconsistent. Right hand not talking to the left hand. The GOP has been trying to enforce strict mail-in rules for years, but that's only because the ballots were overwhelmingly from Democrats. The strategy to reject more ballots makes no sense if they want Republicans to switch to mail-in voting (However, in PA, the mail-in vote remained overwhelmingly Democrat this year. GOP usage only increased by under 10%, I think.). Bottom line, Democrats are not more likely to make errors on their mail-ins than Republicans.

This includes various members of AIPAC, CPAC, Musk, The Heritage Foundation, and many other entities who have their involvement masked behind the litany of sketchy shell companies all sharing a common location in Wyoming (IIRC.)Those bad actors will NOT just quietly let go of their access to a rubber stamp from the highest office of the land. They'll throw all of their efforts behind the next puppet the moment that Trump is toppled as a viable candidate. The only thing the had working in their favor is that Trump is SO over the top and narcissistic that he draws ALL of the attention due to his excessive habits, gluttonous demand for the spotlight, and vulnerability of taking credit for anything and everything to stroke his ego. Those same backers will be looking for their next figurehead. And while they may be disorganized at first, they'll present a far more threatening candidate in 2028.

You can look at corrinthians for that little Token of knowledge.Trump is ok with abortion, an adulterer (this is not because of him being a sexual offender but instead due to him being divorced), doesn't believe in Christ being King, and defiled the book of God by putting man's laws in it. Kamala is also straight disgusting for her own reasons I don't need to go down to.Some people say that voting for Trump is voting for the lesser of two evils.

Gaga was one of many starry names at Harris multi-city rally on election eve, which also saw performances from Katy Perry, Jon Bon Jovi, Christina Aguilera and more in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas and Milwaukee. For more than half of this countrys life, women didnt have a voice, Gaga told the crowd after her performance of the patriotic ballad. Yet we raised children, we held our families together, we supported men as they made the decisions  but tomorrow, women will be a part of making this decision. She continued, Today I am holding in my heart all the tough, tenacious women who made me who I am. I cast my vote for someone who will be a president for all, for all Americans. The pop star then introduced Doug Emhoff, who spoke to the crowd about his wifes readiness for the White House. Oprah Winfrey followed after him, introducing the vice president. The lineup for the star-studded Kamala Harris concert had been under wraps for weeks. Then, on Monday, the performers were revealed, not only for one concert rally but also for simultaneously coordinated concert rallies taking place in seven battleground states. The livestreamed Vote for Freedom rallies  the campaigns final get-out-the-vote effort before Election Day to capture grassroots enthusiasm and mobilize voters  included performances from 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, Joy of Jesse &amp; Joy in Atlanta; Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland in Raleigh; Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte, SOFI TUKKER in Las Vegas, with remarks by Eva Longoria; La Original Banda El Limn in Phoenix; Eric Benet at a Tim and Gwen Walz-hosted Milwaukee event; and Jon Bon Jovi, The War and Treaty and Detroit Youth Choir in Detroit. But the main event was two rallies taking place in Pennsylvania, with Harris making her first stop in Pittsburgh  where Katy Perry, Andra Day and D-Nice performed  and ending her tour in Philadelphia, where the A-list lineup included Winfrey, Gaga, DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Jazmine Sullivan and Adam Blackstone. The 2024 election eve rallies followed a burst of Hollywood support for the vice president in the final days leading into Nov. 5, including a Houston rally endorsement from heavy-hitter supporter Beyonc, a Saturday Night Live appearance from Harris herself (prompting equal time given to Donald Trump on Sunday by NBC), and other high-profile endorsements from the likes of Harrison Ford, Jennifer Lawrence and Will.i.am. A campaign senior official recently spoke of the impact of celebrities getting out the vote for Harris, noting how the campaigns strategic use of DJs, videos, songs and celebrities throughout Harris campaign run speaks to both the hopeful and optimistic environment Harris looks to create and helps to hammer home her message that everyone has a home with us. DJ Cassidy previoously helped rally the Democratic National Convention with a first-of-its-kind roll call dance party; Winfrey was also a surprise speaker at the convention.","title":"Lady Gaga, Jon Bon Jovi, Katy Perry and More Perform at Kamala Harris Election Eve Concert"},{"text":"You're so right!

Either folks that have come to that on their own, or were influenced by these senior Republicans.There are lots of anecdotes of people knowing conservative friends or family members that are voting for a Democrat for the first time, ever, for some of them.And there's clearly a lot of support for abortion within the Republican electorate. This is made plain when protection for abortion is on the ballot alongside positions to be filled. The politicians get voted on in what is close to the normal political lean of the location, but abortion gets somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% support. It's not necessarily super crazy that those people that both vote red and support abortion would vote against the guy that facilitated the end of Roe.So, put all that together, you've got pretty strong evidence of some crossover voting, and who might be doing that crossing over, but no great sense of how much or what the final impact will be. Could it legitimately be like 15% shift toward Harris? That would be crazy. Is it impossible?... probably not.Not likely. Probably much less. Will it turn this election into a landslide?There's a viable theory how it might. And, my own personal opinion being that it should have been a landslide back in the Republican primary in 2016, barring Trump from even getting the nomination, it's of course attractive to me to think that theory has some merit.But margin of error being what it is, it's equally likely that this is going to, yet again, be a much closer election than I believe it has any right to be.","title":"Nevada analyst says Kamala Harris wins swing state in final prediction"},{"text":"Watched the rally live Steam?\\n?Oprah?Lady Gaga?Katy Perry?Will.I.Am?Bon Jovi?Ricky Martin And more!","title":"Lady Gaga, Jon Bon Jovi, Katy Perry and More Perform at Kamala Harris Election Eve Concert"},{"text":"What the hell is this sub anymore bro","title":"New here, whats so bad about Trump after surviving Obama??"},{"text":"I think people are cautious in not putting up Harris signs, especially in red states.

Especially in a cultural context. And I'm a firm believer that more intelligence equals greater empathy. Thus, The Culture slips to the Left as people generally get smarter.I mean, you can expect the average person to have a passing knowledge of germs and space and radios and The Great Wall of China and so on, so much so that we're geniuses compared to people 250 years ago.There's a non-zero chance that someone reading this actually understands General Relativity and that's fucking dope!The track of progress is slow but steady.

You can post up to four times per hour, even if all four are right after another.The websites leftists use to pay for downvotes charge by the downvote, rather than by the hour of labor. So more posts means you drain their pre-paid account more quickly. Because posts downvoted to zero tend to have more than one downvote, when there is more posts, paid brigading is more costly than when there are just a few posts, but with some upvotes.That is a strategy against paid brigading, but it is not as effective against volunteer brigading. To wear them out, youd need even more posts.When the brigading is really bad, the mods might consider putting a sticky note up announcing that the four posts per hour limit has been suspended temporarily. Then conservatives could just post dozens of links each at a time until eventually it wears out the brigade.Would this actually work? I dont know, but it would be interesting to give it a try.All leftists need is a credit card, and there are white collar workers in third world countries who will be happy to downvote whatever they want.Some Reddit users have described in the past spending what appears to be in the thousands of dollars on paid votes. It isnt cheap to put food on the table for hundreds of people halfway around the world.The cost of 50 downvotes is $16.99, which comes out to $0.3398 per downvote. According to?[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country\\\\_result.jsp?country=India&amp;displayCurrency=USD](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=India&amp;displayCurrency=USD)?, one pound of white rice in India costs $0.33.I dont know how much of the fee actually reaches the base level worker, but even if it is only half, it still adds up over time.Paid Reddit voting makes you think about the kind of people who pay for downvotes. Same kind of people that might mess with an actual real life election.But I accept that Reddit is twisted as sort of a fact of life.

From that defeat was a Republican strategist named Jude Wanniski who pushed forward the idea of supply-side economics and two-santas theory.  Both of which were kicked off with Reagan and used ever since.  The crushing defeat Goldwater experienced also lead to Nixon and his tendency to cave on popular pushes from the public like environmentalism.  Without that, we would never have had something like the EPA.  Jude Wanniski, witnessing both the dying of conservatism with Goldwater, and the constant capitulation and compromise under Nixon, decided enough was enough and strategized what we see to this very day where Republicans flipped the script.  Under these bad faith strategies supply creates demand and wealth trickles down (both very flawed economic views). Under Wanniskis bad faith re-election strategies, Republicans now purposefully ramp up debt when in power so they can complain about debt when not in power, thus preventing Democrats from succeeding on funding their policies.When we look back, we definitely see Goldwaters embarrassing defeat.  And we see conservatism dying out as a platformbut by the mid 70s something far worse was born out of that.  It is an outcome we should be very vigilant in spotting if the same happens with Trump.  They will re-strategize, and become far worse in the process. Guarantee it.  This will be our battle to fight for the rest of our lives and generations to come.  Defending democracy will always be a 24/7 lunchpail job.  And even as depressing as that may sound, it is still 100% worth it.","title":"This is not how democracy is supposed to be..."},{"text":"MMW: Nathan Howard is going to win a Pulitzer for breaking news photography.","title":"This is not how democracy is supposed to be..."},{"text":"Ya gottem with this one ??","title":"Does anyone here honestly believe that Tucker Carlson was mauled in his bed by a demon?"},{"text":"Only if The Cheat 2.0 suck-seeds.

They hate you, they hate your family, they hate God and they hate the truth, the message sent Friday reads in Spanish, referring to three Latina Democrats running in the majority-Hispanic 14th legislative district, which was redrawn in a contentious redistricting process that has angered Republicans.Meanwhile, the state GOP sent an English-language message to voters in southwest Washingtons 3rd Congressional District, where Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez  a Democrat who has repeatedly bucked her own party while representing a district that former President Donald Trump won in 2020  is in a high-profile rematch with Republican Joe Kent. That message, sent with an image of the communist hammer-and-sickle symbol on a rainbow background, calls the freshman congresswoman a Democrat socialist and claims that she lives in Portland and supports defund the police, abortion until birth, castrating minor children/confusing them about their gender, higher taxes, and less efficient government spending. A spokesman for the Gluesenkamp Perez campaign, Phil Gardner, said the message is typical of the kooky outright lies Joe Kent and his far-right supporters tell about Marie. In a statement, Gardner said Gluesenkamp Perez obviously does not live in Portland and is endorsed by the Washington Council of Police and Sheriffs, because of her strong support for the police.","title":"On eve of election, Washington GOP tells Spanish-speaking voters Democrats hate you and hate God"},{"text":"It shouldn't be...","title":"On eve of election, Washington GOP tells Spanish-speaking voters Democrats hate you and hate God"},{"text":"I know a registered Republican in PA who always votes blue.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"JD Vance calls Kamala Harris trash, at last-minute N.H. rally"},{"text":"And far more coherent than the orange one","title":"Kamala Harris Notches Another Big Hollywood Endorsement: Dick Van Dyke"},{"text":"I voted by mail, and I am working the polls tomorrow!","title":"BREAKING: It is time to vote!"},{"text":"There's a couple hundred people out there.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"Nevada analyst says Kamala Harris wins swing state in final prediction"},{"text":"This endorsement just locked in all of the Mary Poppins voters.

The reason that I say this is that Rasmussen and a few others are very clear about their methodology. They aren't overestimating any \\"hidden\\" (or \\"guessed\\") Trump voters. That would really destroy the credibility of a poll. Rather, Rasmussen is simply making a traditional \\"likely voter\\" based upon previous turnout. Within that, they do account for some voter enthusiasm indicators. This is where polls like NY Times-Siena are flawed (in my opinion). Since Joe Biden dropped out of the election, this small subset of pollsters perceive a higher enthusiasm for Kamala Harris than I believe is accurate. They base this on favorability and a gap between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. On average, Kamala Harris has a 4.1% better favorability compared with President Trump. However, there are some outlier polls -- and they tend to be the same polls that are favoring Kamala Harris. Marist, NY Times-Siena and a few others even give her a positive rating (meaning more people like her than dislike her). However, most other polls show her favorability index quite negative -- with some having it at or under President Trump's negatives. The problem, of course, is that this is a NATIONAL index rather than a state index. The only favorability that matters is within each of the battleground states. In those, I suspect President Trump polls higher than  nationally. The question is whether Kamala Harris would poll more negative or even with President Trump. Both (negative and even) would bode poorly for her in terms of potential enthusiasm. Personally, I think that the Hill and Atlas polls are more likely. The only possible exception is with Michigan and (potentially) Nevada. President Trump would still win with Pennsylvania (and/or Wisconsin). Moreover, if Trump overperforms the polls half as well as he did in 2020 in the battleground states, then I think that he will win all of the battleground states.","title":"Final 2024 Electoral College and National Poll Predictions"},{"text":"She should have run instead of Kamala.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"Bernie Sanders: Netanyahu Prefers to Have Donald Trump in Office"},{"text":"perfect.","title":"Joe Biden passing the baton to Kamala Harris"},{"text":"The funniest thing is that it would be a 2000 redux, when Gore would have won if he had held NH or carried his home state of Tennessee.","title":"WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE?

Theyve been promising FSD next year every year since 2016.And Elon has borrowed a fortune against his Tesla stock to avoid paying taxes.

Although I am somewhat nervous, I feel somewhat confident that President Trump will win tomorrow. I just think that the voter pools used by many of the news outlets (to construct a viable \\"likely voter\\" model) is flawed. I believe that many pollsters are predicting an across-the-board turnout similar to 2020 (by rate rather than numbers). However, that election defied most election analysis conventions because of the pandemic. Even in November 2020, the local, state and national response to the pandemic resulted in an extraordinarily high number of voters at home. This included many schools and colleges being completely shut down. Younger voters were strongly in Biden's (and a rabid anti-Trump) camp. This is NOT the case in 2024. Everything is open. Student turnout (among high school seniors and college students) will probably be closer to what it was in 2016. The same is true of younger workers. If the polls are inaccurate due to overestimating the rate of 18-25 turnout, then I believe that this will shift the overall turnout and numbers in President Trump's favor.","title":"Final 2024 Electoral College and National Poll Predictions"},{"text":"Ridiculous.

Her coalition is ever broader because it includes Republican women, who know that they may lose even more of their rights if they put their vote behind Trump.\\n**\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1gjv3hp/women_can_put_kamala_harris_over_the_top/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \\"Version 2.02, ~696090 tl;drs so far.\\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \\"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\\") | *Top* *keywords*: **vote**^#1 **Trump**^#2 **Harris**^#3 **women**^#4 **poll**^#5","title":"Women Can Put Kamala Harris Over the Top"},{"text":"Come onnnnnnn!!!!!!!","title":"Georgia"},{"text":"not seeing it. the order states absentee ballots received after 7pm nov 5 will not be counted. there is nothing there abouts the offices.Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration (the Board) may count only those absentee ballots received by the statutory deadline of 7:00 p.m. on Election Day, November 5, 2024.","title":"Georgia"},{"text":"Vote Trump and free Ross, get a Libertarian in the Cabinet and a department with Elon and Ron Paul to slash the size of government.

Bush tried to swoop in with TARP.Obama continued with TARP, then expanded it. He did similar things to that Auto industry. The growth and expansion of TARP+ and similar techniques while those industries rebounded without anyone who caused the crisis to be held accountable was a massive cause of populist anger.Obama was dealt a difficult stating hand from Bush, no question.Obama as part of his reelection campaign and his legacy now, boasts about how he handled the crash and recovery. Trump was leading the charge on the Obama birthed conspiracy Yes he was, without a doubt.The Tea Party was the right wing movement of this populist anger at the government following the financial crisis.Was there plenty of racism and general disdain for liberal elites mixed in on top of the more reasonable populist gripe? *Yes, of course there was*.But the Tea Party populist backlash that divided both the Republican and Democrat parties at the end of the Obama years doesnt happen if (a) Obama held bankers accountable, and (b) economic recovery was more even and felt by those in more depressed areas, not just rich coastal areas.Would Trump have tried racist birther stuff? Yeah probably, but I doubt he would have gotten as far. We were gonna build a wall to keep the Mexicans out Yes, Trump scapegoated immigrants and had no real plan to fix the issue. Yes, building a wall is a stupid solution the problem.That said, many border towns are feeling the cost of undocumented immigration - and immigration from the developing world has surged in Europe &amp; Canada too with major backlash. This is an area where, as clumsy and stupid as Trumps framing is, is rooted in a fairly legitimate concern that is growing.

The Green, Socialist, and Communist Party Presidential candidates are impotent to bring attention to ethical, Just, and non-treasonous alternatives faithful to the People. However, we need to run alternatives in every congressional district in the US (as well as state legislative and municipal legislative districts). These legislative districts are invariably drawn so skewed to one or the other of the party duopoly that there is no spoiler effect whatsoever (in any sense imaginable). For example, the Democrat might ordinarily win 80% of the vote and the Republican 20%. A Green, Socialist, or Communist can run in the district and if they take more than half of the votes from the Democrat, that turns into a breakdown such as 41% Green,  39% Democrat, and 20% Republican. Theres no way for someone that doesnt want the Republican to win to end up suffering from that fate when they vote their conscience (incidents pervade with a  similar skew toward the Republican candidate that opens up the same opportunity for a candidate faithful to the constituents of the district to win without any concern for spoilage).","title":"Thoughts on the concept of \\"spoiler\\", as applied to US federal elections"},{"text":"Atta girl","title":"Women Can Put Kamala Harris Over the Top"},{"text":"I am happy this person is voting correctly, but really, it shouldn't be because it's someone you already care about.

That's 80+ years of fighting. Meanwhile their numbers have skyrocketed. Meanwhile in seven years of Yemeni civil war, up to 350,000+ people have been killed. In Sudan, where civil war has been ongoing for a year, up to 150,000 people have died. At the height of the Holocaust up to 14,000 Jews were killed per day, with a final death count of 6,000,000.I understand that many on the pro-Hamasnik side are living in a post-information state where anything can be characterized by however your agenda demands, which in this case is demonization of Jews and cheapening of *actual* genocides (for example, the Holocaust, where six million of Europe's Jews were killed). But the Israeli conflict with Hamas, who (and I'm just shocked that this somehow just bypasses your attention over and over) uses their children as shields, is not a genocide. The Arabs of the Levant still speak Arabic and eat whatever Arab food Hamas releases to them, they still practice Islam and hate Jews - they're not being culturally exterminated, they're not being put in camps, they're not being firebombed. They are being subjected to the horrors of refusing to end warfare with their neighbor and electing a government of islamist extremists who attacked Israel during a ceasefire.Words don't just mean whatever you want them to mean, even if it cynically demonizes the side you don't like (you know, the ones whose country was formed as a result of *actual* genocide, about half of whom are descended from the 800k+ Jews thrown out of their homes in Arab countries).","title":"I am an Arab American voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"He meddled in it by doing nothing at the time that Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced.

North Fulton and south Fulton county are very different and the Fulton you all dislike is south Fulton where downtown Atlanta is. North Fulton is mostly suburban and includes Johns Creek, Alpharetta, Milton (3 of the richest areas in the state) and Roswell. North Fulton tends to go more conservative, especially Alpharetta and Johns Creek. I live in one of these 4 cities and I wish we would break off of Fulton County and go back to being Milton County like we were until the 1920s. We do not think like the downtown/midtown/hood folks. Not at all. North Fulton consistently scores nationally among elite places for raising a family, schools, amenities, housing, food scene, etc. We are not downtown. !obligatory I already voted down ballot R including against this dork Ashwin Ramaswami up here.
