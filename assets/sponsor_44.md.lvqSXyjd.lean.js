Can people not imagine how racist, and misogynistic he is and will be? All one has to do is remember how terrible trump's first term was. Leaving covid aside, which was handled so poorly, he increased taxes for the middle class (me), left us with a huge deficit (1 trillion dollars), made cultural divisiveness and hatred ok, enriched his family and himself through grifting, cheating and lying. Then of course, we still have his 34 indictments for fraud, and guilty verdicts in the E.Jean Carrol trials to admire. This guy has filed for bankruptcy 6 times with one of them being a casino. How the hell do you bankrupt a casino even if it's used for corruption? That should be a no brainer. Somehow he made it a sign of being a real man to cheat on 3 wives with hookers in some instances. To me, trump is primordial sludge, not even close to being a real man. Now, even his closest allies in his administration (Pence, McMilley, John Kelly, Mark Meadows, Cassidy Hutchinson, et al) are not supporting him and encouraging others to not do so either. He wants to discontinue the US constitution, seek revenge on people that he sees as disloyal to him and/or actively oppose him. There is nothing redeeming about this orange creature. The bottom line is that no matter who you are, trump will find some way to come after you personally, your security or your money.","title":"Alabama Republican explains voting for Kamala Harris in new ad: I voted for Trump ...

The way the electoral college map currently is, this is extremely relevant. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, she gets to 269. Omahas one electoral is what will put her over the top to 270. It is her most likely path to victory.One other state does this as well: Maine. Just as NE-2 is blue, ME-2 is red. Just as Nebraska is controlled by Republicans, Maine is controlled by Democrats. So the two balance each other out. If one decides to tilt the field by changing the rules to winner take all, the other one would do so in retribution to exactly cancel it out. ?Except: Maines constitution has a clause that laws dont take effect until 90 days after they pass. So if Republicans in Nebraska waited until very close to the election to change the rules, Maine couldnt balance it out in time. Trump would have a much higher chance of winning. They tried to do just this. Trump urged them to. Lindsay Graham personally met with their legislators to plead with them to. They almost did: they were just short because the state senator representing Omaha (a moderate former Democrat) refused because he wants to run for mayor later.In 2022 Democrats won two state senate seats by a handful of votes. One by 234 votes, the other by 82. If these races had gone the other way, Republicans would have had to votes to pull off the last minute rule switch, the consequences of which may have very well changed the outcome of the Presidential election.So no. You never know how these small things might snowball into big things. As long as Republicans up and down are giving their loyalty to Donald Trump I am not giving them any power.

In 2016, Trump was a break with the norm. In 2020, a lot of people were uncomfortable with the covid restrictions (lasting 8 months at that point) but couldn't say it in polite company. I think both created a lot of substantial quiet Trump swing voters who didn't show up in polling.I have to believe those days are gone. What is different in 2024 is abortion. To a lot of men answering the polls, abortion is an abstraction not something that's going to really swing their votes. To a lot of swing state women, it is all too real. Sure they might sympathize with pro-lifers, but if you've gone through a pregnancy or are planning to have a child or even just worry about an accidental pregnancy, you're now faced with the actual question of whether you are going to show up to the ER and be refused care if something goes wrong. And I have to imagine there are a lot of purple-state women who have that on their mind, but feel uncomfortable discussing it or saying it to a pollster because their friends and family are long-time pro-lifers who never had to wrestle with this issue for real. Also, this demographic is evenly distributed across the key states.How many of these women need to make the decision to show up to vote, switch their vote, or abstain in order to swing the election? 2-3%?

Especially not nothing when considering third parties like the Greens take ZERO corporate or lobbyist/PAC money. Correct, that's nothing.  It doesn't matter if they get those things because a first-past-the-post system guarantees a two party system is the only stable configuration.  The best a third party could do without electoral reform is replace one of the current parties, and then the two party polarization dynamic resumes.  This is an inevitable mathematical truth of a first-past-the-post system.  Additionally, it would be cheaper to literally lobby congress to make ranked choice voting a thing than it would be to get a third party passed the 5% line.  And that assumes republicans wouldn't yank funding for a third party or raise the threshold from 5% to 15%...you don't really trust them after all this, do you?And the data of PA independents to date does not support the theory they are voting for a non-major party.

It's literally nail-bitingly close and the polls *will* be off by a certain margin. To what direction, only turnout will tell us. If Democrats command turnout like they did in 2020 and 2022, this race is ours. If current trends continue from 2020 and 2022, this race is ours. If the polls are wrong in favor of the the same direction as they did in 2020, we lose. If they are wrong in the same direction as 2022, we win.

I don't think Biden would have won without him being up against Trump, and voters being more motivated to vote against Trump than for Biden. Secondly, we live in a country full of people with disparate views. While you and I may agree that what is happening in Gaza is a genocide, many more people in the United States do not feel this way, are misinformed, or prioritize the rights of Israel over everything else. Harris stands to lose more votes if she were to take a hard stance against Israel than if she doesn't, but there may still be enough third-party and non-voters to keep her from winning. That doesn't mean that those voters \\"don't matter\\" to her C just that she needs to appeal to the majority opinion, in an effort to get in a position to enact any Democratic/progressive policy whatsoever.I agree with you that US voters absolutely should exercise their right to not support candidates/policies they disagree with. I also believe that this is most effective in primary and local elections. For presidential elections, I think it is naive to not consider the compromising that has to take place in order to get elected in a country of 330 million people. I firmly believe in the concept of \\"voting isn't a marriage, it's public transport.\\" You're not waiting for your perfect match that aligns with you on every issue. You're \\"taking the bus\\" C voting for the candidate that gets you closer to your destination, not the one that sends you in the opposite direction.I understand it is frustrating, disheartening, even morally repugnant to vote for someone who you so fundamentally disagree with on such a serious issue. But there is only one candidate in this election who has a chance of winning and also a chance of enacting progressive policies of any kind, and that's Kamala Harris. Choosing to not vote for her is therefore voting against progressive interests.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"It's totally a vibes election.

In his own words, the liberals do so in order to gain power or retain power.\\"\\nResponse:?\\nPolitics is all about power and human nature is primarily understood via incentives/motivations. Humans are self interested by every action they do. Politicians act in a self interested way to win elections, and the system sets it up in a way that the incentive is to make the people they work for happy. This self interest and power is necessary to our system and for prosperity.??\\nAnother fact is that we work with different groups or factions in life if we have a common interest. The entire Democratic party has unions, LGBT, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, Blue Dog Democrats or moderates, women, younger voters, progressives, environmentalists, gun control advocates, public sector workers and teachers (I do realize some of these categories overlap). I'm a moderate white liberal myself but I understand that holding together a coalition this large is difficult. Just because these different factions use each other for power, doesn't make any of them evil.?\\nArg:\\n\\"This is fully seen in how the liberal of today talks about social justice and moral issues especially on Reddit. Issues that would traditionally be seen as important to liberals causes that affect minorities, and other contentious issues are thrown out the window as soon as it seems it may hurt the chances of a Democrat winning the election.\\"\\nResponse:\\nIf you have no political power, then how can you affect any change in a serious manner? How can you pass legislation? How can you obtain more funding for critical institutions such as schools, daycares, police, infrastructure, after school programs? Like imagine if African Americans had no power, Democrats had no power, and Republicans/conservatives had all the power. How do we obtain change? If you say through activism that's all fine and dandy, but if you completely discount politics and our political institutions, then you shouldn't care about politics in the first place and just volunteer.?\\nCan you give me some examples of contentious issues??\\nArg:\\n\\"Many liberals on Reddit say things like if you even question Whether the democratic option is a good choice or matches your policies than you are aligned with fascism or dont care about women/whichever other vulnerable demographic they can use as a card. This is manipulative and is reflective of Malcolms argument\\"\\nResponse:?\\nIf you don't think the democratic option is a good choice, then what are your alternatives? Authoritarianism when it comes to systems of government. Anarchism is a meme. Volunteering or mutual aid or protests is great and all, but what solidifies change is legislation (Civil Rights Act of 1964, or with the Supreme Court who is approved by the Senate who is voted into office, aka Brown v Board of Education).?\\nArg:\\n\\"When its in fashion and low stakes, then its okay to criticize Israel for their crimes but when its election time we have to ignore all of their faults and behave as their #1 supporter.\\"\\nResponse:\\nOkay, let's say that Democrats such as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support genocide. They get off to it. They love it. You can't support them because you don't want to ignore your faults.?\\nSo what happens next?\\nIf Republicans are elected, Palestinians get fucked harder by a more pro Israel supporter. But okay, you hope to hold off another four years and that using your leverage of not voting, that it would have pushed the Democrats far enough left to be more pro Palestinian.?\\nWell, not supporting Clinton in 2016 didn't result in a radically leftist follow up candidate in 2020 (Biden). It's a gamble you're doing and not a very good one. And if they win without you, they realize your vote isn't needed and can go after other demographics who might be more amicable to them. Or you could also just lose again in 2024 or 2028.

But that was a hope, not a goal of the protestors.They don't even have a real plan or attainable goals, Israel isn't going to willingly dismantle itself.Again, the protests I visited and aided had clearly stated goals and demands (where applicable).

They generally included divestment, and sometimes actions against staff members who had engaged in wildly inappropriate behavior against students who expressed opposition to Israeli treatment of Palestinians (there was literally a professor at one of the universities who tried to make all students write an essay explaining why protests against Israel's actions were anti-semitic and racist, and another who retroactively changed the grades of any student who expressed support for the protests to make them fail his class).I don't know if all the protests were that organized or clear, and I think it's quite likely that many of them weren't. But in general I don't think it's fair to say protestors had no plan or no attainable goals. are deluding themselves and playing a game.I don't think most of the protestors considered it a game.  The ones at Columbia certainly didn't when a pro-Israel mob attacked them in their tents.","title":"CMV: MLKs true message has been distorted in American history"},{"text":"Freedom of one side's speech.","title":"Eminem Endorses Kamala Harris, Says She Will Protect Freedom of Speech"},{"text":"We're open primary in Michigan so we don't have to register, but for all practical purposes I do the same thing.

It is, by its nature, a chaotic and disorganized disaster on its very best days. This is true at local and state level elections too - there are just never enough staff to handle all the work - especially in a high engagement cycle such as this one.As others have suggested, dont be afraid to just walk into an office at this stage. An organizer will take your info and train you to knock doors and talk to voters. You will download an app (Reach, VAN, or PDI), they will give you a list of addresses, a script, and some literature. Go out there and tell voters to turn in their ballots!If youre feeling extra patriotic, you can offer to return their ballot to a polling place on their behalf (if the campaign trains you how to do this).Alternatively, is the mobilize link that somebody else provided.Ill also add one recommendation that I havent seen from others.

I'm glad to have changed your view on that. Like I can see that you consider Israel to be a 'colonial apartheid state,' with the only logical solution being to dismantle said state (that's the only way to decolonize). The kind of protests that result from a group that wants Israel to no longer exist and the messaging around that are not going to be conducive to the kind of protests you're going to appeal toI do not want Israel to exist *as an apartheid state*.  At this point I think it would ultimately be an extremely bad idea (to put it mildly) to try and just remove Israel as a state.  Any future solution has to involve the cooperation of Israelis and Palestinians. As for \\"the kinds of protests that result from\\" a view that colonialism is generally bad and we shouldn't support states that commit genocide, the fact that you insist peaceful protests against Israeli actions in Gaza can't happen only highlights the exact issue I was pointing out.When you're ostensibly protesting (hopefully not just 'online activism') and calling for divestment, are you expressing your views and chanting for colonialism (what you view as Israel) to end?Sometimes there are chants against apartheid and oppression, but mostly it's emphasizing a desire to stop the slaughter in Gaza and (when I participated/aided college protestors) advocating for divestment.The media is able to portray these protests as antisemitic, aggressive, violent, etc. because a huge number of people that are antisemitic and aggressive and violent are attracted to them.Are they?  Have there been widespread instances of anti-semitic violence directly tied to protests?  Because with any protest movement there are going to be some isolated incidents, but if you use those to characterize the entire movement then you're doing exactly the thing that I and others have been criticizing in this thread.  And you're doing exactly what people did with civil rights protestors and college students who opposed the Vietnam war and South African apartheid.You say \\"a huge number\\" of anti-semitic, aggressive, violent people are attracted to protests opposing violence and genocide.  What evidence do you have for that claim?When you speak about this, that's the quiet part you aren't saying. At a certain point, it's playing dumb. Or I just don't agree with you when you say *huge numbers of violent anti semites are attracted to protests against Israel's actions in Palestine*.So is it hypothetically possible to hold peaceful protests with an eye on divestment that will appeal to moderates? Hypothetically yes. Do I think that those protests are actually happening? I don't think that they are. Oh no I don't think protests that appeal to moderates are happening. But I actually don't really think that's possible on the issue of Palestine because the \\"moderate\\" position is political indifference to Israel's actions.  Nor do really think that trying to appeal to moderates is a worthwhile goal of protests most of time because moderates often hold moderate views because they are uncomfortable with stronger positions that would require change.","title":"CMV: MLKs true message has been distorted in American history"},{"text":" Almost all neighborhoods I've lived in 98% of the home owners kept to themselves and either had problems with one another or barely waved twice in passing once a yearYou ever think that is a \\"you\\" problem?","title":"Conservatives will soon be jailed for their beliefs"},{"text":"'member when Donald Trump immediately fired the Inspector General who was tasked with overseeing the dispersing of the Covid-era PPP loans?

First, from my understanding, the Bible is a collection of independent stories written by different people after the death of Jesus. Fornexample the gospels Matthew mark Luke and John and simplely those 4 peoples version of the story of what they saw Jesus say and do. There may have ben other people who wrote accounts as well. Later when the writings were decided to be put together in 1 book someone had to kind of decide what to put in there, and they alhad their reasons that I don't know.Second, if some books were removed from the Bible it could be because the church itself is corrupt. Jesus was not a religion, he came with a message on how to be saved. We made the religion afterwords. Jesus came to say that we just need to follow what he says and trust him. It would make sense that a corrupted church would want to hide certain important teachings so we cannot understand and follow Jesus correctly.Other than that, I dunno but I have learned to look into these questions rather than ask them hypothetically. As of today we have access to these removed books so if we need to know about the nephilim according to enoch or whatever its right there for anyone to read if they want to. Its just not with the rest of it.","title":"To Those Who See: Youve Broken the Illusion, but Control Runs Deeper Than You KnowFuture Chaos Will Forge the New World, and Youre Already Living Its Beginning."},{"text":"I actually think the lack of open primary ended up being an accidental strength.?","title":"I'm pretty black-pilled on this election guys but I hope you all prove me wrong"},{"text":"No thank you.

Whereas in a remote setting they are less willing to seek help and when they do, it's slower and less extensive. But obviously this comes at the cost of disrupting senior productivity, since it's time you spend helping them instead of doing your own work. And depending on the company and junior retention, the former or the latter may be more profitable. Or perhaps a junior that turns to senior assistance as a very last resort, after exhausting all other options, is preferable to the company, indicating resourcefulness and intelligence. You should compare how often juniors ask for help, and much time you spent mentoring them, in an in-office vs. a remote setting.

At the same time, a grassroots petition describing an existential crisis in the Liberal party was demanding an urgent secret ballot vote  both inside the caucus room and at the partys national executive  on whether Trudeau really should stay on in the face of months of bad polls that place his party well behind Pierre Poilievres Conservatives.  With Parliament Hill abuzz with speculation about Trudeaus future, entrances to West Block were jammed with reporters and staffers keen to press MPs on what will happen inside the mornings high stakes Liberal caucus meeting.  [...] Judy Sgro said the dissenters have damaged the Liberal party and should have privately raised their concerns with the prime minister.  When you look divided, you look weak, she said. Its not necessary to do what is going on today.  Sameer Zuberi pushed back against the put up or shut up sentiment [by Francis Drouin], saying its the first time caucus is having this important conversation and he doesnt expect today to be the end of it. The petition describing a crisis in the party  titled Code Red Petition  was started by a group of mostly young Liberals, said Alfred Apps, a lawyer in Toronto and longtime Liberal supporter who helped edit the document. The petition is accompanied by a memorandum that details how the modern Liberal party is struggling in many corners of the country, and names Poilievre as our enemy who has harnessed the power of the internet to win support and rake in more donations than the federal Liberals.  The document also criticizes the Trudeau governments policy problem, decrying how gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has dropped in Canada. It calls for the party to address the leadership issue through a secret ballot vote in caucus and at the partys national executive, and that if Trudeau decides to resign he should announce his choice as quickly as possible.  [...] Unlike the Conservatives, who ousted their former leader Erin OToole in a caucus vote, the Liberals decided not to adopt parliamentary rules that give their caucus that power.  Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, a Liberal from Torontos BeachesEast York, said he didnt expect a secret ballot vote on Wednesday. But he said he would like to see some sort of future vote, possibly in Trudeaus caucus, to provide finality to the question of the prime ministers leadership.  I think a secret ballot vote in caucus, you know, at some time in the foreseeable future, makes a certain amount of sense, said Erskine-Smith, who has also voiced support for a partywide vote on the leaders status. !ping Can","title":"Code Red petition from Liberals urges secret ballot on Justin Trudeaus leadership"},{"text":"Just remember, crew, we're less than 2 weeks away from Election Day.

I think most people have loved to hate him for a very long time, why the apprentice was so popular. But yeah, I'm not sure anyone should idolize the man, not exactly a pious life.

I'm sure I could point to real-world examples and you'd say 'yeah that's a good example of what you're talking about,' and I'm sure you could point to real world examples and I would say that it's a good example of what you're talking about. Why do you think this?My opinions are informed by my experiences at universities in Toronto.Despite what the media might have you believe, the college protestors also have had pretty clear and specific demands in most cases that I'm aware of (divestment for the most part).This I quite disagree with, based on my personal experiences. Like I can see that you consider Israel to be a 'colonial apartheid state,' with the only logical solution being to dismantle said state (that's the only way to decolonize). The kind of protests that result from a group that wants Israel to no longer exist and the messaging around that are not going to be conducive to the kind of protests you're going to appeal to. The media is able to portray these protests as antisemitic, aggressive, violent, etc. because a huge number of people that are antisemitic and aggressive and violent are attracted to them. When you speak about this, that's the quiet part you aren't saying. At a certain point, it's playing dumb. So is it hypothetically possible to hold peaceful protests with an eye on divestment that will appeal to moderates? Hypothetically yes. Do I think that those protests are actually happening? I don't think that they are. When you're ostensibly protesting (hopefully not just 'online activism') and calling for divestment, are you expressing your views and chanting for colonialism (what you view as Israel) to end? If yes, then that goes far beyond what you're talking about, and is the kind of thing I'm criticizing. If no, then aren't you trying to just hide your true beliefs and then getting upset that people see the real intent behind your words?","title":"CMV: MLKs true message has been distorted in American history"},{"text":"If they had better turnout Texas could absolutely be blue.

America, just like the whole world, went through two years of high inflation which caused prices to rise significantly and real wages to drop, the first link below has a graph that demonstrates that rise in inflation. That is why you are worse off than you were 4 years ago. However, that was the economy two years ago, the economy today is doing great and real wages are rising. They're just not back to 2020 levels yet. the second link charts real wages and shows they've been rising since Q2 2022.[https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/latest-inflation-statistics/?tpt=b#what-is-the-current-inflation-rate](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/latest-inflation-statistics/?tpt=b#what-is-the-current-inflation-rate)[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q)In the context of this election and liberal propaganda there are a few considerations. Was the high inflation Biden's fault? No, it was caused by covid and the Ukraine war and the entire world suffered from it. Did Biden make the situation better or worse? It's not possible to say for sure but what is known is that America under Biden performed better than all of America's peers. Will a Trump presidency cause prices to fall? No, America is close to the 2% inflation which is what governments aim for, prices will continue to rise at a similar target rate under either Trump or Harris. Will wages rise higher under Trump or Harris, it is impossible to say for sure but most economists believe the economy will perform better under Harris as reported in the below link.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/14/two-thirds-of-economists-think-inflation-would-be-worse-under-trump-than-harris-poll-finds/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/14/two-thirds-of-economists-think-inflation-would-be-worse-under-trump-than-harris-poll-finds/)All the data is general, there will be places in America where wages are rising faster and places where wages are rising slower, there may still be places were are falling.

If (again, IF) Harris loses, it'll be clear to most that the youth vote is fickle and not reliable, and we may not be able to sustain continued losses in those key three groups anymore.  I'm not sure Democratic Party planners could handle another election dominated by unengaged youth voters, if that ends up being part of the story.    Now, you're absolutely right that the primary system benefits progressives, and a candidate with sense will lurch left during that time (same with normal Republicans lurching right during theirs).  You're also right in that we have a back bench filled with quality candidates who are solid Democrats that are not right wing.  But the real key to winning a Democratic presidential primary is whether a candidate can win the black vote, and time after time that will lead towards the more moderate Democrat winning over the progressive champion(s).  Obama, who was a moderate but perceived as more liberal than Clinton during the primaries, may be the exception to this rule for obvious reasons.  The reality is, I wouldn't be surprised if the Democratic Party lurches right REGARDLESS of the election result--if Harris wins, it may be on the backs of crossover Republicans and there will be many who will wish to try to keep them in the fold.  As I said before, the youth vote is fickle, the labor vote is starting to stratify along social-economic, gender, race, and education lines rather than union affiliation, and progressives are not particularly powerful in the federal government (in particular, we've seen a gradual shift by progressives, e.g., AOC, towards more pragmatic leadership).  Even if Harris wins, a shift right may be the best chance the Democratic Party wins in the post-Trump era.","title":"If Harris loses, expect Democrats to move right"},{"text":"They don't trust anyone.

In justifying a cause people will distort facts to either prove or disprove others actions. NeoNazis will distort WWI and II, Hitler, and Jews in order to justify their beliefs. Staunch supporters of Mao or Stalin will dismiss deaths under their regimes. Capitalists will dismiss the faults of capitalism or the benefits of communism/socialism. Communists/socialists will do the opposite. A British loyalist in the early 1800s was probably distorting the Americans' views and actions. People who support the lost cause are going to leave out or distort facts about the Confederate states.No one has the time to be an expert or specialist in everything and this often leads to simplification and distortion of facts. People often use this fact to push an agenda. Much of what you know about American history or that you were taught in school is probably distorted or leaves out key facts in order to give you a general idea of what has happened in history because otherwise we would be in schools for our entire lives if we went into extremely complex subjects to their fullest extent.I think this is more of a change your perspective instead of change your view. Much of what you have learned in school has been sanitized and propogandized on top of being simplified for the sake of understandability. Everything is complex and school is often the end point of people's learning outside of their focus in college/life.People who push a simplified, sanitized, and a technically incorrect version of MLK may be doing it for specific reasons or simply because they learned it years ago since most classrooms aren't going to cover every nuance of moments in history even if they are as impactful as the civil rights movement.

Period.\\"When is the last time the DNC had debates and a primary with a with a sitting incumbent capable (in legal terms) and intent on serving a second term?Likewise, when was the last time senior members of party of the President disparaged him and encouraged him to drop out well into his campaign?This is relatively uncharted waters and a huge risk in revealing potential disunity in the party, weakening their image.Lichtman endorses candidates because he has personal preferences like we all do. His personal preference with Hillary didn't align with his predictions for a Trump win in 2016.The writing was patently on the wall that Biden would lose in a blow-out the moment he stepped on that debate stage. Nobody wins with Carter-level approval ratings that consistent, capped off with a scandal that large.I think his move to drop out and endorse Harris was correct but I'm not convinced all the signs necessary for your assessment actually presented themselves at that point in time. I thought at that time it was a risk with potential failure but a worthwhile one. The risk of a contentious contest was real given how 2016 played out.","title":"James Carville: Why Im Certain Kamala Harris Will Win"},{"text":"In hindsight, this really makes me question picking Kamala to replace Biden.

Or not a voter at all. As long as life moves on, you can find housing, food isn't outrageously expensive and your kids have hope and a future, you don't buckle too much. You don't pay attention too much. Once the political parties declare war on the working class, then spit in their faces, then gaslight them about using their taxdollars for endless grift and bullshit, and are owned by their corporate donor overlords, and then life turns to shit for real everyday people, then they STOP HAVING A REASON TO STAY LOW INFORMATION. When you are being fucked by your government, any government, at any point in human history, the \\"plebs\\" then work to become informed. You want to know who is killing your children's future. You want to know why the streets aren't safe. You want to know why billions are sent overseas for all kinds of bullshit, while American veterans, many are homeless and have no help. Then the \\"institutions\\" get captured and declare war on the working class. The mainstream media then just becomes propaganda. The public schools turn into training academies to churn out new cannon fodder for the DNC. America's children become some huge social experiment for some whack jobs and those who have never worked a real day in their entire lives. Politicians are nothing better than parasite. But here's the difference. The current establishment Democrats are like parasites who drink so much blood that it kills the host. A parasite who wants to live just drinks enough, tries to hide, not try to generate too much attention, realizing you can't kill the host and still survive yourself. This is the why the worst elements of the establishment Democrats, the lunacy of The Squad on law and order, and the neocons on the right side of the aisle are morons. They have no sense of self preservation. Everytime Psaki and Karine Jean Pierre were sent out to gaslight us, it was attempt to call us all too stupid to see the truth. That's all Biden, Harris, Obama, Pelosi, Schumer, Jeffries, Whitmer, Newsom, Buttigieg and the rest have for working class America. Just trying to shame us, call us bigots or racists, talk down to us, and call us stupid because it's pretty obvious at this point that they believe the United States should be a new feudal system where the working class are nothing but serfs. They hate us. They see us and see our children and believe our kids will only grow up to be just good enough to clean their bathrooms. Now you have a groundswell of working class American voters who are INFORMED. The path to speed of information has created more ability to see behind the veil of how modern politics really works. You cannot declare war on the working class and win. We are the mob. We are the tide. We define actual momentum. Once mobilized, these elected officials can't stop us. Just like all throughout history, when the Kings and Lords let the commoners starve, finally the commoners had enough. And then what happened? We all know what happened. There is no talking point, no messaging, no gaslighting that will work once a political party starves your kids. Goes after your children. Establishment Democrats, the ones in power now, are a bunch of feckless gutless incompetent morons. Paid off by donors that only prove they are bunch of whores.

Harris and Walz have two choices: they can give progressive voters what they want and commit to end arms shipments to Israel, or they can not. One of these helps Trump to win. Harris and Walz are choosing that choice. Therefore, they are helping Trump win. Its still irrelevant. The voters still have the same two choices. Just because the good choice has been made slightly worse because of your theoretical scenario that doesnt mean that its OK to let the still even worse option win. This is kindergarten level stuff, really. If you actively or indirectly let the more evil option win, and that option is truly a bad option, then you have done something bad.I agree, it is kindergarten level stuff. If Harris knowingly makes a choice that results in fewer Harris votes, she is helping Trump to win. She will have done something bad. If Harris announced, tomorrow, that marijuana will be rescheduled to Schedule 1, then she would be doing something bad by doing something that is unpopular that would help the evil option win. I think that people making choices that help the evil option win is evil. Kamala D. Harris is a person making a choice that is helping the evil option to win. Therefore, Harris is doing something evil, and by your position, should suffer. This is \\"if P, then Q\\" type stuff.

I know Trump getting elected will have real and deeply scary consequences. It boils my blood that the candidate and party screaming the loudest about voter fraud and stolen elections is actually the party perpetrating fraud and attempting to overturn election results. I'm not diminishing any of that.Nevertheless, just by creating this post, she very likely canceled out their dishonest behavior. She's already done the absolute best thing she could possibly do about it - make an anonymous post and rile up other Michiganders. Her submission has thousands of upvotes and will be seen by thousands more. I can easily see this leading to more than one person voting who would have otherwise forgotten to get to the polls.If I were her, I would take the success of this post as a win and leave it at that. She might consider cross-posting to other subs if she feels the details of her situation are sufficiently anonymous. You correctly point out that the penalties could be severe, but she also needs to consider that such an investigation might lead to inquiries about her sister's mental capacity. That could mean a distressing and harmful invasion into her private life, and even then, there's no guarantee that her vote would be nullified in time or that her parents would ever be punished. She could potentially put her sister through a lot of scrutiny and trauma for absolutely no upside.Though I truly do care about election integrity, and as much as I would love to bask in the schadenfreude of Trump supporters being caught in their own hypocrisy, her sister's well being is more important. Frankly, her relationship with her asshat parents is important too. My entire family supports Trump. I understand how infuriating it is to watch people we love vote against their own self interests and let a malignant narcissist bring out the worst in them.

People like to compare it to 2020 as if Republicans will significantly turn out more on election day but 2020 was a very unusual year where there was a pandemic and early voting was heavily politicized. This year, there is less of a reason for Democrats to vote early or by mail and Republicans have embraced early voting more. This will inevitably lead to a closing of a gap between both parties and perhaps parity in all voting methods. That would mean the election day vote should be more Democrat than usual, not because more Dems are turning out (though that will be part of it) but Republican election day votes being banked early. At the end of the day a vote is a vote so Trump voters voting early isn't an extra vote in his favor.That probably explains the apparent doubling of early votes too compared to 2020. That can either be explained by a huge surge in engagement from 2020 (which I doubt given how highly engaged the electorate was in 2020 too) or the other half of the electorate that votes on election day deciding to vote early instead.","title":"Nevada Republicans take 3-point lead over Democrats in early voting turnout"},{"text":"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0\\\\_H3F84Yjk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0_H3F84Yjk)","title":"Former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard Joins Republican Party, Endorses Trump at NC Rally"},{"text":"Greg Locke is a notorious snowflake on X/Twitter who is quick to silence his critics by blocking them.All it took was once act of criticism for that loser to block me","title":"Kamala Harris is a Witch according to them."},{"text":"She deserves more and you know it.","title":"Kamala Harris vows to double federal minimum wage to $15"},{"text":"Yes, hes one handsome devil.

Like, I acknowledge that the only reason he was the frontrunner is the other candidates were splitting the non-socialist vote.Then after the primary had run for a while, backroom deals were made, and every candidate other than Hillary dropped out and endorsed her, explicitly encouraging their supporters to support Hillary. In contrast, Trump had a very similar start, where the \\"normal Republican\\" vote was split among a large number of candidates giving him an early frontrunner position. However in his case, when Republicans dropped out, they didn't explicitly endorse anyone, meaning more of their supporters ended up supporting the current frontrunner (Trump).","title":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Calls Out Trumps McDonalds Cosplay: 'They Are Making Fun Of Us'"},{"text":"Reddit has been strongly left leaning for well over a decade, but it has definitely gotten more noticeable in the past 5 years.","title":"What is going on on Reddit?"},{"text":"Don't worry, newsweek will post an article for both within seconds of each other.","title":"Democrats fear race may be slipping away from Harris"},{"text":"I fucking love Tulsi Gabbard.","title":"Tulsi Gabbard, former Democratic candidate for president, joins Republican party at Trump rally"},{"text":"This is so true.

In truth, the most influential contemporary Bolsheviks  the people who began, like Lenin and Trotsky, on the extremist fringes of political life and who are now in positions of power and real influence in several Western countries  come from a different political tradition altogether.Donald Trump, Viktor Orban, Nigel Farage, Marine Le Pen and Jaroslaw Kaczynski: although they are often described as far-right or alt-right, these neo-Bolsheviks have little to do with the right that has been part of Western politics since World War II, and they have no connection to existing conservative parties. In continental Europe, they scorn Christian Democracy, which had its political base in the church and sought to bring morality back to politics after the nightmare of the Second World War. ...To an extraordinary degree, they have adopted Lenin's refusal to compromise, his anti-democratic elevation of some social groups over others and his hateful attacks on his \\"illegitimate\\" opponents. Law and Justice, the illiberal nationalist ruling party in Poland, has sorted its compatriots into \\"true Poles\\" and \\"Poles of the worst sort.\\" Trump speaks of \\"real\\" Americans, as opposed to the \\"elite.\\" Stephen Miller, a Trump acolyte and speechwriter, recently used the word \\"cosmopolitan,\\" an old Stalinist moniker for Jews (the full term was \\"rootless cosmopolitan\\"), to describe a reporter asking him tough questions. \\"Real\\" Americans are worth talking to; \\"cosmopolitans\\" need to be eliminated from public life.\\nThe article had tons of revisionism about history I could go into, one example is how she falsely labelled the early Soviet famines (1920's, 1930's) as \\"accidental administrative fuckups\\" by incompetent socialists, when they were in truth more malevolent, the acts were political and intentionally applied to dissident regions (much like Britain did to Bengal, Ireland, or Israel is doing to Gaza), but I digress The psychological tactics I cited are useful because they cite private journals by people like Stalin, recollecting on events where they raised the morale of the troops","title":"Zaid: \\"The Kamala Harris campaign kicked out a prominent Muslim Democrat from the vice presidents rally\\" And no he didn't disrupt or do anything that prompted it.

All three of these people are connected to [Dmytro Firtash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash), the oligarch who was bankrolling the investigation.The reporting that he was doing the whole time at The Hill was blatantly being done in concert with Trump, and Trump himself didn't even hide it - he tweeted and talked about Solomon's articles.

If it were such a big issue that all these laws needed to be passed, you'd think there would be some significant evidence that it was a real problem.I agree with the idea on paper, but the problem doesn't exist and its implementation is done with the sole purpose of disenfranchising legal voters the GOP doesn't want voting.","title":"CMV: If you believe Democracy is at risk then you should support Voter ID"},{"text":"What part of this election hasnt been exhausting?

First, MLK's protests normally targeted the folks who were the problem. They would go to a place where there were oppressive laws and protest there, disrupting the lives of those people. College protests of today just disrupt the lives of other college students who have nothing to do with the problem. There is some circuitous talk used to justify this as though tuition dollars paid by university students are a major funding source for objectionable policies, but that's just nonsense. There is some claim that university endowments should divest from investments that support unjust wars, but the targeted investments are usually just S&amp;P 500 index funds. If universities sell their S&amp;P 500 index funds, it is not even going to cause a ripple in US foreign policy or foreign aid levels. Second, MLK's language was invitational. He understood that, for society to change, some people's minds had to be changed. That means starting with people who don't agree with you, and winning them over. This principle has been utterly abandoned today. Nowadays on both sides, the normal reaction to those on the other side is disengagement. On the rare occasions when we do engage with those who don't already agree with us, the interactions usually consist of shutting them down, shouting over them, or ridiculing them.

MLK and his supporters would go to a city where they identified injustice and stage a protest to make noise and disrupt. What is also missed is what MLK referred to as self-purification where supporters would be checked if they had any knives or weapons before being allowed to protest. They were also no allowed to break property or fight with police. The goal was to be attacked by police while doing nothing wrong to highlight the injustice of the system. MLK was arrested multiple times on purpose, his supporters were told to take the beatings by police on purpose in a large public protest all in order to show the brutal and unjust treatment they were subjected to in their regular lives.So in summary, no to the white moderate that was content with this injustice while it wasnt happening in their towns or television screens.

On Tuesday, November 5 this year, the United States will hold presidential elections. Instead of the decrepit Joe Biden, who has dropped out of the presidential race, the U.S. Democratic Party has nominated the gleefully laughing Kamala Harris to replace him. This is a violation of American electoral law, but no one cares about that when it comes to getting their candidate into the presidency.For all his stupidity, Kamala is a systemic politician. A fool like her has been able to stay on the political scene for so many years only because she is a system politician. That is, the kind of person who don't completely disgusts the big players in the military-industrial complex and the banking sector.Trump  is just an ambitious dodger who was in the right place at the right time. The living embodiment of the American dream.For the unpopular Kamala to become president, public opinion needs to be shaped urgently. There are bot farms that offer their services to anyone who can pay. And now these bots are working in all social networks. Someone needs to get Americans to vote for a silly Kamala. You can see the number of bots in this thread by the number of dislikes my post gets.Actually becoming president both Kamala and Trump would easily start World War III. Despite their wealth and social status, they have no experience in making momentous decisions.  Let's remember when President Trump brought the US 6th Fleet to the shores of North Korea...and quickly sailed back because Kim Jong-un aimed a nuclear torpedo at the California coast.","title":"What is going on on Reddit?"},{"text":"Thats the one!

Ita almost as if when Jesus is talking about his father he isn't talking about the guy they call yahweh who did all the things to humans like the flood.I also agree that God does not judge us and does not need to be worshipped and does not suffer from our negative emotions like jealousy.If anything, from reading the Bible, what makes sense to me(in the sense that why God is even asking anything of us at all) is the discussion of free will basically stating that while God is all loving and wants us to be happy, we have free will and that means we are capable of walking away from God if we choose.I don't believe that God wants to punish us or anything. If anything what I've taken from reading about Jesus is that God wants us to come back to him, but if we don't we will die and that is our choice.I don't know the truth, but that does kind of answer why God is asking us to do anything. Doesn't mean its true, but I also haven't found any other beliefs that seem true in any way. Also I feel like at the rate we're going we gonna need Jesus because last time I checked everyone with money and power is effectively worshipping evil and committing evil leading down the road to world enslavement. Certainly would like to see some counter force to this... doesn't seem anyone can stand up though and that I think puts people to have more faith in Jesus because he said he was gonna save us and there dont seem to be any other candidates right now.

Prior to 2016, you cannot say there were any issues w/normal peeps, not really. Politics was a side thing, not the main event in a relationship.  He was fine w/everything...but definitely watching fox &amp;now newsmax has indeed brainwashed these people. They are not getting the same news as the \\"real world\\"...the fact that the aftermath to covid economy sucks for these gop/maga to blame dems plus those fake testimonials&amp;videos of illegals supposedly invading have definitely achieved their objectives. It's very hard to change someone's mind  when they are convinced what they're watching/reading are real. He did ask me when I became a dem? Obviously,  we've never had to discuss any of this prior to tfg bc we seemed on same page in most things until gop went full fascism which he hasn't recognized.We've had several blow out and loud arguments.. we(my kids&amp;i) have tried explaining not to believe everything on tiktok or w/e bc anyone can claim w/e, but now got to the point I have to ignore his politics crap &amp; leave the room if he ever starts to spout nonsense.

What of the countless innocent children that must have perished in the floods, for one? It was an attempted genocide, nothing less. The moral solution to bad apples isn't and will never be to completely exterminate everyone around them just to make sure they're gone.The bible tells the story that Noah saved us, that god for some reason had a complete turn around and tried to save our species from his own attempt at exterminating it.I am from Brazil and my father's side of the family came from the Yuhupdeh river tribe, my grandpa is still a member even if my father was not.His tribe also have their own passed down story about the floods, and in it, it was not \\"Noah\\", or \\"god\\" who saved the humans on earth, but \\"underground people\\" who sheltered them in their underground homes. Now who do you suppose those people from below us might have been?When the catholic colonizers began taking the land from the natives in the 17th century, they found that many of the native tribes still worshipped caves, because their ancient saviors had come from there.In fact one of the most famous \\"holy pilgrimage sites\\" from the catholic church here in Brazil, called \\"S?o Thom das Letras\\", is a settlement founded over one of such caves. It is an ancient native sacred site repurposed by the church as a place of worship for their own god.It was plain censorship and appropriation. They say now that this cave was instead a holy site for St. Thomas, who traveled around the world in the past, helping ancient people, and he liked to rest in caves. They completely ignore the original reason the caves were worshipped by the natives way back then.This is just one reason why no one should blindly believe what the churches tell them about the story of our world , there are many cases of censorship and appropriation to fit a narrative, such as this.","title":"To Those Who See: Youve Broken the Illusion, but Control Runs Deeper Than You KnowFuture Chaos Will Forge the New World, and Youre Already Living Its Beginning."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/fe41w2tr0iwd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14d2622eb129524724d2e697ed1e5889bb8f71ee","title":"DON T BELIEVE IT ??"},{"text":"McDonals corporate approved this event ahead of time.They could have easily just said that using their brand for a partisan political stunt is not OK.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"Why Obama slamming Trump on his response to Covid matters"},{"text":"Twitter sucks tho man!","title":"Surreal experience seeing President Obama, Eminem, Elissa Slotkin and others tonight in Detroit."},{"text":"But what are those jobs?I live in a smallish town in Indiana.

If they think elections are not secure, they got two big ways to deal with it: 1) Actually demonstrate a problem with voter fraud or election security. They have, as of yet, failed to do this. I think that should be the end of it, but if they're still uneasy because of their feelings, they could;2) Propose measures that address both their concerns and the voter disenfranchisement issue. They have also, as of yet, failed to do this. Pouting about the mean democrats gets them absolutely nowhere closer to their stated goals. From there, I'm forced to conclude they're either completely incompetent or lying about their concerns.

The way primaries work just make it too difficult for someone who doesn't have the party administration's approval to win.Going way back to 2016 - the only reason Trump was able to run away with the primary is that when Republicans dropped out of the race they didn't really endorse anyone else.For example Jeb Bush - the candidate who had many of the \\"establishment\\" republicans behind him, dropped out Feb 21, and didn't endorse anyone until a month later, when he endorsed Ted Cruz. Far too late, with Super Tuesday already long in the past by that point.If that was a democrat primary, he'd have endorsed someone immediately after dropping out, to ensure the party-outsider (In this case Bernie) didn't get any of those supporters going his way. I know it's wild to compare Bernie and Trump, but if we think back to 2016, both were actually quite similar in that they were \\"party outsiders\\" running for presidential nomination, with a strong base of supporters that made them an early front runner, while the more \\"party insiders\\" were busy fighting each other.If you look back at Trump's primary results in 2016, he wasn't over 50% like he is now. If the Republicans had coordinated with each other and made backroom deals he'd never have been nominated.TL;DR The Democrats are too organised to ever allow a genuine progressive to win the nomination.","title":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Calls Out Trumps McDonalds Cosplay: 'They Are Making Fun Of Us'"},{"text":"I have seen them make posts on FB about how they should still vote even if they keep the top of the ticket empty.

But then I had a sort of \\"religious\\" experience that made me consider that maybe the old stories weren't just hogwash, but they were certainly not the whole truth.The lightbringer was the \\"fallen\\" creation of a tyrant god who'd demanded sacrifices and tried to exterminate humanity for petty reasons. That's almost a compliment.Your churches don't even trust you with the full story of your bibles, censoring whole parts of it away,  neither do they trust you to peruse the vatican archives, and somehow you are completely convinced the story they are telling you is completely true and unbiased.A rebel to a dictator such as the one in north korea would be considered a \\"fallen, disgraced person\\" in the eyes of their own society because of the brainwashing and propaganda, but we from the outside looking in would see him for what he is - just a person fighting for freedom. We would largely support that rebel, because we know the truth beyond propaganda.Lucifer is only a villain because his rebellion failed and history is written by the winners.Yahweh wanted a slave, controlled species, not a free thinking one. The Jehovah's witnesses have the right idea about what kind of god he was, they even call themselves \\"Yahweh's slaves\\" as a badge of honor and behave as such.A truly benevolent god/leader wouldn't punish their subjects for wanting to learn more, to awaken. The lightbringer's entire goal was to awaken us, to break us free from mindless worship and elevate us as a higher species.Imagine punishing your own children because they wanted to learn more, because they questioned your authority. It is no different from what extremist cultists still do nowadays.The fact that you're even here in an obscure conspiracy community, searching for answers beyond what the \\"system\\" tells you, rather than just accepting it all, makes you more luciferian than you'd ever care to admit.","title":"To Those Who See: Youve Broken the Illusion, but Control Runs Deeper Than You KnowFuture Chaos Will Forge the New World, and Youre Already Living Its Beginning."},{"text":"3 letters:LBJ","title":"Why Do Black People Vote for Democrats?"},{"text":"Emerson is only giving Cruz +1 in a Trump+6 sample?

At this stage, its mostly getting people to go vote, but well ask people what issue is most important to them in this election, then well talk about that. If they say immigration, we talk about how Kamala supports the border bill which Will hire more border patrol agents, improve physical barriers like fences and walls, and add money to other systems like immigration court to resolve peoples circumstances more quickly. If they say the economy we poke holes in Trumps tariffs and tax cuts for the rich while touting Kamalas plan for middle class tax cuts, child tax credits, and plans to address price gouging. And so on. Since people are skeptical of liberal media, I try to reference candidates actual words. Today Donald Trump said hell add tariffs to all imported goods. Do you think an added tax will lower prices? Or JD Vance said he wants to allow insurers to pool higher risk people together and charge people more for healthcare if they have preexisting conditions.

Its a losing battle, but we also try to push back on misinformation, mostly by expressing strong skepticism and asking them where they heard such information. Youre saying democrats abort babies after theyre born? Where has that happened? What states have laws making it legal to kill a baby after birth? Whered you hear that?

Trump is not the first candidate/president to run for/hold office with an advanced ailment, obviously Reagan is another. Wilson was basically bedridden during his last term, and his wife was actually our president during this time.What history shows us is that if someone achieves power in this country, and then their mind deteriorates, theyre actually a very attractive prospect to many Washington players. This is because they can now be used as a puppet. Thats why youd never see republicans try to replace trump. Not just because of the potential voter backlash, but because people around trump are salivating at the thought of putting an old, infirm, easily manipulated person in the White House-with not many years left to live statistically. Im sure theres a secret plan that the public and trump dont know about. And its all about how to use trump to manipulate various government levers. Im a teacher, I had to take a seminar recently. Drs have compiled data over the last few decades to show that more than 65% of our country is living their lives experiencing some kind of impairment as the result of childhood traumas.

Illegal immigrants cannot vote in any election.  There isn't any mechanism by which they could do so.  In order to vote, even in states that don't require voter ID, you need to go to the exact precinct polling station associated with a registered voter and give the name of that registered voter.  If you're trying to vote illegally and are caught, you face five years in prison in exchange for the one extra vote you're trying to add to a total of millions.  Every single time people have tried looking for evidence that this happens, like, anywhere, they've come up completely empty-handed.

They all say Trump is going to turn out unlikely voters for him. It'll be very funny if the unlikely voters all turn out - and vote Harris. That is the rhetoric, but it's nonsense. Trump already turned out the unlikely voters who are going to vote for him. But there are only so many people who are swayed by racism and sexism. When he was running against Biden, that was probably enough. But against Kamala, the entire dynamic changed. Suddenly we have a candidate who appeals to the *real* unlikely voters-- young voters, especially young women, minority women, and women in general. The idea that there are enough young men who will vote for Trump to overcome that is completely absurd.It's worth looking back to 2020 as a guide. 2020 had record turnout from young voters (18-29), more than in any election in US history (58%, up 9% from 2016). But despite Trump claiming to appeal to young voters, 65% of that bloc voted for Biden. Less than 35% voted for Trump. It's possible that he will have swung a few more young males after the last 4 years of his lies, but with the appeal to people who would have stayed home in 2020, plus the Dobbs backlash, I just don't see \\"unlikely voters\\" being a pathway to victory for Trump.","title":"Texas sees record early-voting numbers, particularly in Democratic-leaning areas"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|xnvgKamBwOucccvbSp|downsized)","title":"How to Delete Your McDonalds Account"},{"text":"The war in Ukraine is very different from interactions ROK army faces at the north border.","title":"Seoul demands North Korean troops leave Russia immediately"},{"text":"Thank you Newsweek, we seldom see equal opportunity propaganda being pumped out, and especially at such frequency.","title":"Democrats get silver lining in new Senate election report"},{"text":"i can't wait to go there","title":"Obama jokes his \\"palms are sweaty\\" after Eminem introduction at Detroit rally"},{"text":"I have an aunt and uncle who also were die hard Trump supporters.

I havent been ignoring polls, but I am looking at all the polls. Presidential polling absolutely makes no sense this cycle. There are statewide and local polls that show Democrats way ahead or trending better than usual, and the same polls will show Trump even or ahead. It makes no sense. None. Pollsters make adjustments for various reasons to account for demographics, based on prior results. I think they are all collectively missing the mark, because all the other polls tell a very different story.Add to that all the other indicators: voter registrations, donors and donations, endorsements, early voting turnout, stories across the board about fewer Trump signs, online trending, polls showing Harris favored on things like the economy, disaster response, and overall favorability. The list goes onYes, Im a data driven person. And all the data tells me one story: Kamala Harris is ahead in the race to the White House. The biggest outlier in that data are the polls for who is ahead, and those polls are the ones that are most subject to manipulation, whether well-intended or nefarious.Theres very good reason to be hopeful right now.

Taibbi was right: Democrats are not a party; they're a marketing strategy. I can see why: They've gotten away with it for a long time with their base.  But people are finally waking up. Took me most of my life so far. Your second first mistake (yes, that is intentional) is not realizing that Democrat and Republican pols are all oppressors. Among many other things, Harris is famous for prosecuting blacks.  And Democrats in general are famous for empty rhetoric, pandering and virtue signaling, while both taking minorities for granted and exploiting minorities. Referred to by some as shucking and jiving--what Hillary's campaign had one of her surrogates say about Obama.  One of several of her racist dog whistles during her primary campaign against the first black Democrat to have a realistic shot at the US Presidency. Also called his supporters Obama boys. Even said during a debate that she *and McCain* were more prepared to be President than Obama. A political first during a Presidential primary, AFAIK.And, yeah, Democrats corporate culture is bragging about other things to their base than Trump brags about to his base. But they're both pandering to their own base and getting people like you outraged about \\"the other side.\\"  As far as reality, Obama set some records as to immigrants and had the cages built that Trump got flack for (but Obama did not) and Biden continued building \\"Trump's\\" wall. Huge difference. /sSome minority groups, like Cubans and some Asian groups, have long been quite satisfied with Republicans. And **NOT** because of the tone deaf, condescending Dem cliche about not realizing that they're voting against their own interests.

In cases like the example you gave, where a word is stigmatized by misuse and then discarded as being offensive, changing the word is essentially pointless, since the process of stigmatization is happening separately from the actual word itself. People stigmatize the word Zionism because they fundamentally oppose the concept, changing the word to something else would work temporarily but then people would just start to stigmatize the new word thats meant to describe the same concept. Its a bit of a pointless exercise imo because youll just be racing against the stigma forever and nothing would have a clear definition. I know language naturally evolves and changes all the time, but making a concentrated effort to hunt down and destroy any bad words is pointless.?On a personal note, I think its just kinda gross to have bad faith actors take over a word that applies to many people, decide unilaterally that it actually means something bad, and then force the people it applies to to discard it because its offensive.

With hardly anything leftover, it becomes much more difficult to go job hunting; can't afford to take time off, can't afford to travel too far for in person interviews, can't afford to relocate even if someone else offers an outrageous amount, etc. Eventually an employee gets free of it, but they'll save a ton in labor expenditure, even if they have to burn through 2-3 people per position until they get one either trapped (or worse, too unambitious enough to leave before they're 'comfortable' in the position).
