If you happen to live for a long time you will have an amount of money to keep you from being homeless. What your tax pays for is not *just* retirement. It is disability insurance and survivors insurance (widow, children).You can go to SSA.gov and see how much you have paid into the system. You cannot simply say the return is bad without knowing how long you will live. Some people will not get anything. Say you are single with no minor children and you die before you ever draw. That money is not coming back to you or your family. But the money did go to everyone around you. If you are a landlord it paid the rent. If you work at a business SSA money has flowed through it. You have to look at the big picture and beyond thinking of it as an IRA. The absolute biggest issue is that people will not voluntarily save for these things if SSA is not around. It HAS to come out of paychecks automatically. Sure some people will save. But not everyone and I'd guess **most** people will not save. I'm telling you. I see situations all day, everyday. There is a huge number of people that are straight up homeless without their SSA check and they worked their whole lives.

Should we not send the message that the USA wants peace when nobody is seeking a fight with us? What is the point of escalating tensions with a major trading partner when we dont want to fight them? The context of the situation was that China received bad intel that we wanted to attack them. The second in command of the entire US Forces should be in communication with foreign powers to coordinate peace when our objective is peace. It would be totally irresponsible to not have anyone in a command position engaged in some aspect of US diplomacy. In the military there is the concept called commanders intent which delegates authority based on what the commanders intent and guidance is. Trumps guidance was peace, not war. It makes sense to engage in deescalation and coordination of the peace when nobody was seeking a fight. The only possibility it was a subversion was if the President was seeking war without the approval of Congress, which again, Trump was not!

I saw a set of videos yesterday made by a woman who has owned a salon for 22 years. Her first video was her declaring that Trump supporters/ Republicans were no longer welcome in her place of business. In the second video, she talked about how a woman who's been going to her salon for years sent her husband to get a refund on gift cards she had bought to give as Christmas gifts. She said no originally, but the husband wasn't having any of that, and they got their money back. The third video was her crying about how her clients were dropping like flies, and she literally had an interview to work at Chipotle later that day because she had lost so many clients already. The o ly credit I'll give that woman is she did say she made her bed and she has to lie in it now, but that's where that ends. She continued on saying how she'd stand up for her morals and against racists, misogynists, homopbes/transphobes, and rapists. Honestly, I hope all these businesses go under.

IMHO, we simply need more social democracy. Cut the super rich and the large corporations down to manageable size and redistribute the power and opportunity downward. We've been here before, with the only obvious difference the absence of an organized extremist left.The problem, now as then, is that, once you get to the point where right wing economics starts to seriously undermine society, two things happen. Firstly, the moderate right loses its narrative because even their own supporters stop believing in it, so it pivots to distractions rather than give up, even partly, on free market ideology. This then leads to a surge of the extremist right, because those distractions are their bread and butter.Secondly, coalitions between social democrats and social liberals (free market + political liberalism) become ineffective to deal with this problem because the latter, like the social conservatives on the other side, are unwilling to moderate their free market beliefs, even in the face of a growing authoritarian threat, growing economic crisis and even existential threats like climate change. This is what hobbles the Democratic party in the USA, and what dooms most centrist coalitions in Europe. We have arrived at a point where you can either serve the people or serve business interests, and this makes coalitions of both focus on those bits that don't impact either (not necessarily bad things or things they should not change, but to an extent that they ignore the huge socioeconomic changes they should also make).When push comes to shove, for many politicians on the right and center their commitment to democracy is negotiable, but their commitment to laissez-faire economics isn't. Depending on their overall position, they are then willing to make common cause with authoritarians and reactionaries, or unwilling to do the same with social democrats. Hence why every single bit of social progress has to be fought over tooth and nail, whereas huge leaps backwards can be made on the smallest of margins and in the shortest of time spans.If things continue as they do now, we'll have fascism and other forms of reactionary populism everywhere, which will lead to war sooner or later, as irredentism and nationalism are the obvious distractions they will turn to when their \\"solutions\\" don't deliver anything but more money to the oligarchs (i.e. what happens in Russia).","title":"Black Republicans feel left out of Trumps 2nd-term picks"},{"text":"I feel the same way.But Elon said he was going to turn X into an everything app, so theres hope that may one day include topic-based threads.Although updates to X seem to be moving very slowly.

We need to start accurately describing those that voted for Trump. Trump isnt the only one who is stupid."},{"text":"At the most basic level, some of what we thought we knew about how viruses were transmitted was flat out wrong.At multiple levels, we got the physics wrong, we got the epidemiology wrong.As I recall, before 2020, it was pretty widely accepted that the kind of droplets spread by someone with COVID would not stay in the air for any noticeable amount of time.It was also pretty widely accepted that fomites on surfaces was, as such, a primary method of infection between people who weren't right next to one another when the sick person was coughing.With those incorrect assumptions in place, keep separated, isolate, wash surfaces on a regular basis, and wash your hands so that you're not touching a contaminated surface and then say, your face, was perfectly reasonable advice.To the best of my knowledge, we still don't know for sure that the last one there is _wrong_, we don't know if fomites on surfaces are a good vector for a virus to spread.What we _do_ know now though is that our models of how viruses spread, and what it takes for a virus to be long term airborne, were wrong.It's not that we were wrong about what was in people's breath, coughs, and sneezes.It's that we were wrong about what that meant.  About what actually happened in the air after that.Science is not, and can not be, about perfection.  It is as much about how to handle finding out that you're wrong about things that you think you know.It's about figuring out how to fully test things, to figure out if you're really right or wrong about things.But you hit a real snag when you can't ethically run the experiments necessary to really test chunks of knowledge.COVID researchers got around it, by doing their best and watching what went wrong.  It's a _horrible_ way to learn, but sometimes it's the only way that we do learn.Now, we _also_ had some serious problems with public policy handling the new knowledge correctly.  With some choices which were...  Suboptimal.Once you start to suspect that you've been wrong about it being airborne, and start to think that masks are going to be essential to keeping the spread down, and then you realize that you don't have enough masks even for the most vital personnel, what do you tell the public?In places, sometimes the decision was made to continue with the old advice, because they didn't want the limited supply that existed to be immediately grabbed up by people not required to keep everyone _else_ alive.Of course, that problem was caused by policy choices made in the years leading up to COVID.The US was supposed to be maintaining stockpiles of supplies to handle a pandemic very much like COVID.And then, well...

(Ideologies I might point out, that are spreading in Europe as well, as I'm sure you know.) But I think it is your closing sentence that really puts a fine point on the root of the problem...Giving up on this worldview becomes progressively more difficult the longer people adhere to it because their perception of their own social status comes to depend on their belief in the narrative depicting the fictional moral hierarchy, __particularly as the *actual* social hierarchy (the one based on wealth and power) *has* relegated them to the bottom.__The US is backsliding into an oligarchy of a type nearly as bad as it originally was, with a disparity of wealth that now far exceeds the Gilded Age and pre-revolutionary France and continuing to grow at an unfathomable rate. Opportunities for the common man are theoretically still there but in function are ever more increasingly difficult to access. The younger generations are watching this decline and losing hope for their future, the older generations are watching this decline and seeing the future they've worked for being taken from them.And anecdotally I can say that for the friends I just described who will soon likely lose everything, it is exactly this situation which over the years began prying open the door to that rabbit hole. As counterintuitive as it may be, when watching the system that represents the status quo consistently and repeatedly fail to address clearly obvious societal decline, it is not hard to understand grasping at any radical change, if it looks like that change will benefit you and your 'group.'If that change comes with an offer of added status, then all the better.And on a side note...as it happens, I now also live in (northern) Europe, and here I can see the same societal decline beginning to happen as well. Services are declining, safety is declining and standard of living is declining and the same dangerous ideologies are rising.Understanding the roots of the problem and the psychology behind it is very important. But if we don't want to be overwhelmed by this ideological wave, we have reached - probably passed - the time where action is going to be required.","title":"Black Republicans feel left out of Trumps 2nd-term picks"},{"text":"THATS BECAUSE HE ONLY HIRES THE BEST THATS WHAT FOX NEWS AND THE INDEPENDENT (c) MEDIA TOLD ME","title":"Trump DEA pick Chad Chronister withdraws from consideration"},{"text":"Yeah but Bill handily won 2 terms.","title":"Now that we have a loaded GOP Congress and constitutional originalists in the Supreme Court."},{"text":"Ok a populist political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition","title":"Why many Arab Americans voted for Trump, and why some regret it"},{"text":"Of course he is.

Russia is spending 30-40% on defense spending and have (had) one of the biggest arsenals of the world.Also Russia will literally throw millions of people into a grinder to halt an offensive and if truly invaded will use nukes. They do not use them now because they do not want to increase support against them, but in a pinch of course they will use them.Reddit armchair generals have consistently underestimated what kind of threat Russia is. It will not be easy for European nations to defeat them; because their nuclear arsenal prevents the decisive move - full scale invasion to destroy their logistics capacity and conquer their decision makers. You know, how ww2 was won in the end.So no; Poland is not even close to soloing Russia, even if tRussians are tied down and struggling in Ukraine. Which is really exaggerated btw, because Russia has learned from their mistakes and now are conducting war much more efficiently. Personnel loss is a benefit in their world view. Less costs and less drama to deal with after the war.They are currently wreaking havoc on Ukraine and are clearly winning. They win more and more terrain and the pace of advance is increasing.God damn I truly hate this reddit vibe that flippantly dismiss the Russian threat. We are 1000 days into a full scale war and it is the west that is losing, not Russia.It is only the US air force that can truly make a difference in this. NATO forces are 300k.

Operation Paperclip (scientific recruitment)\\n2.

France?Yes, and the US, since a huge portion of the military is not going to agree to fight fuckin Canada. Will they full on mutiny? Maybe maybe not, but they will definitely desert en masse at a minimum. And major complicated assets like aircraft carriers probably won't be very functional with internal chaos.

The (imaginary) social status accrued in the hierarchy presented by the narrative is a substitute for material benefits that will never be delivered, and for some that is enough.The belief that the subjugation of others will somehow lift them up is also caused by this. When you believe (or feel) that there is a fixed social hierarchy based on identity (the basic reactionary idea), then social progress is not only impossible but undesirable, i.e. it feels like a degeneration of the ideal social order. But when progress is impossible, then social change must be a zero sum game, where someone else's gain (even towards equality) must be your loss. Conversely, if you can make others lose social and political rights then the in-group, of which they think themselves members, must necessarily win. This is why some people support politicians who are just bullies, or laws that exist solely to punish or control others. It's also why reactionary movements don't understand things like trade, diplomacy, cooperation and solidarity, economics or society itself. They can't, because their conception of all these things is as a zero sum game where some are destined (and morally justified) to win at others' expense is a fallacy.And because this is an emotional rather than a rational thing, you don't need to acknowledge, let alone understand the dynamic to be swept up in it. All it takes is an emotional rejection of equality, the feeling that some people are more worthy than others. All ideological constructs within reactionary movements are merely window dressing to justify that basic idea, or facades to pretend that this isn't all there is to it. Giving up on this worldview becomes progressively more difficult the longer people adhere to it because their perception of their own social status comes to depend on their belief in the narrative depicting the fictional moral hierarchy, particularly as the actual social hierarchy (the one based on wealth and power) *has* relegated them to the bottom.","title":"Black Republicans feel left out of Trumps 2nd-term picks"},{"text":"What he means is privatize medicare so it can blow out the cost.","title":"GOP Rep.

They all talk as though they have a special knowledge about 'the world', 'what is coming', and a special standing in (their concept of) future society. They speak with a confidence as though they are in direct connection with 'the movement'....as though their individual perception of reality is an integral part of the overall 'plan' to which they themselves and their ideas are integrally connected and considered.When, for instance, they have talked about the future with Trump in charge or the idea of a \\"civil war\\", in their words and very attitude you can see the absolute assumption that it is the 'other side' that will suffer some undefined righteous defeat or comeuppance. They speak as though their lives will be unaffected and it will be everyone around them in disagreement who will be subdued to some degree or another, all the while never specifying what, exactly, they expect will happen to their friends and neighbors, and daughters, and carefully avoiding any mention of what they foresee their own involvement to be. The future upheaval and societal reset they allude to or imagine somehow involves no direct affect on their own lives. And while they warn the rest of us to 'get ready' because 'changes are coming' they themselves appear to do nothing, and appear to think their lives will just continue unaffected. Some of those I have in mind while writing this are longtime friends of mine who have gone down  the rabbit hole. They are longtime members of a close rural community who have managed to almost completely ostracize themselves from friends that were once like family. They are lifetime working poor, now in their 60's, paycheck to paycheck trade workers who have spent so much of their lives working for cash in their community that they will have little social security, if any. They will never be able to retire. The increasing cost of living and increasing physical ailments from their long working lives are literally slowly killing them. I know for a fact that if Trump initiates a trade war one set of these old friends will lose the shack and land that they just, finally, managed to scrape together the money to buy. The part of the country they live in it is nearly impossible to find rental housing even without having burned nearly all their community bridges, and they will have to sell or discard nearly all their possessions and leave their lifelong home and move to a completely unknown place in order to have any chance at all to survive for the final years of their lives.Yet, they remain true believers.","title":"Black Republicans feel left out of Trumps 2nd-term picks"},{"text":"Id pay good money to see that","title":"Zuckerberg wants active role in crafting Trump administrations tech policy"},{"text":"What a pick-me guy.","title":"Michigan Republican says gay marriage should be illegal"},{"text":"Firstly not all Jews like Israel secondly yeah thats called politics.

There are not really any ways to stop a government where all 3 branches are cooperating as authoritarians thoughA lot of the constitution was written with the assumption that everyone would play their role, in good faith. A belief that there would always been a unified sense of patriotism among voters who knew it would be their duty to ensure that their interests were fairly represented. And it worked for a while. Problem is that the constitution was written for a 18th century country, intended to suit the needs of a 18th century country and to be amended where necessary to adapt for future changes. And, for a long while, it was amended and adapted to suit a country beyond the scope, scale and expectations of the European-born colonists.But America is a different beast, and the rules and dressings of governance were simply expanded to include its new territories, rarely was it adapted to suit the situation of being, effectively, 50 countries in a trench coat. The degree of separation between two Americans is vastly greater, both geographically and values-wise, than can be said for other democratic/adjacent countries. And that's been the biggest gap in our armor for decades, now. It's allowed for 'faceless' and 'unreachable' individuals to turn us against ourselves over time. But the biggest, most insane part of it all is that the methods with which bad-faith actors have used to influence democracy are always evolving and updating, but the tools America has to fend them off have remained pretty much unchanged since the 25th Ammendment in 19-fucking-67, and that was about the rules of presidential succession, which means we've had the same 'defenses' for 57 years. More than half a century has passed without any meaningful update to how the government and it's people can protect themselves from exactly this kind of situation, and that was taken advantage of. Our biggest failure, as a country, as a people of governance, was to allow this stupid notion that the rules of our democracy and it's traditions are indelible and immaculate. In a harsh and bitter turn of words, we failed to adapt.EDIT: 3am brain forgot that the 1700s would have been the 18th century, not the 16th.","title":"Trump agrees to DOJ background checks on administration nominees, appointments"},{"text":"It's about to be.

I even think we've added an entirely new market just for upper middle class people. It's a market that didn't exist in the past, because the income gaps were not large enough to support it. The problem Democrats have speaking to the \\"working class\\" hasn't always existed. It's a result of Democrats moving to the center under Clinton, which was arguably necessary at the time. Back then Republicans were winning the educated vote and the middle-upper class vote that went along with it. So Democrats adopted much of the Republican playbook and the language for themselves. This includes a greater effort to appeal to the wealthy and corporations for campaign donations, since Republicans were destroying them here, as well.The problem today is that Democrats won't acknowledge that things have changed and they're afraid to tell their wealthy puppet masters what they don't want to hear. Kamala shifting to the center has been typical of Democrats for 30 years and so it was nothing new. But it's not what people want anymore, either. I just filled out a survey from Kamala's fundraising committee and it never even mentioned people in lower income brackets. Which you might say makes sense because they don't have much money to contribute, but it's also more of the same status quo that voters don't want. Of course it was probably only intended to raise money, but for what and for who? Many voters will just see it as another example of Democrats not understanding the predicaments of the \\"working class\\". The funny thing is that Trump wasn't afraid of telling people he would go after \\"elites\\", even though he'll actually protect them. But Kamala, who actually did go after elites with the Biden Administration, wouldn't think of saying something that might scare off big donors. I believe Trump fooled people, but what good did it do for Kamala to play it safe? Yes, Kamala promised to raise taxes on the wealthy, while Trump promised to lower them, yet Trump received the \\"working class\\" vote because they believed he was more likely to help them economically. My point is that you're right about Democrats not speaking the language.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Trump directed that the Kavanaugh \\"investigation\\" was not allowed to actually interview anyone who knew anything:The report, released Tuesday by Sen.

You have to get in to get out.Now that's out the way--it's important to note that Trump essentially represents the one of the two factions of the deep state.  It's like Trump and his cronies are *nWo Wolfpac* and the establishment Dems/Republicans--Obama, Biden, Clintons, Cheneys--are nWo Hollywood.  Both operate under the similar brands... Both get their checks signed by the same class of entities (billionaire donors, Isreal lobby).Now to your point, I think it's a nobrainer--no one gives up power easily.  In sticking with this topic, look at all Trump had to get through just to hopefully win the presidential election of 2024.  Most of that was a result of establishment Democrats' desperation to maintain whatever power they had left.Trump was shot at, there was a 24/7 news apparatus that was dedicated to besmirching his name and on top of that, and somehow, with help from his team, he was able to weather the storm.Now I do think that ~~nWo Hollywood~~ has taken a lot of hits... Perhaps too many to get up from?  We'll have to see.Establishment Dems like the Bidens, the Obamas and the Clintons, have their legacies hanging on by a thread.  They've spent so much of their time eliminating  leftist populous candidates for not playing ball.  Because of that, they've left themselves vulnerable for future presidential pursuits.The deep state's hold over the public by way of the Democratic Party has waned significantly.  However, at this moment, it is safe to say that they still have significant control over other areas of societal activity.**The major areas of societal activity are:** *Economics, Education, Entertainment, Labor, Law, Politics, Religion, War/Military, and Sex.*Trump, I assuming based on his posturing, has his mind set on transforming almost all of those areas of societal activity.  It remains to be seen what the deep state has planned to try to stop the other brand of deep state.All I know, because much of this is above my paygrade, I will be keeping my head down, and peeking up with my popcorn in hand to see how this second edition of the Orange Man's presidency goes.","title":"Do you really think the deep state is just going to hand over power to Trump willingly?"},{"text":"As a south korean im worry about western and us","title":"SK opposition files motion to impeach President Yoon.

They're conservative and dislike being ruled by Ontario.  They have much more in common with the US states they border.  But Democrats would never allow 6 new GOP senators without adequate compensation.**Democrat**: **BC** **&amp; TM**British Columbia would be one liberal state, with much in common with the US left coast.  Combining NS, PE, NB &amp; NL into one state of roughly 2.65 million people would be another.  Give it postal code TM (The Maritimes).While this gives the GOP a net gain of 2 Senators, the combine populations of BC+TM (8.4 mil.) vs. AB+SK +MB (7.6 mil.) provides the Dems a net gain of 1 in the House.  Given that BC is also the fastest growing of the bunch, the opportunity to expand the US might satisfy both parties.**Independence: QC**It's no secret Quebec dislikes being part of Canada.  They've had two Referendums on Independence.  The last, in [1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Quebec_referendum), lost by a whisker: 49.42% to 50.58%.Next vote, they'll likely secede.  Canada splintering with other provinces joining the US would further guarantee that.  They have much more in common with France than the US or the rest of Canada.**Rump Canada: ON &amp; NU**Ontario would likely remain independent, and try to hold on to Nunavut to control the Northwest Passage &amp; a stake in the arctic.  No president wants to become a subordinate governor.  Likewise, the US would find a political compromise impossible -- adding 4 more Dem Senators &amp; a net-gain of 18-20 more Dems in the House.  I don't see either country agreeing to to that.**Territories: YT &amp; NT**The Yukon &amp; Northwest Territories likely become annexed to the US as part of a land deal.  Ontario would be reeling and in need of cash.  However, they don't become states.  They are territories (not provinces) of Canada, due to their sparse populations and would be also under US jurisdiction.  Each has roughly 40,000 in population.  By comparison, the least-populous US state, Wyoming, has a population of nearly 600,000; 15 times more than each.  The average US Congressional District has a population \\\\~ 770,000; 19 times more than each.  They would have to remain territories, or be annexed to other states.","title":"Trump Jokes About Taking Over Canada: 51st State, Trudeau as Governor"},{"text":"She threw it in the trash because he bought it to commit suicide with.

When the Soviet Union fell, Western leaders promised to not expand NATO towards Russia, a promise that they failed to keep.  NATO is led by the most belligerent of modern military powers, the United States of America.  The USA is responsible for the majority of military violence in the world since the end of WWII.  The USA still militarily occupies Germany and Japan.  The USA has created a ring of military bases around China.  The USA invaded Iraq in 2003 under false pretenses and had its leader executed.  The USA invaded Libya and allowed its leader to be horribly assassinated.  The USA currently occupies large sections of Syria and is responsible for fomenting and funding the rebels in Syria's civil war, which was the cause of the 2015 refugee crisis.  Prior to the Syrian civil war, American leaders broadly praised Vladimir Putin.  Then Russia aided President Assad against the aims of the American interlopers, and the Putin became the new Antichrist.  America controls the largest military on the planet, is greedy &amp; won't stop with Ukraine.  Your prediction about the aims and future actions of Russia are conjecture, only.  From all appearances, Russia invaded Ukraine to forestall Ukraine from joining NATO.  No one - no one - has attempted a dipomatic solution to the war.  On the contrary, Western leaders, starting with Boris Johnson, have encouraged Ukraine to conscript its men and throw them at the Russians, and they have given millions of dollars in bribes to Zelensky, his ministers, and his generals to encourage them to do so.  American intelligence has known since Bloody Bush years that Russia considered the entrance of Ukraine and Georgia into NATO as the bright red line.  It is the famous Nyet Means Nyet cable that Wikileaks heroically exposed.    Instead of guessing about Russia's aims and getting off on the violence, you should be taking a moral stance: Urge diplomacy.  Accept neutrality for Ukraine.  Reign in NATO, which became obsolete upon the fall of the Soviet Union.  And most of all: Follow the money - who is making money on the conflict, which will tell you much of why it is occurring.","title":"Democrats want to send your money to Ukraine, Republicans want to send your money to Israel.

And it is a fantastically successful one. My figures are dated, but when I studied SS 50% of seniors would live in poverty without SS and only 10% do after SS.\\nThats an 80% reduction in poverty among the elderly. The only way to reduce poverty among those too old to work is through subsidies.\\nHow does SS create subsidies?\\nRevenue: SS taxes everyone 6.2% of lifetime wages (up to the earnings cap). (Times 2 for employer match and the additional 1.45% is for Medicare HI (Health Insurance), not OASDI (Old Age, Survivors Disability Insurance).) So everyone PAYS the same rate.\\nExpense: When you retire, your benefit is calculated by determining your Average Indexed (for inflation) Monthly Earnings (AIME). Your SS benefit is determined as:\\n90% up to X of AIME plus\\n32% of AIME from X to Y plus\\n15% of AIME over Y\\nSomeone who earned X for their AIME RECEIVES 90% of lifetime earnings and someone whos AIME is the cap RECEIVES 28% of lifetime earnings.\\nDid you get that? The poor person pays 6.2% and receives 90% the\\nrich person pays 6.2% and receives 28%. (Rich is in quotes because many middle-class skilled laborers without college degrees earn the SS maximum.)\\nI did some actuarial calculations once and the poor person (receives 90%) earns about a 15% return on taxes (over a period where the S&amp;P returned 12%) and the rich person earns about a 0% return (an interest free loan.

The government was built with three branches and a due process to changing government framework. Laws are meant to go through channels and bureaucracy for a reason. So all parties have an opportunity to represent their constituents as best they can.It's all very inconveniencing and boring. It's difficult to work around for a reason. It's not to hold back just one party or the other. It's to keep a balance, so that one party can't completely stamp out the other. Because the culture of the land does not dictate the culture of all its people. It's very unfortunate that any president can just erase the policy of the last with no one who can object. I don't believe the executive branch should have executive decisions to just change things or over anything really. Especially the \\"hiring and firing\\" of government employees and dismantling entire government agencies.There simply IS an obligation to keep people in positions doing things against the wishes of the executive. If these people are following due process and not violating any laws/codes of conduct, why should they be fired or replaced. Is their defiance in the ideals of another group of people the only reason? Just because they have the name \\"executive\\"?Elections aren't a \\"consequence\\" and winning shouldn't grant absolute power or absolute obedience. To any person, party, religion or ideal. These are the things our country was built upon. Independence, freedom and the ability to stand up for your beliefs.The idea should not just be appeasing the executive branch above all. It doesn't matter whose in the office. Just like anyone has the right to run for president, anyone has the right to run for another office or apply for a government job and oppose them.

In 2023, he published his book titled, \\"Deep State Gangsters,\\" which Trump praised as a \\"roadmap to end the Deep State's Reign\\". He has also promoted election denying, COVID-19 and anti-vax conspiracy theories.Patel also has a history of supporting Qanon conspiracy theories.. On Truth Social, Patel boosted a prominent Qanon account. According to Media Matters, Patel has shared an image featuring a flaming Q on it and has gone on multiple Qanon shows in order to urge members to join Truth Social. Patel said in 2022 that Truth Social was trying to adopt Qanon \\"into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences\\", and that the figurehead of the Qanon movement \\"should get credit for all the things he has accomplished\\".Patel once proposed closing the FBI headquarters and reopening it as a \\"museum of the deep state.\\" Let's see if he follows through on his proposal.When Trump first proposed appointing Patel to lead the FBI or CIA, it faced significant backlash. Bill Barr even chimed in, writing that, \\"Patel would become FBI director \\"over his dead body.\\"Patel has also proposed making it easier to sue journalists.This next one is pretty relevant considering all of the right wing hysteria around Hunter Biden's pardon at the moment, because as a public defender, Patel often represented clients with firearm violations, not to mention drug traffickers and murderers. He was aide to Devin Nunes of all people and authored the \\"Nunes Memo\\" which tried to discredit the FBI and the Russian investigation. Even though it was regarded as deeply biased, inherently flawed and contained \\"cherry picked facts,\\" it became widely accepted by the MAGA community.Patel claims that the Steele dossier was used to initiate the Russia investigation, it wasn't. In fact, the dossier appeared after the FBI first began its Russia probe. The investigations and findings of both Mueller and the FBI did *not* hinge on the Steele dossier. Patel still wrote a book about it titled *The Plot Against the King*.He was formerly appointed to the NSC, and it was noted by his colleagues that he was severely under qualified. Patel was accused of being a Ukraine policy back channel for Trump, even though he was assigned to counterterrorism. Fiona Hill told investigators that it seems \\"Patel was improperly becoming involved in Ukraine policy and was sending information to Mr. Trump.\\"Patel once argued that former Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, was \\"disloyal to Trump\\" because he refused to send military troops to quell protestors. After the November 2020 election, Patel reportedly blocked some Department of Defense officials from helping the Biden administration transition.In 2022, when Patel had to testify before a federal grand jury that was investigating the Trump classified documents scandal, he declined to answer every question by invoking the fifth amendment. He was also one of the proponents of the idea that Trump had unilateral powers to declassify all materials.That same year: Patel created Fight With Kash, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charity, to raise donations for \\"helping other people\\" in need, though more specifically to bring \\"America First patriots\\" together and \\"helping fight the Deep State.\\" Patel has also supported the idea that Trump should seek vengeance against his political enemies.During an appearance on Steve Bannon's podcast, he said the following: We will go out and find the conspirators  not just in government, but in the media ... we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections ... We're going to come after you. Whether it's criminally or civilly, we'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice, and Steve, this is why they hate us. This is why we're tyrannical. This is why we're dictators ...

These people didn't stop to think about what the state of the war in the middle east would look like under a second Trump presidency. Trump's previous middle east platform was built around anti-muslim/Palestinian attitudes and policies, interventionist and contentious measures that emboldened Netanyahu and heightened provocations in the region, a transactional relationship with aggressors, and a coalition of vehemently pro-Israel allies, among other things.Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with other \\"strongmen,\\" he caved in to Bibi's political pressures.Trump's record indicates that he is willing to take an  uncompromising stance on this war that he likely knows nothing about.Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved in. When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his handlers, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.What's more, Trump's \\"Middle East peace plan\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. As foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably brief, insincere and ineffective plan also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.In terms of his rhetoric, Trump has referred to all pro Palestinian protestors as \\"radicals.\\" Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said, Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,Trump has not only vowed to crush pro Palestinian protests, but he's threatened to deport *all* demonstrators. Trump has made statements like, they (Israel) \\"have to have a victory.\\" And speaking to Netanyahu, Trump has stated, \\"do what you have to do\\" in Gaza, while he has also said that we have to \\"let Israel finish the job.\\" Republicans in his orbit have also been pushing to annex the West bank, which is a real possibility considering Trump's MAGA coalition is willing to trade their loyalty for a chance to use him to enact their Islamophobic agenda.Trump hasn't laid out a viable plan for addressing the war in Israel. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gazas current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy. Gazas waterfront property could be very valuable, Kushner saidCaution around the controversial topic hasn't kept Trump from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.Trump has a long history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a \\"Muslim problem.\\" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.In 2015, he said he will \\"look at\\" closing mosques.He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.Trump once said he would certainly implement a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registryHe called for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\\"He's called Muslims \\"sick people.\\"Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that the Judeo-Christian west is engaged in a global war against jihadist Islamic fascism.Then there's Trump's first \\"Muslim ban\\", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of \\"radical islamic terror.\\"While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.Let's not forget the recent \\"rally\\" at MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points. Some of it directed at Palestinians. Trump even used \\"Palestinian\\" as a slur during his debate with Biden.All that being said, the consequences for Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims will be far more severe with Trump in office and a MAGA coalition of fierce loyalists behind him. Not only that, but over the next four years, this agenda will encumber any future progressive efforts to broker a peace between Israelis and Palestinians. And criticize Biden all you want, but this is a war that the US has been complicit in for decades. Biden's role as a mediator during this stage of the war was made more challenging by not only the U.S's involvement in this conflict for over a half century, but also by the previous administration's foreign policy, anti-Arab attitudes and Netanyahu's far right coalition of jingoists who preserve power by perpetuating conflict.","title":"Why many Arab Americans voted for Trump, and why some regret it"},{"text":"Trump would be crazy to accept a pardon in a conviction so flawed as that one from NY.

Boulas has connections to Hezbollah and good relationship with PLO president Mahmoud Abbas which will be critical to any negotiation with Israel. Foreign policy is complex. The idea that Arab voters regret their votes just like the idea that Hispanic voters regret their votes is nothing but conjecture and pure speculation. You judge a president off their action. Its far too early for any real remorse. Article like these are just used to bash Arab Americans who stood their ground and rejected Biden and Harris.

China will not bend the knee as they are some of the largest holders of US sovereign debt, so they are in a position to bully back, however that is only because both Dem and RINO administrations before Trump thought is was a good idea to outsource all domestic heavy industry to China and India because it was cheaper and destroy domestic manufacturing, then saddle the remainder with insane regulations.Trump's tariff policies are a fundamental necessity to prevent Chinese hegemony and restore US domestic industry, Trump knows this, he also knows that the Chinese economy is reliant on exporting cheap goods to the US to fuel their own debt financing. But he is also aware of the precarious position of the US given decades of mismanagement, hence the tariff plans, domestic growth policies and reducing the US' over leveraged position financially. I don't expect the Chinese to bend the knee, but they know Trump does not fuck around, so I expect they will treat him with far more respect than the fools Biden, Harris, Clinton and Obama, as on their watch China was able to run amok.It's good to still be wary of the China's territorial ambitions in the East and their incursions into Africa to secure natural resources. I think they will come to an agreement with Trump, they know they'll have to with the damage he could do to their economy, but don't expect them to just roll over and fall into line, Xi and the party are too astute and ruthless to simply pack up their geo-political maneuvering and call it a day.

So, grain, eggs, milk, crops (think vegetables/fruit), and to some degree livestock.(There are exceptions with livestock/meat products, but those are less a tariff question, and more a health and safety question.)One other thing to note, it's not a treaty.  It's a trade agreement.  A treaty is an entirely different beast.To put it simply, a trade agreement, only applies to trade between nations.  Where as a treaty is much wider reaching and covers everything from defense, legal matters, trade, and anything in between.So, a good example of the difference, is back during the 1980's,  the United States had a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, which allowed US farms to sell grain (primarily wheat and corn), to the Soviet Union.  That agreement saw neutral ships stop in US ports to be loaded with grain, which would be shipped to the USSR.  At that time, however, there was no active treaty between the two nations.  So, they didn't share intelligence, weapons designs, extradition for crimes, or a defense treaty where if one was attacked, the other must aid them.  The agreement in place only allowed trade between the two.","title":"How could Trump impose tarif, don't we have Alena ?"},{"text":"Could have had 216 if it weren't for TWO left wing spoiler candidates helping flip CO-08 to the GOP.","title":"Adam Gray Declares Victory Over Incumbent Rep.

In practice, the idea is to make it far cheaper to produce a product (regardless what that product is) inside a nation, as opposed to importing it.The kind of tariff that is being proposed, isn't anything we haven't seen before.  Back in the 1970's, a steep tariff was placed on imported pickup trucks. (This Tariff is still in effect.)  This was due to their popularity among American drivers.  This tariff hit a number of foreign companies particularly hard, like Toyota.  The direct response to that tariff, was for Toyota to construct multiple new production facilities that were used to produce pickup trucks locally, and sell them to local national markets.  The offset of this also being that it created multiple jobs in places where those production facilities were built, as well as work for construction firms, and taxes which must be paid to state, local, and federal tax offices.  So while the tariff made trucks expensive, for about a year, the offset for Toyota was it was simply cheaper to build them inside the US, as opposed to importing them.  The higher cost in the short term caused people to be less likely to purchase them, which naturally further pushed the company in the direction of local production to lower sales costs, and maintain their competitive standing in the market.","title":"How could Trump impose tarif, don't we have Alena ?"},{"text":"This is naive thinking. The President *is* the executive branch of the US government by the US consitution. He gets to run the executive branch as they see fit.

When the executive wins, it *is* within their purview to reshape agencies, within the scope of law, to match their expectations. This is the power of winning. This is the executive doing what they believe best serves the citizens of the country - which is what they were elected to do. This is the consequence of elections. Do I think if Harris won, she would have done anything Trump wanted in the name of 'supporting what MAGA folks want'? Hell no I don't. If you are honest - you would admit this too. The fact is the Democratic party lost the election and their preferred agenda doesn't get to 'win out' here.

I know the ins and outs and ups and downs of being a female gamer fairly well.I've also had death threats, been dox'd, been harassed, had people harass/threaten me IRL, had my phone spam called for harassment, etc from being a Youtuber a long time back.  On account of the fact I'm a furry.  Thing you have to realize is that 99.999% of this is just people venting or self validating on you.  Just people talking shit.And as far as female leads?  Women buy 50% of the tickets.  They can vote with their wallets.  So can men.  What gets made is what wins out.  You want more Black Swan?  It needs to make money.  But when you can put out 85 Fast and furious movies and guys will keep showing up because Family, Cars, and Cool....good luck competing with that lol.  I dont even think its sexism.  I think that family movies are typically co lead or animated and that guys just watch alot of dumb guy movies that better lend themselves to male leads due to their much more physical nature.  Some movies pull off the physical badass female like Kill Bill or the Resident Evil movies and Black Widow in the original avengers, etc.  But those seem to be more rare these days because the kickass female type changed and what they changed into seems less compelling.Hollywood is also bad at making interesting women.  They're so afraid of making them flawed enough to be interesting that they just come across as bland, girl bosses, or cringe/patronizing.  ANIME of all places is doing it better and has tons of quality female characters and roles including leads.  [7th Time Loop for example is amazing and you should 100% watch it.](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G4PH0WJGQ/7th-time-loop-the-villainess-enjoys-a-carefree-life-married-to-her-worst-enemy)  Despite its full title that show is 100% about her and she's awesome, competent, and complex.  Avoids being a girl boss too.  The girl boss problem isnt even a power problem, its a bad writing problem.[And on the other end of the scale you've got Chilling in another World with Level 2 Cheat Powers. ](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GEXH3W2PK/chillin-in-another-world-with-level-2-super-cheat-powers) I though that would be a trash isekai.  They baited me lol.  It's actually a pretty well written slice of life/slow romance.  I completely wrote off Rhys as clear waifu bait.  And the start of how they introduced her with one of the more distasteful anime tropes thrown in did not help.  I almost dropped the show.  I'm glad I didn't, because as the show went on she became more and more complex and the original more problematic and shallow reasons she had for attaching herself to him were replaced by other deeper natural ones that felt earned.  As did her little bits of progression bit by bit throughout the season.  Somehow bit by bit they turned her from a full anime trope into a fully fleshed out well written character I adored.  And TBH when I realized I actually liked her character and was invested at episode 6...it was a shock to me.  They totally slow rolled me.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, 2 bronze stars and degrees from Harvard and Princeton.

If Congress authorized war, China will know about it. Mark Milley doesnt really have anything to do with the entire process except what is authorized by the Commander in Chief and ultimately Congress. Since we were not at war and had no intention of going to war, maintaining open communication about us not wanting war when they thought we might want war is a positive action that cools the room down. Nobody wants war with China. Congress didnt, Trump didnt, Milley didnt, the American people didnt.

No one is flipping the table, theres no assassinations or jailing the opponent like its 1933 in Germany. Thats because in this rule, They fking win, quite alot.If someone DOES go against the status quo, and flips the table, then the entire powerstructure, what conservatives have been building for the past 2 decades, essentially become pointless work. People might point to Jan 16 as flipping the table, it wasn't. The mob that swarmed the US capitol didn't sweep the building shooting legislators, you might attribute the police in the building for the relative peace, but it wasn't because of them, it was because the GoP still want to play according to the rules. If GoP can actually successfully rug pull the entire ruleset and WIN, then theres a large possibility they will do so.

If I had to guess, it would be to destroy America, and maybe they think Trump is the most likely president to do that. If you wanted to destroy a group, do you think it would be most effective to work from within it or from without it to accomplish that goal? I actually just googled the best way to destroy an organization is to get inside of it, and funny enough, the first hit was to an article about the manual the CIA wrote in 1944, about how to destroy your workplace from within. Im pretty sure the deep state isnt afraid of Trump. If they were afraid of him, and if they werent sure he would act in their interests(even if he has no idea thats what hes doing), theyd kill him. Do you have any idea how easy that would be for them? The assassination attempts were probably used to create some illusion among the masses that hes hated by the deep state and to further fortify his hero status among his followers. I have previously thought that they would just electronically fix the election to get whatever result they wanted, but maybe they actually like winning the old fashioned way, via brainwashing of the masses and the democratic process. I am sure that the assassination attempts made a lot of people like Trump even more. Possibly even those who didnt like him at all before that. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if a lot of people who profess to be democrats voted for him because being shot made him look like more of an enemy of the state, and everyone hates the state. Its in our nature, as humans, to hate the state.","title":"Do you really think the deep state is just going to hand over power to Trump willingly?"},{"text":"Honestly, the government needs to invest in some tech.

Hegseth has an entire police report with details from many people including the accuser herself, which show that this lady was trying to save her marriage via these accusations after her husband figured it out. My favorite line in this, is that Hegseth told the cops that after they banged, she was planning on telling her husband, who she left in another hotel room with their child, that she fell asleep on a friends couch... guess what the husband says she told him. She followed through with the lie until it became too much for her husband to ignore, and then bam, police report. They investigated heavily and then decided not to move forward, because duh.She claims she was drugged, every other witness says that he was drunk as a skunk and she didn't appear at all intoxicated. If anyone was unable to consent, it was not her. Even the husband says that when she returned to their room at 4am, she did not appear intoxicated, her speech was not impaired, she was walking steady, and she seemed entirely sober. The assault against him is not serious, there is not a single thing that will keep him out of the office, unless you think running the dod or whatever the dude is nominated for should kick out serial adulterers.

The [top 50-90%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WFRBLN40080) of Americans weren't hit as hard, but they were still about 8% poorer than they were pre-Recession.Outside of tech, the job market was pretty brutal- with so many people out of work, competition for even the most entry level jobs was intense.People knew that the recession had started under Bush and the Republicans, and the economy was growing again, but I can understand why they were not enthusiastic to turn out and vote for Democrats.The slow recovery from the Great Recession was the reason we got so much fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2020-21- economists and policymakers (and especially the Fed) decided that they didn't want a repeat of the 2010s.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 3, 2024"},{"text":"How generous","title":"Trump agrees to DOJ background checks on administration nominees, appointments"},{"text":"Im hoping that people come and go and cause chaos as they did when he was previously in the White House.

There are plenty of examples where either Congress or the President has told the Supreme Court to go fuck itself.Andrew Jackson was mentioned already, but let's not forget FDR threatening to pack the Supreme Court. The Civil War was the consequence of President Lincoln ignoring one of the rare orders of Certiorari. It was ruled that Dredd Scott was a slave and Judge Taney demanded the marshalls take him into custody and bring him back to captivity (a ridiculous order, what if Dredd Scott wasn't around anymore?). Lincoln ordered the marshalls and the military to ignore the demand. President Nixon was ordered by a federal judge to deliver the Watergate tapes and he ignored the order. He delivered them later when the forced him to tape over some of the tapes. You know these tapes better as the \\"missing\\" Watergate tapes.What JD Vance is talking about is a massive power-grab, and it comes at the expense of Civil Servants that operate our government in a non-partisan fashion. This isn't a coup though, though it's the kind of thing that can be used for a coup. To have a coup he'd have to be unwilling to hand over the Presidency to the winner of the election.

I support just using a different system entirely, like STAR.  But as a patch for IRV, it might help a little if, after running the results the first time, they reran the results, except this time eliminating the original second place finisher (who we already know cannot defeat the original victor head to head) at the start, and giving their second or third choice preferences a chance to be expressed.     \\n       \\nThis is especially an issue because a selling point of RCV / IRV is supposed to be preventing extremist candidates, but if frequently allows a less popular extremist to defeat a more popular moderate.","title":"Trump agrees to DOJ background checks on administration nominees, appointments"},{"text":"a 'coup' is when you undermine those laws.","title":"CMV: JD Vance and Trump will try to coup the government"},{"text":"What a surprising turn of events.","title":"Black Republicans feel left out of Trumps second-term picks"},{"text":"I mean.. when you game it out for a half second you see why.

Will you really be shocked if Biden decides it's important to uphold existing norms and doesn't pardon everyone who helped in going after Trump at personal risk to themselves?To me Biden's pardoning of Hunter goes more in the column of his stupid insistence on running again after saying he would be a bridge candidate in 2020.

The same goes, currently, for the House and Senate. You dont need a coup if you can accomplish the goal legitimately.However, to accomplish a coup or anything collaboratively, you need morale and cohesion. Gutting the administration of staff and expertise will, effectively, destroy both. Add into the mix the ambitious, but reactive, policies they have in mind, and its going to produce inaction.Now, suppose that, in 2026, Democrats sweep back into power like they did in 2018. Republicans will still have the Supreme Court, and I dont foresee a situation where Democrats get a supermajority to override Trump vetoes.Now, it may be that the Supreme Court rules unfavorably in some way. If Trump (or Vance) defies that ruling, then yes thats a constitutional crisis. But the easier and more likely solution (see the Muslim Ban from 2017) is to just go back to the drawing table and work within the confines of the ruling.The 2028 election will be the major stress test, I think. Trump will be 82 and hes term limited. If past is precedent, 2025-2028 will be exhausting in its nonsense, callousness, and stupidity. The rich will be richer than before, Republicans will live in a deeper unreality than present, and lets say the Democrats win. Will we have yet another, worse January 6th event? I think what we really need to look out for is the extralegal stuff: armed extremists in particular.All in all, I dont think the Republicans would risk a coup, or even calling a constitutional convention to cement their power further, even if they had enough states to call it.

I dont understand how Kamala Harris handlers could be so stupid as to not only make the vast majority of their campaign Trump bad, but also then just bounce off of Trump talking points and political theatrics when you do actually talk about policy. So the Harris campaign (and possibly you?) were so goddamn **out of touch** that they/you really honestly believed that the Democratic Party was *too left?*. That is such a fucking ridiculous notion that it borders on parody. The Democratic Party isnt left, period. Let alone is it too left. What an absolutely asinine notion. You just keep arguing points that reinforce that democrats are in a different fucking universe from everyone that isnt a Republican voter. That is completely and utterly out of touch. Real, actual people want actual progressive politics. Remember the statistics I spoke of in my original comment? Not only that, but look at the entire fucking developed world. There is not a single developed country on earth besides the United States without universal healthcare, paid parental leave, free or extremely cheap public universities, comprehensive public transportation, the list goes on. Not a fucking *whiff* of any of those policy items *any* democrats goddamn mouth. The United States stands alone.

I think just the trucking industry is subject to over 150,000 pages of CFRs. Example. A Ranger at Moab designates a road 4x4 only in the Superintendent's Compendium. You take an AWD Subaru down that road no problem. They later find out from a trail cam. They send you a letter warning you not to take an AWD down that road again. You don't get the letter, cuz you're still on your trip and you live out of State, so you take the Subaru down the road you know it can handle just fine with its AWD from experience. Ranger pulls you over, sees you've already been warned. You are now facing 6 months in federal prison, a $5,000 fine, and vehicle seizure, you will not get an appointed lawyer, you will never see an actual federal judge or the inside of a federal district court, because a mid-level administrative bureaucrat is all that's necessary when facing less than 6 months in jail and a fine.","title":"CMV: JD Vance and Trump will try to coup the government"},{"text":"As much as Trump or Musk would like to do something about it, it is unlikely. ?Its too much poison for congressman running in competitive districts.?The nations unfunded liabilities are a problem, and one that raiding billionaires cant fix, only delay the inevitable.So it will mostly be kicked down the road. ?Maybe get away with raising the retirement age, increasing deductibles, stuff like that. ?","title":"House Republican: Hard decisions needed on Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"Keep it in the news Whoopi!","title":"Whoopi Goldberg calls out pearl clutching Republicans on The View over Hunter Biden pardon"},{"text":"Demand spending cuts?

Simple. There's no way that Republicans actually work with Democrats to pass anything. They didn't do it in 2017, they won't do it now. Because Republicans will sideline Democrats from the start, they have to pass everything on their own and with their own majority. The House will probably be able to pass stuff, but the Senate still has the filibuster. Democrats are going to 100% filibuster anything that cuts programs to help citizens, which would require a 60 vote threshold.But budget reconciliation just needs a majority to pass, and Republicans have that majority in the Senate. But budget reconciliation has to be net neutral. Meaning it can't make or cost money with whatever you are proposing. So you can have your tax cuts, which costs the government money. You make up for that loss in revenue by cutting programs. For the average person, imagine you cut 5 hours from your weekly work schedule. You've lost income, so you then turn around and cancel your health insurance  to make up the budget shortfall. That's what Republicans want to do.","title":"House Republican: Hard decisions needed on Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"That sounds like something a CIA disinformation operative might say.

But we can see it in a milder less dramatic form in wannabe-authoritarian red states, where (Georgia) if a committee tasked with reporting maternal mortality stats reports that more women are dying because of abortion bans, that committee gets dissolved.  Or Florida, where state legislators tried to ban the use of climate data later than a certain year, or even to ban any discussion of sea level rise or climate change.We saw another glimpse of it when (in his first term) Trump suggested that if we stopped keeping statistics about Covid deaths, the problem would go away (i.e. no longer be visible).Corporate culture is fundamentally authoritarian (very few corporations are worker-owned or democratically run) and also tends to resort to concealment or suppression of bad news.  A shift in focus from trying to respond to reality, to trying to manage *perception* of reality, i.e. optics, is very typical of upper management in large corporations.It seems important to me to be aware of this pattern, be alert in recognising and naming it, and call it out every single time.

For example, DARPA itself does very little. Its primary job is to administer money to private entities to do research. It also oversees the research doing audits, etc. Milestones are often a simple unclass report, while the bulk of the work is classified.The military spends money directly on people, but almost everything else is the same thing, they administer funds to private contracts and corporations for equipment, support operations, munitions, vehicles, etc.I really think there is zero difference in transparency. Anything they don't want reviewed too deeply gets put into a SAP, and SAPs can have contractors read into them. Defense contractors (I owned a small one for a period of time) are heavily audited themselves, in fact the bookkeeping requirements are way more strenuous / enforced on contractors than on military proper.  I was audited constantly and had to follow the FARS (100s of pages of PDFs on rules and regulations about book keeping and contracting rules).I'm not a republican or even a fan of the people looking to make changes, but if they can  improve efficiency by 1%, much less cut any budgets, I'd be overjoyed and impressed. The other thing people dont understand is often \\"waste\\" is not what you think it is. Everyone has heard about 500$ hammers. Often what that is is, they have to allocate funds on a contract by end of Fiscal year (September) or else the lose the funds.  So, they have friendly contractors help them allocate funds with the understanding that real value exchange happens after Fiscal year. I've seen vendors supply empty cases to meet the deadline and then fill them with the actual computer components in October or November.I've also seen cases where you are told by the government to grossly underbid and then do change orders after winning it.  All this stuff isn't necessarily corruption or waste, its unintended side effects created by policy makers who don't understand the actual work they are writing policy for.  Most people are just trying to get the mission done and finding creative ways to work around the silly beaurocratic obstacles.
