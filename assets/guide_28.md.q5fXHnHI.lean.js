I dont know if Id change your mind, but you got me thinking about some of my own experiences.?I was molested when I was a child. It was a step cousin of mine, essentially, and he was a teen who came from all kinds of problems at home. Not a good situation. But one thing that really helped me was - as much as my parents could be flawed people, they listened to me, and they really helped me when they realized what was going on. They taught me that no one had the right to do that to me, and I never needed to believe that I should put up with it, ever.But a lot of times in situations where a child gets molested, the molestation happens in a background of child neglect. A young girl will get molested, but when she tells her mother, the mother says something like no wonder, with the way that you dress. Or a young boy gets molested, but when he tells his father, his father assumes that he must have liked it.I guess what Im trying to get at is, where do we draw the line? If a child molester takes advantage of a child, thats horrible, and I do believe there are some people out there who are evil. But what about all the other people who create a horrible situation where the child is not being helped, not being protected from abusers? What about neglectful parents who dont physically harm their children, but do nothing to protect them? Im sure you know people who have come out of situations like that where theyre horribly messed up.If you talk to a lot of victims of molestation, a lot of what hurt the most wasnt just being molested - what sometimes hurts more is knowing that no one around you cared to believe you, no one supported you.?Im Canadian, we just had it come out in the news after her death that Alice Munro, acclaimed author, had supported her husband the whole time even though she knew he had molested her own daughter:https://thewalrus.ca/undoing-the-fairytale-of-alice-munro/So where practically do we draw the line? If we maim and murder child molesters, do we also maim amd murder the people who do such damage by continuing to support the myth of the molester actually being a good person and blaming the victim? What evil do we draw the line at, where we shouldnt use violence because the evil is not bad enough? And what do we do in cases where the child who was molested is most angry not at the person who molested them, but by their loved ones who abandoned them and failed to support them?","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"This podcast examines the issue in detail: https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/11-the-packaging-of-hunter/id1746189942?i=1000679887631","title":"GOP *knowingly* and willfully framed Joe Biden and his son."},{"text":"Doesn't matter.

Biden has requested that Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona prepare a policy memorandum exploring whether the Secretary has statutory authority to forgive student loan debt of up to $50,000 per borrower. To respond to this request, Cardona and his staff will have to dig into a legal morass worthy of a law school examination.Superficially, the question seems a simple one. Everyone agrees that the Secretary of Education is empowered to make adjustments on federal student loans. The debate turns on the precise meaning of provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) which confer upon the Secretary the power to consent to modification of, and to compromise, waive, or release, amounts due on certain student loans. These powers are often referred to as the Secretarys compromise authority.\\"from: [https://www.theregreview.org/2021/04/19/jackson-mark-executive-authority-forgive-student-loans-not-simple/](https://www.theregreview.org/2021/04/19/jackson-mark-executive-authority-forgive-student-loans-not-simple/)If he had the nuts to do it, as you read right there, he could have warped the powers of the secretary... but instead - wanted to democratically sample the republicans first... bc guess what, they didn't really actually ever want to do it in the first place.But then it's always easy peasy to send billions to Israel... more than the student debt cancellation would have cost - in fact.","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"Australians can make anything about Australia.

Take the classic trolley problem, for instance.

If I look at it through a utilitarian lens of the greatest good for the greatest amount then I'm seemingly obligated to pull the lever and change the direction of the trolley. But if I'm a deontologist who argues that murder is always wrong, then I'd be committing an immoral act by causing somebody's death. But what if it's one baby and five 90 year olds near death anyways, and so I'm collectively saving more quality lifetime by not diverting the train.

John Boehner and Paul Ryan, during their respective tenures as Republican Speakers of the House, often faced challenges from the more conservative factions within their party, particularly the House Freedom Caucus. This group had enough leverage to block legislation or influence leadership decisions. Several high-profile bills that could likely have passed with bipartisan support were either blocked or never brought to a vote because of opposition from a minority of the Republican caucus. Here are some examples:--- **1. Immigration Reform (2013)**\\n   - **Bill:** The Senate-passed *Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013*.\\n   - **Details:** This comprehensive immigration reform bill passed the Senate with a bipartisan supermajority (68-32). It included provisions for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and border security enhancements.\\n   - **Outcome:** Despite having enough bipartisan support to pass in the House, Boehner refused to bring it to a vote, citing the \\"Hastert Rule,\\" which required the majority of the majority party to support a bill before it could be considered.--- **2. Hurricane Sandy Relief (2013)**\\n   - **Bill:** Additional disaster relief funding for areas affected by Hurricane Sandy.\\n   - **Details:** After the Senate approved a $60 billion relief package, Boehner initially declined to bring the bill to the floor, facing backlash from Republicans in affected states like New York and New Jersey.\\n   - **Outcome:** A pared-down version eventually passed with bipartisan support, but the delay and initial resistance stemmed from conservative opposition to the spending.--- **3. Reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank (2015)**\\n   - **Details:** The Export-Import Bank, which facilitates U.S. trade by providing loans to foreign purchasers of American goods, faced opposition from conservatives who viewed it as corporate welfare.\\n   - **Outcome:** Paul Ryan and Boehner faced pressure from conservatives not to bring reauthorization to the floor. It eventually passed through a procedural workaround involving a discharge petition, supported by Democrats and moderate Republicans.--- **4. Gun Control Measures (Post-Sandy Hook, 2013)**\\n   - **Bill:** Bipartisan proposals like expanded background checks.\\n   - **Details:** Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, there was widespread public support for stricter gun laws. Moderate Republicans and Democrats supported measures for universal background checks.\\n   - **Outcome:** Boehner did not bring such measures to the floor due to conservative opposition, despite likely bipartisan support.--- **5. Bipartisan Budget Deals**\\n   - **Example:** In 2015, Paul Ryan faced resistance over bipartisan budget agreements negotiated to prevent government shutdowns.\\n   - **Details:** Conservatives frequently opposed increases in discretionary spending or compromises with Democrats.\\n   - **Outcome:** Ryan often worked around the opposition, but several deals were nearly derailed due to minority factions.--- **Structural Context: The Hastert Rule**\\nBoth Boehner and Ryan adhered, at least partially, to the \\"Hastert Rule,\\" an informal guideline that the Speaker should not bring bills to the floor without the support of a majority of the majority party. This often led to legislation with broad bipartisan support being sidelined.\\nJust some stuff, not a comprehensive list or anything. Hastert rule fucking sucks ass. At least it's named after somebody appropriate for a shit rule.","title":"Rep. Spartz wont caucus with GOP, narrowing Republican margin in House"},{"text":"Ok, on this you might have a point. From a purely linguistic point of view, evil is one of those unqualifiable adjectives which means no comparatives and no superlatives. No eviler / evilest, for example, not that it's a competition.But people normally talk about impact. For example, if you give someone a gun and that person is pissed off, he could go shoot the CEO of a healthcare fund, or he could go shoot up a school. It's the same act, right? Take a gun, find a person, have at it. But, 9 times out of 10, the person will shoot up a school not a healthcare CEO, which is why in the US, there are 300+ school shootings for the year 2024 and only 1 shooting of a healthcare CEO. So yeah, impact is important, and it's what motivates 300+ people to shoot schools but only 1 individual to shoot a healthcare CEO, even though the act of pointing a gun and shooting it at a person is identical in both types of crimes.","title":"CMV: There are no native people"},{"text":"They don't care, but they're still hypocrites.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"Or more people simply voted for him.","title":"Trumps 2024 Mushroom Margin"},{"text":"So, Putin is Stalin?","title":"Is Trump a Fascist?

She stepped down to support Bernie Sanders in 2016. When Bernie Sanders lost the primary to Hillary Clinton, she was infamous for spreading the lie that the primaries were rigged. Im not saying she was the architect of claiming election interference, but she started off with Bernie Sanders and continued to 2020 when she too lost the primary. We also knew in 2020 that Trump would follow the same playbook. So Im guessing they consume the same media??Anyways, her spreading the vicious lie that the primary was rigged by Hillary Clinton made people apathetic and 2016 had a very low turnout. She also galvanized MAGA voters and pushed people to the right because Hillary Clinton had numerous scandals.?Same vicious attacks are happening on Nancy Pelosi this very moment. Shes been with the party for so long. Her family was also part of the party. Realistically, she doesnt need to use the government to generate money as her extensive political connections can land her a top consultant position which pay millions. She only has $220 million yet Elon was able to pay out that much in cash, meaning if she is using the government to get rich, shes not doing a very good job. Yet people are militantly insistent that she is doing insider trading. Most likely some media outlet is pushing the insider trading narrative. She most recently pushed for Connolly to be picked over AOC for the House Oversight Committee. This is pretty much the seat within the House that can launch investigations into Trump. And Connolly represents Fairfax VA where all the intelligence agencies are located.?And why is this relevant? Trump now has immunity for official acts. Last time Trump got impeached, his text messages to the OMB were ruled invalid as evidence. Basically, if Trump does something horrible, the evidence must be public. So, most likely we will need a whistleblower, aka some CIA agent. Not to mention, Trump has already nominated Tulsi Gabbard for intelligence director, which tells you how much he fears potential leakers. Anyways, Connolly has an office in Fairfax, like all representatives, and he always has staff working there. Its a whole lot easier for an agent to go down to this guys office. Even more important, he might already know some insiders as its pretty common for top officials to regularly communicate with representatives. In other words, Connolly will probably have his own set of eyes within the intelligence agencies. Reddit is currently angered that AOC would be passed over for this because the guy is 74. So you can imagine that some bad actors are taking advantage of the 2024 loss to infuriate voters. But I can tell you, if I were Trump or Putin, I would want AOC and not Connolly","title":"Kremlin Insiders Spill Putins Secret Plan to Manipulate Trump"},{"text":"I think we are closer to being on the same page here, and I do appreciate the delta, but in the spirit of continuing the conversation...I think I disagree that the MAGA crowd can properly be described as disenfranchised, because it is specifically their enfranchisement that makes them desirable to the people attempting the kind of exploitation you describe. I also think there's a thing to be talked about here along the lines of the fact that economic inequality is a major problem, and in light of the volume of information available on the reasons for that, namely your plutocrats and fascists, there are few ways to view support for those people, and between evil and stupid, stupid is the more charitable option.  We can work with stupid,  you can become not stupid.  Evil is harder.  Either way, there is a component of responsibility to that support, because the fascists and plutocrats could not do what they're doing without it.Which ties back into the notion that I feel you're advocating for giving the MAGA crowd a pass because they're not the root of income inequality, but I'm saying this is a \\"por que no los dos?\\" situation.We can blame the plutocrats for being the root, and work with the MAGA crowd to help them realize that they actually are propping up fascism because they want cheap eggs, and that is either stupid or evil, and asking them whether they want to be stupid or evil.

This way, the majority of them get to be very progressive on issues in front of the camera, but in the backrooms with donors, they can say its better that we bring the radical progressives into our wing and neuter them. Lest they form a true progressive party.This gets the corporate overlords and centrists to go along with it, they can hand the progressives and the Liberals an unplugged controller while they continue to play the game.To me, it feels like this time around the overlords thought to themselves why the fuck do we need to continue with this charade(?) Of appeasing and appealing to the liberals when Trump is promising to do what we ask if we pay him money. Lets just do that.The veil dropped and now we have huge CEOs like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk literally showering Trump with money in public view for everyone to see. The curtain is Dropped.

There's no second primaries by the rules and if Biden dropped out earlier it just would have meant Harris would have been the presumptive nominee earlier which would have given Trump time to prepare and even further crush Dems in November. I don't know what if any path to victory there was for Democrats in November but I do know things could have been so much worse.

Its also important to note that the meaning of words can change over time or between cultures.Woke, while its roots are indeed in the black community and civil rights era, entered the common lexicon around 2010 and began being co-opted and overused by white progressives.Then, **after** that, conservatives caught on and started using it pejoratively towards white progressives, largely to make fun of what they saw as performative racial politics.And then, of course, it evolved into this weird muddled culture warry term that it is today. Woke means something different to everyone now it seems.

But wait, that doesn't make any damn sense.  Bernie was the evil 'blue' party.... he was even a communist, like what in the fuck is going on here?    \\n  \\nIt was a sterling example of - when you discuss and want to properly represent real people - the 2 party bs doesn't matter.  They wanted change, and he had recipes and receipts to get that done. For once, it was a politician that wasn't a puppet. People could tell he was going to fight for it too.  Which is a feature no other politician demonstrates.So if trump states even a bit of these things, lies or not, it appears as if he's not a puppet to them... not because of 'dumbness' on their part, they desperately don't want him to be a puppet. On the other side, you should see that there's real discouragement. With the remaining people being registered independents, who also want these things, there was no motivation coming from the dem camp this yr, and some might have bought the trump messaging/trap somewhere along the way.","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"2-fold. The dems have campaigned on 'their' set of policies, and never get more than 1% of it implemented. For example we all believed Biden when he adapted from Bernie, that he would eliminate higher ed debt.  Biden could have easily handled this and it wouldn't have been reversable or anything... and to great praise, but instead they took the detour route that opened the door to hoards of lawyers and other entities to inject havoc, essentially self-sabotaging it and then shoulder shrugging like they didn't know it would happen. This doesn't just affect dems and is an example of 'screwing' - at a minimum, not following through.  This same pattern of promise - then 1% effort/'success' - and throwing on top, the media 'glowing it up' and stretching it is just sickening after many cycles.  How much of that works until there's real damage to reputation?  It becomes: \\"yeah, sure, whatever -- I know you don't care\\"  \\n  \\nThis makes campaigns unbelievable by default - we all know what they say, isn't what they'll do (for the current Dems/ pre-trump repubs), and that they will effectively keep everything as it were = right of center to the hard right.  Why would they do that? Elites thrive right-of-center to the right, nothing changes for them, they continue to be a black hole.  Trump shamelessly manages this by lying outright, but since it's different, it's received differently.When it comes to trump, you have to understand that he was toting 'populism' to these people - a solution we all **desperately** need.  Sure, we can see through the bs, we know he will not be beneficial to 'normies' - but if all your social media, the onslaught of bots pushing their propaganda, and the news of \\"your bubble\\" are telling you that he will... as you go about your dailies, it's becomes all you know.","title":"CMV: MAGA is not the problem"},{"text":"He is President now Im sure he can throw something at Hankey to make the money worth losing.","title":"Judge rules Trump does not have presidential immunity protections in hush money conviction"},{"text":"They like their OWN freedom.

I think this administration will go as far as it wants to , and there is nothing anyone opposing it can do. The only limits are on what the administration wants to do. The only question is what it decides. It might not be as bad as I think - that's definitely a possibility. But if what it wants is as bad, then that's what it'll get.The right people will be installed at the top of the departments that remain. The political appointees will be installed regardless of Sentate's wishes (and Senate is unlikely to object too much anyway). There will be appointees below that that will enthusiastically toe the party line, and their primary goal is going to be weeding out anyone that fails purity tests. None of the existing rules will hinder that. They will get replaced, disregarded, whatever - they no longer apply.If the leader decides to run a military government - he will. The supreme court will go along with it, or be disregarded in the remote eventuality where it doesn't. If the leader decides to and is able to run for another term - he will.

The law often hangs on technicality. However, in this instance, I simply don't feel that Trump had a leg to stand on. His argument in court would have boiled down to \\"I wasn't found to have raped her, I was found to have sexually abused her.\\"I don't find that distinction particularly swaying. Or comforting. It also would have been hard for him to show overt damages in court based on that distinction. It seems ABC just didn't want a lengthy legal battle.If we go by your definition however, then I think my example of the Haitians would certainly apply. He (along with his cohorts) defamed/slandered an entire community of people, resulting in demonstrable harm to said community. And continued doing so even after being told it was false. I entirely agree with the rest of what you wrote. I avoid pundits and opinionators like the plague. I read my news and try to get it from as many sources as I can before forming *my own* opinion.

I think Trump engaged in attempted election fraud, in large part because I read every one of his lawsuits, and the charges against the people involved in it. I think he stole and mishandled classified documents, because I've seen the list of documents, then he's publicly tried to claim that he actually owns classified US documents. I think he's a fraud and a cheat, because I've read a bunch of the lawsuits filed against him both from the public and from the government, detailing his frauds. I think he's a sexual abuser and rapist, because he's been credibly accused by over two dozen women, he's paid hush money multiple times to shut women up, He's been adjudicated liable for sexual assault equivalent to rape in a court of law, and he actually bragged to us out loud that he does it and how he gets away with it.

In the 1798 case Calder v. Bull, the Court enumerated four ways in which a legislature may violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses prohibition on imposing retroactive criminal liability: (1) making criminal an action taken before enactment of the law that was lawful when it was done; (2) increasing the severity of an offense after it was committed; (3) increasing the punishment for a crime after it was committed; and (4) altering the rules of evidence after an offense was committed so that it is easier to convict an offender.

All these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the convention; which is, that the people of each State shall choose a number of persons as electors, equal to the number of senators and representatives of such State in the national government, who shall assemble within the State, and vote for some fit person as President. Their votes, thus given, are to be transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the President. But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre in one man, and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided that, in such a contingency, the House of Representatives shall select out of the candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office.The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States. It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue.

So when someone is speaking with any kind of supposed authority on them, and claim to have taken them -- they can't be trusted.Because:1) Either they're dumb, and they fell for the most dumbed down propaganda campaign of all time.or worse:2) They're lying. (Because it gives them more credibility as they push their official counternarrative disinformation.)With guys like Musk, Malone, McCullough, and Rogan --- these people aren't dumb, and there's no way they took the shots.

Or you may use a federal statute to preempt. Cut and dry or mild state issues aren't normally headline material. So if a state is fucking u over you normally look to your state consitution's rights then your federal rights to argue its unconstitutional. In other cases you may be arguing there is federal law to supersede a state law that invalidates or preempts the state law, this is a common issue when congress doesn't explicitly say fuck ur state laws. Implied vs Express preemption. Thus any of this will get you into federal court land which also has requirements that don't involve federal questions.  Federal courts will settle smaller issues that aren't technically federal and normally use a mix of state law and federal law if you are arguing over 75k+ and both parties are from different states.  This is known as diversity jurisdiction, the federal issue method is known as subject matter jurisdiction. This leads to whats called forum shopping to find the most favorable state or federal court and law by fucking with the \\"citizenship\\" of parties. Federal cases will go through federal appeals courts whose last appeals court is the Supreme Court who can tell anyone to fuck off and hear nothing if they desire. State supreme court decisions also appeal to the Supreme Court.  Everyone gets in by filing a petition through a writ of certiorari to get the Supreme Court on their case but it needs to have met the federal bar still. Lastly the Court has original jurisdiction on cases involving ministers, ambassadors and where states are a party. They share those with lower courts by choice and when its State V State it has to go down in the Supreme Court.P.S When to use state law vs \\"federal common law\\" in like \\"normal\\" cases was a nightmare and the Supreme court flip flopped on it. Now we have the Eerie doctrine and federal courts have to apply state substantive law except theres a bunch of ambiguity and if you google it youll get a nice flowchart google image.

The building codes for residential buildings are very different from commercial buildings, so they don't have the same infrastructure. This is most important on two things: Fire safety/Egress, and ventilation. Residential buildings have more stringent rules on both. Some areas REQUIRE operable windows in every bedroom for ventilation, not allowing pure mechanical ventilation, and most highrises built in the last 50 years have ZERO operable windows. Additionally, many commercial highrises only have a single \\"smoke tower\\" or smoke proof egress route, while residence buildings require no less than 2, but possibly more depending on the egress distance.Beyond that, there's difficulty with electrical/plumbing infrastructure, not to mention the pain in the ass that is grease or lint duct as needed. I've been working on a project to make exactly this conversation for the past year, and in the end, it's being converted to a hotel, simply because not enough units sold in time to allow the project to fire.

There as a blip of time where we pretended we weren't, but it's still a systematic issue in this country.  The problem is we never actually addressed the racism, prejudice and sexism in this country.  Reconstruction was hobbled by white supremacy after the civil war, Jim Crow kept people in generational poverty and actually got people killed (lynched) and has never really been fully addressed or repaired in any significant way, we couldn't get the ERA to pass.  The supreme court undid a huge part of the civil rights act when it no longer maintained oversight of voting regulations in known racist stronghold states.  The racism and hatred doesn't go away when there is less class inequity.  The problem is America is a place where racism and prejudice thrives.  The blowback when we had a moderate black president is one of the reasons we have such vitriol currently.  The problem is that, while we like to pretend it isn't, America is a hateful place that disguises the hate behind a false meritocratic faith in capitalism.Until we actually address the systematic issue regarding race in this country this is going to keep happening, no matter how happy, well fed, or well paid the majority of white people are.  It's our culture that is the problem.

If there were, it would be an existential issue right away for Russia, for the same reason that Cuban IRBMs were for the US. The Baltics in particular, the Russians remain unhappy - back in the 1990s, Russia was under the mismanagement of a US puppet, Yeltsin, who agreed with Clinton. Needless to say, this war is being waged by the US for the purposes of regime changing to desperately get another Yeltsin. That's failed and backfired because the Russian people have rallied around Putin.How stealing land from Ukraine resolves that existential issue.It's not stealing their land anymore than the fact that there used to be parts of Germany such as Silesia that are now Polish territory. It resolves the issue because Ukraine will not be able to join NATO. Post-SMO, the government in Ukraine will have to agree to Russia's terms about no NATO for Ukraine. It also resolves the issue that the Ukrainians were discriminating and killing large numbers of Russian speaking Ukrainians. Fictional? Are you under the impression NATO doesnt exist?

Russia's reputation around the world is actually improving as of late.The 15% of the world that makes up the West is isolated, and increasingly, the Western world is seeing anti-war candidates win support.

Every accusation is a confession, every investigation is a \\"witch Hunt,\\" every piece of negative coverage is \\"fake news,\\" every effort to indict or impeach Trump amounts to the \\"weaponization of the justice system,\\" every election loss is \\"rigged,\\" every criticism is unfair, every attempt to hold Trump accountable equates to \\"persecution.\\"Trump is *always* the victim, and *always* the winner, no matter the circumstances.The party of personal responsibility can't seem to take responsibility for a damn thing.There's a demonstrative double standard at play here. You may or may not be surprised to know how often Trump, his allies and co-conspirators have lied or attempted to obstruct justice during investigations over the last eight years.Donald Trump has been evading justice and threatening to sue his critics throughout his entire life. He's continuously exploited his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system and avoid being incriminated. In January 2023, a federal judge fined Trump and his attorney nearly $1 million, characterizing him as \\"a prolific and sophisticated litigant who is repeatedly using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries\\"This has always been Trump's M.O. He continuously threatens to jail his political opponents, and is, even now, currently issuing threats to multiple media outlets and reporters.Then there's this: In 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA) commissioned a report to highlight Trump's excess litigation, entitled \\"Donald J. Trump is a Libel Bully but also a Libel Loser\\", but initially declined to publish it fearing being sued by TrumpIt also might not surprise you to know that Donald Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which included financial crimes, multi-million dollar real estate disputes, tax and state law violations, dishonest business practices and defamation suits. Showcasing his penchant for corruption, fraud and vindictiveness.He is a serial fraud and cheater. He cheats on his wives, on his taxes, he cheats at golf and constantly lies about his wealth.He has persistently screwed over small businesses, patrons, staff, and financial partners who have had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor, often leveraging their money to make bankruptcy and unsustainable debts work for *him*.Don't forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.And don't forget the time Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes. It was later forced to shutter its doors under court supervision.Then there's Trump University.In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University.Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.There was also a class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims failed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against a student who made her experiences at the \\"university\\" public. Trump was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and costs. He was found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.Trump equates accountability with persecution because he's spent his entire life exploiting his own wealth and privilege to evade being held responsible for his crimes.On more than one occasion, Trump has eluded justice by power of executive privilege and through broad immunities granted to him by a DOJ and Supreme Court that he packed with kowtowing loyalists.Don't forget the indictments related to his negligent and nefarious mishandling of classified documents after misleading the National Archives and the DOJ for over a year.Or the fact that he's been accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women, including one of his own ex wives.Or how he has indicated that he will disregard the constitution to achieve his goals.And of course, there's his most recent indictments related to his efforts to conspire to overturn the last election. Including his attempts to defraud the country, disenfranchise millions of Americans, install loyalists into DOJ positions to help *him* steal the election, and his efforts to intimidate election officials into manipulating the vote for him. Not to mention the dozens of empty lawsuits filed by Trump's team that were meant to disrupt the transfer of power.For Donald Trump, life is a zero sum game and he is always the winner.Which is why every investigation, indictment, impeachment or conviction is an act of injustice.Yet, the MAGA crowd remains silent about this hypocrisy or they drum up whatever rationalization imaginable to defend this corruption. What's worse, they then try desperately to make the criminals out to be the victims.But God have mercy if Joe Biden, or any Democrat for that matter, is even rumored to have erred. Republicans expect to be handed a hall pass. They demand immunities, empowered by the fact that so much of their misconduct has become practically legitimized as of late.And more and more, Republicans are saying the quiet part out loud, that only *they* are entitled to the god given rights and freedoms afforded to them, that only *they* are entitled to privileges and immunities.So of course Trump and his supporters cry often and loudly that Democrats are persecuting *them*, that Democrats are \\"weaponizing the justice system\\" against *them*.But in reality, Republicans have been the ones targeting their opponents with needless, politically motivated investigations. It's Republicans, and especially Trump, who continuously threaten vengeance against their political opponents.Think about the general tenor of this last election. The bar for Trump and his MAGA allies remained and still remains shockingly low in comparison to the high standards that Americans expect of Democrats.The media and the general public have played a hand in normalizing and sane-washing Trump's criminal behavior and misconduct.

And they are all owned by companied that own UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Cigna respectively. And they often own their own pharmacies. So, they can lower PBM rates or raise them as needed or reimburse differently at certain pharmacies to increase marketshare with insurance or pharmacies. Or meet MLR rates so they dont have to pay back enrollees. You could even be worried that the large PBMs could overcharge smaller insurers to make them less competitive for the larger players. That's before issues like spread pricing where they upcharge on generics in some cases.The rebate system could work in theory, but we neither regulate PBMs enough nor enforce existing rules enough.Regardless, the share of the pie in healthcare inflation from Rx drugs is tiny.

It feels, to me, like the prosecution of Hunter was to somehow \\"even the playing field\\" and make the cases against Trump seem less impactful. If that's not the case I would love to see the light. **The rest of this is lengthy and not directly relevant to the case or article. It's just a ramble regarding my personal thoughts and why I am asking the questions and pushing back a little on some things.**I try my best to not consume news from any particular angle, side, or spin but *everyone* can be a victim of their own inherent bias so I could be (am likely) unintentionally ignoring things or I could have missed them entirely. This is especially true of some of the \\"extreme\\" viewpoints on both sides as I have a hard time finding relatively neutral news about the far ends of either party and have to parse my own opinion out of the few \\"facts\\" mixed in with the spin. Add that internal bias and inability to really see all sides of the matter through the spin to the fact that I was aware of Trump decades before I knew who Biden or Harris was and it is almost certain that I am giving Biden/Harris a little more grace than Trump. I have felt for decades that Trump is an agitator that uses less than ethical, potentially illegal in some cases, and many times (in my personal opinion) immoral methods to achieve his goals. Those goals, in my opinion, have not resulted a net positive for the communities he is a part of, the nation, or the world in general. In fact: the results have always seemed, to me, to be positive for him and negative for anyone else involved. I am unable to point to a business venture, political action, legal action, or even interpersonal interaction where he actively worked towards a win-win for everyone involved. This is potentially due to my own ignorance and not due to Trump being an evil monster of some sort. In addition: based entirely on the things he has said and done over the decades I am not sure how to determine what the end results will look like if he gets his way in any given situation. I might have been biased against him from the first few times I saw him in the news or on TV but it seems like he says one thing and does a totally different thing the next moment. These inconsistencies are even more egregious to me when the results take significant time to develop. It seems that he will say several different things that sometimes turn out to be contradictory - none of which seem to play out in reality once the results are in. **With all of that nonsense out of my stupid fucking head I would like to end this by saying:** I am actively working to unravel my own internal bias and I really find myself struggling where it comes to Trump. I am uncertain if this is because he's really a giant turd or because the media on all sides has painted a picture of a turd and told me it's him.","title":"Trump not eligible for immunity in New York hush money case, judge rules"},{"text":"They booted McCarthy for working with the Democrats to pass the debt ceiling bill, just saying.","title":"Hill Republicans say funding deal reached, but Johnsons dealmaking with Democrats stirs anger among conservatives."},{"text":"That is the same mindset that had the father in the movie scrambling and pleading for someone else to protect his own family.

I'm tempted to be a CRT Doomer and say that the fact that this polarization has been steadily increasing since the passage of the civil rights act implies Americans have spoken with their actions rather than their words that racial integration is not possible, but the truth is it's doing a disservice to describe the social contract under segregation as rigid. A social contract that seems strong but only for a caste of Volk is in fact a very weak social contract, it just congeals all of its distrust, hatred, and fury towards maintaining segregation.Lyndon Johnson's presidential administration infamously concluded \\"white society is implicated in the ghetto, its institutions created it, its institutions maintain it\\" when researching the state of racial disunity and violence in America and it paints a depressing picture that it was created to bolster our social contract. The ghetto existed because a large enough number of Americans needed it to exist. They needed a social terrarium of manufactured destitution to pat themselves on the back for being more civilized than, and to comfort themselves in the face of complex social problems by merely working harder to contain the spread of the urban blight to the Heartland inhabited by the Volk. They needed to manufacture an existential danger to comfort themselves by being in a perpetual state of conflict with. And George Orwell thought he was predicting the *future*.Is it any surprise that Americans, rather than shun, indeed *welcome* policy solutions that create haves and have nots, trusting their own moral character to put them in the haves, when they've been told for 200 years in some form or another that's exactly the case? Whether that's slavery, segregation, or urban blight? Now it's illegal immigrants.Americans trusted each other and cared more for each other when they could take out their social anger and need to exclude on others. Now they can't, and they don't know who to trust and distrust without a socially and state sanctioned group to act as a living effigy of social decay and institutional disease, and so they're descending into an increasingly panicked state of paranoia about each other, the government, expertise, education, everything they can reach with a pitchfork.But I think we'll grow past it eventually.What we are witnessing is the painful and agonizing slow development of an actual, real, social contract in America. We have a lot more in common with South Africa in this sense than I think we'd care to admit: a rich country reserving much of that wealth to one class, and being forced to desegregate *exposing* just how disunited the people were rather than *causing* it, and now deeply in need of a slow and painful social reunion. But there is precedent. A period of great social alienation brought about by sudden sociopolitical change and technology shock precipitating the reconstitution of the national social contract, sounds terrifying in isolation, but that also describes the period just before the birth of modern Japan, or the birth of modern Germany.","title":"Paul Krugman sums up why Trump won the election"},{"text":"Sheesh took em long enough..

I think many people thought, perhaps, after his defeat in 2020, that his first presidency was an aberration, but what this election shows is it was not, that he is continuing a path through American politics.And I think in some ways, because weve been living in that age for nearly a decade now, the sheer extraordinary nature of this year is hard to take notice of, Jacobs conceded. But he said that historians will be writing about each of the events Scarborough mentioned.Jacobs said the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, was a transformational moment for Trump and voters alike, with Trump himself saying in his Person of the Year interview that a lot of people changed their perspective about him as a resultJacobs suggested that early nominees for the title  including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Vice President Kamala Harris, Elon Musk and Joe Rogan  paled in comparison to Trump.Some years this is a hard, hard choice, he said, adding that last year, we talked about Taylor Swift and the decision behind that. This year, not a hard choice. We certainly asked [the] president-elect about many of those people  and hes got opinions about all of them.But this was an obvious decision for those of us at Time, Jacobs continued.Times Person of the Year title is certainly not an endorsement, as previous recipients have included dictators Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. The title is, however, an acknowledgment of how influential the person is.Jacobs wrote Thursday that Trump, who panned Time in 2013 but lauded it as a very important magazine after first winning the title in 2016, has remade American politics  forcing global leaders and politicians to once again align themselves with his whims.","title":"Time's Editor-In-Chief Says Key Moments Made Trump 2024's 'Person Of The Year' - Sam Jacobs told MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe\\" about the selection process and divulged how the choice became clear."},{"text":"Haha yes I did:)","title":"Its Frightening: ABC News Staffers Incensed by Capitulation To Trump"},{"text":" nooo you cant work from home literally works out of a house","title":"Trump says federal workers who don't want to return to the office are \\"going to be dismissed\\""},{"text":"No, the Jews and Muslims should share the site.

To simplify, part of the way a PBM is paid is based on the negotiated discount on drugs on behalf of your insurance company. So, for example, the list price of a drug might be $500. A comparable drug might be $600. Your insurance contracts with a PBM, which negotiates with the two drug companies and gets them to offer the price for your plan of $100/month, with the rest being more or less covered by kickbacks from the drug company. Thats all well and good, but heres the rub - the first drug has a discount of $400 and the second has a discount of $500. The PBM gets to keep a portion of the *discount*. So what that means is that they have the incentive to put the  one with the *higher* list price on the formulary.This has actually led to some scenarios where the best way for a company to get their drug on formularies is to *raise* the list price and offer a larger discount - the drug company gets the same amount of money, but the PBM gets more and is more willing to put that drug on the formulary. Ive heard from some insiders this is a very large proportion of the increase in list price of, for example, insulins. More or less no one pays more than $35/mo for insulin these days - even cash price with a coupon used by an uninsured person is $35 - but the list price is $500 because theyre competing for formulary spots.

Reparations are an absolutely terrible idea that accomplishes absolutely nothing at an incredibly massive social cost.You can't make up for slavery.  You can't make up for any large scale societal ill.

I'm all ears when it comes to expanding such programs as long as Americans of all ethnicities remain eligible in theory.One unintended outcome of government programs meant to benefit black Americans has been the precipitous rise of extremely efficient commercial ventures who very efficiently siphon off money from those programs.  Even if some form of Reparations did pass, one would expect a similar trajectory.  The idea that we should pass, at massive political cost, a program that does absolutely nothing to solve the problem it purports to address (the stain of slavery), creates massive ill-will, and amounts to a financial giveaway to private industry, seems insane to me.The pushback isn't just going to come from Republicans, it's going to come from other Democrats, which is already happening on the other contentious issues you've mentioned.

Honestly I think even if he does an insanely good job with the economy he will not receive this praise. Argentina was in such a mess that huge numbers can be used to signify gains, as in the huge inflation reduction. The US doesn't have that kind of mess so if trump does well and gets steady growth year on year, democrats won't feel obliged to admit he was good.Bit like Obama inheriting a mess with the 08 recession, he was able to make a lot of big gains but by the time trump got in, either trump or hillary would never have been able to get huge % increases.As for your point again trying to separate the two, we see people like destiny saying shit about getting what you deserve when it comes to a man being murdered at a trump rally, milei then compares himself to trump and this would ordinarily have their opinions to be completely discarded by progressives and democrats.","title":"Milei and Trump"},{"text":"I have to disagree.He has done nothing but lie, cheat, steal, exploit, and divide all his life, and he has lived his entire life in wealth and comfort and will do so until his death.","title":"What I plan to teach my children about Trump"},{"text":" She is pointing at her own fear and lived experience, for better or for worse it needs to be addressed in a much better way than this.

People kept trying to say the 2024 election was the most important election of all time. But that just wasn't really true. Whether or not Kamala won, the Republican Party has become the MAGA Party. And there's no turning back the clock on this one. It can get worse, but it can't really get better. During the Republican Primary, they chose Trump over DeSantis. That's fucking insane. DeSantis offered all the same shit, but without the \\"baggage.\\" They chose the baggage. They want the type of person who is caught lying over 100,000 times, held liable for rape, held liable for fraud, indicted for stealing documents and overturning election results. They want these horrible horrible things. And they cannot be convinced otherwise, nor can the party be relegated to the annals of history because too little of the populous believes factual news or the opinions of experts. If you've ever tried to argue with Republicans, you'll run into this huge roadblock where you realize that the arguments you need to make just cannot be made. I have many friends who said their sole issue was the economy, and they were voting Trump for that reason. I tried to link expert reports saying that Trump's plans were worse than Kamala's. If they just read those reports and disputed the results, or pointed to other experts saying the opposite, I wouldn't feel so hopeless. But they just said they don't trust the experts. If your sole issue is the economy, and you don't trust economic experts, your opinion *cannot be changed*.In my mind, the car has hydroplaned, and the question is just what we hit, not whether we hit something. We are out of control with no way to regain control. Maybe we avoid disaster over the next 4 years. Hell, maybe a Dem gets elected after that.

Like...if my father or grandfather were swindled in a land deal or something, I might still pursue justice. each generation back makes it more nebulous.I also don't think that because a specific claim is difficult or impossible to enforce, you must therefore dismiss all concerns arising from it. For example, I'm sure someone lives on the piece of land my forefathers occupied in england or ireland or where-ever, but I don't have concerns about that because I potentially have the rights of a citizen there - I have the redress of buying back the land, or some similar piece, like any other person, if I want to live there. MY family moved, but my entire class/race/religion of people were not dispossessed en masse so I don't have prevailing injustice to address en masse before pursuing personal economic justice. If I did have some sort of court case, I could count on it being heard normally and seen as a normal case.if I had been forcibly deported and didn't even have records of that place of origin, and couldn't access the courts in either my old or new country fairly, I might have entirely different feelings.So I think it's very hard to arrive at a blanket position. It depends very much what was promised, what was done, what came of it, what could still be done, and what is being asked for or offered instead.I think what's unique about settler colonialism, and what sets it apart from \\"routine\\" migration and conquest is basically the specific type of economic deception used in it.If the united states/individual states had honored their various pacts with natives and not used apartheid legal conventions against them, the united states would in all likelihood, exist nearly identically but have more rich native americans in it.So to follow forth from your own ideas:if no GROUP is specifically entitled to land, individual rights must matter, must be how we determine who is currently entitled to land. If members of a group cannot fairly participate in the systems that determine what individuals hold land at a given time, than that group is less entitled to land and fails your own logical test of \\"No group is inherently more entitled to land than another\\" - because if a group is less so, other groups must logically be more so.edit: Starting the \\"clock of legal equality\\" from 0 RIGHT after a group loses a massive amount of land or rights, but has had equality under the law specifically enumerated after that fact, or deceptively during that act, is an act of brinksmanship. Like if we were fighting in a no holds barred martial arts match, and I opened by kicking you in the balls as hard as I could, then, while you were writhing around on the ground, said \\"Ok, I do feel a LITTLE bad about that, so ... new rules, this is a boxing match now, is it is NOW illegal to nut-kick, neither of us will do it from now on,\\" I would have morally cheated you in that boxing match, even if I was legally allowed to change those rules.the issue with the idea that redress \\"creates\\" grievance, in and of itself, ignores *the fact that grievance exists.*Sure, bob, your great grandfather got muscled out of an entire continent by my great grandfather, but doing something about it would make some people now mad. Well, it would also address some people now who are already mad, would it not?When does the \\"just suck it up\\" clock actually start? what's a fair day to start it on?
