The ones that form naturally from putting yourself out there in hobbies and activities that you enjoy doing rather than from actively trying to find a partner.Also, all those videos you watch? Most normal people consider women like that to be one giant fucking red flag. A woman whose primary focus in a relationship is that and not the myriad of factors that actually make a relationship good and functional and fulfilling is probably not even the kind of person you want to date.Money, height, and muscle do not inherently make you a pleasant person to be around for the long term and anyone primarily looking for that over other things in a person is probably equally unpleasant to be around.","title":"cmv: dating a girl feels like submitting a resume to your boss and hoping that you have enough qualifications and credentials for her to want you"},{"text":"GQP is broke because their party leader hoards all contributions for himself","title":"DNC will send funding to all state parties to support down-ballot races"},{"text":"No it doesn't.

I agree with everything else you have said though. America was not committed to preventing individuals from amassing wealth that competed in magnitude to minor and even major aristocrats in europe, in fact philosophically that was celebrated as \\"the American dream\\" that was supposedly an opportunity for everyone (as long as you didn't look too closely at the reality of that situation, which no one actually did for a very long time) Because he's given up the charade. He doesn't even pretend to truly believe in Enlightenment values.Trump doesn't even preted to have normal human values like basic empathy or loyalty to his immediate family or a basic ability to follow the law or even a plausible pantomime of christiantiy. to borrow from \\nNate White: he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace.I know that is second to the fact that conservatives have moved on from trying to roll back the New Deal to trying to roll back the Enlightenment, but I feel like it is worth noting that their champion for that attempt, the individual that most represents their view of a leader, the personality that most resonates with them and animates them to join the movement for that cause is the worst human instincts incarnate, and not even subtly so, and that **attracts** conservatives to give their endosement to Trump. we run this place and always will.

They have been verboten around DC in no small part thanks to the efforts of ADA architects like Tony Coehlo, and other disability rights advocates. That merits a lengthy mention.For a more recent example, the house just recently passed a QALY ban on partisan lines, which would further solidify what is already the natural state of things in the federal bureaucracy. While this legislation never left the house, the Biden administration has been receptive to the disability rights community in shaping federal rulemaking around the use of these sorts of measures.All that to say, I become worried when I see QALYs proposed with the explicit intention of lowering costs. Ethical implications aside, I do want QALY advocates to ask themselves whether or not they find the utility estimates all that plausible, especially when many of them are based off of [surveys of people engaging completely in hypotheticals.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1069999/)edit: sorry, wrong hyperlink.

Excerpt, bold added:-They never tire of telling us that we live in a democracy.-**This means that that dreaded mass known as the people are permitted C with however much groaning and reluctance C to present themselves every four years to choose their representatives**. These representatives then betake themselves to the parliament, where they form some manner of government, which proceeds to rule us in highly democratic ways. This is is literally the best thing ever, except for the fact that the **the people, in their profound stupidity, cannot always be relied upon to vote for the right parties. Sometimes they vote for the wrong ones, and in these cases democratic solutions must be found to rein in the rabbles undemocratic exercise of democracy**.-The people of Thringen have proven themselves particularly inconvenient to democracy, in that they have exercised their democratic rights to vote overwhelmingly for the evil, fascist and antidemocratic party known as Alternative fr Deutschland. What makes the AfD so evil and fascist is never quite explained, but we hear all the time that they are very bad so the point must be beyond question. -Now, a naive person might think that the AfD, being the party most favoured by the people of Thringen, should enjoy certain parliamentary prerogatives. Existing procedures, for example, grant the strongest party the right to propose candidates for the office of parliamentary president. The president is the person who presides over the meetings of the parliament; he is like a glorified committee chair and his powers are not all that great. The very idea that the AfD might have the right to suggest their own candidates for president, however, strikes enormous fear into the hearts of the democratic parties, who are determined to save Thuringian democracy by all the antidemocratic means at their disposal.  -This brings us to the absolute unprecedented clownshow that unfolded yesterday at the Thuringian parliament in Erfurt... These legally mandated procedures require that an acting senior president preside over the first meeting of the new parliament. This senior president is simply the oldest member of the dominant party C in this case an affable rotund AfD politician named Jrgen Treutler. -According to custom, the senior president opens the first meeting with a speech. Then he appoints provisional secretaries, determines that there is a parliamentary quorum, and presides over the election of the parliamentary president who will replace him. When this president is elected, the state parliament has been officially constituted, and it can act as a legislative body C for example, by changing the procedural rules that have governed it down to this point. -All of this should have happened yesterday, but it did not, because our brave, upstanding democratic parties were determined to take a stand for democracy by antidemocratically denying the AfD their parliamentary prerogatives... The hecklers in the CDU kept shouting; Treutler and the other AfD members kept pointing out that the new parliament had to be constituted before it could change its own legally binding procedures. The democratic parties did not care about this, because they had just discovered a few days ago that the Thuringian law mandating parliamentary procedures is unconstitutional, although it dates from 1994 and nobody had thought to question its constitutionality before.-Because Germany has spent the past decade transforming itself into an open-air insane asylum, all of this has naturally led to renewed calls for banning the AfD. -(sounds like the US Senate's filibuster)Let us dispense with much bullshit and say plainly what everybody knows to be true: Henfling is right. **The CDU elected to keep the present rules in 2023, because they thought they would come out on top in September and they wanted the exclusive right to nominate a parliamentary president from their own ranks**. They overestimated their popularity and now they have decided that the very rule from which they hoped to benefit is unconstitutional and should be denied to the AfD.","title":"eugyppius: Thuringian parliament descends into chaos after Alternative fr Deutschland antidemocratically and fascistically insists on adhering to established laws and procedures"},{"text":"They want to ban parts that convert semi-auto guns to full auto, which they acknowledge are ALREADY illegalI dont understand this.

The UK is not a good example to hang your hat on and I am pretty convinced if British people actually understood the NHS places a value on their lives to determine if they should recieve care they would revolt (British revolt == writing strongly worded letters to their MPs and the BBC).It also doesn't work which is why NHS has the cost sharing program for drugs that are not reccomended by NICE.Most countries in Europe consider QALE as part of long term policy (EG relative funding for speciality training) but use a cost efficacy measure for assessing interventions. If a drug has 2 efficacy of another drug then it can have 2 the cost.Absolute QALY also makes health inequality go crazy as you are implictly creating a tiered system. US has done a good job at avoiding this (and greatly reducing the lack of access for low-income people), its an area of inequality that IMHO does matter even if most of the others do not. Its clear oppertunity where they others are caused by lack of oppertunity.According to the National Institue of Health as of 2012, Nearly 30% of all Medicare spending occurs during the last six months of a patients life.We spend such an absurd amount of money on end of life care by choice/policy. Its addressable without deciding to place an absolute dollar value on human lives. Until Trump killed the CMS experiments there were a bunch running dealing with this issue, home palliative care/hospice care etc.By The time the negative results became available, 42,000 women in the US had been treated at a cost of $3.4 billion.Its pretty easy to solve this problem by making treatment standards federal rather than decided by insurers. Same deal with drugs and a national formulary. See pretty much any mainland European healthcare system for an example of this in practice.Drugs are the easiest. FDA already have pricing data for all drugs, FDA publish a price efficacy factor when they are notified of pricing changes and insurers are required to cover drugs that have a factor of at least n.Both are going to be a very hard sell as you will absolutely reduce access to treatment rather than increase it. Insurers have fairly limited ability to say no which is why they have pre-auth for so many things.Other advances that increased costs without improving quality are easy to find.A long time ago on reddit I saw a post that stuck with me on this. Surgical intervention for prostate cancer is extremely expensive and actually has worse outcomes than alternatives, its a negative efficacy intervention. Doctors perform them because, understandably, they want to help their patients even if they have an effective death sentence.","title":"Is it Finally Time for QALY Policies in US Healthcare?"},{"text":"Garland needs replacement","title":"Harris' team is considering keeping Biden Cabinet officials if she wins and Democrats lose the Senate"},{"text":" Immigrants are also real people in need.\\n \\n So is the African American community being subjected to systemic oppression.Who wants to spot the obvious contradiction","title":"This is the Democratic Party here.

It was extremely hard. I had all these special education services for me when I was a kid but after I graduated from college I was basically thrown to the wolves. I wasn't even given any information about how to get further help- my mom happened to find that information years later online. And when she realized that I could actually get *financial* services her head practically exploded. I guess because I didn't have a \\"low functioning\\" disability that they thought I would be \\"fine\\" on my own. I guarantee I wouldn't be fine if I didn't have such superhero parents. My parents are separated now and even though I don't live with my dad, he will completely change his work schedule (he's self employed) to drive me to places if I need it.Once we started the process of getting me those services I had to be completely retested. We had to go through years of ancient school and doctor paperwork that we luckily had saved. If my family didn't have the habit of saving every damn thing, I probably wouldn't be so lucky because they outright said I had to have proof that I was diagnosed as a child. And as I said, I had to be retested because they basically had to have \\"proof\\" that wasn't miraculously \\"cured\\" or something! It took about 3 years to actually finish the process and get something out of it. During that time my brother's close friend's partner started working in the local Department of Developmental Disabilities and ended up having connections to people higher up in the department who worked on state level. Every once in a while my brother would give us a name of who to contact, in hopes that they could get our info further down the line. If we didn't have that connection it might have taken longer. ??Thank god I live in a blue state because I probably wouldn't have been given any of those opportunities if I wasn't.","title":"Kamala Harris Fries Donald Trump When Asked About His McDonald's Truther Stance"},{"text":"Mxico here, I've been getting insane amount of ads for expat voters.They are all obviously aimed at Kumala voters.","title":"Dont be surprised when every mail in ballot says Kamala Harris"},{"text":"You mean before Jan 3 lol","title":"Harris' team is considering keeping Biden Cabinet officials if she wins and Democrats lose the Senate"},{"text":"Have you ever asked them what they think a republic is supposed to look like?

Red tape, high administrative expenses, physicians spending hours navigating insurance paperwork and phone trees that are designed to waste their time. It's a massive loss of efficiency in the health care system that harms patient care and drives up health care costs.A majority of the prescriptions I write now are for things that some health plans are requiring us to go through this arcane process to get permission to use, Dr. Resneck explained, adding that prior authorization has been around for decades, but it's really been in the last several years that physicians and patients have seen it massively expandedeven to cover generics.For the medications or procedures that do require prior auth, it's a bit of a guessing game. We don't actually know what piece of information the health insurer is looking for, so we send a bunch of explanations, said Dr. Resneck. But if it doesn't exactly match what the health plan employee is looking for on their computer screen, then oftentimes it won't get approvedeven if it's justified and evidence-based. Oftentimes, the person evaluating the prior authorization requests at the health plan is not a physician and hasnt even heard of the disease the patient has or the treatment the physician is recommending, he explained.Physicians spend an enormous amount of time fighting these prior authorization rejections to get patients the therapies that they need, said Dr. Resneck, noting **in the U.S. the average doctor fills 45 such requests each week.**\\"Ultimately, that increases the risks of bad outcomes and hospitalization for patients when they don't get their health care issues taken care of in time,\\" Dr. Resneck said. \\"We know that as many as a third of patients who get stuck in this prior-authorization process, don't ever pick up their medications.\\"\\"As we look at what things require prior auth ... it used to really be a narrow set of brand-new things that had just come out, but now it's completely unpredictable, said Dr. Resneck. I knew we'd hit a new low in my specialty of dermatology when I wrote a prescription a while back for a generic topical cortisone cream that had been around since the 1960s, and it got stuck in one of these prior-auth logjams.  \\"What does the insurance company want us to use?

Suddenly, Tom found his people. He found others who knew the allure of a sexy XY-BB1 (40ft model). They talked freely, relieved to find others like them. They exchanged dating tips, swapped locations of the hottest new models, even organising meet-ups and gangbangs near the filthiest old poles going - twenty men in a big circle around a gigantic BA-101-XL, drilling holes frantically and working themselves to a froth.Over the years, new members joined, and the network grew bigger. They were Tom's people, and he didn't bother talking to any others. Every day, his entire interaction was with people like him, people who thought he was normal. They might not even mention pole-shagging for a couple of days sometimes, since it was just...normal. Ten, twenty years with his group, and Tom had forgotten that what he was doing was...weird. After all, there were now hundreds of people active in his little group, with little cliques and sub-groups, and thousands of former and potential future members. Then, one day, Tom forgets himself.

His bemusement is laughed over, and Tom can't work out why everyone is so interested and so reviled by what he's doing. He simply can't understand it. Everyone he's ever spoken to for two decades or more has been of the same mindset, and he's completely cemented in his feelings that he's perfectly normal.

The wealth inequality this creates has caused an asset bubble in the US making retirement and home ownership more unachiveable for middle class Americans.

Most Americans including many reading here support a woman's right to reproductive choice and the restriction on homosexual degeneracy that homosexual marriages provide.The Democratic administration has been a strong supporter of our allies in Europe. Trump famously threatened to withhold US aid to Ukraine in what we now know was a lead-up to war. Democrats reversed Trump's plans to pull troops out of Eastern Europe on the eve of a Russian invasion and has been a strong supporter of Ukraine and Israel in their conflicts.Democrats have presided over an extended period of high wages and low unemployment for the past four years.

Ppl have constant complaints about statewide Democratic policies while also completely ignoring how much their lives would be worse under Republican control. People in my area have a higher min wage, lower (bracketed) income taxes, strong state-level child tax and earned income credits, better access to food stamps and WIC, and extremely importantly... expanded Medicaid. All things that disproportionately help rural NYers. Literally over HALF of the families in my hometown benefit from all of these policies because we live in a blue state, yet they still vote strongly red and complain about NYC (which most have never even been to).

His much earlier past political takes and tone is dramatically different than his current song and dance. He sounds like someone who has either been bought or is being blackmailed. He's also lazy. For example, I don't agree with Ryan Grim on a lot of stuff, but he's always very prepared. He does his research. He's at least willing to listen to other people and their viewpoints. He'll concede things that don't make sense to the average working class person. The difference between a Grim and a Kulinski is night and day. Kyle likes to \\"wing it\\" on air, and he's not talented enough to wing it. My take on Kulinski and Jill Stein is Kyle only cares about the position that optimizes the monetized algorithm. He'll take whatever stance that generates the most clicks. IMHO, Kyle and Krystal have an extremely myopic view of politics in general. If they don't think it's wrong for them, it shouldn't be wrong for anyone else. \\"Progressives\\" like Krystal absolutely drive more undecided people into the camp of the GOP.  No one wants to be lectured against some purity test from monetized activists. I think much of the struggle for Stein is she's just too passive. I'm not saying she should be caustic, but I think a more hard edge no nonsense kind of tone would help her campaign more and attract more people who are prone to agree with her. For example, whatever people think of Vivek Ramaswamy, the guy will talk to everyone ( did he have a choice when he was running in the primary?) and will defend his boundaries. Bad faith is met by confrontation by Vivek. Love him or hate him, he's going to defend his positions. And his free speech.

I have lived in a country with large amounts of guns per person in my original home country (not Australia) that were used for defense - including against the government in recent years - and Ive lived with them removed. I know which I prefer to live in. I dont need hand picked statistics from a single country that is the outlier itself decreasing in numbers to tell me that any of unnecessary deaths shouldnt be occurring. In 2020 per 100,000 people in Australia, we have 0.078 deaths occurring as a result of firearm related homicide. The US had 4.05 per 100,000. It could not be clearer that firearm ownership is the factor here given our media landscape is similar. I personally dont believe that citizens are an acceptable collateral for a military complex, and certainly not that number, regardless of its position in the world and absolutely nothing will change my mind.

Whether the groups and leaders are the aristocracy and king, or \\"Germanic peoples\\" and the Fhrer, or MAGA hat wearers and Trump - the fundamental features of the counter-Enlightenment have always been the same.

A big chunk of the population believed in having a white-anglo-saxon-protestant pseudo-aristocracy, owning slaves and politically dominant over other European groups. That group (although expanded to 'white Christians') is now overjoyed to have Trump as a leader, because unlike previous Republican presidents, he's been \\"honest\\" in their view.

But, I would suggest that this was the last hurrah from those still engaged within the aging Counter-Generational movement and their influential cultural legacy.

Now, we have a generation of many children and young adults over 18 that now believe this is correct unless they dismantled those concepts themselves (via life experiences or parents).

I have a college degree and am in my mid 30s.Unless it is owning my own business since then I can do things on my own terms, I cannot see myself doing anything but working in retail- a job considered not important. As someone who has struggled with mental illness and disabilities I think it's great that I can get paid doing something with repeated tasks and minimal thinking involved (though it does eat up my social battery A LOT) and come home and not even needing to *think* about what I did today. I've done an internship at a digital marketing firm where I struggled to write articles and had to bring home work in order to finish it. I owned my own business for a while and struggled to keep up with supply and demand. College was an absolute struggle for me and my mom often asks why I don't do something related to my degree. And even though I'd like to, I know deep down I'd end up being burnt out like what happened while I was in college. Meanwhile I see my mom who, while she gets paid doing it, has to attend zoom meetings during the time where she's out of the office. Her job working at a facility for women recovering from drug addiction, plus her previous teacher assistant job, are EXTREMELY important and I think it's very interesting hearing her stories about what happened at work every day. Sometimes I wish I had more to say about my job, but I honestly can't really remember who I talked to and what I did because it's so repetitive and everything blends together. But looking back I like that. I *need* to do something like that.I hear people saying that my job is just a \\"stepping stone\\" for young people while they work on getting a better job. And they use this \\"retail/fast food worker is unimportant\\" mindset to justify treating people like me as second class citizens. Luckily it doesn't happen much to me, but when it does happen I notice telltale signs that they're mostly Republicans doing this. People like me exist! And we should have the right to support ourselves at our job like any other worker! I can't stand seeing my coworkers having to have multiple jobs so they can support themselves. The only reason why I haven't done that (aside from the fact that I am physically/mentally unable to) is because I've recently been able to get some funding due to my disabilities after years of endless paperwork/testing.

It's quite interesting. A great example of this is China's ghost cities. There have been endless documentaries, articles about these giant \\"abandoned cities\\" with no inhabitants. It's tough to understand these cities when you're from countries that only think in 2-4 year increments, and everything is done for short term profits.A few decades ago Pudong was once called a ghost city by the West. It's perhaps the earliest examples of the Western media and governments not understanding long term planning. It's now a major financial hub of Shanghai and home to 5 million+ people. Dantu was also considered a ghost city in 2010 - it now has a population of 300,000.The famous \\"Paris city\\" with the Eiffel Tower replica was built for 10,000 people. It was the subject of many documentaries showing how it was empty. It now has a population of 30,000 and has been expanded multiple times.In 2010, 60 Minutes and Daily Mail did coverage of Zhengdong, calling it China's largest ghost city. It now has a population of 1.2 million people with 150 financial institutions and an annual growth rate in the 2010s of 25%.Zhendong today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxAQ4XvX2RsAl Jazeera did this article on Ordos \\"ghost city\\" 13 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0brcZTVde-ITechnically they are specifically talking about the Kangbashi District of Ordos. Kangbashi now has a population of 120,000 (with a target of 1 million i believe), has become an elite education district for children and in the top 10 for GDP per capita (although I'm not sure if that reflects wealthy people buying but not living in the district).These cities are being build as part of multi-decade planning. Again, they make no sense to us, but unsurpringly, not doing this kind of planning is exactly why both Canada &amp; the US are facing almost unsolvable cost of living crises that may only be solved by doing exactly what China has already done the last 20 years.

They are the descendants of the diaspora Jews, who were expelled from the territory that is now Israel.

God forbid, stock prices dip to a normal valuation, when money isnt being produced by the citizens during covid. If that happens where would the CIA get their money for black projects. The sad part is that capitalism is the best system for production. But the financial industry is the head of the snake we call modern capitalism. Greedy fucks will always ruin it. Like the robber barons of late to the hedge fund managers we have today. Its the greed for money that will always bite you. Trying to save you wealth from the scary commies coming for it, all the while they re picking your pockets you call your retirement fund, in whatever wealth management fund your employer picked out for you. Also, fair market? Where and when? Sure we had our good decades in the past, but that was just kicking the can. We got off gold to overvalue our money, but its just made up who cares. As long as production keeps rolling and you keep buying. Now we play this delicate dance where we threaten an economic collapse for political leverage. You cant help yourself though, that ego is telling your fear to hold on to that precious resource we call money. You cant possibly find happiness without it. Even your own Christian Bible tells you that money is the root of all evil. But that doesnt cross your mind when youre flexing that master of coin muscle to score social point when in front of peers.

Let's set communism aside for a moment and just focus on capitalism.Do you know what hardcore, dyed-in-the-wool capitalists believe? They believe *any* form of government intervention is \\"communism.\\" They believe that regulation causes monopolies, that corporatism is only possible *because* of state intervention. I.e., pretty much the exact opposite of the solution you are proposing. Your solution is great, I can get on board with it... but most capitalists, and the people promoting it, and the politicians in power - none of those people agree with what you said. They think regulation is detrimental to freedom and detrimental to the natural operation of the free market, which only ever produces good results (by magic or something). That is the ideology you are up against.The truth is, I'm not personally married to communism or socialism as ideologies. For one thing they have been tried, with pretty mixed results. But if your position is that the solution to all our problems is less government and more corporate power, and that *is* the dominant ideology, then your theory is busted and it's provably busted as evidenced by how badly things are going in the world right now. I'm not just talking about inflation, that's just one of many, many problems. We need something new - and that something doesn't have to be socialism or communism, like I said I'm open, but it can't just be \\"more capitalism\\" because that's what we already have and that's what got us here in the first place.I promise you the elites are not interested in communism. Communists would, at a minimum, confiscate all their assets - and more likely, put them in prison or worse. Communists are not friendly to the wealthy and powerful. So when you talk about what \\"the elites\\" are doing, it's different things (they aren't a hive mind, they don't all share the same vision for the future) but *none of it* is communism.Regardless of your stance on capitalism/communism, here's a question to ponder: why should there be elites at all? And why are the fates and destiny of all 8 billion+ souls on this planet determined by such a small handful of people? Are they doing such a great job, that we should let them keep running things? Is that really what \\"freedom\\" is? Should we try to take that power back for the people, so we can live our lives with freedom and dignity?Too many people try to make excuses for *some* elites: \\"this one's bad, but that other one is good, I agree with his politics.\\" They're *all* bad. Elon Musk and George Soros have far more in common with each other than they'll ever have with you or I. You and I have far more in common with each other than we'll ever have with either of them. They've got to go. If we can ever agree on that, then I couldn't care less what system you're planning to implement next, as long as they don't get to come back and take over again in 20 years.","title":"Capitalism is not the reason we are failing.

It's a smaller lead among a slightly smaller share of the electorate than Harris has over those early voters.\\"Either the margin has to close among \\\\[those\\\\] voting early, or Republican margins on Election Day have to be bigger than this to win,\\" said Bill McInturff, the Republican pollster who conducted the NBC News poll with Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.The massive political difference of early and Election Day voters is the latest evidence of a dramatic and enduring shift in the Trump years.In the final NBC News/Wall Street Journal polls of the 2012 and 2016 cycles, majorities said they planned to vote on Election Day, not early.The surveys showed Democrats holding smaller leads with early voters both election cycles (then-President Barack Obama led by 8 points in 2012 with early voters and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led among that group by 14 points in 2016), while the Election Day vote was virtually tied in both instances.People wait in line to vote early in Fairfax on Sept. 20, the first day of early voting in Virginia.Frank Thorp V / NBC NewsThe 2020 Covid-19 pandemic spurred a massive increase in early and mail voting, with the share of early voters in the late October 2020 poll jumping to 68%, with 28% saying they'd vote on Election Day.And with that jump came a massive partisan difference  future President Joe Biden led among early voters by 26 points in the survey, while Trump led with Election Day voters by 29 points.But while the share of voters planning to vote early has dropped between the end of 2020 and now, the major partisan split remains.The Republican drift away from early voting comes after years of?[inconsistent messaging from Trump himself](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trumps-inconsistent-messaging-clashes-rncs-attempted-embrace-early-vot-rcna165972).

Voters are removed from the voter rolls following a biennial list maintenance process mandated by federal and state law. If a county board of elections has not had any contact with a voter for a period of two federal election cycles, then the voter will be sent a forwardable address confirmation mailing. The voter will be required to return the confirmation mailing within 30 days of the mailing. If the confirmation mailing is not returned by the voter within that time, or the mailing is returned by the U.S. Postal Service as undeliverable, then the voters record will be marked inactive in the voter registration database. Inactive voters are still registered voters. If an inactive voter presents to vote, the person will be asked to verify their address and update it if necessary. If a county board of elections has no contact (presenting to vote counts as contact) with the voter for two more federal election cycles, then the voter will be removed from the countys voter rolls and would need to re-register to vote.So you get four federal election cycles of not voting before you're removedyou're considered inactive after two cycles (if you don't return the address confirmation postcard they send you), and you're removed after two *more* cycles.

They claim that the bronzes - looted by British colonialists in the 19th Century from the kingdom of Benin in what is now Nigeria - are also part of the heritage of descendants of slaves in America, and that returning them would deny them the opportunity to experience their culture and history. \\"It is a very interesting argument,\\" says 93-year-old David Edebiri, after laughing for about 15 seconds straight.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63504438This is a reparations issue. It's not just about getting white people to pay up. The Nigerians interviewed in this piece are failing to fully understand and realise the history of slavery, and they are seeking to deny descendents of the enslaved in the U.S. a reasonable requirement. I stand with the African Americans in this case - they have a legitimate claim on at least some of the Benin bronzes and that claim is strengthened because of the evil of institutionalised slavery, committed by the Benin Empire, against their ancestors.If you stand with the African Americans on this case, you are a lot closer to being pro-reparations than you think.The complexity that you are describing is a feature of all dispute resolution commitments ever invented. That's why human beings invented law and law schools and courts. We will handle the complex questions arising from a program of reparations the way we handle complex questions about inheritance and international waters. Sometimes there will be a \\"statute of limitations\\". But we don't have to throw away the whole concept of reparations anymore than we throw away inheritance as a whole because sometimes it gets tricky.Let smart, honest people of integrity work on this for a few decades.

Applicants were encouraged to propose projects to support increasing the number of Hispanics prepared for the STEM workforce, as well as the number of Hispanic educators.Through the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (DHSI) program, 49 grants, totaling more than $28 million, were provided to assist HSIs in expanding educational opportunities and improving the attainment of Hispanic students.Through the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program, 16 HSIs were provided more than $9.5 million in funding to increase the number of, and retain, well-prepared teachers from diverse backgrounds in our nations most underserved elementary and secondary schools.Through the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP), four HSIs were provided more than $1 million in funding to support long-range improvement to science and engineering education to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities, particularly minority women, in STEM careers. Todays [September 19th] grants are part of the Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to creating opportunity for all Americans. To date, the Administration has invested more than $15 billion in HSIsthe largest ever investment. And in July, President Biden issued an Executive Order aimed at advancing equity in economic and educational opportunities at our nations HSIs, including by strengthening their capacity to provide a high-quality education to all students.The list of recipients is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona:Our nations Hispanic-Serving Institutions open up new doors to opportunity and success for Hispanic and Latino students every day, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.

There were both Arabs and Jews living there at the time. So, the Arabs got Jordan and around half of the territory of Israel, and the Jews got the other half of the Israel area. idk, sounds pretty fair to me (especially seeing as many Jews were forced to move to Israel since the Muslim countries had expelled them to go there); Anyhow, the Arabs would have gotten the majority of the land if they didnt reject the proposal. Not to mention the fact that the whole reasons why Arabs are in the Levant and North Africa in the first place is due to colonialism. But leaving that aside, how did the Israelis steal land?Anyway, the Arabs refused to accept this proposal, and thus attacked Israel several times from all sides, losing each time and thus having to concede land; but thats what happens when you start wars and lose. If Hamas werent constantly firing rockets at Israeli civilians, abusing billions of foreign aid dollars, and indoctrinating their children to hate Jews, maybe, there would be a Palestinian state already.","title":"CMV: Zionists have no right to say that we as a society must support Israel."},{"text":"No, I think he thinks he's infallible?","title":"Ted Cruz Calls Zelensky a 'Moron', Claims He Is Campaigning For Kamala Harris"},{"text":"We now have a government:\\nOf the government, by the government, for the government.Prove me wrong.","title":"Capitalism is not the reason we are failing.

It would be helpful to know which end of the spectrum you were angling towards.","title":"CMV: Zionists have no right to say that we as a society must support Israel."},{"text":"See that's the issue, your logic doesn't hold unless history begins between when the Arab ancestors of Palestinians kicked Jews out of their homeland and when the state of Israel was established. You also sort of gloss over the events that were occurring as Israel was established. Most of the people who had their land taken actually fled the region because they expected the Arab states to defeat Israel and they'd have a right to return. Israel's view is they won a defensive war, and especially during that time countries don't get to wage war, lose, and keep their territory. The Arabs who did not flee the area were given full Israeli citizenship, and to this day Arab Muslims have full rights in Israel and represent about 20% of their population. The IDF even rescued an Arab Muslim citizen of Israel, and the people cheered.  \\nAs to your last point, the issue here isn't about a country's existence. This is like you saying that advocating for Nazis in WWII just meant you were in favor of Germany's existence. Everyone knows what would happen to Jews if Israel did not exist, particularly in the context of the current war. How many non-hostage Jews currently live in Palestine? Jordan? Egypt? Lebanon? Yemen? Afghanistan? Iraq? Do I need to keep going? There are over 50 Muslim states, and it's been 76 years since the creation of Israel, anyone who had their home taken is currently a senior citizen. Meanwhile anti-Jew hate crimes are the number one hate crime in virtually every western country because just as Islamists are antisemitic, so are white supremacists. Israel is the one country where Jews are safe, when they're not being slaughtered by the elected and publicly supported government in Palestine. Wanting to abolish that one country is not about the country, but instead the people living there. Yes being displaced sucks and I would support Israel being forced to compensate those who had their homes taken, even if it was after a defensive war and that was absolutely not ordinary at the time. But the fact is there are plenty of countries in the Middle East where Arab Muslims are safe, including Israel today. There is no country in the entire world where Jews are safer than Israel, the world's only Jewish state. And calling for that state to be abolished would absolutely result in dead Jews and in the global Jewish population being less safe. And yes I'm going to judge you for supporting policies which would lead to that.","title":"CMV: Zionists have no right to say that we as a society must support Israel."},{"text":"I love how republicans act so offended Ukraine favors democrats when republicans have literally done everything they can to make Ukraine lose the war","title":"Speaker Johnson demands Zelenskyy remove Ukraine's ambassador to US after Pennsylvania visit | AP News"},{"text":"Compared to Kamala, Biden, honestly, would be a much better pick for president than her.","title":"Trump was right when he said Biden cant stand her"},{"text":"Not surprising considering how Trump repeatedly sucked up to our adversaries (Russia, China, NK)","title":"\\"Perhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat\\" (per former Republican SecDef Robert Gates) endorsed Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Regarding a new government, do you mean removing Bibi and the Likud from power, or something else entirely?

Shouldnt you protest that instead? why didnt you protest before Oct 7 against Hamas? By the way, you know what would happen if a Jew tried to practice his religion in Gaza? he'd be killed; thats what an actual apartheid/genocide looks like (whereas Arabs are free to practice Islam in Israel).

As far as the point regarding pro Palestinians, my point is that what pro Palestinians do is irrelevant when the post is saying Zionists should do something. Its very relevant because to someone trying to change your view. For one thing, its the only way I found out that your adamant belief that clearly Zionists do it more comes from the most biased sampling I can imagine. If youre genuinely interested in having your view changed, now is the time to consider why you took such biased data as proof. To me, it would be a big red flag that I was influenced by my own subconscious biases. Connecting the two is whataboutism. You connected them by taking issue with one but not the other. If you had said yeah, thats just as bad. Im just contemplating Zionism at the moment. then I would have dropped it. Instead you argued it happened less, despite that having no bearing on the morality of it, and with the only evidence being that you find one when you go to the places known for it. Even then, its clear that Zionism targets laymen on places like r/Conservative, r/Jewish, r/worldnews and many real life forums.And what do you think happens when you go to subs with the opposite leaning?My approach to changing your view requires you to take a step back and examine your own argument, see the oddities in it, and consider where they come from in order to reassess internal biases. Its not a comfortable thing to do but Ive learned a lot doing it and am a better critical thinker for it so I highly recommend it.","title":"CMV: Zionists have no right to say that we as a society must support Israel."},{"text":"Palestine wasnt a nation when Israel was established.

On broadcast stations across the country, pro-Harris forces have spent nearly $73 million on 73,000 ad spots. Pro-Trump forces have spent just under $45 million on 52,000 ad airings. Harris and her supporters have spent nearly $97 million in the past two weeks. Trump and allies have spent about $55 million. Harris is out-spending Trump on local and national cable nearly 4:1, and Harris has spent over $4 million on radio ads in the last two weeks, while Trump has spent $0. On the other hand, Trump has spent nearly $2 million for ads on satellite television, but Harris has not spent any on that medium. the Harris campaign (including spending by her joint fundraising committee) had enormous leads in spending over Trump by a factor of 5:1 in the past two weeks. On Meta properties, which include both Facebook and Instagram, Harris advantage is particularly strong: Harris has spent $22.8 million to Trumps $1.4 million over the past two weeks. The Trump campaign (and his joint fundraising committee) has spent more on Google properties to the tune of $6.5 million, but it also pales in comparison to the $17.3 million that the Harris campaign has spent over that same time period. ...pro-Harris advertising on broadcast TV is now more common in almost all media markets across the country, as Figure 2 and Table 4 shows. The only exceptions to this rule are Erie, Pennsylvania, a few small Michigan markets (Lansing, Marquette and Traverse City) and a few markets in the South: Augusta, GA; Greensboro, NC; Greenville, NC; Greenville, SC (which reaches a few counties in Georgia and North Carolina); Wilmington, NC; and Tallahassee (which reaches some counties in Georgia). Pro-Harris advertisers have also been on the air in the past two weeks in several markets where there is no pro-Trump advertising. These markets include South Bend, Indiana; Youngstown, Ohio; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Toledo, Ohio; Duluth, Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota and Yuma, Arizona.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 26, 2024 - 40 days until election day!"},{"text":"Everyone hates Ted Cruz.
