Short of decompiling the code actually installed in the machines along with a chain of integrity there's a lot of room for this to be possibleyes. this is the actual concern. I'm not dismissing the possibility out of hand at all. What I'm saying is that the whole \\"IF/THEN and WHEN\\" stuff is just pseudotechnical babble. Knowing that they actually do adjust the system clock and test for that is indeed something I'd like to know. Or even knowing if the machine itself even has a system clock with any concept of global time; I'd assume it does, but that's not actually a requirement for such a system. My point was more that the letter never addresses that as a possibility. I.e., you absolutely can test this if the machine has a system clock, while the whole IF/THEN and WHEN stuff makes it seem as if that's just not even a thing. Nor does it address that we don't actually even know for sure that this systems have such a clock, though this seems possibly easy to verify if the receipts that many (most? all?) of these machines generate provides a timestamp. * what's the actual process for testing the machines integrity?\\n* what's the actual process by which software is installed and updated?\\n* how is the candidates' data actually entered\\n* does the machine actual even have a system clock with the concept of world time\\n* can that clock be altered for testing? \\n* is that clock altered for testing?This is a big part of why I advocate for open source.

Those affected are taking action now. | CNN"},{"text":"Let's work backwards from the vote results and the messaging that led to it.The evocative imagery of \\"hundreds of thousands of criminals,\\" though untrue, was powerful enough to trigger hysteria on a national level and across demographical borders. Urban flight, through coordinated price fixing (White Pages), and by Wall St firms propping up AirBnB and buying entire surburban residences, made historically white communties see more brown people over the years. BLM marches and subsequent riot damages helped reinforce pre-existing bigotry and prejudice to non-white people. Trump gassing them (painted as criminals) for a photo-op with a bible, reinforced their idea in him as a righteous champion who would be tough on crime (peaceful protesters.)Remember, that demonstration outside the whitehouse was peaceful until police clad in riot gear started pushing them out by force. Barr's DOJ was responsible, yet also likely saved the protesters from live fire, which Trump was fine doing.The movement was inspired by no-knock warrants, excessive force by police, unjust actions without good reason or suspicion, and their coverup attempts all over by rogue union leaders.Right-wing influencers, especially the younger ones, like to hand out fake money to the homeless, and giddly film themselves admitting it. This gets laughs, but when most of the targets are black, then it becomes that black people are to be mocked.Didn't George Flyodd use a bad $20? Or was it selling loose cigarettes? Or did he jaywalk? Or did he fight back? Man, it doesn't even matter. It's justified action against a criminal and its funny when they scream. Right? You know you know a type like that. They proudly meme it all over their socials.They laugh when a non-white person is found hanging from a tree, gunned down over a bag of skittles, killed for taking a jog, shot at the door. 4chan mentality is a becoming the norm of the right-wing youth. There's a pressure to conform.Lack of discipline, lack of empathy, or open hostility from parents drives this immoral superiority complex. Lack of access to quality educators, or time-proven approaches toward education, and attacks by the state to side with such unruly and diseductated and disrespectful parents, impacts the ability to intervene in such matters as would otherwise lead to better decision-making and critical thinking and less to social pressures from their peers.We move to good vs evil. No longer reliant on great minds who challenge conventional religious order, those who teach and provide access to information without bias are treated as evil. God must be the intervention, God makes right, follow God and can I get an Amen for a holy civil war? The demons are on the left, they are in your communities, they are violent and dangerous, they are indoctrinating your youth.They are eating your cats, dogs, and pets, right? Let's justify what we need to because only evil people do that, and Trump is the only one exposing it. To obey Trump is righteous. To obey Trump is to bring order. The world is full of darkness and only Trump can save us. To obey Trump is to bring us closer to prophecy..... We are drunk on our own delusions.There are so many factors driving our conditions that it becomes tough to explain what you are seeing with your own eyes, but it all comes together.","title":"Donald Trump has promised a closed border and mass deportations.

Whereas in the US you could buy that Chinese car for a lot less than the equivalent American car.  The idea is not to shut off trade with China,  but make it a financial necessity for them to build a factory in the US and hire Americans to work in the factory.  Or they can reduce the tariffs they impose on American products to make them more competitive in the Chinese market,  which would drive up the sales for the American company.  Will it work?

Either they are discriminating against people born with the sex of Female (cis women and not-cis [thanks mods...] men) which is not allowedIt is allowed. It's literally what is being fought for even by those that promote gender identity. That those that share a gender identity of woman should be segmented from those that identify as men. They simply wish to leverage gender identity **rather** than sex. Rather than sports be segmented by sex, such to be segmented by gender identity. Otherwise the argument would be that ANYONE should join any league of use any bathrooms they desired **regardless** of one's gender identity. or if they fire someone for being born male but dressing in feminine waysThat's gender expression, not gender identity. a cismale would still be protected if he decided to wear a dress.

I am also gay with conservative family that continues to vote Republican, in spite of loving me and my now wife. It is a struggle to know they have   and will continue to vote in ways that put my marriage and human rights at risk.And yet. Having my family at my wedding was one of the most affirming experiences for me - to see my family truly see me. They were in a room full of gay people, maybe for the first time. They got to see how much love there was, between me and my wife, but also in the people who showed up to support us. My parents were face to face with the community that their news sources tell them to fear, and all they saw was love and support and beauty. And I got to see them, see that. In some ways, it helped with the anger because I got to say (not out loud but in my heart) See?? This is who we are!! We all laughed and cried and danced together. Its a memory I will cherish and I am so grateful I got to have.It sounds like your family may be similar, if they are wanting to attend your wedding. I think that because of the recency of the election, you may be feeling especially hurt and angry about their choices and actions. I get it. I am angry too.But if those relationships have any value to you, I think you will be hurting yourself as much as them by explicitly uninviting them to your wedding. You deserve to feel the love and support of your family on your wedding day. Seeing you and your husband on that day may impact the way they vote in the future, and it might not. But if you truly wish to get through to them, lashing out might feel good in the short term, but it will only push them further away. Finally, your future husband deserves to have the family he wants to have at his wedding. Pushing what you want onto how he treats his family is hurtful. It is as much his wedding as yours. Do you want to start your married life with a family in fracture? And potentially resentment from your future husband for the changes in his familial relationships? Im very sorry you are going through this, and I know that anger and hurt well. I hope you find a way through this that allows both you and your fianc to have the best possible wedding day, focused on your love for one another and the life you building together.

Congratulations to Tom.

Disney and IBM didn't do enough to hide the game - Disney for employees training foreigners and IBM  got caught laying people off and hiring back as contractors with no benefits. The IBM example has nothing to do with foreigners, but shows how corps play with the rules. Since then they have gotten smarter.

That means those governments are taxing their own people to be able to send Americans stuff more cheaply. Why should our government oppose foreign governments taxing their people to send us cheap stuff!? To quote noted free market economist Ludwig von Mises on the subject of such unfair trade: \\"The more unfair the trade, the better!\\" The more foreign governments want to subsidize U.S. consumers, the better! These transfers of wealth make them poorer and us richer.Special interests in the U.S. don't want foreign governments to send consumers free or cheap stuff, because they want to be able to sell us more expensive stuff. The case for tariffs is yet another case of special interest groups lobbying for government policies that use violence to enforce polices that enrich them at our expense.The U.S. has many core reasons why it can't compete globally, and most of them are due to overly burdensome government policies and taxes. The true path to wealth is for government to fix those problems by removing those regulations and lowering taxes. Raising tariffs is a step in precisely the wrong direction.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"Yep.

In his concurring opinion on the Dobbs case in 2022, Clarence Thomas stated that the court, \\"should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell\\" - with Obergefell being the case that required the entire nation to recognize and perform same-sex marriages.This isn't an argument against birth control (Griswold), legalized gay sex (Lawrence), and government-recognized same-sex marriage per se. There's a line of case law that takes the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments (\\"No person shall [...] be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\") and finds protection for unenumerated rights there (\\"substantive due process\\" or \\"SDP\\"). Judges have done this because the Supreme Court basically cut the Privileges or Immunities clause (\\"P&amp;I\\") of the 14th Amendment  (\\"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\\") in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873). The reasoning in that case makes no sense to anyone.Thomas thinks the Supreme Court was wrong in 1873 and wrong with the more recent substantive due process in reaction to the Slaughter-House Cases. He is advocating throwing all that convoluted case law out in favor of a much simpler revived Privileges and Immunities clause. This is an issue that nobody else on the Supreme Court cares about, including the three Trump appointees. The thinking from the other judges is probably along the lines of while Slaughter-House was obviously wrong, going with a P&amp;I regime isn't going to give meaningfully different results than an SDP regime, so why bother throwing out 150 years of precedent?","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"The neo nazi?

There are several variations on the 3 main themes.\\nThe machines at the precinct level have been hacked to alter the tallies. It is believed that this method was used by machines from a manufacturer who employed a person with multiple fraud convictions, as their lead programmer, from the mid 1980s to the early 2000s. When decompiled, the software was found to have a backdoor and set of switches in it, so that a certain proportion of votes for candidate A would be transferred to candidate B. Typically, 1 out of every 30 votes for A would be instead recorded as a vote for B. That would reduce the votes for A by 3.33% and increase the votes for B by 3.33%. (I have read there is some evidence this was done in the Bush/Dukakis election of 1988, and in the Bush/Clinton/Perot election of 1992, but that in the latter case, the winner won by such a large margin that the software could not overcome the result, since it only stole a fixed percentage of the votes.)\\nThe next method is the man-in-the-middle attack. The precinct level machines would be hacked to send their vote tallies to a 3rd party. The third party would then examine the results and alter them either with a program, or manually, to get the desired outcome. This method was allegedly used to alter the outcome in Ohio, in 2004, resulting in the reelection of Bush. There is also a persistent story on the Web that Aaron Swartz, one of the founders of Reddit, detected Karl Rove of the Romney campaign attempting to use the same software in 2012, but he was locked out of the software by Swartz, who changed the passwords, hours before the election. Aaron Swartz was later found dead, an apparent suicide.\\nHack the tallying computers at a central location. This method was used by Paul Manafort, who was caught doing this during the election in the Philippines of Marcos vs Aquino. Exit polls of the voters showed 70%-75% vote for Aquino, but the tallies broadcast from the national election center were clearly being manually altered, since the official numbers for Aquino would drop and the numbers for Marcos would rise, until the totals were 90% for Marcos and 10% for Aquino. Aquino was later murdered, and Marcos and Manafort were forced out of the country due to the obvious fraud. Manafort then tried the same thing in Ukraine.\\nMethod 1 is difficult to detect, unless you have access to the software in the precinct level machines. Note that members of MAGA with ties to the FSB did gain access to machines with the vote tallying software after the 2020 election, and before the 2024 election.\\nIn 2016 there were claims by Green Party members that when they hand counted during the recounts in Wisconsin, they found that the vote tallying machines had miscounted the first 200 votes they audited, and that out of 200 votes, 3 had been switched from Clinton to Trump. The observer was ejected for disturbing the peace, and the recount went forward, using only machine recounts. No hand recounts to check the accuracy of the machines were allowed.\\nMethod 2 can be be defeated in 2 ways. (A) by requiring verbal transmission of vote tallies over the phone, or by requiring paper tallies to be transferred by couriers, who provide physical security for the sealed results. (B) If data is transmitted via the internet, including Starlink, the data should be encrypted and broken up into packets that are each sent by a different route, so that only the first and last links in the chain of custody have access to the entire message, and thus a chance to decode the message. I think that was what the lady in the video was yammering about, but as encryption is ~operating system independent, I don't know what Linux would have to do with it.\\nIf the third method was in use, well, if you cannot trust your election workers at the highest levels, there is no defense.\\nIncidentally, this was the method Trump tried to use in Georgia in 2016, when he asked the Secretary of State to \\"Find me 11,780 Votes. Just recalculate the numbers,\\" meaning add the totals incorrectly.\\nA variation on method 1 would be to intercept the ballots at the Post Office, and not deliver mail-in ballots from addresses where known Democrats lived. Since party registrations are not secret, that would be possible, though hard to conceal from later detection.\\nSources:\\nThe New Yorker. Article appeared in the late 1990s, describing type 1, describing the criminal record of the programmer, and calling for a new generation of more secure voting machines, which were adopted gradually over the next 20 years.\\nWired Magazine. Story included an interview with a programmer who said he had built such a system (type 2) for the State of Florida. He was killed shortly after he testified before Congress.\\nNumerous news reports: LA Times, Washington Post, Reuters, AP.\\"","title":"Trump announces Tom Homan to be his Border Czar"},{"text":"And a shit ton of the rest of us ??","title":"Jim Jordan confronted on Trump's election fraud claims after 2024 victory"},{"text":"Policemen died where, when?

A Trump admin cant be any worse than their current situation. One of three outcomes are likely:1. Trump doesnt care and hands the Ukraine portfolio to a sub cabinet official like Undersecretary of Defense. They will manage the conflict just as Biden has, ensuring money keeps flowing to US defense manufacturers, but otherwise no meaningful change to Ukraines outlook. 2. Trump fast forwards the coarse Biden put them on and forces Ukraine to officially cede the territory they have lost and cannot hope to regain militarily. If they are lucky they might get security guarantees from NATO, or maybe just the US. 3. Abandonment. Trump gives Ukraine up to encourage Russia to pull away from Chinas sphere of influence.

I got a feeling my time here is limited, but I'll just mention that I lean Reaganite and believe in that conservative movement (limited gov't, individual responsibility, supporting our allies and NATO, low deficits, etc.)  \\n  \\nTrump destroyed the Republican Party in 2016 and now destroyed the Democratic Party in 2024. The GOP is now a populist, isolationist party. The fact the the words \\"populist\\" and \\"isolationist\\" are no longer dirty words lays credence to that claim. I could go into how levying Great-Depression type tariffs (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Smoot-Hawley-Tariff-Act), refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power (calling up a GA state official and telling him to change vote tallies is wrong), threatening to abandon our allies and cozying up to dictators around the world are antithetical to the conservative movement, but I've heard all the responses and we'll just have to agree to disagree. The bigger issue isn't even this election, it is what happens in 2028. I expect the Democrats to now reach the conclusion that, \\"We need someone like Bernie to beat MAGA and 'win back' the working class.\\" So, next election you could very well have a MAGA populist running against a Democratic Socialist. And once the Democratic Socialists go all in on universal heath care, universal basic income, paid sick and maternity/paternity leave, 4-day work weeks, raising the minimum wage, etc. it will become a race to the bottom and promises that the GOP will have a hard competing with. At the end of the day, what MAGA really stands for is despising the \\"elites.\\" I strongly suspect that if offered the choice between Bernie and Nikki, the majority of MAGA would prefer Bernie despite the fact that Bernie is quite literally a self-proclaimed socialist. I'll leave this thread with a story about President Ford. When President Ford had an assassination attempt, he walked into his upcoming meeting and didn't say a word about it. That's class. When it was time to pardon Nixon, he did pardoned him because that was what the nation needed to heal, despite that likely costing him the election. That's courage.I get that with the advent of AI, outsourcing, automation, the word is changing fast, maybe too fast. I get that real wages are stagnant and the current millennials/Gen Z are the first generation that might be worse off than their parents. I get that the average age of a first time home-owner is now 8-10 years higher and that many people feel the need to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. I get that guys in particular are feeling that they are being left behind in an economy that no longer values traditional masculinity (which are overwhelmingly good values). I don't know the answers to those issues, but I don't believe that Trump is the answer to them.","title":"Donald Trump wins most popular votes by a Republican ever"},{"text":"Don't worry she cashed out nicely for that bought poll.

There is powerful economic momentum behind the global transition, which the US has led and gained from, but now risks forfeiting. The devastating toll of recent hurricanes was a grim reminder that all Americans are affected by worsening climate change.Much like after the previous withdrawal, cities and state within the US committed to climate action will try to fill the void of federal indifference, acting as de facto representatives at global summits and even engaging with other countries on how to cut emissions.No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back, said Gina McCarthy, former climate adviser to Biden and co-chair of the America Is All In coalition of climate-concerned states and cities.Our coalition is bigger, more bipartisan, better organized, and fully prepared to deliver climate solutions, boost local economies and drive climate ambition, she said. We cannot and will not let Trump stand in the way of giving our kids and grandkids the freedom to grow up in safer and healthier communities.Domestically, environmental groups have said they will attempt to rally Democrats, as well as some Republicans, to oppose Trumps tearing down of climate policies, which is anticipated to include major cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and weakened pollution rules for coal plants, cars and fossil fuel drilling. President Trump will face a bipartisan wall of opposition if he attempts to rip away clean energy incentives now, said Dan Lashof, director of the World Resources Institute.However, Trumps election victory has been a deeply sobering one for those concerned about the climate crisis. The issue was barely championed by Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, with polling showing that voters considered it a minor priority despite scientists warnings of record-breaking temperatures and two devastating, heat-fueled hurricanes that smashed into the south-east US just a few weeks before election day.This should be a wake-up call C the climate movement urgently needs more political power because the climate crisis is moving infinitely faster than our politics right now, said Nathaniel Stinnett, founder of the Environmental Voter Project, which sought to turn out the vote of environmentalists in the US.We must work every day to build an unstoppable bloc of climate voters because were running out of time.\\"","title":"A wrecking ball: experts warn Trumps win sets back global climate action"},{"text":"If you want to see how dishonest the mainstream media is just look at how they are all denying this story","title":"FEMA confirms workers told to 'avoid homes' with Trump signs during hurricane response"},{"text":"Co-author, technically.","title":"Trump announces Tom Homan to be his Border Czar"},{"text":"Just wait until Donnie finds out that Elon makes electric cars.","title":"Donald Trump and Elon Musk Are the Bromance That Cannot Last"},{"text":"Every Republican still supports Alex jones for what he did to sandy hook parents.

They just have to say porn is an illicit drug, which they basically have (but not explicitly) in that quote, and use that as a premise. Let X be an (addictive) illicit drug and Y be pornography (any kind of porn). Then X = Y and X entails the death penalty, so Y also entails the death penalty.

I did ballot curing phone banking to help voters in PA understand how to cast provisional ballots. Some counties in PA mailed out ballots on the Friday before Election Day. Yes, you read that correctly.* Ballots in PA **must be received by 8pm on Election Day**\\n* Many voters (tens of thousands at least) did not have their ballots **mailed to them** (no, not received, **not even mailed**) until Friday, Nov 1. Now, with that said, there's no evidence yet that this altered the outcome of any race. But it is critical to understand why provisional ballots were necessary and why they absolutely must be allowed to be counted.As far as Erie, the data to date shows that Erie shifted less to Trump than most other counties in PA. So far, it shows a 0.5% shift from 2020, far less than many counties - even very blue ones. So while the situation in Erie is a problem, it's not necessarily one that indicates Democrats suffered greater disenfranchisement.That's why it's just such a show of bad faith on McCormick's part to demand Casey concede. Voters of all party affiliation were screwed over by these mishaps. Just count the damn ballots. Concession is not legally binding regardless. The result will be whatever it is when all ballots are done being counted. Just let that process happen. And stop trying to disenfranchise voters, many of who might be members of your own party. The hypocrisy here is what really gets me, as always.  If they actually cared about election integrity, this would be the place to actually show that. But, of course, they do not. They only care about winning. When fraud is a useful narrative to contest a loss, they use it. When actually counting votes might imperil their victory, they do not want it.","title":"Democrats hold out hope in Pennsylvania Senate race as Republicans declare victory"},{"text":"If we enforce the laws then we will look partisan which is a fate worse than handing the country over to nazis. /s","title":"The intensifying threat of Donald Trumps emoluments - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington"},{"text":"As much as I disagree with aoc Id love to be viral with her","title":"Trump announces Tom Homan to be his Border Czar"},{"text":"I guess Im asking is there something specific that would need to get passed for the movement to say ok this worked","title":"What is 4B?

The group suggests criminal penalties should also include hosting or maintaining a website that encourages or facilitates efforts to obtain an illegal abortion, offering or providing abortion doula services and making referrals to an abortion provider. The group recommends states allow civil action to be brought by state or local officials or relatives of the pregnant woman against a person or entity that violates the abortion law.This is saying they want, for instance, a Catholic mother to be able to sue everyone who helped their teenage daughter get an abortion out of state.","title":"Trump appoints project 2025 co-author as border czar."},{"text":"It's so funny that DEM/libs pivoted so quickly to anti tariff when ol Biden is more than happy to maintain and even expand tariff.","title":"Cuban implies Trumps tariff threat having negative impact right now"},{"text":"You can thank all the Dems that didn't get off their butts to vote (at the very least 1.5 million Dems did not vote, well know better number in a few days), AND all the women that decided the Taliban treatment of women is what they want.

The studies done after the fact found that it cost over 100,000 American jobs and cost American consumers billions of dollars every month. On top of that, the trade deficit increased to its largest level in 10 years, which was the opposite to the intended effect.?\\nThis time he wants tariffs on everything across the board. It will be incredibly detrimental to the economy as a whole and everyday people. Sure, there's a time and place for tariffs, but simply applying them across the board is reckless and stupid.?\\nIt's not a coincidence that the rise of America as an economic juggernaut coincided with the end of protectionist policies. The US is an advanced economy with an educated workforce and high salaries. Opening up new factories (which will take years) to start mass producing cheap products is not a good use of the American labor force. Particularly when the unemployment rate is already low.?\\nTrade between countries tends to be a mutually beneficial relationship. If Trump blows up every free trade agreement the US has, other countries will reduce the business with the US and take it elsewhere, to the detriment of the American economy.

No other country does this. Electing a president at the same time as the legislature isn't that unusual, but also not universal. France, for example, holds its presidential election in advance of the regular legislative elections. Kind of helps to know who the president will be when deciding who the legislators should be. Americans wait two years for this opportunity. Other countries don't even have a president, or the president is chosen through a different process. But also, having state and local offices on the same ballot? Absolutely nuts. How can you possibly run a meaningful state or local campaign when federal politics are sucking all the air out of the room? Other federations don't hold federal and state/local elections at the same time.And finally, Americans just elect *way* more offices in general than basically anyone else, not to mention things like ballot measures. So those state and local elections are already comparatively huge, even *before* combining them with an already complex federal election.

Trump won Bucks County, the largest swing county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and filled with wealthy suburbanites, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to win the county in over 35 years. This was also true for the Amish community in Lancaster County. He also won rural Anson County, North Carolina, which is approximately 48% black. This was the second time a Republican won the county since Reconstruction (1876). In addition, Trump won 55% of Latino voters in the state of Texas (14 of the 18 counties along the Mexican border), including Starr County with about 57.7% of the vote after voting Democratic in past presidential elections for 132 years straight. Almost 50 percent of Muslim American voters in Dearborn, Michigan cast their votes for Trump. Shit, Even Tim Walzs home county went for Trump.https://torrancestephensphd.substack.com/p/the-paycheck-to-paycheck-voterEdit to add more from this commentary:The Democrats have gone way too far whacko left and have failed to learn anything from Hillary Clinton's loss.

Going on television news and calling people uneducated because of their voting preference is not a smart or winning message.**When 70% of the nation tells you to your face that they see the nation on the wrong track, maybe you should listen and refrain from telling them what they experience is wrong.** Harris could not even explain the concept of inflation and her media flunkies conflated the rate of inflation going down with actual inflation, which for the record is cumulative - the prices remain 20 percent higher and do not magically go down.

The gap between these two contains a much stronger signal of the class-partisan cleavage than that revealed by the covariates of vote change, which is the standard approach. The reason is that 2,557 or 83% of all counties are either deep red of deep blue....Basically, the characteristics of McCain-Harris counties are much more certain to reflect the sorts of people who really bought the Democrat line of Trump being a threat to American democracy.

Deciding based solely on who someone voted for doesnt consider the many reasons people make their choices. Everyone votes for what matters most to them, and those reasons may not always match your views.For instance, someone might support John Doe because he has helped lower taxes for small businesses, and theyve struggled with heavy taxes for years. By voting for him, theyre hoping for financial relief and a chance to grow their business. However, John Doe might also oppose same-sex marriage. In this case, the person isnt voting against your beliefs but rather in support of their own needs.On the other hand, you might vote for Jane Doe because she supports same-sex marriage, even if her policies increase taxes on small businesses. Your vote reflects whats most important to you, just like your friends vote reflects whats important to them. Neither view is more valid; theyre simply different.If someone genuinely holds hateful views about same-sex marriage, you have every right to keep them out of your wedding, even if theyre family. But Id urge you not to cut off friends or family just because of who they voted for.

He would let red states monitor womens pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. He would, at his personal discretion, withhold funds appropriated by Congress, according to top advisers. He would be willing to fire a U.S. Attorney who doesnt carry out his order to prosecute someone, breaking with a tradition of independent law enforcement that dates from Americas founding. He is weighing pardons for every one of his supporters accused of attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, more than 800 of whom have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury. He might not come to the aid of an attacked ally in Europe or Asia if he felt that country wasnt paying enough for its own defense. He would gut the U.S. civil service, deploy the National Guard to American cities as he sees fit, close the White House pandemic-preparedness office, and staff his Administration with acolytes who back his false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen.\\"HOW IS THIS NOT A DICTATORSHIP","title":"But Trump had never even heard of Project 2025.

A lot of the material we covered was definitely extremely high-level, and if I talked about it to my group of friends, they would look at me like I grew a second head. It's just that complicated, but it's a language that academics and policymakers understand. The issue of that is translating it to be more digestible. The average person will most likely never see it at that high of a level, and if someone says they do, they're either at that level because of where they work or what they study, they're lying through their teeth, or they ended up reiterating what they heard from someone they follow. The standard is to take what we studied or work on and make it readable at the 8th grade level since the average American reads at an 8th grade reading level, at the highest. That's what it was for the longest time, but now it's a lot harder, and a lot of people (not just kids, but full grown adults) are having a hard time reading at the 8th grade level. This isn't a jab at them being dumb at all, but with so much media coming out that's just noise at this point, people don't know what to believe/like to listen to something unless they hear something that agrees with their already set viewpoints. The media recognizes this and goes with the flow of what makes the most money.Academics and those at the policy level are having a harder time translating what they do and study, because they're already translating extremely difficult material to something that is easier to understand for someone who is 12-13 years old. Now, there's been talks of pushing it down even more to a 6th grade reading level, which makes it even harder than what it is now. My friend who's doing his Ph.D says that he knows for sure that what he's studying (Cognitive neuroscience) is something that will be extremely difficult to translate down to the average American.Also, a few sources for anyone who thinks I'm full of shit about the whole average American reading at most, 8th grade level: [Do More Than Half of Americans Read Below 6th-Grade Level?](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/08/02/us-literacy-rate/)[55 US Literacy Statistics: Literacy Rate, Average Reading Level](https://www.crossrivertherapy.com/research/literacy-statistics#:~:text=Average%20Reading%20Level%20In%20The,according%20to%20The%20Literacy%20Project)[Reading the numbers: 130 million American adults have low literacy skills, but funding differs drastically by state](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/10x-adult-literacy)","title":"Fox host questions GOP rep. with report Trump tax plan adds $7.5Tn in debt"},{"text":"Completely ignoring the far right white supremacist agent provocateurs inciting the burning and looting.","title":"I want to break stuff: Rage room bookings increase after Trump wins election"},{"text":"Any Subaru dealer can help him find his Legacy.","title":"Obama Is Nervous About His Legacy After Trump Victory, Biographer Says"},{"text":"Yes, it doesn't make sense.That's what I was saying by trying to highlight OP's contradictory points.

Usually they are utilized as side puffery statements that flank bigger issues that are more central and actually achievable.OP seemed to indicate this concept would be a central platform that would be successful, but a central platform usually has to have at least a possibility of being successful on a level in some wayEdit to add: Trump spoke greatly about energy independence as a central platform. This topic has been central in the news for a long time and resonated with voters, and also logically impacts costs of goods and household finances, so its not exactly true to say he gave his base nothing. You may not agree with his plans or want to see this change, but he did frequently talk about this.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"2028 primaries are going to be crowded.Stefanik is currently the House GOP Conference Chair - with the GOP expected to keep the House majority, shed be expecting to be in a powerful leadership position.

The move fell in line with a troubling pattern: After their tenure at the FDA, commissioners tend to go on to advise private companies in the pharmaceutical industry.In fact, 9 out of the last 10 FDA commissionersrepresenting nearly four decades of agency leadershiphave gone on to work for pharmaceutical companies. The lone exception, David Kessler, joined the ranks in academia before eventually settling in his current position as chair of the board of directors at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit nutritional science advocacy group. On its own, Gottliebs move from FDA commissioner to Pfizer board member isnt necessarily a problem for the FDA. Theres nothing illegal about the move, Kessler told Quartz in an interview.

Here is why:*  Some of those people may vote republican, but also be in favor of same-sex marriage.  People vote certain ways for all different reasons.  Someone might honestly believe that republicans will be better on foreign policy, economy, or something else, and struggle with the decision because they don't support some of the republican party platform. \\n* Same-sex marriage is currently legal, and has been for nearly 10 years now.  Some people may simply not think that right is at risk of being taken away, and therefore prioritize other issues with their vote.\\n* Some of the people voting republican could be very low information voters.  Especially those who are younger and disengaged - they may just vote a certain way because of their parents or community pressure.  This is especially true if you live in a very right-leaning community. \\n* On a more technical level, there may be some republican candidates who ran unopposed, or who personally are in favor of same-sex marriage remaining legal. If someone voted for some democrats, but some republicans because of these issues, would they also be excluded? Honestly I think your approach with this seems a bit politically charged for a wedding invitation.  If you have relatives that have openly stated in the past that they don't support same-sex marriage, I would just not invite them.  If asked, just say that their prior statements on the issue meant that you thought they would not want to attend for moral reasons.  But putting something on the invitation will be a very divisive move, and even those who support your marriage will probably view it somewhat negatively.  Its not worth the drama that would ensue. Also many people who do not support same-sex marriage probably would not attend.  And for those that do attend, well if they ever bring it up in the future you can call them out for being hypocritical.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"Does it really though?

That is why Harris had acknowledge difficulties and try to explain complicated issues.

It is nice and important to improve said policies and positions of course, but for those demographics, Trump never ran against the actual democratic party to begin with. He ran against the pronoun-obsessed, men- and America-hating version of said party that is being fabricated for them.Again, I am not saying that introspection in that area is not imperative.

When there have been *intense* volcanic eruptions, and I mean massive ranges of volcanoes erupting for thousands of years, this has caused massive rising in co2 levels and global warming, subsequently leading to mass extinctions. When the dinosaurs went extinct, a volcanic range spanning 1,500,000 square kilometres of India (called the Deccan Traps), the second largest volcanic range, erupted for 600,000-800,000 years straight. This caused global warming during the time and resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs (not the meteor although this may have sped it up more). I see power plants as man-made volcanoes, they both let off CO2 and cause global warming. Its estimated the Deccan traps emitted between 10,000 to 30,000 gt of co2 over their eruption period of 600-800,000 years. Lets compare it to the co2 weve emitted since the start of the Industrial Revolution (1900) which is 1,500 gt over the past 125 years. Even if we take the highest emissions estimate from the deccan traps (30,000 gt) and use the lowest estimated time of their eruption period (600,000 years), thats 0.5 gt a year emitted. Compared to us, weve emitted 12gt a year. Thats 24 times the rate of the Deccan trap volcanoes, a good example of a natural cause of co2 emissions and global warming. The reason why rapid global warming and climate change is a problem, is because it changes the environment so quickly it doesnt give species the chance to evolve to keep up with it and adapt to the changing climate, leading to mass extinction events. If you look back at mass extinction events throughout history, these all correspond with a rise in the amount of co2 in the atmosphere and global warming.https://www.google.com/amp/s/communities.springernature.com/amp/posts/mass-extinctions-correlate-with-the-extent-of-climate-change","title":"Old tweet from Trump"},{"text":"The real problem is that the Democratic Party isnt really the party of the working class, either.

South Korea has the lowest birth rate of any country, and despite government incentives, many women still feel the countrys patriarchal structure makes the cost of motherhood too high, and refuse to be baby-making machines, according to reporting from the New York Times.Although it started in the late 2010s, the movement didn't really gain attention in the US until earlier this year. New York magazine published a long feature on it in March in which writer Anna Louie Sussman laid out the ways in which 4B adherents were, as Barbieri demonstrated on TikTok, cutting their hair and eschewing beauty products. The blowback and fear that 4B practitioners experience underscores their conviction that Korea is still a frightening place for women, Sussman wrote, noting the threats and attacks women, and specifically 4B protesters, receive.With the election of Trump, and all the threats to reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights and misogyny that entails, women online seemed to be channeling the fear they felt into action in similar ways.","title":"What is 4B?

In fact, the omnicompetent, sovereign citizen found in the influential writings of Robert Dahl and Walt Whitman is an unattainable myth: voters are incapable and uninterested in fulfilling the role required of them by democracy. Most people are too busy with jobs and families to give politics sufficient attention: rather than spending their leisure time studying the minutiae of trade deals or infrastructure planning, they, quite understandably, pursue more enjoyable pastimes.?\\nEven the minority of voters that have the time and inclination to inform themselves about politics do not behave as folk theory contends. When faced with choice in a democracy, human judgement is overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and bent by self-interest. Voters use information not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them, which the authors describe as enhanced bias.

It's really that simple.Free trade works like a magic wand, it turns what you make best into what you want.The *idea* is to encourage domestic manufacturing, but that leads to inefficiencies. It also takes a decade or more to actually spin up a full production line and logistics. Trumps tariffs, if implemented, will hurt in the short term. Whether they produce long term benefits, well, if I could predict the future I wouldn't be on reddit, I'd be at the horse track.The fact is other nations can make *certain* products better than we can. Whether that's because they have expertise in that field, specialized equipment, or better access to the resources needed to make it.Sometimes it's also because our resources are better spent on other things. For example in America we *could* spend money building climate controlled greenhouses to grow tropical fruits. Or we could just grow what our actual climate allows, and trade with tropical nations.Let's take 2 nations Amestris and Zeon.With their own domestic resources Amestris can make 1 ton of electronics at a cost of $10,000. And 1 ton of machinery at $20,000 because they have the knowledge to make electronics, but lack the raw materials for machinery.Zeon is a developing nation so making electronics is harder, but has easy access to raw materials for manufacturing. They can make electronics at $20,000 per ton, and machinery at $10,000 per ton.Now if both nations want to make 1 ton of Food and 1 on of machinery, it costs them $30,000. *OR* they can both engage in free trade. Zeon produces machinery, Amestris produces electronics, and for the same $30,000 they now get 1.5 tons of each. A higher yield, everybody wins. Because capitalism, like a tide, lifts all boats.Some things you *NEED* to produce domestically. Food and weapons being the 2 biggest. But even then free trade is still better. Because free trade allows you to sell your Barley, which needs large fields, for someone else's Bananas which you can't grow because you have a poor climate for it. And now everyone wins because consumers have more choice.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"His legacy of re-invigorating racial division in America?","title":"Obama Is Nervous About His Legacy After Trump Victory, Biographer Says"},{"text":"No paywall: https://archive.ph/Orybg","title":"A resistance raced to fight Trumps first term.

Getting rid of it is part of Project 2025 advisors agenda. eliminating no-fault divorce is one of the goals of many of the advisors to the project  an initiative put together by groups like the right-wing Heritage Foundation. Newly minted Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance has called no-fault divorce one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace. What many conservatives want is a return to the fault divorce legal system, in which marriage was fundamentally binding unless one spouse  and only one  violated anything on a list of faults articulated by states in hodgepodge fashion. Judges had the power to deny divorces for multiple reasons, leaving people who wanted no part of marriage stuck together. Yet, modern conservatives dont just want to resurrect this system  they want to make it even worse. The fault divorce system assumed men to be breadwinners who were required to continue providing support for their wives if they were at fault for the divorce. It was a part of a social contract in which wives had to provide household labor, ranging from childcare to sex, in exchange for financial security (which after a divorce meant alimony).  But conservatives only want to bring back fault divorce  not the alimony regime that existed with it. This selectivity would make the system even more dangerous for the traditional homemakers that the right also demands. The fault divorce regime was a colonial legal concept that loosened slightly with the arrival of the American Revolution, on the basis that wives should be able to free themselves from husbands who had wronged them. Over the next several decades, individual states added new faults, and each one had a different set of rules.  In some states, for example, the only violation was adultery. Other states had a long list of faults, such as abandonment, cruelty, and drunkenness. Often the law required a witness to prove that spouses fault; in Illinois, for example, a witness had to observe a husband striking his wife twice for the wife to qualify for a divorce for cruelty. If both spouses had violated marriage laws, judges sometimes left them married, even if neither wanted to be.","title":"What is 'MATGA?'

And the amount of revenue it generates for government is minuscule. Perhaps if the minimum wage was raised to a living wage indexed to inflation, then taxing tips might be less petty, punishing, and humiliating. It was always bullshit.

Calling everyone who voted for Trump racist/sexist/stupid. General despair.Putting this caveat in makes it *really* difficult to change your view.  Because your view relies upon a logical electorate that values truth.As others have pointed out, and you've agreed, it is easy for a politician to *say* they're going to raise wages, but it is incredibly difficult to actually do that within the constraints of our laws and economic system.For Trump, things like this aren't a problem.  Because Trump can tell his followers that he's going to do something (like make Mexico pay for the wall), not do that thing (only a few miles of the wall were even built, and Mexico didn't pay for it), but then tell his followers that he did it, and they believe it happened.  If that's not his followers being stupid, I'm not sure what it is.But if your supports aren't stupid, that methodology doesn't work.  Like if Kamala had said that she was going to raise the minimum wage, left the federal minimum wage at $7.25/hr, and then 4 years from now bragged about how she had raised the minimum wage, she's not going to gain support.  She's going to lose support because the people supporting her are going to tell her she's lying and didn't do anything.  Because the people who support her aren't members of a cult.  They are rational, thoughtful, intelligent human beings.So, yeah, your plan is fine.  Whatever.  It won't actually make any difference because making promises to intelligent voters who know it is impossible for you to keep those promises causes those intelligent voters to avoid voting for you (possibly by not voting at all).  So even if this strategy *would* pick up some of the idiot voters who might believe her lies, it would lose the voters that are already supporting her.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"Explain","title":"How bad would it be for DNC if Jill Stein joined Trump/RFK to act as a voice for Palestine &amp; Human Rights from INSIDE their administration?!"},{"text":"Now that they dont have to worry about him being re-elected, going to be a lot more Mitch McConnells hopefully.\\nThis will be Trumps first experience as a lame duck President and he isnt going to like it.","title":"Trump declares Senate majority candidates should allow him to make recess appointments"},{"text":"I like to tell them that this was probably the most secure election ever.","title":"What is everyone thinking now that democrats are calling for a recount, and election fraud?"},{"text":"I mean Blair was under Bush.Since then we've had* Gordon Brown (Labour, 2007-2010) took over from Blair half way through as Blair said he only wanted to do ten years in office.

And he verifiably earned more minority votes in this election than the last while getting similar totals in both elections. Clearly a candidate with more support from every demographic in the country who  received nearly identical total votes in both elections is guilty of cheating. Yeah, its TRUMP who cheated this time.  Leftist logic escapes me.  A better question?  Why did a female minority leftist presidential candidate who actually appeared in public get fewer votes than her old white male predecessor who campaigned from his basement! She was obviously more qualified than Joe. Afterall, she had a To-Do list for her first day and everything.  There are two possibilities: The leftists that are on video counting boxes of ballots after removing election observers were cheating and bragged about the success of their schemes to rid themselves of bad orange man in Time magazine.  These same leftists did cheat in 2020 OR it's actually the leftists who are the racists. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. They can both be proven true. Come to think of it, Biden got more votes than Obama too, didn't he?  The available evidence clearly indicates that the leftists that cheated in 2020 are the real racists.I'm not a Biden crime family fan, but it makes me smile when I consider how much pleasure comes to old Joe (a failing old white guy who fought the civil rights movement with everything he had and openly PROVED his racist inclinations by declaring that he would select the best BLACK female candidate for the supreme court) when he remembers that the leftists he hates most in life both got fewer votes than he did. The pain Biden endures at the memory of the undemocratic back-stabbing political manuveres that forced him out this year's election must be soothed with the knowledge that he will forever be remembered as more popular than both of his bitter enemies. His fond recollection that those enemies can never correct that historical \\"fact\\" - his knowing that those hated rivals can never utter a word in their defense without admitting to falsifying vote totals in 2020 must be satisfying. At least he has the knowledge that he will forever be considered more popular to comfort him in his final days.  Good for that theiving evil old racist white pediphile!
