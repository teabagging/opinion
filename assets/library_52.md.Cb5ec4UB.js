What has happened in recent elections is that Republicans have wrecked the economy, turned the mess over to Democrats, and then campaigned against the Democrats' attempts to fix it, leading the public to punish Democrats for failing to quickly clean up the mess that Republicans left them. I would expect that to happen again. Additionally, climate change, wealth inequality, and distrust in our institutions will conspire to make society unstable and increase poverty. No party will be able to form a durable majority in such conditions. Democrats will likely take power in 2028, but it's nearly impossible to imagine them fixing the problems that Trump will leave them with, meaning they'll lose power again fairly quickly.

You can't honestly believe that half the country voted for Trump because they are MAGA? I know a lot of people who hated both choices they were given in this election - I am included in this category. The choice came down to either not voting or picking the candidate who better aligned with personal priorities on issues. I revile Trump but in this election, I felt I had to weigh which candidate could keep the world from descending into a global war - because right now we have 2 wars either of which could ignite a WW 3 dynamic. Harris unfortunately is weak on foreign policy and is viewed that way by other countries - particularly the authoritarian leaders that are provoking hostilities and waiting for holes in US policy to exploit. I genuinely believe as I posted in this thread already, that if Harris were elected, China would have invaded Tawain. Globally that would be an explosive point of no return.Ironically, many things I hate about Trump are also the  attributes that make our foreign adversaries act more cautiously when he is president. And he did a better job keeping the US out of foreign wars than any president in living memory. That is objectively true.For other people I know, issues like illegal immigration and inflation just tipped the scale for them to vote for Trump over Harris. But understand, that doesn't mean they like him. Harris was a flawed candidate who was pushed on the party and that is evident by the fact that she lost 12 million votes compared to Biden in 2020. Meanwhile Trump's support stayed flat. When neither candidate is viewed as an appealing option, undecided voters default to tangible issues. In this case, Trump had a record that people could at least latch onto while Harris struggled to explain to a lot of voters what her overall vision and solutions were.","title":"Who are Trumps cabinet picks so far and who is in the running?"},{"text":"Yes, and what does *h*e do for *them*?\\"I don't know them, They were with the campaign for a short time.

It's possible to convince someone they're wrong for which system is more democratic - because 99% of us believe in democracy. We have the same foundation as each other.But for the pro-life crowd, they view it as a human life. The pro-choice crowd typically does not - otherwise terminating it would be immoral for most people.The argument then becomes \\"what defines human life?\\". This is an easier argument to have that addresses the foundation of their beliefs and more ground can be gained here. Saying \\"you want to control women\\" is not a convincing counter. Arguing that human life does not begin until after birth CAN be a convincing counter because that's the root of the belief.But it gets a thousand steps more complicated because for many people, religion and faith is how they define human life.So then you either have to convince them that their religion is wrong. Or you have to convince them that abortion is allowed in their religion. Both arguments are incredibly difficult because religion is very complex in its nature - and incredibly compelling arguments can be provided by either side, and have been for millennia and the question has never been solved in any meaningful way.With most of the pro-life crowd, you will step into complex religious debate. They will not be convinced when viewing the problem through the question of \\"pro-life\\" vs \\"pro-choice\\". The real question for most people is actually \\"religion\\" or \\"atheism\\".There's of course so much nuance to this that I can't possibly cover in a single Reddit thread. And of course it's personal to each individual.But as with all persuasion, you have to start with the very root of the objection.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"War is peace.

Fulfilling that dual charge is impossible unless business people are more concerned about the good of consumers than they are about profiting business owners. Of course, officers of a business  have a legal duty to serve business owners.Anyway, the conflict was inherent from the start. And consumers tend not to out-bribe businesses or to out-perform businesses in the \\"revolving door\\" job game. So the inherent conflict got resolved against consumers.  On their respective websites and through their other communications to the public, agencies like the FTC tend to emphasize consumer protection, sometimes to a deceptive degree. However, unfair trade practices of Business A disadvantage both consumers and all businesses that do not engage in those unfair trade practices.  For example, actions against trademark infringement protect the interests of Calvin Klein as much or more than they protect consumers from confusion as to what is or is not a product approved by Calvin Klein. They also protect, as they should, businesses that do not abuse Calvin Klein trademarks. But the dual charge set up an inherent conflict from the start that was soon resolved against the best interests of consumers.","title":"Trump just appointed RFKjr to run HHS."},{"text":"The only thing trump knows about the Bible is that hes selling them.","title":"A pivotal moment?

I know people close to me who had life-changing surgeries, that were considered on the non-essential spectrum. Not transgender surgeries, but not plastic surgeries, they were body deformity correction surgeries wherein the consensus was that they were non-essential (doctors tend to be conservative with these things). I cannot, in good conscience, condemn someone who got cancer or something to bankruptcy just because my other friend has to find ways to finance what I found to be genuinely important surgeries in other places. So for me, I view transgender surgeries the same way. For some individual people, it is very important, I don't deny that, and my political stance on it's funding isn't to discredit that. But at the end of the day it is not life threatening anymore than other body deformities/incongruencies are (threatening suicide doesn't count, because mental disorders are their own issue), and I would be equally, fanatically pissed at my friend if that person played the same gatekeeping role and effectively blocked relief for those with medical debt. There is a very powerful argument to be made on universal morality that no human being should go bankrupt over medical debt. Even many groups that usually shy away from the issue, like conservative Christians, could be shamed into supporting it if the issue was clear cut that way.

Bitcoin is a neutral and objective measure the world can use that can't be printed or controlled by any government or bank. That is an incredibly useful tool and one that is subjectively valued by more and more people. Gold was useful because it it a hard money, meaning it takes work and effort to mine it. Bitcoin is harder than gold and takes it a step further by having a globally verifiable supply that any human or country can audit at any time. It also having a fixed supply means it can't be inflated and is something that can be used as perfect measure of account. It takes understanding the history of money and gold to understand why Bitcoin is being adopted and will become the base layer for finance globally and why that's a great thing for freedom and holding governments accountable.","title":"President Trump may create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to pay off the entire US debt and effectively END the FED"},{"text":"I fell down the anti-SJW rabbit hole back when that was a thing.

Senators on the Human Rights Committee have redoubled their calls on the Liberal government and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc (Beausjour, N.B.) to answer for the systems failures, and to address outstanding recommendations outlined in their 2021 report on prisons.

The minister and Edmonton MP has been tied up in multiple probes into past business dealings for months. The medical supplies company he co-founded, Global Health Imports (GHI), became mired in lawsuits, scandal and probes into whether Boissonnault continued to work with the company after becoming a cabinet minister  which would be illegal.

You're insulting their god and they will not stand for it. I used to think Pro-Vaccers weighed the pros and cons of the technology and concluded the pros outweighed the cons. Then I learned they don't know jack about medicine, medical technology, vaccines, vaccine history, clean bowl theory, the advent of over the counter medicine, or anything surrounding the topic. Like the Far Left they have mantras and they will repeat them without a thought behind them.Then when something contradicts their ideology emerges they'll shout it down or ignore it. Let me give you a huge example. The three measles epidemics in the US. Measles hasn't been deadly in decades thanks to over the counter medicine and a cleaner environment. You get hives, deal with it for a bit, and then get better. We're not living in an era where the common cold was a death sentence or a serious concern.Well the Pro-Vaccers blamed the Anti Vaccers for the epidemics. Until scientists tracked down the origin of all three outbreaks with DNA analysis. Turned out the Measles Vaccine, once again (yes this is an ongoing issue) had live cultures in them. So the vaccinated got measles. Spread it amongst the vaccinated. Then eventually it reached the unvaccinated. With this revelation silence. No, \\"hey we need to increase standards for vaccine production\\" or \\"hey that medical companies cannot be held liable for shoddy products is creating an environment where they don't care if the product is shoddy.\\" Just, muh vaccine.Let's look at Autism. The US government's own lead scientist was fired when he came forward and said the government suppressed his research and lied before the vaccine court. Now he split hairs, but this is what he said. Vaccines don't cause autism. They cause neural swelling and the neural swelling causes autism. When Congress was going to hold hearings on the issue of corruption, they aborted the hearings the day of because their legal council advised them everyone involved would be facing serious prison time.Then there is the issue of microcontaminates. The insert that comes with the vaccine flat out says it doesn't work, and it comes with a myriad of side effects. Historical graphs showing only the Rabies vaccines ever curb the death rates or brought a decline to disease. I'm glad RFK JR is going to play a pivotal role in fixing these issues over the next four years.

And I held my nose to vote for him, something I never could have imagined doing prior to Harris. I'm a lifelong Democrat who leans moderate on fiscal issues, foreign policy and illegal immigration. Trump had the better  record on these issues than the Biden-Harris administration. Don't get me wrong, I still would have voted for a half senile Biden over Trump if that had remained the choice. However Harris' inability to articulate her positions and her lack of foreign policy savvy unnerved me. Between Ukraine and the Middle East we are dangerously near the precipice of a WW 3. And I think China would have taken advantage of Harris' perceived weakness to attack Tawain - making a global war inevitable. So I voted global stability over the temporary stability of our nation with the hope we could endure 4 more years where Trump would grow constrained by the historical realities of a lame duck term. But Trump's cabinet picks are off the rails crazy! They are more radical, unhinged and unqualified than anyone I ever imagined him tapping (Rubio excluded). The first Trump administration was filled with secretaries I disliked but at least I believed they were qualified and sane enough to do their jobs with a few notable exceptions like Betsy DeVos. But his new cabinet is shaping up to look like an entire administration of Betsy DeVos's on steroids and crack! Honestly his cabinet is going to be a political freak show. Outside of the hardcore MAGA supporters who celebrate these fringe firebrands, nobody else takes them seriously. So, I don't even think most Republican Congressmembers and heavy hitter GOP donors anticipated this circus.Trump is testing the reach of his power with these picks. Strategically he will either consolidate his iron grasp on his party if they obediently line up behind his nominees, or he'll invite the first challenge to his authority by invoking backlash in the Senate over Gaetz, Gabbard and Kennedy. Trump already failed to get his pick for Senate majority leader so if a couple of his nominees are voted down in the Senate, the vulnerability of his lame duck term will be exposed early. I'm hoping that turns out to be the case.","title":"Who are Trumps cabinet picks so far and who is in the running?"},{"text":"Housing and Urban Dookie Chutes","title":"Trump admin's lineup"},{"text":"Sometimes I think AOC is on the level and just well-meaning but naive.

Some people were so hellbent on reframing rape as an act of power, devoid of sexuality int he interest of sparing victims of grief, that they were willing to turn logic on its head to get there.  In 2024 I see a lot of heated, angry, and impassioned reaction at the mere suggestion that *rape* has anything to do with sex.  It is, to many very insistent people, all about *men* and their need to subjugate and dominate women.Maybe theyre right, but it sure doesnt seem like that could be right.

We havent really developed any kind of positive story about the role of men in this updated world.

Wade recognized is that there's 3 entities to the transaction, so to speak. There's the mother. The fetus. And the state. The first trimester, the right of a mother to her body is the highest. So, a state regulating abortion must be tied to maternal health because it has no other interest. The reasoning here is because first trimester abortions are safe. The second trimester, the right of a mother to her body is still present. But, a state has an interest to protect maternal health. So, any state regulation has to be related to maternal health.The third trimester, the right of a mother to her body is still present. But, the state has a right to protect life.

You say it's vague but it's a corner stone of western legal structures. A nonperson has no rights, at all. The moment an entity receives personhood means rights will start to accrue. You say that \\"even if a fetus has personhood, it has no right to feed\\" but think about that. It's a crime of omission to let a person in another person's charge (e.g., an infant, or someone incapacitated) starve. As far as tracing this to history - anti-abortion laws that began in the 19th century went against hundreds of years of common law understanding. The common law provided personhood around the \\"quickening\\" which is estimated to be between 18-23 weeks or something like that. It's when people thought a fetus got a soul. The reason it's also in modern debates of abortion is that the state of texas argued that a fetus has constitutional rights. The US Constitution though provides rights to people who are born. ViabilityThe reason this is now an issue comes from the case Casey v. Planned Parenthood. Roe v. Wade had a trimester system. First trimester, women have more rights to abortion access, third trimester, states have more rights to protect the fetus. The second trimester had more of a balancing. In Casey, O'Connor screwed everything up by adding in two concepts. One is that a state can regulate abortion as long as it didn't give undue burdens, and two, is that the demarcation is viability.\\\\-Men dont get a sayThe idea is that women carry children and are the ones that bear the consequences of abortion bans. They're the ones that bleed out. They're the ones that die when an embryo implants to the fallopian tubes. Yet, it's male-dominant, southern legislatures that are the source of the worst bans and have lead to the worst results.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"This is just people being told how to feel/act.

For instance, it shows that the last minute deciders broke heavily for Trump, but does that represent the difference of 100,000 voters or just 100?But aside from that, we should look at what is statistically relevant. Avoid anything that says 54% because that response is almost certainly within the margin of error, or a statistical tie. There are others that I could highlight but for the sake of brevity lets look at just these:* 77% C Democrats arent tough enough on the border crisis\\n* 73% C Democrats dont know how to manage the economy\\n* 75% C Democrats are too focused on fighting Trump rather than bringing the country togetherThat massive. Almost 1/5 undecided voters thought we were wrong on the top issues of the election: economy and border/immigration, and wrong about the threat that Trump himself posed.

[Gallup released a poll a few days before the election. ](https://news.gallup.com/poll/652970/economy-immigration-abortion-democracy-driving-voters.aspx)Scrolling down about a 1/4 page to \\"Most Important Factor in Registered Voters' Presidential Vote\\" you see that for Democratic voters, abortion, protecting democracy, and a particular dislike of Trump were the top 3 motivating factors. For Republicans it was economy, immigration, and inflation (economy 2.0). All registered voters was economy by a lot, immigration, and abortion. Right off the bat, our own voters didn't match the electorate on 2 of the top 3. Which is why I'd then argue that this part in the Blueprint link...**Trust Crisis**: Only 22% of swing voters who broke for Trump believed Harris prioritized Americans like me versus party activistsa stark contrast with the 80% who said Trump prioritizes Americans like me over party activists....suggests that we are in fact being driven by our activists and core base, than listening/responding to the electorate. I'd further argue that voters who ranked abortion, protecting democracy, and a dislike of Trump were locked in with us as far back as at least 2022. Nothing was going to move them away from Kamala; we needed to win the economy and immigration voter.And so, avoiding actually talking about those issues, having every other word out of our mouth be \\"fascism\\" did us no service.

Or you're dismissing the magnitude of his provocations, which the media and general public have been doing throughout this election cycle, let me remind you that the \\"fearmongering\\" and unconstitutional threats are coming disproportionately from Trump and his MAGA coalition.While Trump cries about Democrats \\"weaponizing the justice system against him,\\" he has the gall to threaten to do the same to all those who have either spoken out against him, those who have challenged or criticized him, who have literally risked their necks to warn the American public about him, those who \\"stole the election\\" from him, and those who have tried to hold him accountable.He is a perpetual victim who cries \\"persecution!\\" whenever there's the remote chance that someone will hold him responsible for his crimes or misconduct. This is a person so delusional and entitled that he likens himself to Nelson Mandela, MLK, Abraham Lincoln, Jesus Christ ffs! A person who has spent his entire life gaming the justice system while desperately avoiding incrimination. Yet, he takes pleasure in knowing that he's just a couple of months away from having the power to go on an all out vengeance spree.Trump has been the most divisive political figure in recent memory, and not only did he play a primary role in facilitating January 6th, but his lies, his dangerous anti-democratic rhetoric, his constant fearmongering and his emotional tirades on Truth Social have solidified a movement of deranged fanatics willing to go to any length to protect *their* country from all of the big bad boogeymen that Trump and his allies incessantly warn us about.Trump has always appealed to the worst impulses of his supporters, their hate, their fears, their victimhood, their phobias and paranoid delusions. He is a beacon for white supremacist and violent, far right extremist groups.There are countless remarks to choose from, many of them unconstitutional, that Trump has made against his opponents, whether on the ticket, in the media, or all around us. Enemies who are constantly scheming to undermine him, rig elections or assassinate him, plotting to weaponize every system of justice against him, to spread \\"fake news,\\" to relentlessly persecute him and his followers.He has convinced millions of his supporters that violence is a first and last resort against a radical leftist monolith and monster of his own making.Laurence W. Britt published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, which included a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascist. This list has become widely shared and circulated:- \\"Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism\\"\\n- \\"Disdain for the importance of human rights\\"\\n- \\"Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause\\"\\n- \\"The supremacy of the military/avid militarism\\"\\n- \\"Rampant sexism\\"\\n- \\"A controlled mass media\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with national security\\"\\n- \\"Religion and ruling elite tied together\\"\\n- \\"Power of corporations protected\\"\\n- \\"Power of labor suppressed or eliminated\\"\\n- \\"Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with crime and punishment\\"\\n- \\"Rampant cronyism and corruption\\"\\n- \\"Fraudulent elections\\"I dunno about you, but I found that Trumpism covers almost all the bases here.One problem that exists however, is that the term itself has kind of lost some of its meaning recently. As a result, Trump supporters will simply roll their eyes whenever they hear the accusation, while simultaneously being on board with many of the... pre requisites mentioned aboveOne thing they'll argue is, \\"how come Trump wasn't a fascist during his first term huh!? Checkmate libs!\\"But he tried, and your memory-holing of his presidency, of his efforts to overturn the election, his promotion of election denying misinformation, of his incendiary and xenophobic rhetoric, of his authoritarian whims, his many attempts to obstruct justice, his unconstitutional provocations, his appeal to white supremacist groups, his incitement of violence against marginalized people, and his overtly bigoted, ultra nationalistic, nativist, highly divisive, insular and intolerant language doesn't change that.Not only that, but during Trump's last presidency, he had people around him, people who acted as guardrails against his worst impulses and instincts, and this time around, Trump has and will surround himself with capitulating loyalists who won't act as checks against his autocratic and fascist whims, instead, they'll be there to enable him, embolden him, use him.While at the same time, according to some of Trump's sycophants, we are not supposed to take this stuff seriously, Trump just \\"exaggerates\\" sometimes, admitting of course, that Donald Trump isn't a serious candidate.Trump's absurdity magically renders him benign? Is that what you're saying? We're just supposed to look the other way, and not take him at his word? All his recent threats and his dangerous, anti-democratic proposals are just jokes?Some of his followers will literally tell us that he doesn't actually mean what he says... That we shouldn't listen to the things he's saying, or he's really just saying something else entirely, which is a load of BS.These people will continue to rationalize and defend him to no end. Minimizing and downplaying his threats and rhetoric, but when he becomes president, these same people will show us that they were behind him all along.","title":"Trump isnt hiding plan to use military to quash protests and deport immigrants"},{"text":"4 years? 12 if you consider Vance will likely become President by fair vote or by cheating. 100 if you consider a 6/9 Trump SCOTUS destroying all human rights it possibly can, as soon as it can.","title":"Lost in Translation: Swing Voters Misperceptions of Harris And Late Turn To Trump"},{"text":"The Mises Institute paleo/ancap crowd used to be mostly absent in the LP in the late 2000s and early 2010s because they had more influence in the GOP e.g. Ron Paul.In the early 2000s the paleo/ancap vs classical liberal (Hayekian) divide didn't matter that much because the main issue energizing the libertarian movement was opposition to Iraq war. Where the two camps were unfied. Although it was mostly still the classical liberal camp in control. Going further back who was the dominant camp traded off.Around 2017 or so the Mises Institute decided they wanted to take over the LP. They created the Mises cacus and the associated PAC. In 2021 (I believe) the Mises cacus was successful in taking over all of the national leadership positions. No one really knew what their end game was they took over. but it seems like it's been a mix of endorsing populist Republicans and running thier own paleolibertain candidates. The Mises caucus did try to nominate thier own LP candidate at the convention who lost. Although some of their members nominated Trump. And the NH LP (the most Mises aligned state party) organized their members to vote for Trump in the general. So it's reasonable to think many of Mises cacus members voted for Trump.The classical liberal camp still exist in the party and definitely don't support Trump. They still control some state parites and have limited control in the federal party. The Koch brothers have mostly tried to influence the GOP in a more libertarian direction in recent years rather then being active the LP.

It was a campaign of domestic terrorism and fear based control. Something started in 2000, or maybe the decade before that. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dark_WinterQuote from UNZ:**The handful of anthrax letters had only killed five Americans and sickened 17 more, a tiny sliver of the 9/11 casualties, and the last envelope sent had been postmarked on October 17, 2001.** But I think the impact upon American public opinion during the year or two that followed was fully comparable to that of the massive physical attacks we had suffered a few weeks earlier, or perhaps even greater. **For all the death and destruction inflicted on 9/11, without the subsequent anthrax mailings, the Patriot Act would never have passed Congress in anything like its final form, while President Bush might not have gained sufficient public support to launch his disastrous Iraq War.**The anthrax mailings were almost totally forgotten within just a few years and today my suggestion that their impact had matched or even exceeded that of the 9/11 Attacks themselves might seem utterly preposterous to most Americans, but when I recently reviewed the articles of that period, I discovered that I had hardly been alone in that appraisal.Renowned investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald was just beginning his career, joining Salon in 2007. He soon began publishing a number of columns on the anthrax case, with one of the first including this paragraph near the beginning:The 2001 anthrax attacks remain one of the great mysteries of the post-9/11 era. After 9/11 itself, the anthrax attacks were probably the most consequential event of the Bush presidency. One could make a persuasive case that they were actually more consequential. The 9/11 attacks were obviously traumatic for the country, but in the absence of the anthrax attacks, 9/11 could easily have been perceived as a single, isolated event. It was really the anthrax letters  with the first one sent on September 18, just one week after 9/11  that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after. It was anthrax  sent directly into the heart of the countrys elite political and media institutions, to then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt), NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and other leading media outlets  that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by Islamic radicalism...There were also some very direct consequences [of the anthrax attacks]. American government support for biodefense had been strong under Clinton, then sharply reduced once Bush came into office. **But those few deadly envelopes changed everything, and during the years 2002-2011, our government spent an estimated $70 billion on biowarfare and biodefense, vastly more than ever before. These days our total biowarfare outlays have far surpassed the hundred billion dollar mark, but almost all of that gusher of funding was triggered by a handful of envelopes bearing $0.23 stamps.** During September 2001, a biological defense contractor named BioPort was on the verge of collapse and bankruptcy, but **once the mailings reached the headlines, the company was saved by a flood of anthrax-vaccine government contracts; later renamed Emergent BioSolutions, it played a controversial role in the production of our Covid vaccines nearly twenty years later.**","title":"9/11 Truth at an Inflection Point?"},{"text":" When the Democrats come back to the core issues that are their strength, and move on from the woke bullshit, I will vote for them again.Don't hold your breath.","title":"I hate Trump, but Im glad he won"},{"text":"I'm not offended, I just think it's objectively stupid and 95% of people picking the bear are being intentionally obnoxious.","title":"We Asked Young Men Why They Voted for Donald TrumpHeres What They Said"},{"text":"I hear they need aid workers in Gaza - since they had the enormous strength and resolve to cast an idiotic vote for trump surely helping their brethern on the ground should be a no- brainer.","title":"Muslims who voted for Trump upset by his pro-Israel cabinet picks"},{"text":"Why the fuck would they think hed take a balanced approach considering hes loudly and consistently attacked Muslims","title":"Muslims who voted for Trump upset by his pro-Israel cabinet picks"},{"text":"I get that.

But in this years election, the county voted for Trump.Nassau Countys diverse population of 1.4 million  larger than Dallas  makes it a microcosm of political changes in suburbs and urban neighborhoods in and around New York City and across the US. Manhasset swung about 14 percentage points to Trump this year, about the same as the county as a whole, based on an analysis by election data expert Ben Rosenblatt.Nationally and in Nassau, voters cited a litany of issues  starting with the economy, immigration and public safety  to explain their shifts to the right. Their reasons can be as varied as the distinct identities of the countys more than 100 towns, villages and hamlets.[Read more here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-11-15/donald-trump-voting-results-nassau-county-win-shows-democrats-us-struggles?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMTcwOTQzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzMyMzE0MjM4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTVpUR0lEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFOURENjUxQUFBN0Q0MEFFQUU2QzRGMTY2Q0JCRkJFNCJ9.PowLsTSbNi3qAaB0k4PLCLPv2tL0Bqgm8u4xtsBj2iY)","title":"This Wall Street Suburb Voted Republican for the First Time in 36 Years"},{"text":"I agree.

So from this perspective, elevating Jesus to divine status mirrors the very deception attributed to Satan: offering a false god to lead people astray right?So if Christ represents a break from Judaism's truth, then in the Jewish view, Christianity itself embodies an \\"Anti-Jewish\\" theology. By extension, the promise of an Anti-Christ is merely a continuation of this deviation... a more evolved illusion...

Ukraine is about to be abandoned, and the Baltic countries are at risk, as are Moldova and a few others.  They were in the Soviet Sphere, and so their presence in the EU sphere does not have the full commitment of the USA.    When the war in Ukraine ends soon - as Trump will condemn @ 20%+ of Ukraine to Russian slavery, that will leave the Russian army in the field with a full war-footing, which is a dangerous thing.There is also a chance that China will perceive Trump as weak, and they will attack and occupy Taiwan   We are already uncoupling from the Chinese economy at an increasing rate, for various reasons.

The goal is to deny everything until they can get the resources lined up to accomplish the task.","title":"Stock Market Tanks as Trump Unveils Nightmare Cabinet Picks"},{"text":"As someone else already pointed out, the title is clickbaity and the article doesn't really live up to it, but some of the comments in the article really illustrate why Democrats will always have to beg and plead for every last vote.   \\n  \\n  You cant claim to represent the values of your base and then ignore them. Youre not going to winand thats exactly what happened.  \\n  \\nDemocrats *don't have a base.*  This is a big tent party.  Republicans have a base, and their base wants people like the ones living in Dearborn dead.  Democrats have potentially everyone who isn't a Republican, but that's a huge gamut of different groups of people, many of which are at severe odds with each other.  So when this woman says \\"you can't ignore your base and expect to win,\\" I feel like she thinks she's the base and they should form their entire platform around what she thinks is right.    \\n  \\nSorry, no offense, but Muslims in Dearborn Michigan are a tiny minority of the potential Democratic voting bloc.  There are several other groups, groups without which Democrats CANNOT win, who want to see Israel continue to receive support and consider Hamas a terrorist threat that needs to be eliminated.  If the party leaned fully into the foreign policy this woman is calling for, I don't think you can argue that would result in a net gain of votes.    \\n  \\nThis is just a microcosm of the larger scope of the party's total platform across all issues, and what we have gotten ourselves into is a situation where the Democratic party, essentially a coalition party, has seen such a deep divide form between its center and left partitions that it is now effectively impossible to earn votes from one group without losing votes from the other.  This rift will be difficult to heal as each side becomes less open to compromise and more strictly attached to their issue of choice.  So you get people refusing to budge on things like immigration, Palestine, or student loans and while they don't vote Republican, they do the next best thing which is vote third party or stay home.    \\n  \\nThis is horrifyingly similar to Germany in the 1930s.  We are literally repeating those mistakes as if we're following a set of instructions.  Hitler came to power in Germany not because a majority of Germans elected him, but because the centrist and socialist Germans became largely convinced that they were each other's greatest enemies and became stubbornly opposed to any form of compromise with each other whatsoever.  Ultimately each group's voters decided in numbers big enough to matter that the other side would do well to learn a lesson from letting the fascists run things for a while.  See how that feels then come back to the table when you're ready to start giving in to our demands (both sides of the opposition were guilty of this).  \\n  \\nNobody was remotely prepared for the actual weight of that lesson.  A decade of death and destruction on a scale difficult to comprehend and not seen before or since followed, after which Germans would spend 40 years without their own country, residents of two proxy states separated by a figurative and literal wall, families torn apart for decades, young men dead of old age before seeing their home restored.  The people who had thought that was a lesson worth teaching died before the lesson ended, either violently or after a long slow limbo of international shame.  \\n  \\nBut good news.  They didn't have nukes when they elected fascism, nor did they have to deal with imminent climate change.  So we likely won't meet the same fate they did.  Our hell is far different, far darker, and far harder to escape from.","title":"Muslim Voters In Michigan Are Starting To Regret Their Choice After Trump Win: Trump Is Playing Us'"},{"text":"The handyman is part of the corporate planned obsolesence trend.

The standard of \\"objective\\" journalism were developed during an era of print media where newspapers had classified ads, subscriber revenue, and ad revenue to keep afloat. When coverage caused a company to pull its ads, newspapers could sustain themselves using the other two for a time until they could make up the shortfall. Early tv newsmen came from the print industry and nightly news was funded as a loss leader by the networks. Get people onto your channel and they will keep watching it, etc.Well, the internet killed classified ad revenue and replaced it with Craigslist, indeed, etc. Then people stopped paying for news because there were copious free sources out there. So the only thing left are ads, and advertisers demand eyeballs - so you get race to the bottom clickbait trash. And all those legacy sources of news kept failing and failing. So what we have now is not bias towards the right or left, what we have is bias towards sensational bullshit over meaningful analysis.

It will take more than a theoretical common ground and vague ideas of class.

In many cases it would seem that the doctors are grappling with saving the child and the mother but lose them both. However, the question is, would they have gotten the D &amp; C sooner in a state without the ban. Really, what those articles need to include, in order to prove that the women died from the abortion ban, is the doctors that worked on the pregnant, deceased woman need to be quoted or admitting that, \\"She died because we could not offer life-saving support due to the abortion ban.\\" A few articles quote other doctors from other hospitals saying,that they feel delayed with life-saving support due to ban but never a doctor who worked on the stated case. In these articles it is also stated that the mothers wanted the baby, so why would the doctors do a D &amp; C with a heartbeat?  \\nI don't know. It is a tough call. However, I am a proponent of putting this in the states because it gives the power to the people vs the federal gov with MALE politicians, Male president, MALE bureaucrats....I think the transition time that we are currently in is difficult, though, eventually the people will have the states laws as they want it.","title":"Abortion isnt your right to bodily autonomy"},{"text":"What does he do?

They also offset a labor shortage, putting a damper on inflation. With the next administration vowing to seal the border and carry out the largest deportation program in American history, those economic forces could reverse  depending on the degree to which Mr. Trump can fulfill those promises. Mr. Trumps newly appointed border czar, Tom Homan, has said that the administration would start with the immigrants who have committed crimes. There are not nearly enough of those to amount to removals on a mass scale, however, and Vice President-elect JD Vance has also said that all 11 million undocumented immigrants should prepare to leave. If you are in this country illegally in six months, pack your bags, because youre going home, Mr. Vance said in September. The numbers could rise by another 2.7 million if the new administration revokes several types of temporary humanitarian protection, as the Trump adviser Stephen Miller previewed last year. On top of that, millions of undocumented residents live with U.S.-born children or green card holders who could end up leaving the country as well.","title":"Trumps Immigration Plans Could Bring an Economic Toll"},{"text":"\\"Might\\" being the operative word.  ??","title":"Gaetz Nomination Seen as Doomed by Some Senate Republicans, More Than 30 Republican Senators Might Vote No"},{"text":"No such thing as an underage prostitute.

The document also offers an unprecedented look into the events leading up to that fateful day.While some of these details have been explored in the media, many of our readers will find value in examining these firsthand insights..CNN also reported that two months before 9/11, Youssef alerted the FBI about a \\"walk in\\" entering the Bureaus field office and purporting to have significant information about bin Laden. Although initially asked to talk to this individual, the FBI counterterrorism unit later ordered against using Youssefs services, likely due to a decision from top leadership.**In all of this story, it remains unclear who the good guys and bad guys are.** One thing is certain - the words of the former top-tier FBI employee Ted L. Gundersons about the involvement of the U.S. government in the 9/11 attacks take on a new meaning.","title":"9/11 Truth at an Inflection Point?"},{"text":"I think Gaetz will be as good of an AG as the situation we are in.

However, overall US earnings inequality has plateaued in the last decade. This is due to particularly fast earnings growth among low-wage workers rather than median-wage workers catching up with those at the top. Key drivers of secular rising inequality have continued. However, these have been offset by rapid, although unsecured, earnings growth at the bottom of the labor market.AbstractUS earnings inequality has not increased in the last decade. This marks the first sustained reversal of rising earnings inequality since 1980. We document this shift across eight data sources using worker surveys, employer-reported data, and administrative data. The reversal is due to a shrinking gap between low-wage and median-wage workers. In contrast, the gap between top and median workers has persisted. Rising pay for low-wage workers is not mainly due to the changing composition of workers or jobs, minimum wage increases, or workplace-specific sources of inequality. Instead, it is due to broadly rising pay in low-wage occupations, which has particularly benefited workers in tightening labor markets. Rebounding postCGreat Recession labor demand at the bottom offset enduring drivers of inequality.","title":"Biden leaves Trump a booming economy, with almost no unemployment and inflation under control"},{"text":"Palmer's Hog 2028","title":"Muslims who voted for Trump upset by his pro-Israel cabinet picks"},{"text":"\\\\about AOC being considered to be propped up for 2028.AOC vs Vance and Tulsi?

Excerpt: President-elect Donald J. Trump was flying to Washington for his first face-to-face meeting with President Biden since winning the election when a top aide offered a startling idea to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. The adviser, Boris Epshteyn, who coordinated the legal defenses in Mr. Trumps criminal cases, suggested to the president-elect that he should be Mr. Trumps special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to four people briefed on what took place. Mr. Epshteyn, who was born in Russia and lived there as a child, has no experience in foreign policy. He told the group that he had family on both sides of the conflict. Several people on the plane appeared shocked at the idea of appointing Mr. Epshteyn to a sensitive diplomatic post, according to the people briefed on the matter. In addition to his lack of diplomatic experience, he is currently under indictment in Arizona along with several other Trump allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election with so-called fake electors. (A fifth person with knowledge of the events insisted people on the plane reacted well to the idea and suggested thoughts on how to structure such a move.)","title":"The Trump Lawyer Who Wields Outsize Influence on the Next White House"},{"text":"There aren't enough surprised Pikachu jpegs in the entire world for all of the Trump voter FAFOing going around.","title":"Muslims who voted for Trump upset by his pro-Israel cabinet picks"},{"text":"The report from Gaza was that they're happy Trump won because they'd rather have someone honest about letting  Israel do anything it wants rather than a government lying about pushing for a ceasefire and also letting Israel do whatever it wants.","title":"Trumps Pick to Lead U.S. Military Has Tattoos Linked to White Supremacists and Nazis | Democracy Now!"},{"text":"Good promises, but the proof is in the pudding not the rhetoric as the dems are perhaps learning","title":"Left-Wing Donors Wary As They Fear Funding Won't Buy the 'Resistance' It Used to in a New Era of Trump"},{"text":"No job, no oversight - but a private citizen can't negotiate with foreign powers on behalf of the United States (historically).He's gonna take in all kinds of $$$$ at the cost of OUR sovereignty.","title":"Jared Kushner expected to be pivotal to Trump admins Middle East efforts without taking a formal job"},{"text":"Remember that time Alex Jones got caught having an open tab of trans women porn on his phone?

Because he couldn't, Congress wasn't interested and congress didn't need to be interested in what the president cares about. --Trump needs to come into the office, and that takes time.

They can be gamed more than polls. As inequality grows, rich people can simply place large bets on their candidate that shifts the market. Take Musk for example, he could easily put his thumb on the scale of these markets if he wanted and it would be worth it. His net worth has gone up like $30-40B since the election. The whale in this story bet $14m. That's like the change in his couch and if gaming polymarket had the potential to influence turnout, it's a no brainer.The second issue is that Trump is a unique candidate in the sense that people are actually embarrassed to admit they are voting for him to pollsters. The whale in the story was very smart in what they did as demonstrated by this paragraph:More important, Tho did his own research. Rather than rely on polls, he theorized that there was a strong shy Trumper effect. That is, he believed that Trump supporters were both less likely to talk to pollsters and less likely to tell pollsters that they would vote for the former president. As he told The Wall Street Journal in an email, he commissioned his own surveys in which respondents were asked who they thought their neighbors would vote for. The results were mind blowing to the favor of Trump!I think this was smart, but since a bettors methodology isn't going to be published like a polls, it's really hard to understand why someone is placing a bet. Also, since every race is somewhat different, there's no real way to determine some better isn't just acting crazy. What would have happened if that better was just some random rich person on tilt for Trump.I do think these prediction markets will have value going forward for some things, but polling has been pretty accurate in every election aside from the ones Trump has been in. Go look at polling during midterms versus when Trump is running. My guess though, is that people won't be reasonable and will just throw the baby out with the bathwater.  That being said, Theo did reveal something that pollster should probably try to use and incorporate into their polling methodologies.","title":"How the Trump Whale and Prediction Markets Beat the Pollsters in 2024"},{"text":"FFS.

But that could also just be normalcy bias.Let's not forget that there are countless instances around the world and throughout history, including our own country, where the minority party does this and they aren't just larping.So long as they continue to recognize the statutory power of the executive branch and act within the bounds of the law (e.g. continue to recognize the legitimate and lawful authority of Trump) this is just an exercise in virtue signalling and won't be anything more than a minor annoyance.But, again, let's not discount the possibility, however small, that they will refuse to recognize the legitimate statutory power of an executive branch headed up by Trump... In which case this becomes something far more worrisome and impactful.Because again, there is a precedent in our own short history as a nation of Democrats forming their own government that does not recognize the statutory power of an executive branch headed up by a president they did not recognize as legitimate.To put it more succinctly; we shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking open rebellion is impossible because it's illegal because anyone openly rebelling de facto does not recognize the lawful authority of whoever they're rebelling against.If the left actually does this, it should be a major warning because on the scale of refusing to recognize the legitimate and lawful authority of the president it is a much bigger step to go from no shadow government to having one than it is to go from having a shadow government to open rebellion.The first step is the biggest, but the second step is much smaller.

Undeniably. What's debated is whether or not it's a?*person.*?That it is alive and human is beyond doubt.  I just don't like when people agree with me and have poor reasoning or make bad faith arguments. It so very clearly is a losing proposition when it comes to rhetoric and influence. I think I explained pretty clearly why an embryo is not a human. Humans don't get absorbed into other people's bodies. When it comes to fetuses the same is mostly true until about the 25th month. I think reasonable viability is a fine standard assign personhood but am still not for giving fetuses full rights. I am happy with abortions rights as they were before the Dobbs ruling and think that abortion should be unrestricted with the support of a physician for the sake of the mother or for the sake of not having to do surgery or induce birth because of a non-viable fetus. It's pointless and cruel and kills women.What are the criteria for personhood?*beyond*?being a human that qualifies one for personhood, and thus protection from being killed?Like I said, we can start by saying that humans don't get absorbed into another persons organs and disappear and they don't randomly split into two different bodies. If a fetus is a person, identical twins are one person. They aren't because a fetus is not a person. It's a group of human tissue that can split like dna in any other organism. What is it, sapience? So sleeping people and coma patients are on the chopping blockThis is not that complex of an issue unless you are a religious zealot. People who are brain dead and on life support are generally accepted to be permanently gone and most people believe it is okay to end life support. That is to say, that under some circumstances, we are okay with nature taking course and allowing people to die a natural deaths. Except for religious zealots.

But one thing that stuck out to me was a brief article in a legal trade the week before the election. It compiled information about donations to the Harris and Trump campaigns by lawyers and staff of the biggest law firms to see where they were contributing money. The greatest amount of donations to Trump came from the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, followed by Jones Day, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Gibson Dunn, and King &amp; Spalding. No great shock there.But what was remarkable is that at each of those firms, the amounts donated to Harris were way, way higher. At Kirkland, the donations to Harris were more than 8 times greater; Jones Day, 4 times; at S&amp;C, 10 times, at GD, 15 times, and at K&amp;S, 9 times.I chalk that up to a couple of things. First, that we have an understanding of and vested interest in keeping institutions viable. And second, that we have the ability to keep more than one thought in our head at the same time. Of course many people outside of law have that same second ability. But many, many people don't and just decide based on impulse or a singular shiny idea that grabs their attention.","title":"Stock Market Tanks as Trump Unveils Nightmare Cabinet Picks"},{"text":"Very nice, indeed.","title":"Pence Urges Republican Senators Not to Confirm R.F.K.
