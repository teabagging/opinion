According to the report, Gaetz regularly paid women for sex, engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old, used illegal drugs including cocaine and ecstasy, violated House gift rules regarding a 2018 Bahamas trip, misused official resources, and attempted to obstruct the Committees investigation. The Committee determined that these actions violated House rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct.The Committees investigation included reviews of nearly 14,000 documents and interviews with over two dozen witnesses. Multiple women testified that they received payments from Gaetz for sexual activity, with the report detailing tens of thousands of dollars in payments made through various methods. While some women characterized their relationships with Gaetz differently, most confirmed they were paid for sex. The Committee found evidence that Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl at a July 2017 party, though it did not find sufficient evidence to conclude he violated federal sex trafficking laws.The report includes dissenting views from Committee Chairman Michael Guest and other members who opposed its release, arguing the Committee lost jurisdiction when Gaetz resigned from Congress in November 2024. While these members did not challenge the findings themselves, they objected to publishing a report about a former member, calling it a departure from standard practice that could have potentially catastrophic consequences. The report notes that Gaetz was largely uncooperative during the investigation, refused to be interviewed, failed to comply with a subpoena, and attempted to obstruct the Committees work through delays and misleading statements.","title":"Matt Gaetz Goes Off on Ethics Report in Emotional Tweetstorm: 'Giving Funds to Someone You're Dating Is Now Prostitution?!?'"},{"text":"The same MAGA relatives who laugh and say \\"Oh, I wish Trump would grab me by MY pussy!\\"We already know what they'd say. \\"You liberals are just jealous, because Matt Gaetz would never want your ugly daughters!

This is a status quo that is excessively right-wing compared to much of the rest of the developed world, dominated by corporate interests and anti-government ideologues (governemnt can never do anything right, all regulatiojs are evil, and similar themes).They largely talk about minor tweaks that wouldn't really make any major changes to wealth distribution, and their focus on raising revenue from the rich to fund programs misses the point of monetary policy which allows them to use the same 'quantitative easing' that propped up the financial markets to fund those same bottom-up programs. See Keynesian economics which isn't thay controversial in the rest of the world. Finally, their written platform rarely aligns with their voting record when they actually have power, so it's a bit of a red herring to focus on it rather than their actual legislative record, which is dominated by the same pork-barrel politics they accuse the Republicans of. They have a tendency to slow walk all those progressive policies that they campaign on once they get into power and stop listening to voters and start listening to donors. They blame a few of their party for being more rightwing and needing to appease them, but they continue to caucus with those people.A few specific points:Making the cutoff for 'working families' be 400k is high. Their focus on collecting unpaid taxes from corporations misses the more impactful need for anti-trust enforcement to break up business cartels and anti-consumer practices. See the EU's approach as a counterpoint.The ACA was a state Republican idea and essentially amounts to an insurance industry subsidy rather than a true public, single-payer option.The focus on rental assistance and general assistance is still a market-based approach that relies on private developers and the private sector generally to increase housing supply affordably rather than just finding a way to extract that rent for the same limited, run-down supply or otherwise collude to fix prices higher.

But from everything Ive seen on social media the save the children crowd are actually only concerned with child sex trafficking that doesnt really exist - ie Sound of Freedom stories and QAnon conspiracies like liberal elites and celebrities drinking adrenchrome harvested from babies, but also being pedos - like pizzagate. They picture 3-5 year old white children kidnapped in broad daylight in the suburbs and carted off in shipping containers. Or even the immigrant children that disappeared under Biden, despite them having sponsors because they missed voluntary check ins - again these people think there are robust networks and bidding of children being trafficked across the border; when in reality most human trafficking across borders involves unpaid or slave labor (sweatshops, child labor, farming, etc). The reality of child sex trafficking is the Gaetz story, or teen runaways from abusive homes or kicked out of their Christian homes for being LGBTQ. Its a boyfriend or girlfriend convincing them to do sex work. Its a local groomer preying on the most vulnerable teens. But the save the children crowd doesnt want to acknowledge this at all. Its easier to believe Taken or Sound of Freedom are real biopics instead of Hollywood stories - because yes! no one would ever support these things. Its easy to be against the most appalling and vile acts out there against the most innocent but they look at the real teens in these real situations and think theyre just troublemakers who made bad decisions. God we need better issues education and reporting in this country. Oh they also arent all up in arms because the reality of most pedos and sex offenders is that theyre usually family members or acquaintances who know how to hide and blend. Uncle John cant be a predator, hes such a nice old man kind of bullshit. TL;DR its easier to be against the most heinous crimes and criminals that rarely if ever occur. Its easy to hate monsters, especially if they dont really exist. Its harder for people to be against the banality of evil that actually exists in the world and every day - AND some people get overwhelmed by that fact and just tune out.

Favorite sons, such as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, were groomed, financed, and supported.In 2016, the CNP put its partners money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep himand themselvesin power.Over the final year of the Trump presidency, the CNP took center stage. By January 2020, its leading figures had become sought-after guests on talk shows and frequent visitors to the White House. Many of its stated goals had been advanced. By March, the Republican Senate had confirmed more than 185 of Trumps conservative nominees for the federal bench. All but eight of the judges had ties to the Federalist Society, headed by longtime CNP members Eugene Meyer and Leonard Leo. Two of the CNPs favored Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had been confirmed.Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the Trump brand. In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.Ultimate realization of the CNPs agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November.

It feels like he's lining up a grifty rightward heel turn or at least spend the next 4 years being the enlightened centrist dickhead. With that said, there is a point here. There are times that Trump will say something asinine about something that doesn't really matter and, yes, I will get frustrated by MSNBC spending a whole segment going on about it. There are lots of cases where neither mockery nor pearl clutching is the best response to Trump's off-hand remarks. He's both an inveterate bullshitter and an attention whore. In fact, a lot of his lies and exaggeration are done solely to stay in the headlines and I cringe when Democratic lawmakers or media personalities line up to give hot takes pointing out, in effect, that the pig is rolling in mud again. Why is taking Trump's bait dangerous? Three things off the top of my head:* It distracts from things he or his team will do that will have real impact and do harm. Every time he uses overblown but figurative language like \\"it will be a bloodbath\\" when talking about a segment of the economy, and commentators run with this as a call to violence, it numbs the populace to where the real harm will come from. Yes, the very online, politically aware among us can parse this out but for most of this country, all they know is he talks in extremes don't care to weigh each statement for intent. The noise is meant to distract from the signal.\\n* It bolsters his claim to the MAGA base that his detractors are just haters and just have a kneejerk opposition to anything he says. Fact-checking obvious nonsense doesn't help clear the air- it just turns most voters off from the conversation and they leave thinking he can't get a fair assessment (even if the assessment is fair).\\n* It keeps him centered in the conversation and often, on his terms- even if criticizing him. He loses support not when he's shown to be a liar but when he's shown to be impotent or irrelevant. Being the president again definitely hurts the case for him being irrelevant but I think a good example of an appropriate attack is questioning if all this \\"support\\" from Elon Musk is because Trump can't manage his team.","title":"John Fetterman says Democrats need to stop 'freaking out' over everything Trump does"},{"text":"Are you OK with US Representatives paying minors for sex, knowingly or otherwise?","title":"Matt Gaetz poses for a picture with several Venmo accounts."},{"text":"And that's why I will never feel bad about sailing the high seas.

But its not clear to me what the Harris campaign and the DNC should have done differently. Whether its going on Rogan, being more unequivocal in her support for Israel (or more critical), running ads expressing support for banning trans female athletes and restrictions on transition care for teenagers, being more populist (or more business-friendly), etc. theres always a plausible counterargument. In the end, the Harris campaign [walked back](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-now-backing-away-several-far-left-stances-she-once-promoted) her positions (or at least lip service) during the primary in 2019, and campaigned tough on the border and [in vibes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4yxe2xxzdo).It wasnt enough, of course, although it surely helped keep the House as historically close as it was and for Democratic candidates to win five of the six statewide races in the battleground states, as they either werent incumbents or didnt seem to be hurt like the presidential incumbent was.My assertion: if Democratic candidates across the country run like this again in 2026, and the nominee in 2028 does as well, well take back the presidency and the House.

There is (and has always been) left-leaning critique of illegal immigration, plainly because initially immigrants and \\"the poor\\"  both compete for state assisted housing and also for similar jobs, depressing wages. \\\\[But we could always quibble if and to which degree this critique is appropriate today.\\\\]Usually, right-leaning critique of immigration is - different. There is a lot of xenophobic and plainly racist attacks against immigrants from the right (often with little regard if they're actually illegal immigrants or legal ones). Broad attacks against \\"brown\\" people, any woman wearing a hijab, or pretending all illegal immigrants are criminals (see how convenient it is that illegal entry is a crime? Now every illegal immigrant is a criminal!). And let's be honest here - you yourself list far-right parties surging in popularity because of their (disgusting) anti-immigrant positions. Let's not pretend in this current political climate being anti-immigration is some kind of left-leaning position.The democratic policy plan really does fail to explain \\\\_why\\\\_ they think  \\n  \\n\\\\\`\\\\\`\\\\\`  \\nWhen the system is overwhelmed, the President should have emergency authority to expel migrants who are crossing unlawfully and stop processing asylum claims except for those using a safe and orderly process at Ports of Entry  \\n\\\\\`\\\\\`\\\\\`but that wouldn't fly in the current time SPD. Since I haven't heard a single sentence from the Democrats that would indicate their concern how to humanly house immigrants without compromising other social safety net housing, I would put consider this a right-wing concession (of some sort) that 100% wouldn't be a center-left position in Germany.Your timeline also shows what I also wanted to stress: That positions change between elections, sometimes because you archived what you wanted to archive and aim for new targets, and sometimes because you've given up and declared something to be a losing policy position.Now, is the 2024 Democratic party to the right on immigration compared to the 2015 CDU Germany government? Certainly. I would also argue that the 2020 Democratic party discussing to decriminalize (and make it a civil offense) illegal border crossings is still to the right of the 2015 CDU position. And the Democrats failure in 2011 under Obama to get all of their senators to support the DREAM Act \\\\[who are only in the US illegally by no fault of their own\\\\] would also be to the right to any reasonable party in Europe at that time. At that time, I only recall the Lega Nord openly advocating for immigration policies that could force adults who grew up in Italy to leave Italy because they technically entered Italy illegally when they were extremely young - to the point where they probably don't speak the language (or even know much of) the country they officially \\"belong to\\".","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"So we going to war with Greenland then?","title":"Trump: U.S. Ownership of Greenland Absolute Necessity for National Security, Freedom"},{"text":"Okay, I am European, so I dont understand this completely.

He had, in the past few years, become a MAGA folk hero for his commitment to posture and provocationas well as a trusted confidant of Trump. He was able to exact revenge over his arch-nemesis, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. More than anything, though, Gaetz seemed relieved: Hed been released from a set of ruinous claims after the Justice Department, which had been investigating sex-crimes allegations against him, dropped its probe in 2023, reportedly because of witness-credibility problems.Already personally rich, Gaetz has only ever wanted one thing: relevance. And his path forward seemed obvious to anyone whod ever known him. At the end of 2025, he would run for governor of his home stateand, given his relationship with Trump, he seemed likely to win the GOP primary. Serving two years at the helm of Trumps Justice Department could help Gaetz in that quest; even if his nomination were to be blocked, he could campaign as a victim of the deep state and the GOP establishment.Yet all of Gaetzs planning fell apart. After initially voting not to release the report, the ethics panel took a second, secret vote earlier this month in which all five Democrats on the panel, plus two of its Republicans, chose to make their findings public After standing down from consideration as attorney general, Gaetz was being wooed by Newsmax, a TV network owned by the Trump ally Christopher Ruddy, where Gaetz has previously guest-hosted. But with the unreleased ethics report still hanging over his head, Gaetz instead accepted a role anchoring a show on OANN, a significantly smaller and less influential network  Schorsch said. Some observers I spoke with expect Gaetz to relocate to San Diego, where OAN is based, which is nearly 3,000 miles from the Trump White Housefar enough that it might as well be Mars Trump has not seemed eager to jump to Gaetzs defense. After Gaetz withdrew from the AG race, the president-elect posted on Truth Social the kind of message you might read in your high-school yearbook from a loose acquaintance: Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!In two years time, Gaetz might still run for Florida governor. But his chances of success have dwindled, allegation by toxic allegation  Gaetzs implosion has probably made it easier for Trump and his allies to begin consolidating their support behind a candidate in a crowded field Gaetzs superpower has always been his ability to find the spotlight and stay stubbornly in it. Yet he will have a hard time accepting his ouster from the white-hot center of MAGA world during a new Trump administration and adjust to a new perch far outside the perimeter. At OAN, Gaetz could engineer a way to make himself relevant once againtransforming himself into a media personality with influence and reach. But for now at least, Gaetzs winning streak is over.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/XQlGXYMd](https://theatln.tc/XQlGXYMd)","title":"Not the Life Matt Gaetz Was Planning On"},{"text":"I know right ?!?!?!

It needs to be legalized &amp; decriminalized. Sex work is real work &amp; there are consenting adults who would be willing to partake in that. There also needs to be a system in place that would prevent any exploitation &amp; abuse that these workers can face. The main problem that the oldest profession has always had is that those in power have always abused it. So long as there are safety nets in place, it should be a no brainer. What those specific safety nets are &amp; how to implement them would be the difficult part though. Since the gov't could easily cross the line into literally controlling people's bodies against their will. But the effort to find those solutions would be worth it imo. \\nAnother benefit that I wholeheartedly believe that would come from it would be a significant decrease in the sexual frustration that young men face today. This WOULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM, but it would help imo. Young men believe that losing your virginity is one of those hallmarks that defines who you are &amp; your masculinity. It isn't, but that's not how the majority see it. So once they hit the legal age they'd be able to \\"check off that box\\" in a safe, controlled, &amp; consenting environment. A place void of coercion, manipulation, &amp; threats of violence. Again, this would not solve the problem as that would take massive education reform &amp; making consent/emotional intelligence an integral part of the masculine identity.

Child protection agencies are underfunded. Being in a situation where one needs material help to ensure their childs well being is the criminal act of child neglect.

We pledge our best efforts to deal effectively with both.....Include an educational bill of rights for Spanish-speaking people, American Indians, and others who face special language problems in schools;....In the field of school finance, we favor a coordinated effort among all levels of government to break the pattern of excessive reliance on local property taxes to pay educational costs.  \\netc.and the Environment section:we gave top priority in the Federal Budget to environmental improvements. This fiscal year approximately $2.4 billion will be expended for major environmental programsthree times more than was being spent when President Nixon took office.....We are not going to give up electric lighting and modern industry, but we do expect cleanly-produced electric power to run them.We are not going to be able to do without containers for our foods and materials, but we can improve them and make them reusable or biodegradable.We pledge a workable balance between a growing economy and environmental protection. We will resolve the conflicts sensibly within that framework.etc.Though both the non-isolationist foreign affairs and many other items addressed in the entire platform are quite reminiscent of current Democratic policies while the modern GOP has taken a sharp reactionary turn.

In fact, I think I agree that when it comes to platform and ideals, the American left-wing isn't that far off from much of Europe's. And I think this brings me to my favorite point of your argument, your point on the difference between the parliamentary system and our filibustered-based senate.I think the structure of how our government works makes the Democratic **function** more center-right. It may be left-leaning in theory, but more centrist in practice.This is partly because the Democrats have such a wide branch of coalitions they serve, each of which often has opposing interests. What's more is that norms in Washington which were put in place to uphold a fair system of checks and balances were just that.... norms. And as a result had no real teeth in making sure that fair distribution of power among elected officials happened in a way that accurately represented the electorate. See the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Because it's harder for Democrats to solidify power when their base is not as uniform and easy to tap into as the GOP base, Republicans have been able to better exploit those norms to help lock Democrats out out of institutional power and to use our government's institutional structure to favor a more reactionary political party that seeks to preserve the status-quo.This is where right-leaning Democrats like Manchin and Sinema hold a lot of sway in party leadership because of how fragile the Democratic stronghold on power is that it is easier for center-leaning Democrats to hold left-leaning policy hostage in service of their more purple voting base.So yes, ideas from Democrats can be often very left-leaning, but those ideas don't just come out of nowhere. They emerge from concrete systems and real-life contexts, and while Democrats can talk all they want about passing left-leaning policy, actually getting to turn the keys which will allow that policy to come to fruition and define their party is a different story.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"Conservatives defending him... smh","title":"Matt Gaetz, former Trump AG pick, had sex with underage girl while in Congress, House Ethics report says"},{"text":"Oh look it's the most entitled brat in the known Universe advocating for the invasion and occupation of a another sovereign nation as she thinks it's her birthright.

Stronger union protections than what dems implemented.\\n\\t3.\\tPublic Housing: Dems focus on subsidies and tax incentives for developers and dont support massive public housing programs, like Viennas system where 60% of residents live in public housing.\\n\\t4.\\tClimate Policy: Democrats rely on subsidies and tax credits for green energy, but European center-left parties push for carbon taxes, stricter regulations etc. Harris didnt even pretend to care about the biggest existential threat to humanity.

The two systems couldnt be more different in both how theyre structured and how they function.First off, the German private system exerts serious monopsony power over prices. Were talking drug prices, procedure prices, and everything else across the board. The private insurers in Germany dont get to operate freely like American ones dotheyre heavily regulated with risk-sharing requirements, profit caps, and other interventions that the U.S. doesnt even attempt, not in degree or kind. To act like theyre equivalent is just hand-waving away these crucial differences.And lets be clear: the majority of Germans arent even covered by the private system. Over 70% of Germans are covered by Statutory Health Insurance (SHI), not private insurance. So its not just a minor quirk of their systemits the foundation. Private insurance in Germany is supplemental for most people or only an option for a small subset of higher-income earners and certain professions.On top of that, the German government invests way more in healthcare staffing. They train more doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers per capita than the U.S. does, and it shows. Their staffing levels are way higher, which directly impacts access and quality of care. For example, Germany has around 4.5 physicians per 1,000 people compared to the U.S., where its closer to 2.6. Thats a huge difference.So yeah, saying the German private system is similar to the American one is kind of like saying Mario Party is similar to the Bolshevik Partythey might share a word, but they operate on entirely different principles.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"Dont forget about greenland","title":"Trumps wants Panama Canal back to the US, Responds to Panama Government with          well see about that"},{"text":"If you ever find yourself asking \\"Can people be this stupid?\\", know that the answer is 100% of the time \\"Yes\\".","title":"The FAFO stage is here and Trump voters are about to see that the dildo of consequence rarely arrives lubed."},{"text":"didnt the republicans want death penalty for this kind of thing?","title":"Florida just passed a law making child sexual abuse a death penalty crime.

Their foreign support was nominal at best - closer airbase. Only Turkey was the true power within NATO (outside of USA), but it was mainly due to its imperial ambitions. But it was ok due to politics. It also merged with the global structures like WHO, WTO etc. and became the bureaucratic golem eventually (like EU for example).Trump came into a power due to a fluke basically - even he did not expect to win - and he was not a politician or an ideologue. He was a business with the idea of deals. In that regards his ideas are closer to China, whose goal has always been to feed the country rather than push the global idea (well, historically China has always been like that).

They all planned on turning on eachother to be the one grabbing the power. It's how these types of groups always go because they are all so extreme and hold different views of that extremism, that they literally can't work together. As soon as they start it goes \\"okay so we are going to do this,\\" then it goes \\"but that isn't extreme enough I want this,\\" well no that's too extreme we want this instead,\\" que infighting and rabidity over who's extremist views will be implemented, que the leopards eating faces. They will of course blame the Democrats saying they are simultaneously so unbelievably powerful they can't be beaten and so incompetent they couldn't win if it was given to them, while making absolutely no headway the entire time they are fighting themselves. The whole point of project 2025bwas to engineer that part out of the power structure but it can't be done, because all the goons aren't on the same level of fanatical beliefs as the rest. For some it's not enough for some it's too much. They will continue to infight, and we should support it to be frank. Let them destroy themselves. When they got control over the whole leopard eating faces bit, Hitler was at his height of power. He managed to get control by being the first to eliminate all the others who weren't on board, and scared the others who wanted more or less into submission due to organization. if we don't let them organize, or if the people organized around don't care about said organization, they will never gain any traction and make very little headway.

Everyone knows this.  This situation wasn't deliberately and consciously created, and no one likes it.There are three factors: 1) the tradition and legal infrastructure of capital punishment 2) a lot of people are against capital punishment and either want to get rid of it, or at least try to make it more humane (good luck!), and try to make sure  those sentenced get the maximum legal due process 3) those who like capital punishment just fine or want more of it.  If those in favor of 2) got their way, there'd be no death penalty.  It was like that for a while.  When and where 3) prevails, like....Texas!  They kill them whenever they can.Neither party likes it this way.  (I'm not talking about Republican or Democrat; I mean pro- vs. anti- capital punishment).  One side would like to do away with the death penalty.  The other side would like to do away with most of the legal protections so we could hurry up and kill people.  The illogical situation where hardly anyone gets executed, except in Texas and a few other red states, but quite a few are on death row, is the result of a stalemate.  Also, while there is some desire to kill, and a lot of tradition and structure for it, there is this desire to make it more \\"humane\\"-- traditional methods like hanging are out; lethal injection is in fashion, but the drug companies and the medical profession want no part of it, so a lot of the fighting is about that.There is a death row because people get sentenced to death but then resist the sentence through legal appeals, which can take decades, or executions can't be done because the drugs aren't available, etc..  Whether Trump could or would somehow manage to kill all those prisoners, I have no.idea.  I don't see how he could do anything with an executive order, or even a federal law or a single court decision. What he can do is nominate more right-wing judges who are more friendly to capital punishment, so it gradually gets easier to kill.If Biden actually did all these acts of clemency for the purpose of stopping Trump from killing them, or just to stop executions on moral/ethical grounds, he should have commuted or pardoned all of them.  But then there still would be more coming up in the future.","title":"Biden Clears Out Most of Federal Death Row Before Trump Can Kill Them"},{"text":"He learned from Clinton I guess.

Heres what you might expect:1. Initial Bonding Over Shared TraitsNarcissists might initially connect through mutual admiration or shared ambitions, often seeing each other as allies who \\"get\\" their drive or vision. They may flatter and support each other to build rapport, especially if it serves their individual goals.2. Competition for Attention and RecognitionBoth may vie for the spotlight, leading to frequent power struggles or subtle attempts to outshine each other. If one consistently overshadows the other, resentment and conflict can arise.3. Superficial CollaborationTheir working relationship or friendship may appear functional on the surface, but it often lacks genuine trust or mutual respect. They may cooperate only as long as it benefits their individual goals, with little interest in true collaboration.4. Mutual ManipulationBoth might use manipulation tactics like flattery, guilt, or strategic alliances to maintain an advantage. This can create a tense and unstable dynamic, especially if both are highly self-serving.5. Fragile AllianceThe relationship may endure as long as external circumstances (like shared projects, goals, or enemies) align their interests. However, conflicts over control, recognition, or perceived slights can quickly erode the alliance.6. Cycles of Betrayal and ReconciliationNarcissists may betray each other if they feel their own interests are threatened or neglected, leading to periods of animosity. They might reconcile temporarily if it benefits them, but the underlying competition often remains unresolved.Key TakeawayThe relationship between two narcissists in a friendship or work context is often unstable and marked by competition, manipulation, and superficiality. While it can function temporarily, it typically lacks the depth, trust, and mutual support needed for long-term success.","title":"Trump Responds to President Musk Claimsand Its Clear Hes Pissed.

Influencing is unavoidable and therefore fine; but I'd like to see secular reasons in support of ideas.  A robust exchange of ideas and careful deliberation before deciding how to proceed forming a more perfect union. Most of the founders were deists.  Thomas Jefferson, for instance, wrote a version of the Bible devoid of any reference to divinity. Thomas Payne called Christianity, \\"a fable\\".  Benjamin Franklin denied the existence of a personal god, in favor of what he terms, \\"nature's God\\"; a phrase which exists on the Declaration of Independence.  They were, to be sure, influenced by various forms of Christianity.  As am I; an agnostic raised protestant.  I'm more than willing to support a good idea but I don't believe those are supported by faith without reason. Those ideas belong in churches. There's plenty of reason to have hope.  You could read Jonathan Glover's Humanity - A Moral History of the 20th Century or Harvard Professor Stephen Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined if you're interested in moral progress.  Personally, can find hope within myself.  It looks something like this: If everyone found it within themselves to not be an ass hole, like I have, which is certainly logically possible, which entails a reason for hope, then we can arrive there.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Merry Christmas everyone","title":"Matt Gaetz, former Trump AG pick, had sex with underage girl while in Congress, House Ethics report says"},{"text":"So someone who is in the federal service and doesn't make six figures then fuck them i guess?

We can incrementally get more info out of them if we can pit them against each other. I don't expect Trump to directly solve problems. I expect him to show us whole new perspectives of government failure that opens up more people to eventual real solutions. The real solutions will come at more localized levels from people who actually care and are directly involved.I'm under no illusion Trump is a Saint or even a good person.

Same goes for most of America's problems.?","title":"Biden Clears Out Most of Federal Death Row Before Trump Can Kill Them"},{"text":"Because they are brainwashed into believing in a false dichotomy. The meaning of 'left and right' in terms of the French National Assembly is that 'Right' meant you sat at the right hand of the assembly and supported the First Estate (Royaly).  If you sat at the Left that meant you supported the Third Estate (the commoners).  The modern version of 'left and right' is more aligned to Hegelian concept of it.The Prussian state ran University system was heavily influential in the late 18th and 19th centuries.  During this time Germany was considered the leading intellectuals and scientists of the world and was heavily influential. At the top of the philosophical food chain was Hegel.  The English (the USA legal system is based on English common law) tended to use contract-based way of viewing the state.  That is were we get ideas of \\"Social Contract\\".  They attempted to extended common law ideas to justify the state. Were as Hegal had a much different view of things: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel#Philosophical_systemhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-social-political/His idea of 'The state' is much more metaphysical and idealistic.  More along the lines that important institutions of the state embedded the will of the people.  That it is more like a hive-mind that represents the current social goals and notions of the people. \\nAfter Hegel passed away his students split into two camps:The Old or \\"Right\\" or \\"Conservative\\" Hegelians that believed that the Prussian state had reached the pinnacle of human social evolution and used their philosophy to justify the then current state structure.Then the Young or \\"Left\\" Hegelians that believed that society and the state will continue to evolve and be reformed.  As the contradictions in society slowly resolve through conflict then it will become better. For example Karl Marx was a \\"Young Hegelian\\".  His moral philosophy (aka Marxism) can be formally described as dialectical materialism, because it rejects a lot of metaphysical/spiritual tendencies of Hegelianism, while maintaining its core dialectal theory of history.  https://www.britannica.com/topic/dialectical-materialism\\nSo that is were we get Left vs Right.Hegelian-style thinking entered into USA in the late 19th century progressive movement.  This is where we get things like Eugenics were social aspects of dialectical conflict and struggle \\"theory of history\\" stuff married biological/evolutionary processes...Hegelian-style thinking pretty much dominates modern political thought.  Any time somebody brings up notions like \\"You don't want to be on the wrong side of history\\" or want to talk as if the state is it's own thinking breathing \\"being\\" with its own rights and will... then that stuff is very much Hegelian. Libertarian, then, is not located anywhere on the political spectrum.  It is completely outside of most modern concepts of political thought, which is one of the major difficulties in discussing things.  It requires people to think of the state and people and individuals kinda \\"sideways\\" to the way they are discussed in schools. Libertarianism is \\"Classical Liberalism\\", which pre-dates Progressivism and modern USA-style Conservatives. You can accurately think of Progressivism is a reactionary against Classical Liberalism.  USA Conservationism is reactionary against USA Progressivism. \\nIt has become increasingly popular among many \\"conservatives\\" and \\"new right\\" on twitter or similar platforms to try to tie modern conservatism into some sort of ancient tradition or whatever.  They are talking out their ass. Conservatism in the USA is 100% born out of opposition against Progressivism.  This is why Conservatives are only strong and united in the face of a \\"Winning\\" Progressive movement, but once they get in charge and the progressives are very weak the whole thing falls apart and they are completely ineffective at instituting real reform. They are, very literally, only united in opposition. They are defined by their opposition. Without a strong force to fight against the conservative movement fractures into intellectually opposed camps.https://mises.org/library/book/betrayal-american-right","title":"Why did conservatives start calling themselves the right?"},{"text":"They make 6 figures.

The question comes down to: who was Trump referring to with the \\"very fine people\\" comment? He said not the white supremacists and neo-nazis, so who?One answer could be that he was referring to non-white supremacist conservatives at the rally, but I reject that answer because in all this time no one has been able to point to a single person at that rally who wasn't a white supremacist. The rally was organized by white supremacists and advertised white supremacist speakers, that's who was there.So another answer could be that he thought there were some regular conservatives there and was just mistaken. But that's hard to believe too because these comments were made several days later after his initial refusal to condemn anyone blew up.Then finally we come to what I think is the obvious truth: Trump knew it was a white supremacist rally, and lied about there being very fine people there. Why would he do this? Well white supremacists have been trying to legitimize themselves for a while, calling themselves ethno-nationalists or whatever and distancing themselves from the \\"nazi\\" label. I believe Trump was referring to this group: effectively white supremacists who are pretending they are not. There's even evidence for this in his comments (that Snopes decided to ignore): There were people in that rally  and I looked the night before  if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.The night before was the Tiki torch rally, where they chanted \\"jews will not replace us\\". I don't think there's an argument that they weren't white supremacists.So in summary, I believe trumps \\"very fine people\\" comment referred to the group of white supremacists who weren't actively carrying nazi flags, and therefore it's still accurate to say he called white supremacists very fine people, even though he pretended to condemn them.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump cant have them executed"},{"text":"*\\"Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?\\" Trump said on Sunday.*In other words, he just heard about the Panama Canal and he's all worked up about it.For the next four years our policies will be determined by whichever self-interested crook happened to be talking to Trump last.","title":"Panama president hits back at Trump over canal U.S. takeover comments"},{"text":"Wow they're really all pathetic, aren't they?","title":"Trump's Pick For Latin American Envoy Was Fired From Bank For Having Affair With Woman Who Worked For Him"},{"text":"Download it while you can.","title":"Matt Gaetz Report (Dec. 23, 2024)"},{"text":"The real investigation should be how he got over $90,000 to pay for his hookers and drugs...","title":"Political nepo baby Matt Gaetz rose quickly to power in the House.

If people really wanted accountability, why would they back Trump?  He has dodged accountability since his early days. He takes credit for things other people did and shifts blame for his failures onto others. I think he is able to get away with jt because of our modern echo chambers. Both sides can play the technically correct storytelling game. They simply omit the parts that make their own side look bad and use a ton of inference and innuendo to lead people to what they know is a false conclusion. But we never said that is the defense. Technically true, but they made people believe it. What people like about Trump is that he is unconventional, disregarding what that really means. Personally, I cant stand what others love. I hate the third grade name calling and bullying. Many applaud it. I am constantly shocked at his short sighted views (lets abandon NATO, lets throw tariffs on our biggest trade partners). Some think that drastic change must be good because Trump will cast it in some false narrative (they arent paying us, tariffs are taxes paid by the other country) and people gobble it up blindly. Maybe folks really just dont see how he has been dodging accountability for years. People call his fraud cases lawfare even though he blatantly committed fraud. Very straightforward black letter law. Yet, he is innocent because the people prosecuting him are democrats. It seems like lawfare doesnt mean that he isnt guilty, just that they dont like their guy being held accountable. But I hope I am wrong. If Trump does what he has said he will do, we will be shifting from a pseudo-oligarchy to an actual oligarchy very rapidly.","title":"House Ethics Committee accuses Gaetz of 'regularly' paying for sex, including with 17-year-old girl"},{"text":"Yup.

Harris would have stood strong. Trump is going to cave and bend over. Like he always when talking to dictators. 4. You want to support a man who cheated on all of his wives, the last with porn star he paid for sex, a man who bragged he could walk in on minors as they changed, a man who selected a man who had sex with 17 year old girls to work for him, because he defends traditions and family values? You can support a man who breaks the law and who brags about walking in teen girls  as they change all you wish. I get that those values are important to you.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Because he was the vice president for 8 years?","title":"Why did trump try and nominate a pedophile as the attorney general?"},{"text":"And all the prdophile positive states??","title":"Ethics Report: Fmr.

All of those populist movements occurred after Nietzsche famously pointed out the decline of organized religion in Europe.

Even the Catholics in America are bible-thumping nuts compared to those in Europe, and that goes back a long way. It's easy to go after organized religion now, in retrospect, because separation of church and state is a core tenet in liberal societies. And that's important, yes, because of freedom!

You clearly are already familiar with this sub.Still, I think most regular people in the real world don't care about a politicians letter anymore. Real people want real accountability across the board. Only the slow, weird, old, or dense are still fixating on red vs blue noise in this fashion. It would be really nice for this country to agree on some objective standards and hold all sides equally accountable for their actions. Accountability needs to be equal across the political  spectrum as well as across the financial/class divides. The longer we fixate on red vs blue like your post, the longer the status quo can continue. If he committed crimes, especially against minors, then throw the book at him. Fine. (One caveat I would add is that in this new era of lawfare, it's not always clear which offenses are amped up and which are downplayed by the legal system for purely political purposes. Like who else among his colleagues have been doing exactly the same stuff? Im pretty sure its many of them. I dont doubt that Gaetz is a scumbag, but i have zero confidence that the reporting or even the contents of this report are entirely accurate.) Its not controversial to say that Gaetz is a creep in his personal life. In the real world, away from reddit thinkers, there is a lot of nuance, especially when it comes to people. Even deeply flawed scumbags are complex and multifaceted. People can support his political positions and professional activities without sactioning or approving of his personal life.Assuming you are a real person, I find it really bizarre to bait subs with posts like this.

If it were a rejection of the Democratic platform or blanket anger at Democrats, why did we do well downballot for the most part? Even things like Casey's loss were very narrow.The working class isn't \\"lost\\" or whatever. They're just hit hard by post covid inflation and took it out on the incumbent administration. They did not reject Democrats in general. Trump has a weird and unique hold on white working class voters, true, but guess who can never be on the presidential ballot again? Seeing the actual effects of a Republican trifecta plus not having Trump on the ballot suddenly makes working class voters more easily winnable.That and we shouldn't write off any demographic.

Voters cite inflation and immigration as their main reasons for voting Trump over Kamala. This swung the election, but with only a 2 million vote difference in an anti-incumbent year, Dubya had more in 2004.The voters, while not complete idiots, aren't informed enough to grasp why tariffs = bad and Trump = authoritarian = bad.The scenes of chaos at the border a few years ago hurt a lot. People aren't as racist as we'd think. They just want a sense of control over the border. Look at Brexit. It reduced EU migration and increased non-EU migration. You'd think the racists wouldn't like that, but since Parliament was now in charge rather than the Eurocrats...Then, there's the discomfort from inflation. It sticks with people more and outweighs wage increases. All while the party viewed as big spenders and bad on the economy was in power. The party irresponsibly spent too much,[ maintained tariffs](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/china-tariffs-biden-trump/index.html), and worsened inflation, with a disproportionate effect on working class Americans. They were then punished for this, so democracy works?The voters aren't evil. They're just moderately uninformed, and didn't buy the Trump is a fascist, vote for me thing. Which, seeing Kamala congratulate Trump after having called him a fascist... It makes me feel like I'm the idiot for having bought it. If they actually think he's a fascist, why congratulate him and invite him to the White House?So, to win it back, just tack to the center and become Bill Clinton. The people crave a charismatic, tough on crime Democrat. One that doesn't screw up the economy like a protectionist succ. Give them that, bomb misbehaving countries rather than acting like a coward, and they'll feel everything is going great again.","title":"How can we bridge the cultural gap between neoliberals and the median voter?"},{"text":"He still paid tens of thousands of dollars for sex, including with a minor","title":"Why did trump try and nominate a pedophile as the attorney general?"},{"text":"Bermuda?

Some of this money was funneled through a private company he created and ran from government buildings, called Government Blockchain Systems LLCI dont think its the same minor involved here but there is a very clear connection between this man and Gaetz.

Doesn't mean I'm \\"making up things\\".My reason for stating it this way is that I don't know if the rule is universal or not. As an example in immigration court the [DOJ Immigration Court Practice Manual](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/reference-materials/ic/chapter-5/12) explicitly says: Parties should note that unopposed motions are not necessarily granted.But, just because that applies in immigration court doesn't mean it applies in this context. No one has cited any sources saying it doesn't though. Also, if it's the prosecution making the motion (say a motion to dismiss, which likely won't be opposed by the defendant) my understanding is that[ rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure says they can only do so \\"with the leave of the court\\"](https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/why-do-rule-48a-dismissals-require-leave-of-court/). That means the judge gets to decide. This is in part to protect the defendant from the prosecution trying to cover up an error and also to prevent an abuse of power (like an incoming prosecutor dropping a pending case because the defendant is their friend or a big donor). As I said, I'd love it if a actual lawyer could clarify if that applies in \\"normal\\" court like this or if it's in just some courts (like the immigration court I cited above). I haven't seen any sources saying a judge is required to not adjudicate a motion without opposition. If you still think I'm \\"making things up\\" I'd love to see why you think that rather than just deal with childish attacks.","title":"Federal judge who agreed to scrap Trumps election fraud case allows Jan. 6 rioter to attend inauguration as other defendants wait for green light"},{"text":"If you want to post about \\"President Musk\\" on X or Truth to screw with Vice President Trump, feel free to use any of these images to really piss him off.
