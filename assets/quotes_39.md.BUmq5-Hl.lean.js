To what ends?  The Left is both for US intervention in Israel/Gaza and Ukraine/Russia - it just depends on the side.

If the Left took the side of Russia, they'd argue that sending armaments to Ukraine is no different than sending armaments to Afghanistan, which led to the blow back which caused 9/11.The political paradigms are illusory and only make post hoc rationales for their positions.In an alternate universe, Trump wins 2020 and the Covid vaccines are embraced by the political right because Trump's Operation Warp Speed bypassed the conventional strangleholds of Federal delays for medication development and got a miracle vaccine released in 18 months rather than 8 years.

Even after the invasion of Crimea and the Donbass by Russias Little Green Men, Obama continued to refuse to provide any weapons or approve of arms sales to the Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian proxies in their Eastern frontier. Trump on the other hand, approved of the first arms shipments and training exercises with Ukraines military, and empowered US forces in Syria to bomb Russian paramilitary forces into ash and cinders when they dared to engage or troops.The Biden admin has, despite what many claim, has chosen to hem, and haw, and drag their feet on any aid provided to Ukraine. The delays in their willingness to give various pieces of wartime technology and materiel to the Ukrainian forces have been one of the major contributing factors to the current stalemate the two sides face. Whether it was Abrams tanks and Bradley AFVs, or offensive missiles, or F-16s, Bidens administration has been a day late and a dollar short on providing the Ukrainians with the support they need to actually achieve victory.If we had been willing to provide them with everything they needed back in 2022, the west would have been fairly well suited to demand a return of all Ukrainian territory. However, at this point, the war has killed a large chunk of the militarily-fit population of Ukraine, and allowed the Russians the time to dig even further into the entrenched positions they have held onto forin some casesover a decade, while also learning to adapt their doctrine, strategies, and tactics to the realities of the battlefield.If a return of all territory is your standard, you arent asking for a realistic resolution.

The fact is, their near-monopoly on the culture of the USA means that God's existence is a given. In order to change that situation, it is you, the atheist, who acts as interloper to their previously tranquil domain, who has the burden of proof. It is you who is the serpent suggesting that they can take a bite of the apple after all, and unfortunately for you they've all learnt the wrong lesson from that story.Interpersonally speaking, I'm going to call this not a burden of proof but a 'burden of change'. Whoever wishes to move away from the status quo (in this case, a default of 'god is real') is the one who will be expected to carry those who are comfortable with the status quo entirely upon their backs.

Not only has it set a bad precedent for the overall national political profile, but it put the Democratic party in a far worse position coming into the 2024 than it could have been, particularly in terms of running against the administration's perceived weaknesses.","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"he's DINO","title":"Josh Gottheimer promised an abortion protection bill.

Then, the first copy was officially certified by the Council of Carthage some 300 years after Jesus was alive. This makes me skeptical as to legitimacy of many of the claims the Bible presents about the life of Jesus and the apostles. Regardless, we have many other examples where many more people did more extreme and irrational things for the sake of a single person than the apostles did. For example, the Manson Family and Heaven's Gate. These examples are much more extreme, but that's the point; they were willing to go to farther extremes than the apostles were asked to go through despite gaining even less of a promised reward.

To be open, I do know quite a few teachers, and while this admittedly shapes my own opinion, I think it has given me some insight into why the profession is truly underpaid. To help explain, let me address your points individually:  [According to the National Educator Association](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank), average salary for a starting teacher is 44k and for all teacher is 70k. Meanwhile, the average income in the [United States is 59k. ](https://www.demandsage.com/average-us-income/#:~:text=The%20annual%20average%20US%20income,adult%20with%20a%20bachelors%20degree.) The problem with this assessment is that youre looking at average salaries on the whole, not salaries based on level of education. The current median salary for a person with a masters degree is around $81,848. If we go by your own numbers on teacher salaries, we can see that teachers are making around 30% less than peers with similar levels of education, which is a massive gap. When you consider that the education in question is often quite expensive, this can make teaching a financially risky profession to enter.  As you can see, teachers starting pay are higher than the average income in their respective area, high job security, work 10 months a year, great benefits (Healthcare insurance + pension). Again, this only makes sense if we dont factor in cost of education. Making slightly higher than average salary doesnt account for the opportunity cost of spending years getting a tertiary degree instead of working, or of paying off student loans. For other professions these expenses are counterbalanced by higher pay, but teachers barely make more than if they had just stopped at an undergraduate degree. Adding to what you have said, teachers dont actually work only 10 months a year in practice, even if theyre allowed to in theory. To the contrary, their off time is often used making lesson plans for the coming year, especially for new teachers building their syllabus out. Essentially, theyre only getting paid for 10 months of work, but have a job the required then to work 12 in practice (with constant unpaid overtime for things like grading).  If you calculate the pension payout, you are looking at 54% to 60% of salary replacement upon retirement. If you retire with a final income of say 80k, that is 44k per year even at 55%. Conservatively speaking, divide 44k by 0.04 as per the 4% 401k withdrawal rule, this is equivalent to a 1.1 million 401k savings. This only works if you assume teachers are able to stay in their jobs long enough to get their full pension, and most dont. The profession wide turnover rate for teachers is absolutely insane. Every year, about [8% of teachers nation wide quit teaching](https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/12_13_2023.asp). That means that a significant portion of teachers, and likely an outright majority, dont say in their role long enough to ever earn the generous pensions youre mentioning. This isnt a surprise since burnout rates among teachers are regularly [found to be the highest of any American profession, and pay is consistently reported to be the biggest cause for burnout.](https://www.devlinpeck.com/content/teacher-burnout-statistics).  Sure, your teachers will never get paid like a Google Software developer or your military field grade officers, but most people will love this pay/benefits for their jobs. Heres the issue though, many teachers *could* take those sorts of jobs and get paid way more. A big part of why teacher pay being low constitutes a crisis is because those teachers have a strong incentive to leave for better paying non-teaching jobs. This problem is most acute with teachers from stem disciplines, which are going to be vitally important for developing a competitive future workforce. Right now there are [critical shortages of math, physics, and chemistry teachers](https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/75/3/25/2842714/The-US-is-in-dire-need-of-STEM-teachersFaculty), in large part because people from those fields can make more with just an undergraduate degree in other jobs than they can as a teacher with a masters degree.  Now, is the job difficult? Absolutely. But so is CDL, welding, plumbing, HVAC installation and those jobs are far more demanding physically. The issue is, those jobs come with an expectation of intense physical labor, its part of the trade off. Getting higher level degrees is a different risk to reward strategy: you take on higher risk in the form of studying and educational debt, in return for higher pay/lighter workloads later on. Teachers get screwed because they take on the risk, but dont get the benefits. Their pay is mediocre, and their actual work hours are often very high, far outside of what their job description would suggest. The average teacher works a shocking 53 hours a week, and that number is likely a good deal higher for brand new teachers, who are developing lesson plans from scratch. Anecdotally, I know a former corporate lawyer who decided to become a history teacher. They shared that their workload as a teacher massively eclipsed what they experienced as a lawyer, to a point they were often working 5+ hours a day on weekends their first year just to keep up.  Does the job require qualifications in degrees and intelligence? Sure, but I wager that mechanical/civil engineers, on average, are higher in test scores, GPA, and IQ score. Sure, you can always selectively compare STEM teachers to engineers, but Im sorry, a math/physics degree simply isnt as marketable as any engineering ones. Ok, but the problem here is that low teaching pay has pushed the brightest students away from becoming teachers. Of course the highest scoring folks are going to be disincentivized, theyre going to get screwed out of tens of thousands of dollars per year by following the noble aspiration of educating a younger generation. The issue isnt that teachers are dumb, its that our broken system pushes potentially excellent teachers away from a career in education.  Is the job dangerous? Yes, it can be. But so are police, military, and mall cops. Again, we have to talk about expected tradeoffs. A cop gets paid well for doing a potentially dangerous job, and they know that going in. Risk of harm is an inherent part of the jobs payment calculation. In contrast, teaching **shouldnt** involve the risk of harm from anything greater than paper cuts. The fact that teachers need to worry about being personally endangered by violence from or between their students speaks to a profound social failing. Can you blame them for being upset? It would be like showing up for a data entry job, and learning that your company bought computers that explode every few years. Its simply not what anyone should be expect or a risk that they should be expected to tolerate.  So teachers who feel they are underpaid should seek employment elsewhere, that is the beauty of capitalism. Actually, its one of the core failings inherent to pure capitalism, widely known as [the tragedy of the commons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). As a society we all benefit from a strong education system, which is needed to train skilled workers, who in turn keep America economically competitive. However, nobody wants to pay for the costs of that education, as they often dont get the benefit immediately or directly. As a result, teachers end up underpaid, schools go underfunded, educational attainment scores drop, and our workforce becomes less competitive with that of other nations. This is exactly the scenario where state and federal government authorities are supposed to step in. Its their job to tell everyone to suck it up, and to fund the common good of education through taxes, as this is ultimately to everyones advantage. When governments fail to do so, as weve seen recently, it creates crises for teacher recruitment, retention, and student success. __________________________________________Anyhow, I hope this has given you a new perspective, at least in part.

Works for a public school corp in a medium size town in the MidWest. She has taught for 33 years and is near the top of her scale. A teachers contract is for 185 days spread out over a year, with no overtime. Teachers pay is determined by the wealth of the town. Funding is provided through local property taxes, as well as state and federal funding based on test scores. So socio economics will play a part in what a school can budget for salaries. Now, she is salaried and does not get overtime. She typically leaves home at 730am and gets home at 600pm. She has a 15 min commute. She teaches 2nd grade. She will go into the classroom about one weekend day every two weeks to prepare for the week. She is in bed by 930pm every night. But maybe one to two nights a week, she is grading papers and entering grades into her laptop until 1100-1130pm. She spends about 500.00 per year out of pocket on stuff for her classroom. Her health insurance is awful. Mine is way better so I carry her on a family health insurance plan from my employer. During summer vacation, she will typically start working her classroom 2 weeks before school starts at about 20 hours a week, except if she has to move classrooms, then Ill help her move and its a solid 2 day affair. During a typical school day, she often complains she didnt have time to eat her lunch, and she barely has time to pee. (Cant leave the kids unattended). Last year she was attacked/assaulted twice by a problem child, the child eventually left the school. Due to school policies, she cant defend herself or remove herself from the situation as she has to protect the other kids in the class. Several years ago, a child threw his chair at my wife. It hit her, but she was not seriously hurt. Couldve been worse. She fears physical attacks and lawsuits. The school can only do so much. She also has to deal with parents who defend their wayward kids, Treat teachers like babysitters, wont take accountability for their childs actions, or even parents who are so dysfunctional themselves, cant even be pro-active in their childs lives. My wife has had to deal with headlice epidemics, bedbug epidemics brought into the classroom by unkempt kids several times over the years. Not to mention, provide a coat, or shoes to some kids. She even had one kid who witnessed his dad shoot his mom before shooting himself. She has stepped in between a child and a non-custodial parent trying to abduct/kidnap his child. Since COVID, there has been an exodus of teachers leaving the profession. There is a national teacher shortage. For every reason you think teachers are paid enough, I can give you ten reasons they arent. I can tell you a few more stories of how hard some teachers have it. If you really need convincing, go an become a volunteer assistant in a classroom, do it for sometime and eventually you will change your tune! You have no idea the dedication it takes to become an effective public school teacher and why they arent paid enough. Go walk a mile in a teachers shoes!","title":"CMV: Teachers in the United States are compensated enough and further complains about low pay will only alienate more taxpayers."},{"text":"The workers themselves have come out in favour of it recently.

The Republican party has been right wing at least since Barry Goldwater was their nominee in 1964.  He voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  His campaign slogan, In your heart you know hes right was a dog whistle to those who shared his racism and extreme  views privately.  This was thrown back at him with, Yes, extreme right.  In his acceptance speech, Goldwater famously stated that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.  He was laying the groundwork for events like the January 6 riot and attempted coup fostered by the losing Republican incumbent, Trump.  Trumps MAGA slogan was also a bird whistle that his racist supporters understood to mean make America white and straight again.

With very strategic purposes. One of the most important would be that any such animation should focus on the victim. It should not breed a false narrative that the child benefitted in any way. It should instead complete the story, showing how the child was impacted from the abuse and how their life has changed. If this is truly meant to be a coping mechanism for pedophilia, then it should do more than just satisfy base urges. It should minimize its graphic stimulus and instead teach the long term effects of such actions. It should be made with an aim of associating the situation with a strong, negative connotation that should make the practice feel abhorrent and unwanted, acting as a psychological deterrent. Oftentimes, abusers imagine that their victim actually wants the abuse. These animations should make it quite clear that that is not the case.

Tuesday, Wed, and Thursdays 11 to 1pm EST. (closed holidays). I call weekly. There's less than a month left to call. Peltier is 80 and in failing health. Hes been in prison since 1977, for 47 years. Biden is likely his last chance to get out. Please share with everyone you know!\\n34 Members of Congress Urge President Biden to Pardon Leonard Peltier\\nWASHINGTON  U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Ral M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Chairman Brian Schatz (D-HI) spearheaded a letter urging President Biden to grant clemency to Leonard Peltier, the renowned Native American rights activist. The letter was dated Thursday, December 12, 2024, the same day the president commuted sentences of 1,500 individuals and pardoned 39, a record by a president in a single day. The letter, signed by 34 Members of Congress, was sent during the final weeks of Biden's term, calling for a pardon for Peltier, who has been incarcerated since 1977 following a controversial trial and conviction for the murder of two FBI agents during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.The lawmakers highlighted the long-standing legal and moral concerns surrounding Peltier's conviction, citing the cases flaws, including what many view as an unjust investigation and trial. The U.S. Attorney who prosecuted the case has also called the trial problematic. In their appeal, the Members of Congress emphasized Peltiers advanced age and declining health, making the argument that a presidential pardon is his last chance for freedom. The case of Leonard Peltier remains a focal point of discussions about justice, Native American rights, and the U.S. legal system, with many advocates urging for his release on the grounds of humanitarian and legal concerns.Despite the grave concerns surrounding the continued imprisonment of Mr. Peltier, who is now 80 years old and suffering from severe health conditions, including increasing vision loss, the Bureau of Prisons denied Mr. Peltier a compassionate release or reduction in sentence in April of this year; and in July 2024, the U.S. Parole Commission denied him parole. These recent denials mean only you have the unique ability to grant him clemency and rectify this grave injustice that has long troubled human rights advocates and Native Peoples across the globe, the lawmakers wrote.https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/34-members-of-congress-urge-president-biden-to-pardon-leonard-peltier\\nBiden commutes most federal death sentences\\nUS President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates, switching their penalty to life in prison without parole.\\nThe three excluded from the measure include the Boston Marathon bomber and the man who killed Jewish worshippers in 2018. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkxe4xlvgxo","title":"34 Members of Congress Urge President Biden to Pardon Leonard Peltier.

For example, lets compare teachers to the workers at the Government Department of Justice, since they too, are employed by the state.A Paralegal has a starting salary of about $72,000 per year, increasing to 95,000 per year with eight years of professional experience. Incidentally, it takes only a two year degree to become a Paralegal.Lawyers at the DOJ have a starting salary of $89,000 per year, increasing to $116,000 with eight years of experience. You do require a Masters degree in this instance, but it nonetheless takes you just as long to become a lawyer as it does to become a teacher.And its not just other government workers who earn more than teachers. Pretty much any job that requires a college education pays better than teaching. Nurses: $70,000 a year\\nFlight attendants: ?$92,000 a year\\nLogistics Manager: $92,000 a year\\nFood scientists: $70,000 a year\\nLoan officers: $63,000 a year\\nFire inspectors: $66,000 a yearThese are all jobs that require at most a four year college education like teaching. Keep in mind, these are averages across the entire US. All of these jobs have opportunities for well experienced employees to earn in the six figure range.The advantage of these jobs over teaching is that all of these jobs offer clear opportunities for advancement leading to increased pay over time. Once youre a teacher, youre basically stuck at the level youre at. On top of which, there is now significant political risk attached to becoming a teacher owing to the rise of the far right in the US. God help any teacher who winds up teaching at a predominantly right-wing school, and these are only set to become more common if Trumps national ban on CRT will be adopted into law.In short, being a teacher carries significant risk, has no advancement opportunities, has capped opportunities for earnings when compared to other jobs that require college degrees, and are subject to stress brought on by large numbers of students and outsized class counts. All of these factors dissuade students with teaching degrees from pursuing teaching, at a time when teachers are greatly needed to replace those resigning because of the aforementioned factors. Therefore teachers should be paid more money in order to compete with other careers for college educated professionals, and while this activity would normally end up balancing itself out due to capitalism, the availability of schools and teachers is essential to the functioning of the US economy, which is by definition not capitalist.","title":"CMV: Teachers in the United States are compensated enough and further complains about low pay will only alienate more taxpayers."},{"text":"Great take overall, but I think I arrive at a different conclusion, in that I think it would be unfair to hold the Democratic party, or Democrats individually, accountable for the realities imposed by the system and the electorate.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"The entire Middle East is about to explode into war.

Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.Whether Biden \\"ran on\\" these promises is irrelevant since he clearly made no serious effort on any of them once in office. Also I highly doubt most voters really believe he ran on those or even knew about it. Secondly the only real legislation passed in the Biden era was very very early on, the COVID relief bill. That was it. Nothing else of note happened. Infrastructure was written by corporate lobbyists and Senate republicans! The \\"IRA\\" bill is garbage and right-wing in many ways. The actual attempt to pass something meaningful under Biden called \\"Build Back Better\\" did not happen, and Biden then elevated and flattered the two Senators who primarily prevented it from happening. On abortion I think you're cherrypicking a bit but ok. However when it comes to healthcare, education, stances on wars etc the Democratic Party is way more right wing than those of Europe. Death penalty, etc. Also Ezra Klein is not really a progressive commentator and no real left winger thinks Biden is the most progressive, that is a talking point that some folks tried putting out there but it's obviously completely wrong.At least in Europe you can have MORE THAN ONE CHOICE, in the USA we aren't allowed that to begin with.

One is as a deterrent. One is to prevent a person from committing the crime again.

People will use your argument all the time to fast track investigations, prosecutions, and trials purely for retribution.  It comes up in every conversation, online or otherwise about this topic.  What would you do if they did that to *your* [insert family member here]?  Well Id want to kill that person with my bare hands, slowly, but thats why Im not put in charge of his sentencing or his execution.Speaking of victims, what if a victims family requests a death sentence be communed like in the case of Marcellus Williams?  Oh well, we just kill them anyway.  That doesnt feel like retribution to me.  That feels like a government that wants to kill someone to prove a point.And the carve out for 3 people left shows no moral principle and only political games. Those 3 left would cost Democrats the Boston, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Pennsylvania forever.We agree on something. You cant say Im against the death penalty except these 3. Its the most bankrupt move ever and this makes it even worse.Id go a step further and say you cant say Im against the death penalty and become president.  Just like you cant be an atheist and become president.","title":"Biden Clears Out Most of Federal Death Row Before Trump Can Kill Them"},{"text":"So multiple accounts then?","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"What a load of horse shit.","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"Hi, I kind of did my research  talked to many immigrant councellors after seeing  the ads of study abroad  Germany or Europe  where they claim Tution fee is very less when I call them and they ask my Academic  Records they are like you won't  get Public  University  though  there are private University  which have 60-70 LPA as fee and being  a upper  middle class person  I don't  have that kind of money and honestly  I don't  want to place bets on private University  as I have studied  in one in India and have a bad experience I saw this post in Reddit  Notification.

I think our last murder was in 2009and that was with a claw hammer, not a gun.All that being said, I 100% believe that promoting firearms must be coupled with responsibility.I feel like this is where much of American culture goes wrong.

Its hard for people to understand scale in terms of # per 100k because its not something people colloquially have to conceptualize.

That's all gone now, and I only expect his reputation to get worse with time.However, I do say this much, we need to make sure Gen Z gets more onboard with the movements against them. What we cannot afford to have happen is a repeat of this environment, with that subtle rightward shift. Letting that get locked in is one of our great challenges now.

You don't understand the concentrations at which they happen. It's not population based. It's way above. In regards to establishing what rare means, there have been a few attempts to quantify what rare is at the population level. Literally all agree with me.the European Commission for Research and Innovation defines rare as something that affects no more than 50 per 100,000. In the US the rare disease act of 2002 defined\\" rare\\" as affecting no more than 67 per 100,000 and Japan defined rare as 40 per 100,000. The range of \\"rare\\" as a threshold was also established as being primarily between 10-85 per 100,00 by a 2020 report from Knowledge Ecology International which provided 24 selected government definitions of what constituted \\"rare\\". The WHO defines rare diseases as those affecting 65 out of 100,000. Peru was the single country who defined rare as 1 per 100,000....The gun homicide rate in the US in 2023 was 5.2 per 100,000 which is significantly lower than the maximum threshold to be considered rare (excluding Peru). The 5.2 per 100,000 reflects the total number of gun homicides in the US for 2023 which was 18,874.To add additional context, I worked for about a decade in medical research focusing on a type of cancer called Sarcoma. One of my jobs was to work with patients to find coordinating centers who had Sarcoma experts because the doctors who had experience with sarcoma are rare themselves. John Hopkins, the mayo clinic, the national cancer center, ect; all classify sarcoma as a very rare type of cancer.According to National Cancer Institute, there are around 18,000 new cases diagnosed every year.This is all just a pre-context to something we should objectively know though because 5.2 per 100k is the same thing as 0.0052%. Everyone already knows that something with an occurrence of 0.0052% is rare.That's my basis for determining the rates are objectively rare. Please feel free to provide your sources for standards that demonstrate they are not rare.Finally, comparative rates tell you nothing with the thing being looked at is already hyper rare.","title":"CMV: American society should not be glorifying guns"},{"text":"It's not just the Bernie Bros sadly.

So far, 2.09% of registered voters in SD-32 have cast a ballot.  I can't find results for HD-26, which is fully within SD-32.On the one hand, Virginia has a very long early voting period, and the next two Saturdays will have extra locations open.  There are also more than 9,000 mail votes outstanding, and those are more Dem-leaning in Virginia.On the other hand, I don't feel like leaving this up to chance.  The stakes are huge: **If we lose these races, the GOP gets a trifecta in Virginia and can destroy the state.**  And they've been noisy as hell about interfering in schools, rolling back voting rights, reducing gun protections, and restricting abortion.

This gives a gun homicide rate of 5.6 per 100k which is the same thing as 0.0056%Gun homicides are objectively hyper rare and often very location specific.Gun ownership being glorified does not impact gun homicides.","title":"CMV: American society should not be glorifying guns"},{"text":"How did Trump interfere though?","title":"Please Democrats rig your primary again and run Kamala Harris a second time. -Every Republican"},{"text":"Ran on a policy of is not the party isI could run on a policy of codifying roe vs wade immediately, pulling out of middle eastern wars, reducing taxes on the poor, increasing social services, creating nationalised healthcare, ending citizen surveillance, ending the police stateBut once im in power and win a majority in all three branches, if i leave roe vs wade alone so my replacement can run on the same promise, expand our invasions in the middle east, increase taxes on the poor and reduce taxes on the rich, gut social services, create healthcare that benefits insurance companies and private investors, massively expand the surveillance state, and expanding the police state, then i wouldnt be considered left wing regardless of my policy.

If youre genuinely concerned about tax fairness, we should discuss how the current structure of financial markets allows massive wealth accumulation through speculative trading while productive labor gets taxed at higher effective rates.I literally think that structure is fine and fair - if anything, we should abolish the income tax, whose mere existence is proof of the slippery slope (did you know that the income tax was originally only levied on the 1%) - any tax that's introduced as a tax only on the wealthy will inevitably become a tax on the middle class, because the middle class is the largest cash cow a government has. The wealthy can hide their money and hire an army of accountants to ensure that they pay as minimal a tax burden as possible; the higher you set their tax rates, the greater the incentive for the wealthy to do this.

Were not proposing some radical experiment - financial transaction taxes exist in many markets and we can study their effects. The incentive changes they create are fairly well understood: some reduction in trading volume, particularly in speculative short-term trading, offset by revenue generation from remaining transactions.Good policy design acknowledges incentives but also recognizes that markets can adapt to and function under different incentive structures.

The electorate would push against attempts to remove their existing health insurance plans, especially when a single payer would offer worse terms of insurance to many people with the privilege of a good insurance.- The federal structure of the US means that stuff like mandatory paid leave is usually enacted on the state level. The general lack of labor unions in the US means that government collaboration with them is obviously more limited.- The second amendment severely limits the ability of the government to regulate guns, limiting the federal government to half-measures like banning assault rifles and not allowing them to enact European-style gun regulations.- As for climate, I don't think Democrats are really an outlier here. Plenty of European governments work with the private sector. Electricity production is not nationalized in the majority of EU countries, so transitioning to green energy means working with private producers through incentives. Aggressive public ownership hasn't been a thing in most European countries in decades.

Because that would be.... pretty fucked up ngl. CNC is VERY explicitly talked about and given consent for, and for me that's the only reason I have ever wanted it. Rape is an awful awful thing to do to someone, but *giving permission* to be used and abused by someone you know and trust through CNC is very different imo. Call it... extreme BDSM roleplay, or something to that extent. Ageplay is, from my understanding, similar in that regard. Kind of weird to fantasize about imo, but I imagine that's how some others feel about CNC as well so  but either way, both of those things involve *CONSENTING **adults knowingly *choosing* to be treated some type of way for mutual sexual gratification, versus someone violating another for a sense of power and self gratification. As you say, unequivocally immoral under \\"normal circumstances\\". Agreed, as in both rape and CSA are both unequivocally immoral. Here's another point I may change your mind on though, have you ever read about any studies on fetishization as a form of trauma processing? It's actually an extremely common thing that most don't even realizing they're doing. Take BDSM as a general term. A lot of people who greatly enjoy submissive roles during sex are, throughout the rest of their life, constantly feeling a sense of need for control. *Choosing* to completely give up control to someone else, in a contained and deliberate manner, can be extremely enjoyable. Some people are masochistic because they have been in so much pain that their brain sexualized the sensation as a means of dealing with it. On the flip side, I have never forgotten when I was once asked if the fact that I deal with chronic pain and have a long history of major injuries is part of why I'm into both sides of sadomasochism but lean heavily into sadism, unless it's for the right kind of energy with someone I can trust. It allows for both a sense of control over the feeling of being in control by *choosing* to give someone else control, and it allows me to feel a sense of control over the pain I deal with constantly and have nothing I can do about. I psychoanalyze things more than the average person might, I'm aware, but humans have a need for a sense of control over their environment and experiences, specifically for major things that stand out. Brains will do weird things to achieve that. CNC/age play can, for some, be a means of feeling a sense of control over a situation/experience they have been in before without any control over, and the brain gains acceptance and peace over the associated pain by sexualizing the new pain. Idk if I explained that correctly but the point I'm making is that CNC/age play are very different from rape/CSA, *BECAUSE* they are done so by informed consenting adults choosing to experience a certain control/power dynamic.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"Hopefully you are not as [stupid](https://apnews.com/article/gabbard-trump-putin-intelligence-russia-syria-a798adaf9cd531a5d0c9329f7597f0f6) as you seem to be.","title":"Please Democrats rig your primary again and run Kamala Harris a second time. -Every Republican"},{"text":"So if you arent even working what tax dollars, exactly?","title":"Why is Biden doing this And right before Christmas"},{"text":"It shouldnt.

Yes, a FTT would increase transaction costs and likely reduce some trading volume. But markets effectively serve their core functions - price discovery, capital allocation, risk management - across a wide range of liquidity conditions.Look at markets that already operate with various transaction taxes or higher friction - they still work. They still facilitate investment, still allow price discovery, still enable hedging. They just do it with slightly wider spreads and less speculative trading. The core functions remain intact even if some forms of trading become less profitable.When people say but liquidity! theyre often treating current market structure as natural law rather than the product of specific policy choices. We can maintain efficient markets while capturing some revenue from financial transactions - many countries already do. The question is about tradeoffs and design, not binary outcomes.And yes, this would particularly impact high-frequency trading strategies that depend on zero friction to profit from tiny price discrepancies.

So yes, the tax burden would fall disproportionately on the wealthy... because they do a disproportionate share of the trading.

This is a status quo that is excessively right-wing compared to much of the rest of the developed world, dominated by corporate interests and anti-government ideologues (governemnt can never do anything right, all regulatiojs are evil, and similar themes).They largely talk about minor tweaks that wouldn't really make any major changes to wealth distribution, and their focus on raising revenue from the rich to fund programs misses the point of monetary policy which allows them to use the same 'quantitative easing' that propped up the financial markets to fund those same bottom-up programs. See Keynesian economics which isn't thay controversial in the rest of the world. Finally, their written platform rarely aligns with their voting record when they actually have power, so it's a bit of a red herring to focus on it rather than their actual legislative record, which is dominated by the same pork-barrel politics they accuse the Republicans of. They have a tendency to slow walk all those progressive policies that they campaign on once they get into power and stop listening to voters and start listening to donors. They blame a few of their party for being more rightwing and needing to appease them, but they continue to caucus with those people.A few specific points:Making the cutoff for 'working families' be 400k is high. Their focus on collecting unpaid taxes from corporations misses the more impactful need for anti-trust enforcement to break up business cartels and anti-consumer practices. See the EU's approach as a counterpoint.The ACA was a state Republican idea and essentially amounts to an insurance industry subsidy rather than a true public, single-payer option.The focus on rental assistance and general assistance is still a market-based approach that relies on private developers and the private sector generally to increase housing supply affordably rather than just finding a way to extract that rent for the same limited, run-down supply or otherwise collude to fix prices higher.

It does not scratch the urge but rather increases it. It would be the equivalent of recommending an alcoholic have just one drink to get over the urge. Rather they recommend intensive therapy and skills like DBT, grounding, distress tolerance, etc. Similarly, most professionals do not recommend support groups unless they are led by a specialist because of how much information, bad advice, and potential triggers are present.

I'm not quite sure if it has more to do with guns rather than the hunting itself since I am not expert in this topic, but I would assume that is it rather partaking in hunting although that could be wrong, do not take that as a fact.Either way, I will try to address your original points again since we are going off track here.1. Sure, but Nerf and water guns aren't particularly harmful or glorified. They are more - just like hunting in my view - about partaking in the action of playing with water or playing with regular toys that fire projectiles. These aren't glorified in any sense, they are just accepted. Airsoft and Paintball aren't glorifying it, they are just having fun. This is once again not glorified, but rather accepted. Sure, they might seem brutal and it might seem like they're desensitizing them to war and while that is true to a degree, most people who play these are just trying to have fun and don't really try to reenact or encourage those sorts of actions.\\n2. It has been proven time and time again that video games don't make you violent. This point is invalid and doesn't need to be addressed further. Once again, they're having fun, not glorifying it.\\n3. I sort of agree with you on this particular point. Rap music does typically glamorize guns and violence, but there is of course always going to be some people that are weird.\\n4. That's just the government trying to recruit people. That's not society's fault.","title":"CMV: American society should not be glorifying guns"},{"text":" get ratioedWhat a nincompoop.

Money is fungible. A penny saved is a penny earned. Primary and secondary markets are ultimately the same thing. Secondary markets is all trading among investors, it does not provide any cash flow to companies. Right, but it means the company doesn't have to pay dividends either. If I have a $50 wallet with $50 cash inside, the total value is $100. You can take the $50 of cash out of the wallet and put it in your pocket. You can use the $50 to buy a second wallet. You can trade the wallet/cash to me for $100. You can take $50 out of your pocket and trade the wallet to me for another $50. You can use the $50 to buy a second $50 wallet and then sell both wallets to me for $100 of cash. It's all the same thing. The three people involved are you, me, and the wallet maker.Companies go through a lifecycle just like humans. A startup is like an infant. It needs a ton of cash to stay alive. In return, it gives out currently worthless shares that hopefully will be worth something in the future. When it starts to grow and has a more predictable cash flow, it can raise cash with loans. When it's middle aged, it can finance itself via the profits it generates and doesn't need to raise outside cash. When it's a bit older and has less room to grow, it can start to pay out dividends to investors. When it's older still, it can engage in buybacks, where it actively shrinks in size. And then then when it's dead/obsolete, it can be liquidated where all the companies assets are sold off. All of these things are important, not just the part where companies grow forever. The liquidity of stocks in the secondary market is an important part of a capitalist system, but I see no reason why taxing on the trades themselves would have significant impact or cost on any but the wealthiest investors. As a small percentage of a trade, it wouldn't add much cost to the everyday working person, and exceptions could even be made for, say, retirement accounts.It's not a progressive tax. You're charging everyone the same amount of money. One person might pay 20% of their income as taxes and a richer person might pay 30% of their income of taxes. If you make it a flat 25%, it benefits the rich person more than the poor person.Moreover, it's based on trading volume, not on wealth. Jeff Bezos rarely sells Amazon stock and if he does, it's a tiny amount of his total stake. Working people who dollar cost average into index funds with every paycheck are hit by this transaction tax much more.But the impact on individual investors is not even the main problem. The real problem is that you're introducing a systemic bias into the system. Every old company would be overvalued and every younger company would be undervalued. This is because anytime you want to sell the Blockbuster stock you've held for years to buy Netflix stock, you pay a large transaction cost. This is already a major problem with the American tax code. Intel vs. Nvidia, Boeing vs. SpaceX, GM and Ford vs. Tesla. GE vs. a ton of competitors. Large blue chip zombie corporations exist for years after they should have gone bankrupt. The executives usually bribe politicians to prevent them from being disrupted by new innovators too quickly. This type of tax is just another way dumb already rich people to stay rich at the expense of smart poor people.  The liquidity of the capital markets and the favorable treatment of them by our laws of course contributes to this, but to suggest that a lack of taxation or making the most derivative and abstract transactions easier to execute is the main reason, or perhaps the only reason is so void of coherence it's shocking that this currently one of the top comments to be honest.95% of the world lives outside of the US. 67% of the global stock market is currently based in the US. It's not because Americans are somehow smarter or better than everyone else on Earth. It's because the US has more efficient financial markets (no transaction taxes) and because people can feel confident that politicians aren't going to seize their assets like leaders in Russia, China, India, Europe, Africa, South America, etc. There's a ton of ways to do this including taxes, printing money, \\"nationalizing\\" industries, allowing others to steal without sending police after them to recover stolen money, etc. The problem is that the US is starting to do this stuff too. It's still the \\"least bad\\" country, but it's a growing fear among global investors. By the way, everyone on Earth is an investor in this context. For example, if you have a dollar bill in your pocket, you are invested in a [Federal Reserve Note.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Note) Cash is an investment class on its own. People trade it on \\"forex\\" markets just like people trade stocks, bonds, crypto, etc. Forex markets are the largest and most liquid in the world largely because the transaction costs are so low. The more expensive something is to trade (via taxes, trading costs, etc.) the less it is traded and the less \\"correctly\\" it will be priced. That's what I mean by efficient markets. This is grossly overstating the impact a small tax would make. Just hyperbolic nonsense intended to shut down any meaningful discussion.The \\"small\\" version the OP described would be 20% of the US's total annual tax revenue. If you want to raise taxes, just be honest. Don't pretend like this is just a small tax that only affects a few rich people. It would be one of the largest tax hikes in American history and its the single worst type of tax. It's the financial equivalent of taxing vegetables to subsidize the tobacco industry. A lot of old and wealthy people in the US have been migrating to Florida for basically as long as it's been a state. I'm sure the tax situation is viewed as a benefit, but this, again, just majorly overplays a single issue when it comes to where people tend to move and why.This is a separate issue from the transactional tax, but it's no surprise that Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffen moved to Miami from Seattle and Chicago, respectively, right after Washington and Illinois cranked up taxes on billionaires. Elon Musk moved from California to Texas. Many Silicon Valley types moved from San Francisco to Denver. These billionaires saved tens of billions of dollars on state and local taxes by moving. It's to the point where real estate values in Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, etc. plummeted while Miami, Austin, Denver, and the Southeastern US are rising. The US is nice, but so are international tax havens like the Bahamas, Ireland, Dubai, Singapore, Monaco, New Zealand, etc. It's pretty easy for billionaires to hop on a private jet and move to a mansion in any other part of the world. Many European, Russian, Chinese, Indian, etc. billionaires have done just that. Many of them came to the US, but they're not wedded to this place and are happy to leave. By the way, the next time you watch the Olympic Opening Ceremony, check out the people from the Cayman Islands and similar countries. They're the richest, whitest people I've ever seen, and they're all competing in ultra-fancy sports that I've never even heard of before. No it's not, because it isn't taxing people taking breaths it is taxing high-powered institutional day traders and ultra wealthy investors. Most people wouldn't feel this at all, and again it could even be written in a way to completely exclude a majority of workers' retirement savings.Again, most people aren't dumb. Saying this is a small tax is incredibly insulting to anyone who can do basic math. Politicians who say this are just a scummy as used car dealers who try to get buyers to focus on the affordable monthly payments of a lease rather than the total cost. Come on, buddy. This is ridiculous.Again, the US represents 5% of the global population and 67% of the global stock market. A ton of non-US companies trade in the US. Furthermore, a ton of American companies make most of their money from the 95% of humans who live outside the US. Americans aren't smarter, more hardworking, or otherwise superior compared to any other human. The only reason why so many people from around the world choose to put their money in the US is because of the US's economic efficiency and stability. The US is a bit like a bank. But just becuase you work at a bank doesn't mean everyone else's money is yours. Just because you live in a country where people around the world trust to store their money doesn't mean you're entitled to take their money. If a bank starts raising prices too much, depositors take their money elsewhere. If Americans start taxing people too much, foreigners take their money back home.One of the most fascinating things that happened during Covid-19 is that while every country in the world was faced with a huge economic catastrophe, the US was flooded with money. Countries, corporations, international organizations, etc. were willing to lend money to the US government at a 0% interest rate rather than spend the money at home to help their own citizens. The US government used that windfall partly to send stimulus checks to everyone in America. Americans had a much more comfortable pandemic than everyone else in the world as a result. That's how powerful and trusted the US economy is right now. But trust is something that is hard to gain and easy to lose.","title":"CMV: The risk of capital flight from the United States as a response to higher taxes is overstated."},{"text":"Now they have the possibility of parole.They specifically have life without parole.","title":"Biden commutes death sentences of child killers and mass murderers 2 days before Christmas"},{"text":"Politics and conspiracy are inseparable.

I'm not sure how much I'll be able to follow up as I'm responding during my break, but I'll bite. It sounds like you're saying if anything it's beneficial as it provides an outlet for sexual urges/desires that doesn't involve harming actual children, using the initial conclusion that pedophiles will continue to exist and so this is a better alternative. Do you not suppose that allowing/supporting the indulgence of such desires might lead to those viewing it to want more? People who regularly watch porn and especially those who watch fetish porn tend to need *more* over time. For example, those into BDSM porn will tend to get into heavier BDSM videos over time, etc. I understand the appeal of a 'non harmful' alternative, but I would have concern that making loli porn more socially acceptable (is that the right term here?) would lead to more people being willing to watch it who otherwise might not, whether through curiosity and discovering they enjoy it, or by allowing themselves to view something they hadn't let themselves before since it would become more accessible and more 'okay'.Another thing is that lot of sexual appeal for many things with many people is a sense of taboo around what they are viewing/doing. The more taboo, the more exciting. I'll switch directions and use smoking weed for a separate example. Smoking weed was seen as \\"rebellious\\" and therefore more attractive to disgruntled teens than drinking may be since drinking was more readily accessed and available. After legalization and making it more commonly available and used, it is less \\"taboo/rebellious\\" and doesn't hold the *same level* of appeal to that specific demographic as it would have otherwise. Now back more to your point, I'll reference a different genre of porn: CNC (consensual non-consent). Videos of that kind may attract certain kinds of people and, because it is **consensual**, it is an okay outlet. If someone is able to find a partner who is also into that, it allows for simulation of the act without the exploitation and violation of another person. Someone who is watching those videos may want to try it themselves and then go seek out someone to try it with. A lot of the appeal with CNC as a concept is that *it is **consensual, however.Loli porn and actual CP is..... not. Never is, never can be, should absolutely never be portrayed as such. I posit that if Loli became more widely available and especially if it was seen as more acceptable, it would both introduce more people to indulge in this fetish while simultaneously losing some of it's taboo appeal to those who are especially into the concept *because* of how taboo it is. They know it's wrong, and that's part of the appeal (I assume). Combine that with perpetual viewers of porn needing more and heavier media to get the same levels of pleasure and enjoyment if anything might lead to more people searching out actual CP as they have already allowed themselves to indulge in that conceptual genre. Ik I'm using a slippery slope argument here, but I feel with how porn and sexual desire affects so many individuals in certain ways, it's worth addressing. And beyond searching for actual CP, I mentioned CNC to point out that watching those kinds of videos and being into the concept leads to people wanting to do it themselves, but a big part of CNC appeal is the *consent*. Since loli/CP is inherently nonconsensual, watching those kinds of videos and being into the concept may follow the same trend as CNC of leading people to want to do try it themselves. I need to wrap up so I'll say that you make a very interesting point, and I can understand why you would see things this way from an external position. Sort of like decriminalizing drugs is meant to make it safer to do so, with the understanding that people are going to do drugs regardless. Buuuuuut that sort of thing must be implemented very careful in a very specific way or it leads to situations like Portland, OR where street drug use has ramped up due to it being less legally dangerous to have/do, and the accessibility has led to highly increased levels of heroin/fent users who were introduced to things through accessibility and from there sought out harder substances. Addiction is a dangerous thing to indulge en masse because of how differently it affects people, and porn addiction is a very real thing so should be treated in the same way. Final thought: you make a solid argument, but for this subject I think it would actually make things worse rather than help. Bear in mind, I do not have any desire to watch loli and have no exposure to comments about it or anything like that so some of my statements about appeal and such are complete assumption based on how people view and respond to other things.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"Yeah Ill pass on either one of them","title":"Please Democrats rig your primary again and run Kamala Harris a second time. -Every Republican"},{"text":"Yeah too bad all the voters are traumatized by being lied into a war of aggression, including being lied to by Democratic Party politicians.","title":"Biden is one of our greatest presidents  smears wont tarnish his legacy"},{"text":"In Sweden guns and marksmanship are very much popular, yet they have very few mass shootings or murders.

Essentially, there is an intense desire for something that the person knows is not okay to actually pursue.Everything in neuroscience indicates that reinforcing any kind of maladaptive connection in the brain puts one at risk of acting on and/or repeating that. The general concept is called Hebbian learning C basically, the more you do something, the stronger and quicker that connection is made in your brain. It would never be recommended to a person with SUD experiencing cravings to watch materials of people consuming their drug of choice to \\"let off steam\\" or \\"relieve\\" their desire for it. In fact, you would expect exactly the opposite to occur C that person would be much more likely to relapse.If we apply that same thinking to this kind of porn, everything in neuroscience indicates that consuming any kind of CSAM or its analogues would further reinforce the habits and thought patterns that they are seeking to change. It would be more of a step backward/step toward potential abuse than a step toward recovery.Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most commonly used method (apart from pharmacological interventions) in treating pedophilia iirc, and that would recommend the same course. Its core tenet is identifying and managing thought patterns and behaviors associated with the compulsions, and working to question and change them. Again, according to the principles of CBT, giving these people ways to reinforce maladaptive patterns C even if the materials don't directly harm any children C would not be helping these people in the long term.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"Democrats wont support universal healthcare or government subsidized housing for normal working people.QED.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"For 2, the issue is human traffickers, not the porn, but I understand the concernFor 3, the law distinguishes between realistic portrayals of children and stylized ones, realistic ones are in fact still considered CPFor 1 I have heard this argument a lot, but it comes off as a \\"Video games make ya violent\\" sort of argument.

Animated child pornography/similar child content that has an explicit sexual nature (I will call it child pornography for the rest of this but you get the point) has no victims and\\n2. Animated child pornography helps those who are attracted to children with no adverse effects.For the first point I think there is little to discuss, yes no children are harmed in the making of animated child pornography. But your second point is not necessarily true.From the last time this came up, the main points to take in consideration are this:1. There is no strong proof that pedophiles will actual just consume animated child pornography to release their urges and will cause them to not view actual child pornography. There is even a chance it can be a stepping stone to acquiring actual child pornography. And mainstream access to less extreme context like lolicon can be an initial stepping stone to continue down the hole of content before reaching actual child pornography. \\n2. While this form of content may not be entirely sexual and all its fans may not be adult pedophiles (for example a shota about two twelve year old boys will probably also have fans who are. Twelve year old girls) the community will still be mainly an adult pedophile group, and fan sites/discussion boards can end up basically being a meeting ground for pedophiles to find each other. This part is really bad because this can end up with these people joining communities of pedophiles who share animated and real child pornography.So I think theres two parts: is this content victimless? Yes. Is this content without issue? No. I think having it be mainstream is an issue because of the issues it can cause, but I think your point that if a pedophile chooses to engage with animated child pornography they may not be doing anything wrong but normalizing it as a whole does have adverse consequences and you should not be able to buy this content at the store or be shamed for believing bookstores/manga stores shouldnt carry it. Content like this will continue to exist in a background manner even if it is not normalized as well, so its not like making it not available to buy at stores/ online at retailers will cause it to disappear anyway, but it will make the second part of the issues I brought up disappear.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"This also is my argument against the death penalty, too.The mixed standards create the system of having the worst of both worlds.

Widespread access to pornography, and the nature of a competitive, saturated, market, have made it so that to chase better $, porn stars seek out more extreme / taboo forms of sex. This, in turn, leads to more extreme consumption, and unrealistic expectations (consider how much porn is ~ \\"hardcore\\", or \\"stepX\\"). A concrete example is teens who are groomed. Despite this obviously being abhorrent, it can really affect your future views of sex (i.e being submissive in later relationships if you're groomed by a dom)\\nLoli / Shota, for the most part, is much *less* about the physical age, and much *more* about the perceived extreme power dynamic. Consumption of such pornography can therefore make mental pathways that connect power play to pleasure, and normalize things that we can clearly tell are abhorrent (is like how you know a horror movie is bad).\\nThere's a lot of examples we have where media (all media) affects what we perceive as attractive, normal, etc. For example - smooth skin (not natural, requires shaving), slender / hourglass figures, sewing cutesy demure characters like princesses, seeing manly or flirty men like Iron man, etc. The hypothesis that someone can become a pedophile by *nurture* isn't something you can toss out easily.\\n(2) Human traffickers and groomers use pornography as teaching material for their victims. The manga art style can make this more accessible and understandable by victims.\\n(3) Illustrations *can* mimic real life people, and affect them - like how deep fake porn can hurt people irl. Just like how a hentai can have \\"XX years old\\" for plausible deniability, it could also feature someone's likeness, and disclaimer it as a coincidence.\\nNow, whether or not these downsides outweigh the upsides (artistic freedom, victimless sexual gratification for no offending pedophiles, etc) is up for debate.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"Delete this shit.

There are times that Trump will say something asinine about something that doesn't really matter and, yes, I will get frustrated by MSNBC spending a whole segment going on about it. There are lots of cases where neither mockery nor pearl clutching is the best response to Trump's off-hand remarks. He's both an inveterate bullshitter and an attention whore.

Fact-checking obvious nonsense doesn't help clear the air- it just turns most voters off from the conversation and they leave thinking he can't get a fair assessment (even if the assessment is fair).\\n* It keeps him centered in the conversation and often, on his terms- even if criticizing him.

And its reasonable to believe that most polls have [modestly underestimated](https://old.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1guapvm/harris_would_be_top_candidate_in_cas/lxsyi76/?context=1) his popularity.Regarding your second point, that Democrats should be shooting for a supermajority instead of a bare majority of the two-party vote, I agree in principle. But its not clear to me what the Harris campaign and the DNC should have done differently. Whether its going on Rogan, being more unequivocal in her support for Israel (or more critical), running ads expressing support for banning trans female athletes and restrictions on transition care for teenagers, being more populist (or more business-friendly), etc. theres always a plausible counterargument. In the end, the Harris campaign [walked back](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-now-backing-away-several-far-left-stances-she-once-promoted) her positions (or at least lip service) during the primary in 2019, and campaigned tough on the border and [in vibes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4yxe2xxzdo).It wasnt enough, of course, although it surely helped keep the House as historically close as it was and for Democratic candidates to win five of the six statewide races in the battleground states, as they either werent incumbents or didnt seem to be hurt like the presidential incumbent was.My assertion: if Democratic candidates across the country run like this again in 2026, and the nominee in 2028 does as well, well take back the presidency and the House.

There is (and has always been) left-leaning critique of illegal immigration, plainly because initially immigrants and \\"the poor\\"  both compete for state assisted housing and also for similar jobs, depressing wages. \\\\[But we could always quibble if and to which degree this critique is appropriate today.\\\\]Usually, right-leaning critique of immigration is - different. There is a lot of xenophobic and plainly racist attacks against immigrants from the right (often with little regard if they're actually illegal immigrants or legal ones). Broad attacks against \\"brown\\" people, any woman wearing a hijab, or pretending all illegal immigrants are criminals (see how convenient it is that illegal entry is a crime? Now every illegal immigrant is a criminal!). And let's be honest here - you yourself list far-right parties surging in popularity because of their (disgusting) anti-immigrant positions.

Certainly. I would also argue that the 2020 Democratic party discussing to decriminalize (and make it a civil offense) illegal border crossings is still to the right of the 2015 CDU position. And the Democrats failure in 2011 under Obama to get all of their senators to support the DREAM Act \\\\[who are only in the US illegally by no fault of their own\\\\] would also be to the right to any reasonable party in Europe at that time.

In fact, I think I agree that when it comes to platform and ideals, the American left-wing isn't that far off from much of Europe's. And I think this brings me to my favorite point of your argument, your point on the difference between the parliamentary system and our filibustered-based senate.I think the structure of how our government works makes the Democratic **function** more center-right. It may be left-leaning in theory, but more centrist in practice.This is partly because the Democrats have such a wide branch of coalitions they serve, each of which often has opposing interests. What's more is that norms in Washington which were put in place to uphold a fair system of checks and balances were just that.... norms. And as a result had no real teeth in making sure that fair distribution of power among elected officials happened in a way that accurately represented the electorate. See the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Because it's harder for Democrats to solidify power when their base is not as uniform and easy to tap into as the GOP base, Republicans have been able to better exploit those norms to help lock Democrats out out of institutional power and to use our government's institutional structure to favor a more reactionary political party that seeks to preserve the status-quo.This is where right-leaning Democrats like Manchin and Sinema hold a lot of sway in party leadership because of how fragile the Democratic stronghold on power is that it is easier for center-leaning Democrats to hold left-leaning policy hostage in service of their more purple voting base.So yes, ideas from Democrats can be often very left-leaning, but those ideas don't just come out of nowhere. They emerge from concrete systems and real-life contexts, and while Democrats can talk all they want about passing left-leaning policy, actually getting to turn the keys which will allow that policy to come to fruition and define their party is a different story.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"Is someone investigating the incidences of colorectal cancer in the federal prison system?","title":"Joe Biden commutes sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates"},{"text":"Biden represents the old view of Israel as a moral democracy and useful US ally.I'm not sure why you'd call the country \\"Netanyahu's\\" Israel, it's readily apparent that Bibi isn't responsible for Israel's genocide and war crimes.

The historical debate is about whether Jesus was a historical figure, a myth, or a blend of both. Historians widely agree that a man named Jesus likely existed, but claims about miracles and divinity move beyond history into theology, which requires a different kind of evidence. Churches, anecdotes, and disciples dont necessarily prove divinitytheyre evidence of belief, not the reality of supernatural events.Humans are indeed remarkable, but our dominance can be explained through natural processes like evolution, intelligence, and social cooperation. Remarkable does not necessarily mean divine. Using human uniqueness as evidence for God assumes that uniqueness must have purpose or intent, which isnt necessarily the case.Also boiling it down to a choice between God did it or No God creates a false dichotomy. The possibilities for the universes origin are vast, potentially even infinite. Just because we dont know how the universe came to be doesnt mean the answer must fit into one of these two categories. , its not about dismissing God, but about acknowledging the vastness of the unknown and avoiding the assumption that one explanation is inherently more valid without sufficient evidence. scientific understanding works independently of belief in Godit observes, tests, and explains phenomena based on evidence.Atheists typically reject the God hypothesis not because they claim to disprove it, but because no compelling evidence has been presented for it. Dismissing a claim due to lack of evidence is not the same as asserting the opposite claim. The default position isnt belief in God or disbeliefits I dont know until theres evidence.Finally accepting something or \\"belief\\" is not a choice.

Secondary markets is all trading among investors, it does not provide any cash flow to companies. The liquidity of stocks in the secondary market is an important part of a capitalist system, but I see no reason why taxing on the trades themselves would have significant impact or cost on any but the wealthiest investors. As a small percentage of a trade, it wouldn't add much cost to the everyday working person, and exceptions could even be made for, say, retirement accounts. Some people/companies end up with too too much moneyThat's what we have now. and others who need money end up with too littleAgain, that's exactly what we have now, and taxing secondary market transactions wouldn't affect the IPOs, which is where companies actually raise funding from issuing stocks. In the end, youre just creating more inequality.I don't think you adequately showed how. it rewards dumb people who are already richHow, exactly? The biggest and perhaps *only* reason the US economy is so attractive to people around the world is that financial markets are efficient.I'm sorry, what? You're so far up the butt of the finance world you seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day, businesses must serve a real purpose for people, and the US economy is so large for a few key reasons: it is the 3rd largest country in the world by population; that population (in the aggregate, at least) is quite rich and so consumes a lot; the US government has for some time been the lone Superpower with huge expenditures not only on its military but also on domestic programs that contribute to the economy; and finally, because so much wealth is concentrated here, the US market performs better than other stock markets, including those of other industrialized modern countries, so even *foreign* working-class investors put the bulk of their investable savings into US stocks, acting as an additional feedback vehicle for growth. The liquidity of the capital markets and the favorable treatment of them by our laws of course contributes to this, but to suggest that a lack of taxation or making the most derivative and abstract transactions easier to execute is the *main* reason, or perhaps the *only* reason is so void of coherence it's shocking that this currently one of the top comments to be honest. A financial transaction tax directly kills liquidity and stability. This is grossly overstating the impact a small tax would make. Just hyperbolic nonsense intended to shut down any meaningful discussion. A ton of people on Wall Street have already left New York and Chicago for Miami to avoid state taxes. A lot of old and wealthy people in the US have been migrating to Florida for basically as long as it's been a state. I'm sure the tax situation is viewed as a benefit, but this, again, just majorly overplays a single issue when it comes to where people tend to move and why. Its not modest in the slightest. Its like charging people just 1% of 1 pennyfor every breath they take.No it's not, because it isn't taxing *people taking breaths* it is taxing high-powered institutional day traders and ultra wealthy investors. Most people wouldn't feel this at all, and again it could even be written in a way to completely exclude a majority of workers' retirement savings.The US government depends far more on financial institutions than the other way around.Nope. Could not be more incorrect here. This is just pure wishful thinking. The US dollar is created, controlled, and stabilized by the federal government. The military hegemony has ensured this for some time through pursuits such as the security of trade routes, particularly for oil but other goods benefit from that as well. The US legal system girds up the capitalist system, and literally down to using police to threaten, intimidate, and bully striking workers or even democratic protests to suppress ideas and criticisms of both government and corporate practices.

The two systems couldnt be more different in both how theyre structured and how they function.First off, the German private system exerts serious monopsony power over prices. Were talking drug prices, procedure prices, and everything else across the board. The private insurers in Germany dont get to operate freely like American ones dotheyre heavily regulated with risk-sharing requirements, profit caps, and other interventions that the U.S. doesnt even attempt, not in degree or kind. To act like theyre equivalent is just hand-waving away these crucial differences.And lets be clear: the majority of Germans arent even covered by the private system. Over 70% of Germans are covered by Statutory Health Insurance (SHI), not private insurance. So its not just a minor quirk of their systemits the foundation. Private insurance in Germany is supplemental for most people or only an option for a small subset of higher-income earners and certain professions.On top of that, the German government invests way more in healthcare staffing. They train more doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers per capita than the U.S. does, and it shows. Their staffing levels are way higher, which directly impacts access and quality of care. For example, Germany has around 4.5 physicians per 1,000 people compared to the U.S., where its closer to 2.6. Thats a huge difference.So yeah, saying the German private system is similar to the American one is kind of like saying Mario Party is similar to the Bolshevik Partythey might share a word, but they operate on entirely different principles.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"Imo, the entirety of US politics is much further to the right than it is in some of its peers thus giving the illusion that the Dems (the only \\"left leaning\\" party in American politics) are more to the right than they might otherwise be.

Absolutely. All wars are caused by greed, at their root cause. The increased exposure to the outbreak of a new war is not a result of the lack of political experience on the part of the newer generations: it is because the really greedy, sociopathic ones in the new generation have yet to personally see the logical outcome of excessive greed, and thus think that they are smart enough to get away with continually going for more.Even our current crop of exceptionally greedy people are all too young to have personally seen the heads of the previous crop of the overly-greedy displayed on pikes at the gates to the city- that's how we got to where we are now. I think that such direct exposure is the *only* human experience that can partially overpower greed: the sure knowledge that *there are limits* to how much one can fleece the world, beyond which one tends to get very dramatically and painfully dead at the hands of the fleece-ees. Simply saying something Clintonesque like \\"Knock it off!\\" won't do: there needs to be *carnage*, up close and very personal, for that learning to occur.I suspect that we are coming, at long last, into a new era of heads-on-pikes. The late CEO of the insurance company was just the first. The bad thing about times like this, of course, is that there tend to be thousands of times more non-greedy, unwilling participant heads that end up on pikes in the process.

However, the greedy sociopaths would do well to remember that pacifists like me are in rather short supply.","title":"Do wars repeat themselves due to generational gaps in the transmission of knowledge?

This reveals the circular logic: any change to market structure is defined as instability simply because its change. By this definition, any tax reform would violate the rule of law - an obviously absurd position that would make democratic governance impossible.The London comparison is especially revealing of their rhetorical strategy.

Anyone who wants to point out Schwarzenegger is missing both how much time has passed since then and that the current GOP has shifted pretty far from where he was.As far as California (and other blue states) actually being red if only the cities that make up most of the population don't vote...state's partisan lean changes if the majority of the population do not vote.

The police had already been called from the bar, and were on their way to the apartment and were able to arrest him before he actually killed her and me in her womb. He was originally given a sentence most would think too lenient and the family of the man he killed originally asked for the death penalty (which is still legal where the murder occurred). He was released after 10 years, but broke parole, and then wound up back inside. Released again, ended up back inside. When he went back the third time he went back and wanted to actually get reformed. He stopped smoking. He stopped drinking. He decided to take advantage of all of the programmes they offer inmates so he could actually get mental health help for the problems he had that lead him to why he was in their in the first place. He's in counseling now, and he's found Buddhism. He knows he can't undo all of the things he has done to the people whose lives he's ruined, but should we ruin someone else's life, too? It's not on us to take away someone else's life. No matter what they've done. The prison system needs reform, but I have seen firsthand that if someone is willing to work on themselves they can do better.

What borrowers should know"},{"text":"The critique about transaction flight still misses several key points:1. The idea that market making would completely migrate overseas ignores the regulatory reality of U.S. securities markets. Any entity making markets in U.S. securities for U.S. investors would still be subject to SEC oversight and regulation. The notion that major U.S. institutions could simply route all their trading through foreign venues to avoid the tax overestimates the regulatory flexibility they have.2. Even if some high-frequency market making migrates offshore, this doesnt necessarily harm market quality as severely as suggested. Many major markets functioned with higher spreads historically, and evidence from other countries with FTTs suggests that while spreads do widen, markets remain functional. The question isnt whether spreads would increase - they would - but whether the revenue benefits outweigh the costs of moderately reduced liquidity.3. You implicitly assume current levels of market making and liquidity are optimal or necessary. But theres growing evidence that excessive liquidity and high-frequency trading can actually increase market instability through flash crashes and feedback loops. Some reduction in pure arbitrage trading might lead to more robust markets.4. Most importantly, this critique ignores the possibility of policy design that maintains market function while capturing revenue. For instance, the tax could be graduated based on holding period, with lower rates for genuine market making activities. Market makers already receive preferential treatment in many aspects of market structure - this could be extended to the FTT.The core issue isnt whether a FTT would affect market structure - it would - but whether we can design it to preserve essential market functions while reducing purely extractive trading activity. The experience of other jurisdictions suggests this is possible with careful policy design.?","title":"CMV: The risk of capital flight from the United States as a response to higher taxes is overstated."},{"text":"It seems like a pretty simple case of 'these crimes are so egregious i'm not including them'And in those lists of crimes he *didn't include literal mass rape/murder of children?*Are you serious?","title":"Biden commutes sentences of 37 of 40 federal death row inmates to life in prison without possibility of parole"},{"text":"I dont think the position is inherently bad.

This situation wasn't deliberately and consciously created, and no one likes it.There are three factors: 1) the tradition and legal infrastructure of capital punishment 2) a lot of people are against capital punishment and either want to get rid of it, or at least try to make it more humane (good luck!), and try to make sure  those sentenced get the maximum legal due process 3) those who like capital punishment just fine or want more of it.  If those in favor of 2) got their way, there'd be no death penalty.  It was like that for a while.  When and where 3) prevails, like....Texas!  They kill them whenever they can.Neither party likes it this way.  (I'm not talking about Republican or Democrat; I mean pro- vs. anti- capital punishment).  One side would like to do away with the death penalty.  The other side would like to do away with most of the legal protections so we could hurry up and kill people.  The illogical situation where hardly anyone gets executed, except in Texas and a few other red states, but quite a few are on death row, is the result of a stalemate.  Also, while there is some desire to kill, and a lot of tradition and structure for it, there is this desire to make it more \\"humane\\"-- traditional methods like hanging are out; lethal injection is in fashion, but the drug companies and the medical profession want no part of it, so a lot of the fighting is about that.There is a death row because people get sentenced to death but then resist the sentence through legal appeals, which can take decades, or executions can't be done because the drugs aren't available, etc..  Whether Trump could or would somehow manage to kill all those prisoners, I have no.idea.  I don't see how he could do anything with an executive order, or even a federal law or a single court decision. What he can do is nominate more right-wing judges who are more friendly to capital punishment, so it gradually gets easier to kill.If Biden actually did all these acts of clemency for the purpose of stopping Trump from killing them, or just to stop executions on moral/ethical grounds, he should have commuted or pardoned all of them.

Let's start with space:  \\n\\\\- astronomers and physicists have confirmed that gravity is the result of curvature in spacetime  \\n\\\\-this shows that spacetime is connected to matter and energy, not simply an empty void through which matter traverses.   \\n\\\\-reversing the expanding universe shrinks matter, energy, and the interwoven fabric of spacetime, all into a single point, the singularity.Now time:  \\n\\\\-Einsteins theory also predicted the phenomenon of time dilation  \\n\\\\-the passage of time appears slower at high velocity / high gravity relative to an observer at lower velocity or gravity (this phenomenon is explored in the movie *Interstellar,* for example)  \\n\\\\-again, scientists have confirmed and observed this phenomenon  \\n\\\\-cosmologists can calculate the amount of time dilation for a given velocity / gravity   \\n\\\\-as we hypothetically reverse the expanding universe back to the singularity, gravity becomes so intense, and time dilation becomes so extreme, that it slows down to infinity. This means something like: the first nanosecond of the big bang, if it would be possible to observe from our relative position, would take trillions of years to go by. The closer you get to the singularity, the more extreme the time dilation, into infinite density and dilation, at which point the laws of physics break down, but for all intents and purposes, from our perspective, time slows to a stop.

While this would represent a significant change in market structure, particularly for high-frequency trading, the revenue potential is immense given the massive daily volume of financial transactions.This is the worst type of tax possible. The whole point of capital markets is to allocate capital to the person who can most effectively use it at any moment. Its like how basketball players pass the ball to whoever is best able to ensure that the team is able to score more points. The more you charge people for stock trades, the less people pass the ball. Some people/companies end up with too too much money and others who need money end up with too little. Markets become less *efficient.In the end, youre just creating more inequality. And its the worst kind of inequality because it rewards dumb people who are already rich over smart poor people with good ideas. Capital flight concerns often treat global finance as if it operates purely on mathematical optimization of tax rates, but this overlooks the deep structural advantages and institutional power the United States holds in the global financial system. Heres why the risk is likely overstated:The biggest and perhaps *only* reason the US economy is so attractive to people around the world is that financial markets are efficient. Anything that hurts that is harmful.  The dollars role as the global reserve currency gives U.S. financial markets unparalleled liquidity and stability. This status is deeply entrenched through the petrodollar system and the dominance of dollar-denominated international trade. When most global transactions ultimately need to clear in dollars, theres a natural gravitational pull toward U.S. financial institutions.A financial transaction tax directly kills liquidity and stability.  The Federal Reserves position as the de facto central bank of the world economy became clear during the 2008 financial crisis and again during the COVID-19 pandemic, when dollar swap lines proved crucial for global financial stability. This creates strong incentives for major financial institutions to maintain robust U.S. operations to ensure access to Fed facilities and dollar liquidity.Thats because the US doesnt have the tax you proposed. New Yorks role as a global financial command center brings network effects that are difficult to replicate elsewhere. The concentration of expertise, supporting services (legal, accounting, consulting), and decision-making power creates an ecosystem that reinforces itself. Moving operations to tax havens like Dublin or Luxembourg means giving up these advantagesA ton of people on Wall Street have already left New York and Chicago for Miami to avoid state taxes.  Beyond pure economics, the U.S. offers unparalleled political stability and rule of law. The U.S. legal system, particularly New York state courts, is the preferred venue for complex financial disputes globally. This institutional trust took centuries to build and isnt easily replicated.The US recently took Russian money and gave it to Ukraine. Now everyone around the world knows that the US will steal your money if you irritate them. Similarly, American citizens will vote to raise taxes on you and take your money if you store money in the US.  The proposed 0.5% financial transaction tax is modest compared to these structural advantages. While it may affect some high-frequency trading strategies, its unlikely to fundamentally alter the calculus for major financial institutions whose operations are deeply embedded in the U.S. system.Its not modest in the slightest. Its like charging people just 1% of 1 pennyfor every breath they take. Moreover, the idea that financial institutions can simply leave the U.S. market oversimplifies their relationship with American power. Major financial institutions are not just profit-maximizing entities but are deeply intertwined with U.S. geopolitical influence. They benefit from U.S. military and diplomatic power protecting global trade routes and enforcing property rights worldwide.The US government depends far more on financial institutions than the other way around. Money funds politicians and military power, which benefits financial institutions. But if the government gets too big and tries to take money from financial institutions, theyll pull just pull out the money. Governments lose the funding for their militaries. Power comes from the people, not from god.  The experience of other financial centers supports this view. London maintained its position as a global financial hub despite higher tax rates than competing jurisdictions. What mattered more was its regulatory environment, institutional depth, and network effects.It didnt though. A ton of global money went to the US after Brexit. Same thing applies to Hong Kong after Xi cracked down on Jack Ma. Germanys biggest bank is struggling and one of Switzerlands biggest banks went bankrupt outright. This isnt to say that tax rates dont matter at all - they do. But treating them as the decisive factor ignores the complex web of advantages that make the U.S. financial system unique. The risk of capital flight is real but manageable, especially for modest tax increases that dont fundamentally alter the United States competitive position.?Theres a ton of liberal capitalist democracies in the world now. They copied the stuff that made the US successful and are now often doing those things even better than America. Politicians like Biden, Sanders, and Trump are taking the USs position for granted. Theyre implementing policies that Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama would never have done. Thats hurting the USs reputation for economic efficiency and stability on the global stage. Some other countries are worse right now, but many others are better.

Influencing is unavoidable and therefore fine; but I'd like to see secular reasons in support of ideas.  A robust exchange of ideas and careful deliberation before deciding how to proceed forming a more perfect union. Most of the founders were deists.  Thomas Jefferson, for instance, wrote a version of the Bible devoid of any reference to divinity. Thomas Payne called Christianity, \\"a fable\\".  Benjamin Franklin denied the existence of a personal god, in favor of what he terms, \\"nature's God\\"; a phrase which exists on the Declaration of Independence.  They were, to be sure, influenced by various forms of Christianity.  As am I; an agnostic raised protestant.  I'm more than willing to support a good idea but I don't believe those are supported by faith without reason. Those ideas belong in churches. There's plenty of reason to have hope.  You could read Jonathan Glover's Humanity - A Moral History of the 20th Century or Harvard Professor Stephen Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined if you're interested in moral progress.

Simple as.There are already lower court rulings that death sentences imposed by states can only be commuted to life with parole. Attorneys are 100% going to try to invoke this as precedent to challenge their clients parole ineligibility. Evidence is also lost and prosecution witnesses die or disappear. I dont think the death penalty should necessarily be imposed on a Texas-style, you try, we fry basis but the barbarity, lack of remorse, and overwhelming evidence of guilt in some of these cases more than warrant the permanence of execution even if the appellate process is more expensive than lifetime incarceration.

The question comes down to: who was Trump referring to with the \\"very fine people\\" comment? He said not the white supremacists and neo-nazis, so who?One answer could be that he was referring to non-white supremacist conservatives at the rally, but I reject that answer because in all this time no one has been able to point to a single person at that rally who wasn't a white supremacist. The rally was organized by white supremacists and advertised white supremacist speakers, that's who was there.So another answer could be that he thought there were some regular conservatives there and was just mistaken. But that's hard to believe too because these comments were made several days later after his initial refusal to condemn anyone blew up.Then finally we come to what I think is the obvious truth: Trump knew it was a white supremacist rally, and lied about there being very fine people there. Why would he do this? Well white supremacists have been trying to legitimize themselves for a while, calling themselves ethno-nationalists or whatever and distancing themselves from the \\"nazi\\" label. I believe Trump was referring to this group: effectively white supremacists who are pretending they are not. There's even evidence for this in his comments (that Snopes decided to ignore): There were people in that rally  and I looked the night before  if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.The night before was the Tiki torch rally, where they chanted \\"jews will not replace us\\". I don't think there's an argument that they weren't white supremacists.So in summary, I believe trumps \\"very fine people\\" comment referred to the group of white supremacists who weren't actively carrying nazi flags, and therefore it's still accurate to say he called white supremacists very fine people, even though he pretended to condemn them.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump cant have them executed"},{"text":"So the last photo, is saying that these floors were all emptied?'\\nWe know these floors were emptied and painted with thermite'","title":"A month before 9/11, this pictures were taken"},{"text":"It's \\"funny\\" cause the early christian church recognized transgender saints https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2020/12/12/little-known-history-transgender-saintshttps://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/12/5-saints-reveal-surprising-history-transgender-acceptance-early-christianity/","title":"Democrats Cant Hide From the Culture War"},{"text":"As headlines swirl that Trump may continue to support Ukraine.

After all, if God is real, wouldnt it make sense that His creation could also be understood through the lens of science?Ultimately, I find atheistic logic lacking in this regard.

That's affecting hundreds of millions of people.Edit: Sure, as a society we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, addressing both issues, but from a messaging standpoint, which is what this article is about, it very much matters what you're emphasizing. The biggest problem is that 1% of the country owns 30% of the wealth. That's a huge imbalance that leads to tremendous suffering.

I thought it was mostly an economic message. Kamala will happily fund gender-affirming surgeries for foreign criminals, while hard-working citizens struggle, etc. It's an out of touch party focusing on the priorities of the elite and virtue signaling while anyone who earns less than 50k a year (half the population) struggles.Check the surveys, like 80% of the population barely keep up with the news. Voters cite inflation and immigration as their main reasons for voting Trump over Kamala. This swung the election, but with only a 2 million vote difference in an anti-incumbent year, Dubya had more in 2004.The voters, while not complete idiots, aren't informed enough to grasp why tariffs = bad and Trump = authoritarian = bad.The scenes of chaos at the border a few years ago hurt a lot. People aren't as racist as we'd think. They just want a sense of control over the border. Look at Brexit. It reduced EU migration and increased non-EU migration. You'd think the racists wouldn't like that, but since Parliament was now in charge rather than the Eurocrats...Then, there's the discomfort from inflation. It sticks with people more and outweighs wage increases. All while the party viewed as big spenders and bad on the economy was in power. The party irresponsibly spent too much,[ maintained tariffs](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/china-tariffs-biden-trump/index.html), and worsened inflation, with a disproportionate effect on working class Americans. They were then punished for this, so democracy works?The voters aren't evil. They're just moderately uninformed, and didn't buy the Trump is a fascist, vote for me thing. Which, seeing Kamala congratulate Trump after having called him a fascist... It makes me feel like I'm the idiot for having bought it. If they actually think he's a fascist, why congratulate him and invite him to the White House?So, to win it back, just tack to the center and become Bill Clinton. The people crave a charismatic, tough on crime Democrat. One that doesn't screw up the economy like a protectionist succ. Give them that, bomb misbehaving countries rather than acting like a coward, and they'll feel everything is going great again.","title":"How can we bridge the cultural gap between neoliberals and the median voter?"},{"text":"And you wonder why the Bernie bros dont quietly fall in line.

Islam is an Abrahamic faith, essentially a new iteration of Christianity/Judaism, which both have rules regarding depictions of certain things, especially those that are holy. Think of Jewish restrictions on drawing god, or how Christianity at certain times/places restricted depictions of Jesus. This is likely just a shared quirk of the Abrahamic religions, borne from pre-Abrahamic customs/culture making its way into later religious practice, which is a common theme in any religion. There are different symbolic meanings behind approaches for covering the Prophet's face. Islam made it all the way to India and Persia, causing for example, fire (a motif used in the region to depict holiness) to be a common choice for covering his face/the face of important Imams in certain regions (Imams are essentially Islamic priests with very deep knowledge of Islamic law/scripture). This can look scary but is not intended to be. In this particular case, intentionally or unintentionally, the veil covering his face is likely symbolic of Muhammad's real life practices during the writing of the Quran. It was written largely during a period of conflict between Muhammad and the first Muslims with nearby city-states, shortly after he began cultivating a following. It began with discrimination against Muslims in Mecca, the founding city of Islam, where they were forced to move to Medina. They then gathered an army and later returned to Mecca to capture it, which they successfully did. Muhammad and Islam/the Quran were intrinsically angling at politics and the role of the state, in a region where centralized states were small, usually inadequate, and sparse (scattered city-states and powerful pastoralist tribes, mostly). Muhammad was a prophet, but also a brilliant and calculated statesman trying to build a government. This is repeatedly shown in the Quran, where he describes how his followers ought to speak with him during their trials at Medina and Mecca. He used a tradition shared by Persia, a nearby state with long-standing cultural diffusion in Arabia at the time of Muhammad, which was to have his throne behind a veil, where followers could approach and speak to him through it. Though this particular art might have him behind a veil as a convenient way to cover his face, the Persian veil tradition is certainly part of it somewhere down the cultural line. The Quran is best understood as religious scripture mixed with political philosophy. Muhammad prioritized pragmatism, and taking advantage of shared pre-Islamic traditions in Arabia. He used the Arabic language to this end, mandating that the Quran is to be read and written in Arabic, creating a following that was uncommonly literate and capable of spreading the gospel. As Islam turned into an empire hurtling across the equator, practices of (relative, for the time) tolerance towards other cultures and religions was practiced, another shared attribute with the Persians. The Quran also lays out exact details of divorce law, inheritance, property ownership, and other aspects of government. These kinds of things are far more emphasized and couched in the role of the state than any other Abrahamic scripture, which is why you see Islamic law ruling entire countries. He was the first (and maybe only) human being in history to create a centralized government in the most de-centralized region on earth, and the Quran serves almost like a field manual for how he did it, you just have to read between the lines. It's an excellent book, I highly recommend reading it and the surrounding history.","title":"Merry Christmas to all liberals of the world, united across faith, culture, and geography in love for liberty and universal civil rights &lt;3"},{"text":"This is why we dont let people get this rich","title":"Elon Musk said he plans to fund \\"moderate candidates\\" to challenge Democrats in safe seats."},{"text":" the whipping requiredThere was no lever available to put pressure on either of those two.

College-educated voters are voters with more secure and higher-paid employment and are more proximate to the good economy that this sub is always talking about.

Really spend some time marinating in the inherent injustice in it.That's just the life expectancy gap. I'm not even talking about economic outcomes. I'm suggesting that being insulated from these disparities can make college educated voters unwilling or incapable of engaging in solidarity with working-class voters. Graduating from college can leave a person with a sense, not just that they've earned their place in the economic order, but that those who did not make the same choices as them ALSO earned their place in the economic order.Over Thanksgiving, I started playing a few More Perfect Union videos (their Dollar General one and Right to Repair one in particular) and my very rural family ate them up like candy. It's one of the few times I ever felt on the same page with my conservative family politically.

I understand there are corrupt bargains with the government where organizations essentially steal money from the taxpayer, but best I can tell nothing like that happened with Tesla. The US government wanted to foster new clean energy alternatives, and that's why they gave Tesla a loan (which they paid back I think), acting like it was some handout is a little silly. If you're talking about clean energy credits, then sure, but again we're in favor of that kind of thing I thought.","title":"Liberalism not socialism"},{"text":"Exactly, if you complained about the scene in Endgame with all the female heroes you apparently hated women, even though it ruined the pacing of that part of the final battle (this isnt anywhere near the worst example of shoehorned in stuff, its just a prevalent example from a movie everyone saw)There are plenty of examples of doing woke stuff in a well executed way that doesnt detract from the story like Arcane and Spider-verse, but if you bring up that the problem is bad writing, the left will rip you to shreds because youre apparently not allowed to criticize media thats diverse.
