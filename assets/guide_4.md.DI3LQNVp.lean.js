Fewer people will sign up, and more will cancel their coverage.Remember all of the griping during the 2019 tax season when people got a lot smaller refunds or even owed taxes for 2018 after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect and withholding was revised to make people more or less break even? Having to repay half a year or more of subsidies, somewhere between $375 and $3150, would force most people who owed that much into a short-term (180 days or less)  repayment plan with the IRS if they didn't want to charge the extra tax on a credit card.

Jews have long been Democratic voters - the majority of demonimations heavily value education and are wary of Republican support for things like prayer in schools and Christian narionalism. Overall, Jews voted 3-1 for Harris, significantly higher than the white population. But among the Hasidic (the ultra-orthodox), Trump beat Harris, due to support for Israel and general Hasidic opposition to secular values.We should not be sticking up for any of these people, they've shown they are ready to vote for the opposition for whatever reason. Talib should frankly be booted from the Democratic causus for failing to endorse Harris. And never again should we give this community a second thought - they were willing to burn everything to the ground over a temper tantrum.

If someone causes wrongdoings upon you, anger will motivate you to correct those wrongs.

Plus immigrants on these visas are more vulnerable making them less likely to push back against illegal or unethical actions by their employer.","title":"Elon Musk Warns 'Hateful, Unrepentant Racists' Will Be the 'Downfall of the Republican Party' as MAGA Immigration Debate Intensifies"},{"text":"But context and analyzing the past is the most reliable way to predict future events.

That Americans do not have the education to fill the tech jobs, but in my experience Americans are the most talented engineers, some companies exploit loopholes in programs like H-1B visas to prioritize lower-cost foreign labor over genuine talent. This undermines the integrity of the system and can lead to qualified candidates, including domestic talent, being overlooked. Also, H-1B visa holders often arrive in the U.S. with high-paying jobs and no credit history, which can give them an unintended advantage in the housing market.

Like you have a job opening in the midwest, but everyone qualified is looking for jobs in California. So do you work harder to convince the Californian to relocate? Or do you try to train more people local in that state to be qualified? Or do you move the job, or perhaps allow the Californian to work remotely? Or do you hire an H1B, because they will be more willing to relocate to anywhere in the US, since it gets them a foot in the door towards permanent residency?See, for every scenario, there are multiple possible solutions. The policy for the past few decades has been to trust employers to decide if H1Bs are the best solution, but clearly they are often making choices that do not benefit Americans.So we need to take some of that discretion away from employers, but because there are so many different scenarios to consider, its hard to craft a one-size-fits-all policy.","title":"Trump supports immigration visas backed by Musk: I have many H-1B visas on my properties"},{"text":"This maga infighting is delicious.

We believe we were a people before our God came to us, and people are inherently complex. Good things are good things, regardless of a godly design or thought. There's an extremely strong emphasis in Judaism on individual and collective responsibilities, not to achieve brownie points with a deity, but rather for the benefit of all humanity and all life. It's irrelevant whether the person you show respect to is Jewish or not. Moreover, the teachings of Judaism (and this is not proselytizing, because we don't do that, either) heavily emphasize that the highest forms of good deeds are ones you do not benefit at all from, other than perhaps benefitting from the general betterment of the world. We are not meant to do good things for the benefit of a god or our relationship to a god, we are meant to do good things *simply because they are good.*Moreover, as your claim of Jewish afterlife putting non-Jews into contrast: it might interest you to know that Jews do not have a general concept about the afterlife, save for that all are welcome. No strings attached. The concept of the \\"chosen people\\" as it is represented in media is a Christian invention. Jews believe we were 'chosen' (and, by the way, after God went to literally every other group of people and they said no) to follow a set of rules designed to better ourselves and better the world. We have specific commandments that we only expect other Jews to follow, and there is no judgment that non-Jews do not do these things. Why would they? They are not Jews, and that is fine. Everyone is meant to be who they are meant to be. Why would someone not being a Jew make them inferior to me? That makes no sense! I think your perception of Jews and Judaism comes from an intensely Christian and intensely warped perspective. The simplified version of our holy book: *Do unto others as you wish other would do unto you. The rest is commentary. Now, go and study.* That's it. There's no great plot, no great conspiracy to convert people, no idea of someone being more or less because of people being *different* to us. I really do wish you would spend the time to actually know us before lumping us in with others, because we're very different than what you claim. I imagine this is just a karma farming endeavor, but it still hurts to be responsible to correct the prejudiced misinterpretations of Jews. Do better. Please.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"It's called kayfabe.","title":"Elon Musk Warns 'Hateful, Unrepentant Racists' Will Be the 'Downfall of the Republican Party' as MAGA Immigration Debate Intensifies"},{"text":"Knowing Trump, he probably thinks they are referring to the Credit Card.

Two of the biggest offenders of this- the Catholic Church and Islam- have a very specific caveat. \\n \\nWhich is that who gets punished is very much affected by what they know. There's a name for it that I can't remember in Catholicism, but the basic idea is that  not everyone has the same knowledge. if you grew up your whole life being taught that Islam or Catholicism is the worst, or not hearing about them at *all*, they can't expect you to be living with their exact teachings. but God is supposed to be just. He wouldn't judge someone by their circumstances. So what does happen? the Catholic doctrine is that the only sin that bars you from eternal life is a mortal sin- a sin of a grave matter that is committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent. i'm gonna explain then in order of least to most important. 1) grave matter- basically, a sin that's just REALLY bad. Usually the stuff in the ten commandments.  best example is \\"thou shalt not murder\\". and note that it IS *murder* specifically, not kill. murder  killing. murder is basically the same as it's current legal definition- deliberately killing someone and not having any sort of justification. 2) deliberate consent- basically, agency. you had to have not been pressured into doing it. you had to have had equal opportunity to commit the sin or not to, and chose willingly to sin. 3) full knowledge- by far the most important, and informs the deliberate constant. you had to have been fully aware that what you were doing was wrong and chose to do it anyway. now, to be clear, even if you do ALL this, you can still go to heaven. you just have to repent- and this can happen after death. this is what purgatory actually is. it's not a place, it's a process- purification, cleansing. now, i remembered the term- invincible ignorance. \\n you can't be judged for what you didn't know.this isn't just information, either. the Pharisees and the Romans knew Jesus existed and rejected him, but still JC says they're ignorant:  Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34). rather, it's *understanding.* two people can be given the same information (such as the doctrine of Catholicism) and not understand it the same way due to personal circumstances, such as mental illnesses or prior experiences coloring their world view.\\nThe only people who go to hell are people who, if given full knowledge of god and His plan, in His goodness, and stripped of all the complications of the body and material reality, would still choose to reject Him. and since the official position of the RCC is that hell is \\"the] state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed\\"-not fire and brimstone but just the absence of god- those truly wicked souls likely wouldn't even see heaven as a reward or hell as punishment. As for why you would become Christian if you're probably gonna get saved no matter what- it's an insurance policy and celebration. it's being grateful to Jesus for saving everyone. and even if you're pretty likely to get into heaven, the truth is we don't know what God's judgment will actually be like. so the idea is that sincerely adhering to the belief system of the Catholic Church (not just using them to exploit and manipulate, but actually act in accordance with them) is living in accordance with God and thus gives you a much higher chance.- I'm not as versed in Islam, but I believe it's something similar. On the day of the Last Judgment you'll be shown the truth of God pure and uncorrupted, and then be given free will to decide to worship or reject him. I want to note that while the Catholic Church and a decent amount of Protestants believe in invincible ignorance, some denominations don't. they believe that who is going to heaven and hell has been decided, that if God wanted you to go to heaven you'd choose to be a christian, and that anyone who commits a mortal sin was never really a *True* Christian. i don't understand the adherents of this belief, as believing you don't have free will means there's no point in trying to convince people to praise god since their choice has already been determined.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I see Trump supporters have moved on to the pommel horse portion of their desperate mental gymnastics.","title":"You will love immigration now!"},{"text":"It's funny to me that you think a new government organization named after a memecoin and headed by one of the biggest oligarchs and internet trolls on the planet is going to clean up government funding.

My grandmother's abortion happened around the time Roe was officially decided on. Since she's obviously long gone now, I genuinely wonder whether she never wanted children but had no choice with my mom so she just jumped at the chance when the choice WAS available to her and she faced another unwanted pregnancy (though she was by all accounts happily married to my grandfather for whatever that might be worth) or if she originally thought that she wanted children but found herself not enjoying motherhood so she was completely unwilling to roll with a Round Two. I will never have the chance to ask her why she made the choice and I can't help wondering what she would say about the topic were she still around, she was plenty hypocritical on other things (such as looking down on unemployed people while literally never being employed in her life for example) so I wonder whether she would suddenly identify herself as anti-abortion were she still alive or not, she never did discuss her abortion let alone her reasons for making that choice while she lived so if she was alive now we wouldn't be any the wiser about it (especially if she had the mentality of \\"The Only Moral Abortion Is Mine\\" on the issue).Hopefully that makes sense!","title":"Abortions are up in the US.

They led hard, miserable lives in rural California.  I guess they had more food security and they didn't have to worry (as much) about being shot, but that was mainly it.

They had some fucked up stories to tell us kids, like how they had to sit in the very back of the movie theater.  But at least they were allowed inside the movie theater to begin with.  (And at least there *was* a movie theater.)  They had less rights than white people, but it was *way* easier than being Black in Mississippi.  And Black Americans have been in (what is now) the US for just about the same length of time as Americans of British descent.It all changed after WWII.  My parents' generation had middle class existences (we define that much more loosely than the British, I should note) and got to be California hippies in their youth.  Although my oldest uncle was drafted and saw some of the heaviest combat in Vietnam.

MAGA is absolutely a world that believes the fiction. Remember that the only reason they believe Trump is a successful businessman is because he played one on TV two decades ago. There's a mountain evidence that he's actually very bad at business and would have been much wealthier had he just invested his inheritance than his numerous failed ventures like bankrupting casinos. Americans actually don't want a real president. When given a competent and a qualified candidate up against a reality TV star and carnival barker, they only once rejected the carnival barker and that was only because at the time so many people were croaking that the carnival barker couldn't keep lying about it. But since American voters have the long-term memories of a goldfish, and have absolutely no concept global macroeconomics and believe the president has a dial on his desk for egg and gas prices, they gave him another shot. I only hope that when things get bad they have some understanding of the gravity of their mistake.

The whole text is a single unit that must be taken into account. If you look at the context of the verses from Deuteronomy, you'd see that /u/oremfrien is correct. **Jews are not made to out to be superior to non-Jews.** We are instructed by God to follow certain Commandments and, if we fail to do so, are punished; these Commandments are not obligatory on non-Jews, as they have a different but equally critical mission in the world. Deuteronomy 7:6 (Tanakh): \\"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.\\"Let's look at [the context of this verse, Deut. 7:6-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.10?lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0):?? ? ?? ?  ?   ?? ?  ?   ? ?? ? ?? ?? For you are a people consecrated to your God ?: of all the peoples on earth your God ? chose you to be Gods treasured people.?   ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ??  It is not because you are the most numerous of peoples that ? grew attached to you and chose youindeed, you are the smallest of peoples;?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ??  ?  ? but it was because ? favored you and kept the oath made to your fathers that ? freed you with a mighty hand and rescued you from the house of bondage, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.? ?? ? ??    ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? Know, therefore, that only your God ? is God, the steadfast God who keeps the divine covenant faithfully to the thousandth generation of those who love [God] and keep the divine commandments,   ? ? ??    but who instantly requites with destruction those who reject [God]never slow with those who reject, but requiting them instantly.?  ?? ? ? ?? ? ?? ??{?}Therefore, observe faithfully the Instructionthe laws and the ruleswith which I charge you today.In other words: the purpose and meaning of \\"chosen\\" in Deut. 7:6 is that the Jewish people were \\"chosen\\" to follow the Torah's laws and will be severely punished if we fail to do so.  Deuteronomy 14:2 (Tanakh): \\"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God, and the Lord has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.\\"Likewise, [if you look at the whole chapter](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14?lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0), it lists a variety of things that Jews are forbidden from doing. Specifically, 14:1 contains a prohibition against scarification and shaving one's head totally bald and 14:3-21 lists the animals that a Jew may and may not eat. Phrases like 14:2 are found in 14:1, 14:21, and elsewhere in Deuteronomy to carry forward the theme of Deut. 7:6-11. These are the Commandments that a Jew must follow to keep the Covenant, and if a Jew fails to do them they will be punished by God. ____________Judaism: on the TalmudYou are misunderstanding the text involved. First off, the Talmud does not record a singular opinion on Jewish law. It's kind of a mess and extremely crazy.The Talmud is kind of like what you would get if you compiled every SCOTUS decision and ever Harvard and Yale Law Review article about those SCOTUS decisions, rewrote the arguments in the most concise shorthand possible, excluded any actual final rulings on the laws discussed, and rearranged these shorthand arguments nonchronologically (so that it reads as if every Justice and Law Review editorial team was in a single room debating each question) - and then interspersed this whole text with tangents about the Justice's personal lives and their opinions about medicine, history, demons, talking animals, the shape of the earth, and dozens of other subjects.Your presentation of a single line supposedly extracted from the Talmud tells us virtually nothing about Jews, Judaism, or halakha. Not only that, but your quotations are not even in the text you're pointing to!!** Talmud, Bava Kamma 113a: \\"If a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile ('heathen') it does not have to be returned.\\"If we look at [Bava Kamma 113a](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.113a?lang=bi), *it does not actually say that!*  Talmud, Abodah Zarah 26b: \\"Even the best of the Gentiles should all be killed.\\"If we look at [Avodah Zarah 26b](https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.26b?lang=bi), *it also does not actually say that!*Whichever internet \\"source\\" you found those fake Talmud citations on lied to you.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Good Trump Bad Trump....which Trump do we get today?","title":"Exclusive | Donald Trump backs H-1B visa program supported by Elon Musk"},{"text":"Its wild to see all these people treat other humans as slaves \\nAnd then justify their actions  As if it doesnt make it any more deplorable","title":"Trump supports immigration visas backed by Musk: I have many H-1B visas on my properties"},{"text":"Trump- whines about TikTok and says it should be banned, then hes bribed, then he interferes with his proposed ban and when the SJC returns their favors to him and saves it Trump will its saved because of him and kids should worship him for it.l, but it was Al manufactured.Such a scam.","title":"Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban"},{"text":"Anti Black and Muslim was ok, but anti H1B is racism cause 72 % of those who get them are Indians?

I went for higher studies in a developed country with the intention of eventual migration. However, lost interest and decided to come back after the studies. I have heard this question over and over again, and this is what I have to say.For immigrants coming from a developing country to a developed country, there is a very unique perk they can capitalize on. Most might not even realize this when they are first coming. This perk is so lucrative that most will even tolerate 'getting spitted on' once in a while. This perk, my friend, is called 'having residency in two countries which are economically and culturally vastly different'.You see most immigrants most likely will not die in the host country, or to better rephrase, they have the option not to. To spend your working life in a country that have 8-10 times the per capita income than your birth country while having the option to retire back in birth country is a hidden wealth multiplier (not in absolute terms but in PPP this makes sense) that most people in this world are unaware of. Now you might think that even a native of a developed country can do the same but its not that easy. They simply don't have cultural knowledge, language, general know-how and familiarity the immigrant has on their birthplace.Furthermore, immigrants can pass down this perk at least one generation down. Children of immigrants will most likely eligible for dual-citizenship which most people don't think much of but believe me if correctly used it is almost like having super powers.This is the main reason even people from somewhat well to do countries (e.g. China, S.Korea) don't discard an opportunity to migrate. The perk is too good to let go.","title":"CMV: No person from a third-world country that isn't at war should migrate for their good."},{"text":"None of those are paid to the Federal government by the State of California itself.

Current ones, too.  It's those atrocities that brought me to this subreddit, because being aware of them is just step 1.  Once you're aware, the next step is making them better.  And with structural issues, it takes an extremely long time to change things.  But it does happen, bit by bit.  And unchecked, stupid pride is one of the GOP's best weapons to make people not think or care about the bad things in America, so even people who love their country need to keep educating themselves about why it's not working for everyone.At the same time, though, I don't think Americans necessarily have to feel shame for their country's atrocities.  We are all part of the larger structure that keeps inequity going, yes.  But if you're aware of it, and doing your part to change it...I'm not sure shame is the appropriate response.  If you've been part of a problem but are now making it better, you can be free from that shame.  What's more, in my experience, shame has a pretty short shelf life in terms of being a motivator. Left unchecked, it drags you down into doing nothing (which I know isn't true of you, I've seen you around here lots getting involved, but for me shame has more often than not stopped me from helping).There's lots of people who should feel ashamed of how they voted and what they do, but I wouldn't include myself in that, and I don't think you have to either.  We're not responsible for every bad thing our country does, especially if we're actively working to stop it.And you're right that no working plan is going to ignore any of the problems.  In fact, any plan involves being honest about those problems and deciding to make them better.  An honest plan will include the good in America, though - because the good often contains parts of the solutions we need.  Suitcase_Muncher's reply includes some good examples.You're right that if we ignore our failings as a country, we'll never do better.  And if we ignore our successes, we lose some powerful ways to make things better.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 28, 2024"},{"text":"None, they would all be entirely too old.

That to be excluded from something praised by those who believe in it as a positive thing is an immoral act upon those that don't  even believe in this so declared positive thing. I'm opposing that.It's not about heaven or hell being different or a single thing, it's about people's individual and unique preferences.\\"Hell\\" from a Christian perspective can easily be simply \\"life without knowing God, without declaring Jesus lord and savior\\". Heaven is thus an eternity with God and Jesus. So why would those that give no value to God and Jesus view being excluded as anything negative?Why would Christians want to force you to spend eternity with these entities you have no respect for? The desire by Christians is not for you to join them in heaven, it's  to respect God, understand him, to where you wish to be in such a heaven.The point of heaven is not \\"joy/salvation\\" from your individual perspective, nor is hell \\"torture\\" from your perspective, it's framed from the basis of God/Christ. That a life without knowing God/Christ is \\"torture\\". That non-believers **right now** are \\"suffering\\" not knowing the word.People need to stop applying a \\"burning land of fire\\" as some actual place of hell. After death people will not have physical bodies. Actual fire will do nothing to you.Heaven is not where a Yugioh player gets to play Yugioh all the time. Not where a rapist can rape as much as they want. Etc.. It's simply a time with God. And if you don't  respect God, why would one look forward to that?And why would one objecting to such even believe in a \\"hell\\"? Why would what ever afterlife exists instead be viewed as a negative? You don't \\"choose hell\\". You simply choose not the \\"heaven\\" presented. There's no reason to think the choice is binary.

Make some smaller categories for specific industries that drive innovation but wont necessarily have as crazy wages as big tech, such as biotech, manufacturing, energy. Give each some visas. 3) issue h1bs strictly on highest salary within category. If your person is that amazing, pay them.. The scarcity to ensure its actually top talent is the key and will hold up to nearly any industry you might imagine. Sure, bring in that amazing chef from France you are saying is without peer- if you are going to pay them 200k, which almost no chef makes. Of course the 400k a year engineer will always get an h1b in this system. You could consider area COLA on this so it doesnt end up sf/seattle/ny/la only, but it should be mild otherwise itll get gamed. 4) make it a rolling 3 month process instead of annual. 5) maybe extend the OPT path a year or two if necessary to provide buffer to filter out top talent that graduated us universities and make sure theyll be able to earn enough pay to win this system at the end of it. This mostly nullifies the outsourcers bringing in 100k a year talent to fire 135k a year Americans and is more amazing engineers and scientists coming in at 200-300k. It also causes reliability for hiring. Youll know your 200k hire gets in. And theyll know within 3 months.This also helps a lot with foreign power couples who are in limbo and are actually the best immigrants.

Absolutely nothing there.  Next.And then it states.....Same.  Panama is not violating this.And then it states.....And again.  Nothing there that shows Panama is violating the treaty.The ports on either side of the Panama Canal, Balboa and Cristobal, are run via lease by Hutchison Ports PPC, a subsidiary of Hong KongCbased CK Hutchison Holdings.I know.  You have yet to show that this is violating the treaty.This has been the case since the late 1990's, but initially this violation was ignored because Hong Kong was seen as a friendly actor.BULLSHIT.  It was ignored because that wasn't a treaty violation.  This was something that was discussed before the Panama canal was even handed over:https://www.marinelink.com/news/billionaire-intention302964The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee is expected soon to discuss the right of a Hutchison subsidiary to run two container ports at the Atlantic and Pacific entrances of the canal. The United States will hand over the Panama Canal to Panama on December 31, ending a 96-year military presence in the Central American country. In August, Lott wrote to U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, saying that \\"U.S. naval ships will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots and could even be denied passage through the canal by Hutchison, an arm of the People's Liberation Army\\". Li said he appreciated \\"the American government, the White House, the military department, they have many times made it very clear ... we have no right to control the canal.\\" Hutchison had rejected Lott's allegations in August, saying that it had no influence over the canal's operation or shipping traffic. Lott had complained in the letter to Cohen sent on August 1 that Hutchison's operation of container ports at each end of the canal was a security threat and a sign of China's growing influence over the waterway. \\"This administration is allowing a scenario to develop where U.S. national security interests could not be protected without confronting the Chinese communists in the Americas,\\" wrote Lott. Li rose from rags to riches in Hong Kong's property market. He has close ties with the communist government in Beijing but Hutchison has denied any connection to the PLA. https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/wha/panama/991206_faqs.htmlQ: What about stories that China is taking over the Panama Canal?A: The Government of Panama granted a concession to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, on the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the Canal, respectively, to the Hong Kong company Hutcheson-Whampoa in 1996. Under the terms of the contract, Hutcheson-Whampoa does not own the ports, but rather operates them on behalf of the Government of Panama. The U.S. does not believe that the concession granted to Hutcheson-Whampoa represents a threat to the Canal. Several entities of the U.S. Government, including the Federal Maritime Commission and the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have researched this issue extensively and have not uncovered any evidence to support a conclusion that the People's Republic of China will be in a position to control Canal operations. The neutrality of the Canal and its operations are guaranteed by the \\"Neutrality Treaty&amp; signed and ratified by the governments of the U.S. and Panama, and also by that Treaty's protocol, to which 36 other countries are states party. You need to pretend this is about the change in Hong Kong government, because then it excuses Trump not saying anything about this during his first term.This is pretty clear cut and should easily understandable for almost anybody of any intellectual level.Laughable.  You can't even demonstrate how it's a treaty violation.  The companies operating these ports was approved by the US before the Canal was handed by the US, and do not constitute a breach of neutrality.The answer to your questions above:How does virtually nobody on Reddit know these things?

Interestingly, the article ignores the elephant in the room, which is that people no longer watch CNN because people no longer trust CNN's \\"reporting\\" or its talk show hosts for anything political - and it's been politics and the politics of war that have been driving almost every news cycle for the last year. From the Econotimes article:CNN executives are reportedly planning an urgent strategy overhaul to address the ongoing decline. Potential solutions include increased investment in digital content, partnerships with streaming services, and revamped on-air programming aimed at younger demographics. The network is also rumored to be exploring new leadership, hoping to reinvigorate its brand.Critics, however, remain skeptical. Some argue that CNNs perceived lack of identitycaught between impartial journalism and opinion-driven contenthas alienated its core audience. Others believe that without a dramatic pivot to digital-first strategies, the network risks becoming obsolete in the long term.But it seems to me that such a \\"dramatic pivot to digital-first strategies\\" will just take CNN down the same path as the online remnants of Time and Newsweek. Nobody will seek out CNN behind a paywall, probably not even behind a soft paywall. People will occasionally link to CNN in social media, as they do now, mostly to debunk it or to discuss something someone said on one of their shows. And because CNN is reliably establishment mainstream media, the search algorithms will continue to favor their visibility. But people won't go to them for fresh content anymore, just as nobody is watching their programming now. Furthermore, their propaganda model of \\"reporting\\" and talk show dialogue will open them to evisceration of their transparently one-sided, misleading, and untruthful advocacy right in their own comments sections in a way they don't have to put up with on cable TV.  The downvoting on cable TV comes by way of dropping cable entirely or just ignoring CNN entirely, as reflected in their ratings. CNN had its day. Their 24-hour news cycle was right for the technology of the time. Probably, what they'd really like to do now is to spin it off to remove its woes from the parent company's balance sheet, then sell what's left of it off to the highest bidder.","title":"CNN is losing viewers fast after the Trump election.

The deaths and fear are certainly the point. We can observe the effects of abortion bans in counties like Ireland before legalization, Poland, El Salvador, Brazil and now the US. Romania before 1989 would be an exception, as their abortion and birth rate were both exceptionally high and there was a whole state apparatus devoted to controlling women's fertility. Typically, the number of children born and the number of abortions remain relatively stable compared to peer nations even with abortion bans. Women mostly suffer and die in emergency situations. It's never a pro-natalist solution, especially now that medical abortion is effective, easily obtained illegally and relatively safe to administer at home. There's no need for a back alley butcher or knitting needle today. This was the clear outcome before Roe was overturned and I don't think anyone, regardless of political stance, is surprised by the maternal deaths, infant mortality and morbidity and relatively stable number of elective abortions.?","title":"Abortions are up in the US.

The droids could be upgraded to specialize in neurosurgery, alien biology, cybernetic limb replacement, pediatrics, and podiatry. Though they were designed to treat humans, they were able to treat the diseases and injuries of millions of different species using stored data. They often worked alongside FX-7 medical droids.

Others migrate because social mobility is limited in their home, and the host country offers opportunities that are too good to pass up (with the goal of seeking a new fate they consider impossible under their current circumstances).With this mindset, the immigration process requires focus and discipline in interactions with the host country, leading many voluntary immigrants to adopt \\"model\\" behavior. It's a win-win for them. Even if the political landscape changes or wages lead to poorer outcomes than expected, most immigrants find it worth the effort. The experience alone is valuable, and they will take their experiences and learnings to their next destination.Immigrants who don't fit this description (e.g., those who get homesick and find the environment not as expected) are less likely to weigh financial, political, and other factors higher than their emotional reaction. They don't fit the scenario or circumstances you mention so for all intents and purposes aren't quite the focus here.In other words, your arguments don't really work for the kind of people who have the mindset to leave their country, go through the hoops in order to achieve their goals.

Once it's clear who the winner will be he'll jump in and pretend he always was on that side.","title":"Donald Trump silent on H-1B visas as MAGA civil war escalates"},{"text":"The appeal to the Supreme Court was narrowly focused on whether a state has the right to strike a candidate from a party's primary ballot.  Section 3 of the 14th amendment describes minimum qualifications for holding office.  It has nothing to do with ballots or elections.On the matter of ballot access, the Supreme Court ruled that States cannot use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to unilaterally remove candidates from ballots.  They reasoned that if each state used different criteria there would be chaos.  Republican Secretaries of State would block Democratic nominees, and vice versa.  The resulting patchwork of state results may not result in any candidate getting enough electors to win.  The SCOTUS conclusion was generally well received on this basis.However, as an appellate court, they did not even consider the core fact in the Colorado case. They couldn't. Appellate courts are not set up to debate facts and come to conclusions, they only rule on the applicability of laws and other technicalities. They can offer opinions on the facts - and they did - but those opinions are just that, opinions.  They carry no legal weight.So in all the appeals - at the Colorado district court level (strike from the ballot), the Colorado Supreme Court level (strike from the ballot), and the Supreme Court of the USA level (keep him on the ballot) - the courts accepted as fact that Trump had disqualified himself from office.You would think that ballot access and eligibility for holding office would be related, and they used to be, but that is no longer the case.For example, Maine has a law that requires the SOS to certify that every candidate on a ballot is eligible for office. The Maine SOS did her duty and struck Trump from the Republican primary after reviewing the Colorado decision and the basic facts of the matter.  Other SOSs were considering doing the same thing, driven more by lawsuits from Republicans who didn't want to waste their votes than state laws (Maine may be unique). All of that was nullified by the Supreme Court decision to kick the can down the road.And now here we are.  A ways down the road, and with a serous and urgent problem   If Trump had lost it we wouldn't have to figure this one out, but he won so we do.There are three possible courses of action:1. Roberts and/or Congress follow the Constitution and swear Vance into office.\\n2. Congress removes the disqualification by a 2/3 vote in each house.\\n3. Roberts ignores the Constitution and swears in a president of questionable legitimacy.The most likely path since almost no one is talking about it is (3), but I contend that this will result in far more chaos than we have now. Every corporate lawyer from here to Singapore will raise that questionability to get their clients to prevail in court. In each case the lower courts will be debating who is the real president, Vance or Trump.  All of those cases will percolate up to the Supreme Court, so it is in Roberts's interest to resolve it now, before the inauguration.","title":"Does Trump Jan 6.

In Canada, we talk about being a mosaic rather than a melting pot.  Different cultures are celebrated.  It could be that I am just not aware of immigrants being spit on and told to go back to their country.  It could be that I just work in a inclusive workplace and don't see the bigotry.  Things I do see:* genuine curiosity when meeting someone from another country\\n* genuine effort to include someone from another country in our corporate culture\\n* People asking \\"where are you from?\\" meaning \\"where did your ancestors come from?\\" This is asked of white people as well.  We are all immigrants.  The only non-immigrants are the Indigenous people of this land\\n* multi-cultural festivals where cultures from other parts of the world are celebrated are very popular\\n* Canadians rallying around immigrants who have been the victims of hate crimes\\n* Canadians stepping up to sponsor immigrant families fleeing war\\n* Canada has no plans to deport anyone.  Even if we had a conservative federal government I highly doubt anyone would be deported. Immigration may be greatly reduced or stopped but we wouldn't see mass deportations like the USA is threatening to do.\\n* During the early days of COVID the Canadian and provincial governments stepped up to support temporary foreign workers recognizing their importance in agriculture and the food supply chain.There will be places where immigrants are not warmly welcomed (looking at you Alberta and Saskatchewan) but I think that overall Canada treats immigrants fairly.  We are more racist towards the Indigenous people than we are to immigrants.  I could be totally wrong on this and it is just my white privilege that blinds me.

About the only meme I've yet to see idolizing Elon is him ascending into Heaven with a halo-enshrouded head.I'm not thrilled about either of them - both are globalists believing in a tech monarchy - along with Vance and Thiel.  Let's see what E and M do about all the government money Tesla and Palantir receive.I believe that Trump chooses people for reasons that may not be apparent at first glance.  How any MAGA is idolizing Elon, in particular is beyond me - every business venture of Elon's stands to benefit from the NWO.  He's openly admitted that people will have to be transhuman in order to function in society.  Additionally (and I know many people don't have a problem with this, but I do) he's dated two satanists, and his mother is apparently also involved with the occult.Vivek is allegedly Vance's wife's cousin.  Vance stated in an interview that America needs a \\"healthy ruling class.\\"  Uh, last time I checked we were SUPPOSED to have representatives, not rulers.  Anyway, that comment was overshadowed by the \\"childless cat lady\\" headlines,\\" but, imo, speaks volumes about where his head is at.  I don't like it.  It also correlates with his and Thiel's admiration of Curtis Yarvin, a proponent of the \\"tech monarch\\" philosophy.Sooooo....For nearly a decade, I've immersed myself in an arm of the DS that flies under the radar WAY too much - the Om1dyar (do not want to call attention in this sub)  network.  Vance was a NeverTrumper - and Om1dyar is the original and biggest funder of that movement.  One of O's pets was Evan McMullin - and O bankrolled McMullin's StandUp Republic.  Vance supported McMullin's 2016 presidential run and said terrible things about Trump - even comparing him to Hitler.  He wants us to forget that now.  He's reformed.  He's had a change of heart.  Perhaps... but I need more proof than his word on that - and no one should be shamed for questioning that.  As it stands now, my belief  (based on more than what I've mentioned here) is that they're lining up for a Vance presidency with Vivek as VP and will implement the complete digital lock-down in 2029.","title":"Looks like Vivek's 15 minutes are about up"},{"text":"Biden is the outgoing President and the article is talking about the future security situations in the world.

In rabbinical teachings, our mission is seen as a burden and responsibility, and often emphasizes that its not about superiority, but about service and dedication to a divine mission. There is an old Midrash (tale) that talks about how God went to every other group in the world before Jews and asked if they wanted to receive the mission, but they all refused, and only the Jews accepted. Sure there might possibly be some outliers in modern times, but its kinda weird to assume the opposite of what has been taught in rabbinical teachings for thousands of years.Also, Jews believe that everyone, with the exception of a few very bad people who are also unrepentant (Hitler types), go to heaven. Jewish teachings emphasize that actions affect your path to heaven, and most souls go to Gehenna for a purification period before going to heaven. Jews believe all nations have a place in the world to come. There are 7 ethical/moral pillars that non-Jews have to adhere to in order to be considered righteous among the nations, which may mean that they will spend less time in Gehenna before going to heaven, but being a Jew does not make it easier to get into heaven. You dont get any boost in status for being a Jew.The seven pillars have been the subject of a lot of debate and are as follows:1. Prohibition of idolatry2. Prohibition of Blasphemy3.

I'm not some blue-eyed optimist here, I'm just saying that the decision doesn't actually have nearly as much weight going forward with a Trump administration as some people claim. I would counter this by asking when has criminal law in the United States ever held a president to account for authoritarian actions that violate the liberties of US citizens? Was Jackson criminally indicted, much less convicted, for his execution of the Trail of Tears? How about FDR for Executive Order 9066 forcing the internment of Japanese-Americans?The fact is that criminal law isn't the only or most likely thing to stop a president from violating the law (or as the case may be, the constitutionally granted rights of the citizenry). First off, it just can't be brought to bear against the president while he's actively committing illegal actions. He's the head of the DOJ, don't like an investigation? Just fire the guy, and it goes away. The courts are the first place where presidential actions should be challenged, civil lawsuits against the government for violations (whether or not you have faith in them is a separate matter). Congressional oversight / impeachment is the next level of defense against an actively criminal president (again, this would require a functioning legislature, not looking good here either). The final level of defense is the electorate (uh oh, we failed that test too).What I agree is that the ruling is bad and will only encourage Trump's worst authoritarian tendencies because of what it signals to him about the judiciary. What is more significant is the fact that he has purged the GOP into MAGA loyalist, effectively capturing the Legislature, and I don't have any confidence in the Supreme Court striking him down either. The laws don't matter if you have a court system that will just bend them to whatever is convenient at the time, and that extends far beyond the context of criminal accountability.","title":"Trump transition team plans immediate WHO withdrawal, expert says"},{"text":"The base doesn't like immigrants because they're a different race.

In a less controversial example, many Calvinists dont believe that faith without works is dead (James 2:14-26) instead holding that its enough to proclaim that Jesus is God and God is real.Anyway, there are a number of Xtian denominations as well that believe that atheists, agnostics, non-Xtians, and so on are welcome in heaven/purgatory/the Kingdom of God. The only catch is that those people still have to meet specific criteria (altruistic, generous, forgiving, etc.) in their mortal lives. We know this to be explicitly declared by the leadership of denominations like the Roman Catholic Church, the Society of Friends, the Greek Orthodox Church, Old Order Amish, and the Universalist Unitarian Church. We also know it _not_ to be true of denominations like classical Pentecostalism, the Southern Baptist Convention, the Church of Latter Day Saints, and the Methodist Church. So I wouldnt judge these huge religions by a few dozen words. Id rather say that you should judge people for who they are and what they do. Thoughts certainly lead to action, but youd be surprised by how diverse the thoughts of different believers even within a single temple (of a few dozen or hundred people) is.

In this way, a person does not become one of the elect by being Calvinist; being Calvinist is just one of the pieces of evidence of being one of the elect, which God already chose, but it is both an insufficient piece of evidence (being Calvinist alone does not make a person one of the elect -- they must also do good works) and an unnecessary piece of evidence (since Non-Calvinists can also have been predestined by God).With respect to the unbaptized infants in Catholicism, the teaching was never as grounded as many others (with it being largely -- if not completely -- absent from the Catechism, depending on the year of publishing) and, unlike the person who has no exposure to the Sacrifice Upon the Cross, such an infant is in the presence of other believing Catholics who could baptize the infant.With respect to \\"separate but equal\\", the problem with \\"separate but equal\\" is not a problem in logic but a problem in application because human beings struggle to create a political system that allocates the same degree of respect and behavior to those who are separated in order to keep them equal. In many cases, like that of the Jim Crow racism in the US South, \\"separate but equal\\" was never conceptually implemented because \\"separate to keep unequal\\" was the actual intent from day 1. However, as humans, many of us respect many conceptual \\"separate but equal\\" systems because they are actually seen as separate and equal and designed that way: (1) we see other people as entities with distinct concerns from us and yet equal in their right to advocate for their concerns and equal in their right to receive the same treatment as us -- human rights, and (2) we see governmental entities as existing as distinct entities with different goals and orientations but equal in their right to advocate for their citizens on the world stage -- Westphalian nation-to-nation politics.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I hope both sides lose","title":"Elon Musk threatens 'war' with Maga Republicans over skilled migrant visas"},{"text":"Skilled is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

Equities are sold to raise money, and the expectation is that at some point, you will sell your profits, to someone else, who hopes to do the same, but may not. In other words, it's gambling.Unless you're talking about people who intentionally create meme coins or whatever, sell those to people when they (the creator) is holding the majority of the supply, which they dump on the folks who were duped into buying it.But that also happens with stocks, especially penny stocks, often. And has been for decades.There have been countless cases of fraudulent activity and people losing their money.Unless you're investing in a guaranteed asset class, there are no guarantees and you could lose everything. This is the nature of investing. I question the intelligence of people who want to dump their life savings into some meme coin with no solid fundamentals (or purpose for existing), or tokenomics that give a person a reason to invest.And usually they are people who can't afford to lose it.That's an individual problem. There are people who can't have just one or two drinks. There's people that if they touch hard drugs, will become dependent on them and ruin their life chasing them. There's people that sit in casinos all day long and pull the arm of a slot machine. Nobody is putting a gun to their heads. They are making the choices.Now as to your original question. I'm not sure I'd argue that cryptocurrencies main purpose is to promote equality for all, but there are some that would make that argument. Blockchains will solid fundamentals, that have stood the test of time, like Bitcoin, or Ethereum, are distributed decentralized networks/currencies that are censorship resistant. Your money is your money. Nobody gets to tell you what you can do with it, or what you can't. They can't seize it from you unless you voluntarily give it to them, and nobody can take it from you, unless you voluntarily give it to them or do incredibly stupid things which will allow someone to take your money from you. You can send your money to whoever you want, instead of your bank or government deciding for you. There's no hidden fees, or annual charges, or daily limits. There's no risk of your bank getting hacked and your account/identity being exposed and having to spend months of time and money to make things right again.Crypto is legitimized now. It's available to anyone with a retirement plan, brokerage account, or through exchanges, everywhere on planet Earth. Billions of dollars flow into BTC and ETH ETF's on the regular and not taking the time to learn why they're of interest to people in the finance world, and instead writing them off as Ponzi schemes because you don't understand how they work isn't going to change anyone's mind, or make you any money.You've obviously read my past comments, and so you've seen me say I'm a multi-millionaire, and that's true. All I did to make that happen was buy BTC and ETH on Coinbase, and sell it there also years later. Just like I would with a stock, except with more efficiency. I didn't screw anyone, and nobody got screwed. Whoever bought my ETH from me made an investment decision based on how they feel things are likely to perform in the future. They may do well, they may not. That's investing.","title":"Trumps made in USA bitcoin vow not based in reality"},{"text":"Yeah but Elon, Jeff, Bill Gates, and other billionaires have a read on this and they have his ear (i.e. ego).

Cats are bad, but no where close to dogs.The reason I say this is because it's cherry picking to put your (general, not specifically you) on cats and say \\"oh, we shouldn't keep cats because of blahblahblah.\\" These same people who'd say this would then turn around and say \\"Waaaaah? Barkie McBarkson would NeVeR hurt ANYTHING!\\" I just find it hypocritical. Honestly, outside of maybe sloths, all animals are assholes who'll fuck up your day if they want too.

And essentially what you're talking about isn't eastern vs western religions, but monotheistic vs. polytheistic religions.First, within the monotheistic religions, your original premise is that \\"religions that bar non believers from salvation are morally inferior.  Then you invoke Jews, who have no such belief, but include them inaccurately because they're the \\"chosen people.\\"  I say inaccurately because Jews don't believe only Jews go to heaven. The Jewish religion place no emphasis on the afterlife, some religious Jews believe in one, other Jews don't.  But even those who do don't believe it's limited to Jews, it's for anyone with a \\"righteous soul,\\" though that's not clearly defined.  So one third of your argument about monotheistic (or Abrahamic) religions, is incorrect.  Considering themselves as the \\"chosen people\\" doesn't equal \\"non believers are barred from salvation.\\"Second, people have a tendency to see Eastern religions as more peaceful, more morally pure.  But name me a religion that hasn't been involved in war in the name of religion.  In the Indian subcontinent, Hindus vs. Muslims, Hindus vs. Sikhs, Hindus vs. Jains.  In South and SE Asia, Buddhists vs. Muslims.  Which I understand isn't your point, but you seem to be saying that Eastern religions are morally superior, and I don't think that's true.  Just look at the caste system within Hinduism as an example.Back to your original point. Aside from the monotheistic religions, while other religions believe in reincarnation, that's very different than salvation.  They're not comparable.  So all you're really saying is the Christianity and Islam are morally inferior (in the most reductive sense of your argument).

Also fix the green card process, right now that has to be done through your employer which again, turns even highly paid very good expats into slaves again.

Keep in mind that Scott's more of a Russia expert than one on North Korea. Shortly before the Kim-Trump summit, Korea successfully tested the Pukguksong-2 and Hwasong-15 missiles. The successful test of the Hwasong-15 in 2017 changed the game forever. For the first time, north Korea was capable of striking Washington DC and anywhere else in the US.  That's the game changer. It's a lesson for any nation that is about to suffer from the fate of the Iraqis in 2003. This is the end of the nuclear NPT, if more nations realize this.  Does north Korea want sanctions relief? Does it want to stop being poor? Does it want good roads with nice cars on them? Does it want world-class healthcare? Yes, yes, yes, and yes; but above all else, it wants to maintain its independence and sovereignty.This independence &amp; sovereignty is not something the US ruling class wants to accept, so prior to these developments, it wasn't the US eagerly awaiting north Korea to crawl to the negotiation table; it was the US hoping for the collapse of the DPRK, or the DPRK selling itself out  Even if the North Koreans gave in, they wouldn't get those things. The US would install oligarchs to exploit the people. \\nAny country that loses its trading partners virtually overnight and loses access to oil is FUCKED. No oil? Your tractors become useless metal. You can't make fertilizer. Cuba is similarly sanctioned, but being a warm country means the effects are felt less, since food is more easily grown.

Initially i was providing context that indicates America doesn't even treat it's own workers with any decency let alone immigrant workers. To provide this context i used the example that is Europe, which has some of the best workers rights in the world.It truly is a shame how one of, if not the richest economies in history, in the developed world treats it's common folk/workers how they do. There is a certain irony that America was founded on principles of not being ruled by royalty/elites when they just ended up being ruled by Royals of another name. I have an ex-wife and  daughter who are American and live there and it saddens me how everything is stacked against them.","title":"How much does he pay Trump a month?"},{"text":"Maybe hes sensitive on the topic:Someone present in the US on a student visa who didnt enroll in courses would have had no right to work at the time and would have had to leave the country, according to experts WIRED consulted. (He did ultimately receive work authorization in 1997.)Overstaying a student visa was, and to a much lesser extent still is, relatively common. Working without authorization and lying about it during the immigration process would be, however, a black-letter violation of US law carrying significant penalties, albeit one enforced fairly rarely, say experts.Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell Law School and faculty director of its Immigration Law and Policy Program, says that its not clear that if Musk worked in the US without authorization and attested he hadnt, that would be considered important enough to denaturalize him. However, he says, on purely legal grounds, this would justify revoking citizenship, because if he had told the truth, he would not have been eligible for an H1-B, a green card, or naturalization.","title":"Maga v Musk: Trump camp divided in bitter fight over immigration policy"},{"text":"Why would Trump think he needs voters?","title":"Trump has been awfully quiet."},{"text":"His claims he is a Democrat that just happened to get caught up in the crowd is laughable in light of the fact that Reeder recorded himself breaching the Capitol twice, videotaped an officer being assaulted and bragged that he battle(d) the police,according to evidence presented by the prosecutor.","title":"Does Trump Jan 6. Pardon Plan Include the Seditionists?"},{"text":"Surah 3:85 (Quran): \\"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\\"This is a translation issue. It also can be translated as \\"And whoever seeks judgement other than submission to God, it will not be accepted from him...\\" The Quran explicitly does consider the God of Christians and Jews the same God as Allah. And even calls Jesus' followers\\"Muslims\\".Surah 2:62 (Quran): \\"Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans C those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteous work C will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\\" (people of the book is still arbitrary exclusion)This phrase is repeated multiple times in the Quran in different ways, other similar verses emphasize *anyone* that believes in God and does good deeds of compassion to help others.Surah 4:56 (Quran): \\"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses C We will burn them in a Fire. Every time their skin is cooked through, We will replace it with new skin so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\\"The word \\"disbelieve\\" is not really an accurate translation. It says \\"kuffar\\" in Arabic, which literally means \\"ones who cover\\". It doesn't literally have anything to do with belief.A fairer translation in English might be something like \\"rejector\\" or \\"ingrate\\". It is never used in the Quran as a general term for Christians, Jews, etc. It the Quran, it essentially refers to a miserly ungrateful person who takes the good fortune that Allah gives them and uses it to oppress others, or at least has total indifference to the suffering of others. The Quran usually uses the word \\"kafir\\" to refer to people who attack or oppress Muslims. It never states that all non-muslims are kuffar.\\n  \\nWhat am I misinterpreting?Well for one that the standard medieval interpretation said that non-muslims can go to heaven too, especially if they didn't understand Islam. This is a quote from Imam al-Ghazali, one of the most influential theologians of the medieval era, about non-muslims who heard about Islam but rejected it because they thought Muhammad was a bad person:The name of Muhammad has indeed reached their ears, but they do not know his true description and his character. Instead, they heard from the time they were young that a deceitful liar named Muhammad claimed to be a prophet. As far as I am concerned, such people are excused like those who the call of Islam has not reached, for while they have heard of the Prophets name, they heard the opposite of his true qualities. And hearing such things would never arouse ones desire to find out who he was.\\"Other extremely influential medieval theologians such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya believed all non-muslims would go to heaven, and affirmed universal salvation for all people Muslim or not.This is a more common understanding than you might think. For example, here's a video from a modern Saudi cleric arguing that people from any religion, even atheists can go to heaven:Do only Muslims go to Heaven?

The solution is NOT to supply those people with slave labor through those visas, it's the free market of AMERICAN labor. Either the tech CEOs will offer enough pay to make qualified Americans accept those employment conditions, or the tech CEOs will adjust their working environment to one in which they can find in which an AMERICAN labor force is willing to work to produce a product at a price point a market is willing to pay. Just because a tech CEO wants to live in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Houston, or Miami doesn't mean he's entitled to workers willing to live there working 70 hours a week for peanuts. If it's more important for a CEO to get workers who will work 70 hours a week for peanuts, he may need to relocate his company to the rust belt where those peanuts will buy better houses and more stuff and his product can be produced at a lower price.","title":"CNNs Jennings: GOP Can Compromise on Immigration by Eliminating Fraud in H-1B Program"},{"text":"Thanks!","title":"How much does he pay Trump a month?"},{"text":"Class warfare is the perpetual psy op.","title":"Trump and Bill Gates inviting Elon's son X to Mar-a-Lago for New Year's Eve"},{"text":"MAGA is driven by mediocre white people.

But its important to remember that the job market is really tough right now, especially for recent graduates.Tech layoffs, stiff competition, and high expectations for entry-level jobs are making it difficult even for talented people to find positions. Its unfair to assume that someone who struggled just couldnt make it. Everyone faces different challenges, like tough timing, market conditions, or personal stress. Instead of placing blame, we should focus on solutions, like better hiring practices and more support for recent grads.Also, keep in mind that the $100K salary often quoted for H1B workers is influenced by cost of living in expensive cities. For example:* San Francisco Bay Area: $120K - $180K+\\n* Seattle: $110K - $160K\\n* New York City: $100K - $150K\\n* Austin: $90K - $140K\\n* Rural areas: $60K - $100KSalaries are higher in tech hubs because of the higher demand and cost of living, which means $100K in one city may not stretch far in another.Graduates today are facing big challenges. Economic uncertainty means companies are less willing to invest in training new hires. Many \\"entry-level\\" roles now ask for 2-3 years of experience, which is a major barrier. The job market is crowded, with more graduates competing for fewer positions. On top of that, remote work has opened up competition globally, so U.S. grads are now competing with talent from around the world.In India, the situation is similar. Only about 10% of the 1.5 million engineers graduating each year secure jobs, even though 64% are considered employable. Many Indian graduates struggle because they lack practical skills and industry knowledge. They may do well in theory but need better hands-on experience to solve real-world problems.Source: [Business Standard Article](https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/only-10-of-india-s-1-5-mn-engineering-graduates-set-to-secure-jobs-this-yr-124091600127_1.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)https://youtu.be/y-elx-J1OwM?si=j9gh0jCoGl6gchdZ","title":"Laura Loomer Calls For MAGA Boycott After Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy Defend H-1B Visas; X Owner Dismisses Her As A Troll"},{"text":"Article says he just wants it delayed so he can negotiate on it during his term.

There are companies,  backed by a cadre of lawyers, who specialize in just this.  They will guide a company in how to structure the whole process to eliminate American workers while bringing in the H1B holders, all without breaking any laws and avoiding lawsuits.  You also have companies like Infosys who stuff the pipeline with H1B applicants to game the system and get as many of their workers into the US.  As for Elon, there is ample evidence that he's racist.  But money is more important to him than anything else so he's happy to tolerate some brown folks if he gets fatter profits for himself.  Who is going to win this battle?  Elon will.  No one has heard one damn word from Vance and yet Musk is in the news constantly, even more than Trump.  Vance was hand picked by Thiel.

Loudermilks report reached a through-the-looking-glass conclusion that Cheney &amp; co. had promoted a false, pre-determined narrative that President Trump was personally responsible for the breach of the Capitol on Jan. 6 and should therefore be held accountable.Trump is returning to the Oval Office with an explicit agenda to rewrite history  and upend convictions. He has vowed to issue Day One pardons to Jan. 6 criminals and defendants, whom he has called great patriots, hostages, and warriors. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump referred to Jan. 6 itself as a day of love. And when he recently summoned tech billionaire Mark Zuckerberg to Mar-a-Lago, Trump reportedly prompted his guests to rise and place their hands over their hearts, while listening to a rendition of the national anthem sung by jailed Jan. 6 defendants.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-january-6-pardon-seditionists-oath-keepers-proud-boys-1235219409/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-january-6-pardon-seditionists-oath-keepers-proud-boys-1235219409/)","title":"Does Trump Jan 6.

The Sacrifice Upon the Cross is God providing an avenue for an individual to achieve salvation through the grace of God himself. Accordingly, it is the virtue of understanding human limitation and divine agape (selfless love) that leads to the Christian achieving salvation, not dint of birth. A person could be born into Christianity but not understand what the Sacrifice Upon the Cross is or how humans are limited. This person will not be saved. Further, as others have stated, a person who is not aware of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross with sufficient understanding to grasp this point would not be punished by God. So, Christianity does not argue that morality or virtue are contingent to belonging to the correct group or having the correct creed, if such creed was logistically impossible to have.This is all meaningless given how many different sects of Christianity there are, all with their different beliefs regarding how salvation is achieved and, indeed, what happens to people who don't believe or who are incapable of comprehension. Calvinists believe in predestination. The Catholic Church, for the better part of 2000 years, had the doctrine that the unbaptized go to Limbo.

Im an engineer of Indian ancestry, and I can say with confidence that many American engineers are struggling to find jobs. Just recently, I was talking to a coworker about a young engineering graduate we know who graduated with 4.0 GPA but hasnt been able to find a job. Hes struggling with his mental health and was trying to unalive himself.Companies like Chevron, Shell, Google, and LinkedIn are laying off U.S.-based engineers and replacing them with offshore workers or those on H1B visas. I know this because Ive spoken to my relatives in India and my fellow American engineering graduates who see it happening firsthand.I voted for Trump because I believe in America First, not Elon and Vivek First. Our kids arent less capable simply because theyre more well-rounded (attending prom or playing sports). Indian students are often forced to study 12 hours a day or more, and even when they graduate, many of them are unhappy with their lives. I know this from reading Indian Reddit forums and hearing directly from people in those communities.American kids are not lacking in talent or intelligence. JD Vance is just one example of the incredible potential we have in this country. Its time we focus on supporting our own students and professionals.My father came to the United States on an H1B visa, eventually obtaining a green card and later becoming a citizen. Reflecting on his experience, he often shares how restrictive life on an H1B visa can be. You're largely tied to your employer, with limited flexibility to change jobs or explore opportunities. This dependency can feel restricted, as your ability to stay in the country is closely linked to your employment.Some people make money by bringing H-1B visa workers to the U.S., acting like headhunters. In some cases, fraud is involved, like certain Indian colleges where people can allegedly pay for fake degrees. While many H-1B workers are highly skilled and genuine, not all cases are honest, and misuse does happen. The issue with Vivek is that he comes across as a \\"know-it-all\\" upper-middle-class kid who had everything handed to him. His parents are wealthy, and while he talks a big game, he doesnt truly understand what its like to grow up as a poor kid from a coal-mining town. My husband, for example, is a white Appalachian who joined the military to pay for college and served through four deployments. We don't need more \\"smart people\\" from other countries when we are producing smart kids in America just fine.","title":"Laura Loomer Calls For MAGA Boycott After Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy Defend H-1B Visas; X Owner Dismisses Her As A Troll"},{"text":"The party that has consistently slashed school budgets is now complaining that Americans are uneducated","title":"Elon Musk endorses X post bashing reded American workers | \\nThat pretty much sums it up, Trumps best buddy responds to insult"},{"text":"For some reason, magas think theyre the only ones with guns.","title":"Man accused of attacking TV reporter, saying This is Trumps America now"},{"text":"\\"his richest and most powerful advisors on one hand, and the people who swept him to office on the other.\\"Well, let's see.

They no longer care for the consent of the masses, they are not hiding behind lobbying, they are directly seizing control. They likely anticipate civil unrest, and this is the catalyst i see being the trigger for billionaires to flee with all they have managed to plunder extort and steal from the US. When its no longer safe for even rich people to live in America, then the US as we know it will cease to function as a free union. Widespread overt authoritarian oppression against the working class will be justified to control the masses. The only variable between now and then is whether the masses willingly or unwillingly accept the rule of the wealthy. Republican voters seem very happy to accept it willingly, but the end product will be the same, an oppressed and enslaved people. Im very conscious it sounds ridiculous when you say that out loud as though its a conspiratorial paranoid lunatic rambling. But its hard to ignore that this is what its shaping up to look like and I feel I have to justify that. What is happening in front of our eyes at this point in history is indentured servitude. Employers are becoming bigger as the chain of command of workers gets gradually absorbed by billionaires buying up small businesses or using their wealth to starve out small businesses. Extremely large corporations monopolise the labour market. Then you must submit to an employers terms to be able to access healthcare, you must accept a noose of personal debt to get a college degree, which is simply a gamble on lottery odds of upward social class mobility. And on top of that you must show youre willing to sacrifice working rights and civil liberties to be considered for a job or a promotion or anything of tangible value. But each year it gets harder and harder to actually improve your life, youre running to stand still, and if you slow down you get eaten by debt. Meanwhile billionaires are gorging on and bigger slice of the pie year on year, extracting a higher and higher proportion of wealth from workers economic productivity, workers see less and less reward for the labour they are forced to give. This trump presidency is just the complete mask off moment, a declaration of class war, they are rewriting the rules in front of our eyes to extract all value from the working and middle class. Unless you have a college degree you are already doing economically worse than someone in 1979, and this only stands to get worse. And even with a college degree you are forced to work under more and more extreme conditions just to pay your debt to society, your penance for having the gall to ask for opportunity. You have to take on voluntary roles, offering up your free labour, you have to forego union membership, you have to work longer hours, you have to make sacrifices of health family friends free time and home life.

In most progressive countries, surrogates maintain full rights over their body and medical decisions throughout the pregnancy - they can terminate it if they choose to. The contract only covers the initial agreement and compensation.Think about it like organ donation - we celebrate people who choose to donate kidneys as making an empowering choice to help others create families. And just like organ donors, surrogates make an informed decision about their bodies.The real slavery-like conditions exist in countries without proper regulations, where women lack protections. That's why we should push for better laws and oversight, not ban it entirely. Progressive policies in places like Canada show how surrogacy can be ethical when surrogate mothers have strong legal rights and medical autonomy. even if it's dangerous, the worker is free to withdraw from the contract at any momentThis applies to surrogacy too - the difference is that choosing to withdraw has medical implications that the surrogate understands upfront. It's about bodily autonomy - forcing someone to either continue OR terminate a pregnancy against their will would be the real violation of rights here.The focus should be on preventing exploitation through strong regulations while preserving reproductive choices.

The projects he becomes involved in only succeed when there's government bailouts.Trump was campaigning on cutting this kind of government spending.  Musk bought him out.  A few million dollars now means billions in evaluation and gov't tax dollars keep subsidizing his failed projects.Remember!  Tesla had a decade head start in modern EVs over other manufacturers.  Chevrolet beat the M3 to market with the BoltEV, the first &lt;$40k long range EV.  It had a longer range, was cheaper to manufacture, cheaper to repair, cheaper to insure.  Chevrolet was only \\\\~2 months behind Tesla before they made enough sales to max out the initial EV tax credit program.  Tesla divided the charging infrastructure, and now that they've shifted to a profit model that depends on other EVs using their charging network, they've done so again.  There is a *very* strong argument that Tesla has actually slowed the acceptance of EVs....The Asheville example is neat, but it's all publicity.

A surrogate can decide to no longer continue with the pregnancy up until the legal time limits for abortion, and in many countries the surrogate is the legal mother so they could even choose not to hand over the child once it's born.

Before, it was more fringe but basically some fringe white moms on Facebook claiming vaccines cause autism. These health beliefs were more associated with the left. During COVID they found a new home with right wingers willing to listen to them, and they became much bigger there. This would explain RFK's shift. Initially he did take away Dem voters, but when they began to actually listen to what he was saying, RFK was only taking away Trump voters.
