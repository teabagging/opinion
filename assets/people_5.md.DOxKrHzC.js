Populists underperform in the DNC because the entire party is filled with educated and high income people who have a stake in the system staying the way it is. This brings me to the point that the *DNC will not survive at a national level if they do not adopt populist ideas*. That is to say, they will never get a majority in the house or senate, or the presidential ticket. You need to appeal to low educated and low income voters or else the country will literally elect an authoritarian. The DNC does not have the charisma to start a populist movement if they appear as the stereotypical liberal who doesnt care about people. The DNC doesnt have the conviction/character to actually have opinions on things which is what a populist movement requires. And not a single person in the party had the courage to break from the ruling class donors and fight for actually changing the status quo.Bernie wouldve easily won against Trump in both elections, is what Im saying.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"I think Merica would be better off if he self terminated.","title":"Trump Border Czar to Undocumented Immigrants: Were Coming for You - Tom Homan encouraged non-criminal undocumented immigrants to self-deport."},{"text":"I expect nothing less of them.","title":"Report: Anxious Democrats Plot to Sabotage Donald Trumps Agenda"},{"text":"The sad fact is that a fair number of people in this country love guns more than anything else - people, children, or their own safety in public spaces.","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":"Trump didnt take credit for the deal he cut with the Taliban for the Afghan extraction.

Peter Wagner, a former missionary and seminary professor who spent the last part of his life cultivating what he believed to be a new apostolic age in the life of the church. Wagner wanted to go beyond denominations to a new Reformation - one in which modern day apostles and prophets used their spiritual gifts to guide their congregations. Wagner developed a network of charismatic young leaders who he believed would lead the church into its next era. And twenty years later, these apostles and prophets did just that - by forming the background of Christian Trumpism and leading the charge on J6.Southern Poverty Law Center - [Christian Supremacy and U.S. Politics: An Interview with Theologian Andr Gagn](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2024/05/31/christian-supremacy-and-us-politics-interview-theologian-andre-gagne)Unlike most Christian churches and denominations, it is easier to understand the threat the [New Apostolic Reformation] poses by looking at it not as a political Christian movement but instead as an authoritarian, anti-democratic movement within a religion. Its leaders teach that demonic forces occupy most of U.S. political and cultural institutions, from events at your local library to the Supreme Court. This includes other religious traditions and even other Christian churches C any group that disagrees with them.

Even in the first admin of the Orange, they only got tax for rich past with full congress for that first 2 years. Rest of that was in-fighting. Hoping this admin will be same, in-fighting with not much to show for it.Dems will have to watch how they do their primaries in the future. If Pete wins they dont have much recourse but to allow it. I wanted Pete to win back then. Part of the reason what happened currently is alot of complaining about there was no primaries and ppl got butt-hurt and apathy with the view to no vote as a stand.   \\nAnother is all the heard about free money to ppl (teachers, gov seats, basically everyone but common person not in those positions) that wasnt them and felt left out.Same happened in 2016 with the bernies and the email from dnc leaked with the dnc showing some questionable movement towards and against some candidates. Those voters hopped to 3rd party votes or just didnt vote.  \\nDems will have to play it straight with the primaries, this time and find a message that will ring to more ppl and not just teachers and gov seats. I would suggest they start taking up union ideas in a run to bring back not just higher min wage but how about breaks and lunches work. Many states, workers dont have any rights, can work 8+ hours without a break at...all and its legal. Same with need to guaranty min hours and health benefits not tied to hour status like pt/ft. Ya get the job, you get benefits, period.  \\nPpl need to pull out of the \\"small biz\\" heart strings, this is what big biz has been using as a shield to hide behind to dodge regulation. F the small biz, honestly! Congress can set rules for corp size for rules with all having to do min. This not doing anything needs to go.This will also depend on if the coming admin drags Pete through the mud on his progress for his current seat. If GOP thinks he will run and might have a shot, this will happen alot. Talking about any train wreck, bridge problem, etc. They will point to him on that when its further from the case.If he doesnt have a chance, I dont see it as being Gay, it would be from the coming admin dragging him through the mud on infrastructure collapsing and problems related to that.

We had a major recession and they dropped fast.  I have family who insists it was never over $2 under Bush.  I am not sure the exact average it was because of the recession but it was below $2 and they use that number.I read an article were someone was saying Reagan had lowered the deficit and debt.  The factual numbers say otherwise.  I remember in 1983 the unemployment rate was over 10%.  My parents were not working and we know others like that.  Reagan cut taxes twice and increased spending.  And we saw a market crash.  As well a recession when his VP Bush became president.  \\nWhen Clinton Took office in 1993 we were up to $4.4 trillion.  And that jumped to $5.6 trillion by the time he left office.  The rate of growth not only drastically slowed but by the time he left office the budget was running a surplus.  Hell, every Republican running ran on that fact.  Bush used it to promise tax cuts.  And most of that went to corporations.  Those corporations were seeing record profits for the times.  And still laid people off which was part of the problem leading to the recession.  \\nIt is like those tariffs as well.  The people I know think the tariffs will be good.  When they will absolutely be passed on to consumers.  I explained it the best I could so some relatives would understand.  Businesses factor in their costs to determine a final price so they can make a profit.  I used avocados because they had just bought some at $1 each.  They understood, I think, but did not think it would happen.  If they charge 20% in tariffs on all imports (excluding the 60% China) those could see a price increase based on that.  So you could get 4 for $4.  But now they are $1.20 and you could only get 3 for $4.  Well, they know they will not sell as many.  First, they will increase prices to were you spend the same, at the least.  So 3 for $4.  It could go a little higher.  But it will not be any lower.    \\nA lot of things, any economist not lying, will tell you this.  They know this is how it works now.  So in the end the tariffs increase government money.  But at the expense of the consumers who buy.  All while giving the tax cuts to the corporations and other businesses.  What is weird is that we saw growth under Clinton with higher taxes.  Bush tax cuts did not do it.  Just more deficit and debt.  Same with the Trump cuts.

In a video published by the Atlantic Council think tank last week, he said the US should celebrate countries that hit the 2 per cent of GDP target and pressurise those that do not.He has previously criticised Italy, Germany and Canada for their lower defence budgets, and said the US needs to make clear it is time for our allies to invest in their own security.Mr Waltz will take office at a time of global instability and uncertainty about?[Mr Trumps strategy for the wars in Ukraine and Gaza](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/10/donald-trump-phone-call-putin-not-escalate-ukraine-war/).The president-elect has said he will seek to end the Ukraine war in a day by brokering territorial negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow, in exchange for peace.On Monday,?[Sir Keir met Emmanuel Macron in Paris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/11/11/starmer-macron-trump-nato-ukraine-john-healey/), as the UK and France both vowed to continue Western support for Kyiv, regardless of the state of US aid under a second Trump administration.Mr Waltz is a former member of US special forces, and the first Green Beret to be elected to Congress.He previously served as an adviser to Donald Rumsfeld in the aftermath of 9/11.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/trumps-national-security-adviser-mike-waltz-chagos-islands/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/trumps-national-security-adviser-mike-waltz-chagos-islands/)","title":"Trumps top new security adviser compared Chagos Islands deal to chaotic Afghan withdrawal"},{"text":"I dont disagree but as you pointed out he probably wont have the charisma to win elections without Trump.

In capitalism, the rich who own everything and can make passive income from investments are supported by workers who get paid less than what their labor is worth (where the profit comes from). In a hierarchical religious structure, those with power and wealth are given that power and money through believers and tithing.Fascism however is this idea taken to the extreme, where the anger and contempt for the underclass are so big that they start eliminating them (through deportation, extermination, or just making it impossible for the oppressed to functionally live and be able to contribute). If the powerful start eliminating the people who prop them up, as you can imagine it becomes inherently unsustainable. Fascism has two ways to refresh it's underclass to mitigate this: infinite conquest without ever losing as they stretch themselves increasingly thin over new territory, (thereby getting more people to exploit and eliminate) and shrinking the overclass, knocking people who were near the top lower on the pyramid (so there are fewer people to sustain and more people to do it, until the latter are eliminated again).The fall of fascism is inevitable given a long enough period of time. The problem lies in how much damage and how many lives they're able to take to keep going before it collapses.","title":"Biden wants Americans to \\"bring down the temperature\\"  but MAGA will not let that happen: In conversations with Republican voters, we learned why they shun unity"},{"text":"This man is weak, small and frightened.

They ran a flawed and unfair primary which had the very people who were supposed to be neutral, giving their full support and power to Hillary.In 2024, there was no meaningful primary and no one voted for Kamala.  Need I say more?2020 had a very well done Primary, the DNC enacted a lot of changes since 2016 to limit/prevent what they did with Hillary to happen again.  We saw candidates competing and we let the voters decide in a far more neutral space.  It allowed voters to see their voices heard on stage, one might think that debating pulls us all apart but it doesnt, it is a testing ground before going up against people from the \\"other party\\".  It's needed, and we have to get the skeletons out of the closet while we can rather than waiting until we go up against people that don't have the same values as other Democrats.Pete Buttigieg should be in the primary, if it is fairly run, then it will galvanize voters FAR MORE than pull us apart.

And lastly, but not the least, the general misandry at the tail-end of the #metoo movement (boys will be boys is toxic masculinity etc).Despite what we might believe about each of these events, what we all witnessed was the media acted in concert perpetuating the divide in politics and social discourse. And coincidentally all of these issues culminated in the election year. Without, there would have been a lot less advantage for Biden 2021. My conclusion. The elites discovered that they can now rage-bait large parts of the population into self-identifying themselves as deputies of social justice or antifa by wearing an N95 mask in public, a just voted sticker, a blue bracelet, a rainbow shirt. Giving themselves some symbol of a badge. Encouraging them to attack anyone that doesn't look like they are wearing a badge.

The jobs leaving was bad enough (inevitable maybe but with no serious plans to help) but Keating 5 made all the old Ds persona non grata in middle America. That's where never ever trusting a Democrat started, with the union of Dems pushing to the middle on money and becoming so money friendly. Big campaign contributions and diversity were the new wave in the 90s, and the stock markets did great but almost none of that trickled down. Letting the banks get away bailed out and with no serious consequences was the final straw. 2008 made it a blood feud and Obama got walked right into it by Reid and Pelosi, who basically knew their chickens were coming home. Remember, Obama wasn't one of them, he was the outsider with the surprise Iowa win, mostly just holding his own until Ted Kennedy, the last leader of the pre-shift Dems threw his support behind the kid. Obama's clean hands, powerful messaging, and McCains dirt won Obama that first election with what could best be described as a cynical skepticism, and the second doublecross of a shit ton of people losing their houses again, after having been warned by their previously laid-low parents they could never trust Ds.

So yes, amazingly complicated and crosslinked, with no real cultural memory left about how it all started, a few of the key culprits still around to invoke the irrational original anger, and not a lot of easy answers. Explaining how it all happened is damn near a book unto itself, and they don't care for or have time to listen to the party that sold them out, Even though most of the faces have changed And the renewed outreach has been genuine. FDRs original coalition was shattered, And all the working class people who used to stick together tenuously were divided.

They all need to get along, because somehow someway they're all elected.  So they represent SOMEONE.  (More than someone, their constituency).  In 2024, neocons are a myth.   Maybe in 2004 it was a thing, but not in 2024.  And if you think support for Ukraine is a neoconservative thing, you're an idiot that does not understand geopolitics.   The US has a longstanding tradition of opposing tyranny and invasions, it has a longstanding tradition of defending its interests abroad since Tripoli...that's not an endorsement of the second Iraq war, but it's certainly not an endorsement of isolationism either.  There needs to be a Thermidorean Reaction in the GOP, that accommodates both the traditional strong foreign policy of Teddy Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan, and the populist movement.   RINOs are a myth.   And if you call someone who has been a republican for 50 years a RINO or neo-con, you're the RINO.   There will never, ever be a party that perfectly aligns with your ideology or emotions.  Nor should they be.  When people on social media engage in ideological purity tests, whether progressive or populist, I make the quote reasonable assumption:They ain't ever been married.  They ain't ever managed anything, that requires consolidating a dozen different opinions into a working solution.  They're in a basement somewhere, pushing their idealism to the fullest because they've never had to negotiate or *trade* (one of the fundamental components of the free market, and thus conservatism, and thus the GOP) to get anything done.

Its undeniable that people like voting for winners. And perception of ability to succeed influences the outcome of elections. superdelegates are members of the democratic party establishment that can influence the outcome of the primaries. And reporting before the elections even started showed her 500 delegates ahead of the field.3. Bernie and maybe Martin OMalley were Clintons only serious opponents. A lot of prospective candidates just didnt run because clinton seemed to be pre-ordained to be the nominee. Its impossible to say how much of this was backroom dealing.

Sending millions of jobless Mexicans back to towns they left years ago could create chaos in areas already suffering from poverty and organized crime, they say.Neither the shelters nor the border area nor Mexico are ready for this, said Hctor Silva, a Protestant pastor who runs the Senda de Vida migrant shelter in Reynosa, across from McAllen, Texas.Read more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/12/mexico-trump-mass-deportation/?utm\\\\_campaign=wp\\\\_main&amp;utm\\\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/12/mexico-trump-mass-deportation/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit.com)","title":"As Trump prepares for mass deportations, Mexico is not ready"},{"text":"He always looks keyed tf out","title":"Donald Trump Jr. Joining a Venture Capital Firm"},{"text":"I agree to a point, but ZIOBiden-Harris was no better, only more waffle-y verbally.

[NPR - What drove last year's surge in Chinese migrants at the southern border?](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/07/nx-s1-5032835/chinese-migrants-southern-border)\\n Last year, a record number of Chinese migrants crossed the U.S. southern border without authorization. In search of jobs and freedom from China's heavy-handed pandemic response, they followed paths long walked by migrants from many countries. But here in the U.S. they have come under a different kind of scrutiny, because they hail from Americas biggest geopolitical rival.Politicians on the right, led by former President Donald Trump, baselessly claim Chinese migrants are spies or drug smugglers, sent by Beijing to harm Americans.Trump suggested at a rally in May that \\"military-aged men\\" are \\"building a little army in our country.\\"At the Republican National Convention in July, former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro described migrants crossing the border as \\"murderers, rapists, human traffickers, terrorists ... Chinese spies.\\"It seems there's some truth to increasing numbers of Chinese nationals crossing the southern border illegally.  It seems highly unlikely there are many Chinese spies among their ranks.  The Chinese spies are going to be here legally on academic and work visas, because it gives them greater access to information worth stealing.  An undocumented Chinese immigrant working in a kitchen somewhere isn't in a great position to steal national security secrets.","title":"Trump Isnt Going to Help Make the Cost of Eggs Any Cheaper"},{"text":"Scott, the Medicare fraud guy, is a dishonest simpleton who committed fraud.","title":"John Thune just overtook Rick Scott.

Border security and immigration control.  [Dems used to be a party that believed the border needed secured.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gatekeeper).  Bernie Sanders called open borders a \\"Koch brothers conspiracy\\".  Go back to that.  Don't let the Republican party have such an easy win on an issue that costs you nothing to support.2.  Ending foreign wars, not funding them.  How exactly did Trump out flank Democrats to the left on war?  When I was a kid, Republicans were the neo-con war hawks who wanted forever war in the middle east.  Yet now public perception (rightly or wrongly) is that the Dems are war funders, and Republicans want to back away from the global stage and entrench at home.  How did the Dems fuck up so badly on messaging that conservatives are the party of peace?  Dems MUST get back to being the party of peace.3.  Economic populism.  Trump said he was going to put tariffs on foreign goods.  Trump had is name on stimulus checks that went out during Covid (and I have heard multiple people say that's why they will vote for him this time WHICH IS INSANE but remember, low information voters are the majority of voters).  Trump says he's going to keep jobs here by punishing companies that outsource.  Like the above three positions, until NAFTA, the Dems were the party of economic populism.  Dems were the party of unions.  Dems were the party of not free trade, but protecting the American working class.  Hate to sound like a broken record, but basically Bernie Sanders.  3 decades of neo-liberal policies by Democrats like Clinton and Obama have led to the working class no longer identifying with Democrats, and Trump comes along speaking their language, BECAUSE HE'S A 90's DEMOCRAT.TL;DR - Go back to being 90s Democrats with Bernie Sanders economic populism, and you win.","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

Hillary lost to Obama for a lot of reasons in 2008, but one of the big ones we forget is that he was running more Establishment than she was (that was her Progressive primary)... she heavily moderated her message in 2016 because she became convinced that you cannot get the votes to run on the Blue ticket if you're not at least a little Establishment.  And honestly, her modestly progressive jobs plan fell on deaf ears anyway.  A populist would have to find outside votes to replace 20-25% of the base, where a moderate only has to find 10-15%He was middle-of-the-road for me in 2020, but Buttigieg is becoming my favorite for 2028 to have a chance to represent at least *some* of my views and also have a chance at the presidency.

Private loans can be bought and sold which means much like existing private loans and unpaid debts , the buyer (usually a collection agency) is less likely to sue because if they lose they get $0 so better to buy cheap then offer settlements of pennies on the dollar and they still make a small profit and the borrower pays much less.On one hand Im slightly optimistic because this shows just how stupid Trump and some of these people are.

The infrastructure for natural gas/electric vehicles is simply not there yet, and pushing emissions standards down the throat of the market without a plan for the infrastructure to replace it was horrible.

If the answer is yes then there's a big reason as to how this election went. Enough people understand:\\n1. It wasn't a right to begin with. In order for it to be a right it needs to be constitutionally ammendmended. Otherwise a law, even federal is a privilege, not a right. \\n2. The supreme court ruling that it deferes to the states protects it as much as possible. It doesn't matter if he is lying about not passing a federal law, the supreme court will throw it out. \\n3. The amount of people posting across social media that they are getting their tube's tied, abstaining, going on birth control, etc. Highlights what many already knew,  abortion was being over used as birth control. Practically no one disagrees with it when it comes to rape, incest and risk to the mother. Which represents 1% of abortions.

This is the basic reactionary idea, and it implies a rejection of democracy because democracy is motivated on the principle of equality.Hence why you see oligarchs, racists, religious fundamentalists, misogynists, ..., all working together within the same movement (though they will fall out eventually, because they don't agree on what everyone's precise position in the hierarchy should be). Hence the appeal of laws that seem to do nothing but harm people; doing harm without recourse, even by proxy, is an expression of power and power, to an authoritarian, is equivalent to status. Hence the gleeful destruction of those institutions their \\"enemies\\" value, and why they specifically target those that protect or further equality (the rule of law, human rights, ...). Hence anger at other people getting closer to equality, because in a society that is a fixed hierarchy progress is neither possible nor desirable, so any social change must be a zero sum game, i.e. when \\"they\\" win, \\"we\\" must be losing.","title":"Trump Isnt Going to Help Make the Cost of Eggs Any Cheaper"},{"text":"Im sure he saw the writing on the wall and called it like it is.. got out while the getting was good.?","title":"Self immolatng man at Trump trial"},{"text":"Exactly,  the media sucks.

It would be interesting to see what the administrative costs of your system are.I looked up the official cost reports of the respective bodies.The [GEZ took in 9bn in 2023 and spent 2.03% of that on administrative costs](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/e175/e8976/Jahresbericht_2023.pdf), \\\\~183m (sorry, it's only in German, but can be translated. These numbers are highlighted on p. 7). The most recent [cost report of the UK TV license](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8101/CBP-8101.pdf) shows that it had 3.74bn in revenues and 137m in collections costs (3.66%). Based on the current EUR/GBP conversion rate, this makes the GEZ revenue about 2x the UK TV license's.Let's use simplified, approximate conversions for comparison's sake:* GEZ revenue in : 7.5bn\\n   * scaled down to the UK size: \\\\~3.75bn\\n* GEZ cost in : 150m\\n   * scaled down: \\\\~75m\\n* Scaled up UK license revenue: 7.5bn\\n* Scaled up UK license costs: 275mYou can describe these numbers in a few different ways:* GEZ costs are over 1.5 percentage points lower\\n* Proportionally, the GEZ administrative costs are 55% of the UK TV license's\\n   * This is speculation, but I get the feeling that the admin costs in the UK are underestimated, as I find it unlikely that it accounts for the total cost of jailing people for non-compliance. Costs may be underestimated in some way in Germany as well, so this isn't part of my argument.\\n* If you scale up the UK TV license costs &amp; revenues to the GEZ revenue size, this would mean savings of 125 million\\n* If you use the current size of the UK TV license and adopt the cost percentage, this would still be **60 million in savings**I imagine there are much better uses for that 60m than jailing predominantly poor people.# Qualitatively:the BBC remains incredibly impartial and there's huge controversy every time it broadcasts anything that could be perceived as biased.This contradicts your post's statement about people from the left saying that the BBC is too right-leaning and vis versa. If anything, I would argue that the BBC is a demonstration of the value of impartial, objective media as a public good. We should be funding such public goods more, not less.So I agree with you about the current state of the BBC, but my point was about the consequences of solely relying on privatized media.But if free riding is baked into the cost and it doesn't get out of hand then it's probably a lesser problem than forcing everyone to pay.How is free riding baked into the cost in the UK system? Free riding is never completely avoidable, but the structure of only paying for a service if you demonstrably used it creates a perverse incentive structure and positive feedback loop/vicious cycle of degradation of public media:People are unsatisfied with/don't want to pay for the TV license  \\n They don't pay the license fee  \\n Public media has less money and has to rely more on private funding sources  \\n Public media becomes less objective and more beholden to private interests  \\nAND/OR  \\n The TV license fee becomes more expensive for those who do pay  \\n People are more unsatisfied with/don't want to pay for the TV licenseThe BBC remains one of the most respected media institutions in the world with it's only tarnish being that some people don't want to pay for it, forcing everyone to pay for it would increase criticism not reduce it.You're arguing that everyone agrees that the BBC is good, but no one wants to pay for it? Do you not see that this is a classic free rider problem/tragedy of the commons scenario?Also, from a psychology/cognitive science perspective, simply paying for something makes people value it more, not less.This can be applied to all public goods: Would people like for them to be free? Sure. But unfortunately:1. this is capitalism and things have to be paid for, and\\n2. getting something for free actually decreases the perceived value of a good/service.It's better to distribute the costs of public goods in a fair manner, and clearly demonstrate the value of those goods to the people who pay for it (tbf I don't think the GEZ uses the fairest cost distribution, but that's a separate debate).","title":"CMV: Not paying the TV Licence fee is now a perfectly reasonable consumer choice (UK Post)"},{"text":"In case anyone was worried Bill OReilly was joining Team Reality: He advised the president-elect to focus on five or six really solid bills that are almost unopposable, including border security, immigration reform, tax cut extensions and legislation targeting sanctuary cities.

There's no new information to be gained from this, or from many of the other stories and articles. Nothing actionable, it's pure emotion manipulation. The vast majority of what Trump and friends will shout about publicly is, much like what Putin does, intended to either stir up his base emotionally and make them think he's doing something for them, or to demoralize and upset his opponents. We're in that era, again, where we can expect some sort of inflammatory and outrageous statement from him or one of his goons every day that people will latch onto as if in complete surprise...  And my notion is still that the mindfuck itself is really Trump's greatest weapon against the population. To the extent we understand that and ignore it, or at least not let it bother us, we can conserve strength for when it matters and also have generally normal daily lives despite what's going on elsewhere. People who are letting this get them really down are basically inviting Trump into their homes already and letting him ruin their days by proxy.

Near the movies climax, U.K. spin-doctor Malcolm Tucker (who is working frantically to start a new war in the Middle East) says to a senior U.S. government official  a character modeled partly on former Trump adviser John Bolton  You know, Ive come across a lot of psychos, but none as fucking boring as you.Standing in the center of Trumps election night 2024 watch party thrown near the president-elects Florida home, it was gratuitously apparent just how much the American elites and our ruling class are disproportionately populated by Trumps most shockingly boring psychos.Wealthy donors in immaculate attire and with too much time on their hands were there. Nativists who ran the federal government into the ground, and are on track to run it yet again, were there, too. Hollywood actors like Jon Voight, who just acted in a Francis Ford Coppola movie, and a blue-blazer-donning Kevin Sorbo were enjoying the electoral nightlife.The elites and the establishment honchos of the wealthiest country the world has ever known arent just the ethnic whites who ride and breed horses for fun, and who would rather be tortured to death than be photographed dining at a chain restaurant.
