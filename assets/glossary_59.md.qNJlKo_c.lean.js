Don't let these headlines fool you. All he's done through these so called \\"negotiations,\\" is shown us that he's eager to cave into Putin's demands. Even suggesting the U.S. withdraw from NATO.This is as good a time as any to remind people of just how great an asset Trump has been for Putin.While Trump was president, he frequently repeated Kremlin propaganda about things like the annexation of Crimea, about NATO in particular, and about the threat of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.Trump has repeated Putin's false claims about Ukraine that served as a pretext for his invasion.Trump said that Putin did *\\"an amazing job of taking the mantle\\"* when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\\"*Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\\"Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\\"Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\\"*In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \\"watered down.\\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot the sanctions down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.In response to Putin being labeled a \\"killer\\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \\"diplomats.\\"Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goalsthe weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \\"obsolete,\\" and has reportedly, on several occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO.Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\\"*Trump doesn't even know how NATO works...in 2014, NATO members agreed to move \\"toward\\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024. The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \\"delinquency\\" involved.Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \\"fund\\", but towards their own defense.Trump has called the U.S., *\\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\\"* Not comprehending that the funding benchmark has to do with each country's own defense spending. We're not \\"paying for NATO.\\" In fact, our military spending has actually decreased over recent years.NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.Trump campaigned on the idea of capitulating to Putin. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, just like that. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.That's because Putin is also looking to consolidate power. His goal is to annex as much of Ukraine as possible, rob its people of their independence, then continue with his \\"special military occupation,\\" err, I mean *operation* into other regions of Eastern Europe, where he will expand his oil empire and create soviet-like \\"spheres of influence\\" in territories that his military seizes.Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war wouldn't have happened. Not only is this delusional, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place, and as president, he will continue to help advance Putin's autocratic, escalating, warmongering, land grabbing agenda, as well as his efforts to expand his control over oil.","title":"Trump's strength and unpredictability can help end the war in Ukraine, Zelenskyy says"},{"text":" He won fair and square.He won.

Many forget that MAGA will indeed end with Trump. This is his last 4 years in Office, whether he likes it or not. No candidate like him will get this amount of support. Even when MAGA was at its peak in 2024, they could barely get him in. Simply put, Republicans, aren't that popular. Trump is immensely hated by a large swath of the Electorate, that simply isn't going to stick for Republicans if they screw up, which they ALWAYS do. They're in the honeymoon period of his Pre-Presidency, and by the end of it, I'd imagine a large portion of the Electorate will likely turn to the left. The Pendulum swings each and every election. In 2016 it swung to the right. In 2020 it swung left. In 2024 it swung right. In 2028 it will swing leftward. It's simply how things work.","title":"It's Elon Musk over MAGA: Donald Trump makes his pick"},{"text":"My point about fitness is that there is a difference between seeing someone as marginal currently and being willing to bet on a lack of decline over the next 4 years. Someone over 80, and I would be uncomfortable even if they seemed super sharp and clear eyed currently. I have seen enough of Bidens speeches to see that he is not always impaired. I saw enough of the debate to say that even if he had the flu, as claimed, at the very minimum it says that I wouldnt bet on 4 more years. For standard gaffes, every person who spends as much time in front of cameras as our modern national politicians does can be made to look insane because everyone misspeaks occasionally. With enough talking you can cut things together to look terrible. So those things didnt bother me too much. The question was where he is between the two. From what I gather, his issues seem to be consistent with primarily age related decline. Trumps possibly more cognitive issues showing up in different ways.Drones arent illegal just for flying around. If they are in restricted air space they would be. The military and/or law enforcement arent going to just go shooting down drones just for flying around. What goes up must come down, and you can imagine the repercussions of a big drone comes down or the ordinance comes down and ends up killing people or destroying homes, etc etc. For the ones in Europe that were violating airspace around US airbases, amp that up tenfold given how much damage the US has done to their reputation over the last decade. Given that so many of the video clips people have posted claiming to be drones turn out to be  planes, or sometimes just stars, it is pretty clear that a lot of it is overblown. You know that a lot of it is that some drone owners saw reports about people freaking out about drones and thought it would be fun to do a bit of night flying for their neighbors. Could there be some nefarious reason for people to be flying drones around with the intent of being seen?  Sure. But as they havent appeared to do anything, flying with all their lights on is a poor way to do anything like spying or gathering intel. So possibly some group trying to rile up the rubes. I have no idea who Steve Greer is, but showing off by blatantly flying drones around random areas seems like the opposite of what some secretive shadow government would want to do. Just out of curiosity, what makes this obviously a government project, and what would be the purpose?","title":"Due to Bidens age and mental decline, he was unfit to run for president.

Some of these behaviors are optimized to directly benefit the individual and we have no problem understanding and accepting these (lets call these selfish behaviors). However, other learned behaviors are optimized to help us survive but do not directly benefit us, only indirectly. For example, by not stealing and not killing, we inspire others to do the same and our community will be stronger and this helps us tremendously as individuals. These latter behaviors are what we call morality. But from a learning perspective, both are learned the same way and different individuals will independently learn similar behaviors. Its just that philosophers are sometimes puzzled by the fact that we seem to adopt non-selfish behaviors, but really all our behaviors are for our own survivalEdit: forgot the CMV part. I disagree that morality is artificially created by society to control us.

Artificial vanillin is chemically the same as natural vanillin but it's still artificial. If artificial is anything made by a human then babies are artificial as well. We normally skip over these exceptions because we get it, they're exceptions. Except we can't do that for philosophical truth can we?  \\nI think artificial was the best word you could've used but definitions matter here and especially so for morality. What do you define as morality? If you're saying it is something that should exist as a physical object outside of real actions and ideas, why? If morality is human thoughts, the issue is that human thoughts are very real and produce measurable effects even if it's \\"artificial\\". You can isolate thoughts and feelings in the head, not accurately but you know where it is.  \\n  \\n========================================Long discussion version if you're interested, feel free to ignoreSo clones don't work? That only works until you have to start differentiating between species. It's hard to say which exact wolf is a dog and not a wolf because species are a social construct. You also don't say \\"that's a dog with some poop and gut bacteria in it\\" in regular life because it's implied but when it comes to bare bones philosophy, you have to be very clear on everything including what artificial/morality/subjectivity means.  \\n  \\nIt may seem like I'm nitpicking but I'm of the belief that all ideas as we know it are a social construct because you can't ever accurately define anything in its entirety without exceptions. I wouldn't normally get hung up on details but artificial is too vague since \\"artificial\\" vanillin is literally the exact same as natural vanillin and what morality means is ultimately dependent on what you define as morality.If you believe morality is nothing more than feelings and feelings are just a human idea, then you can't say it's not real because feelings ARE real. We can physically isolate feelings in the brain and it's clear which parts of the brains regulate certain emotions. If you believe morality is the determining of what's right and what's right is entirely social, I think even a newborn comes prebuilt with the instinct that pain is not right for starters. If you think morality that by definition must be written into the universe, then it would be a social construct because I don't even know how it'd manifest in the universe even if it was \\"real\\".For me, morality by definition exists as the actions and beliefs in people's mind and the optimization of that goal for what humans consider the most reasonable and this is theoretically testable, even if it will practically never happen. The actions and beliefs in people's mind are definitely real and what's most reasonable to humans can work by testing and understanding the human brain as we know it.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"That court and general assembly is packed and stuffed with every GOP that is still breathing.

It's obviously facially true that we all have different opinions about whether thing A is morally abhorrent or encouraged, but that isn't the whole story. For most of history we have been wrong collectively and individually about...most things, including things we would now consider to be objectively true. Naturally these disagreements didn't make the topic of discussion any more or less objective - but rather they were part of a process towards uncovering all of the information required to bring universal or near universal agreement. As we better understand things, we converge towards their objectivity.But with morality we're going to hit a snag - there's a whole lot of metaphysical baggage that informs people's morality - stuff that we will never know definitively. So we know that we can never complete a convergence towards objectivity there, and the question pivots to: if we could know everything, would we all have the same morals?My position would be an extremely unsatisfying \\"maybe\\". But it's enough to not make me a moral relativist in the philosophical context.The more layman-common arguments against moral relativism are mostly religious. Which makes sense, if there's a god and you view them as the moral authority of the universe, then naturally morality isn't relative because it's dictated and explicit.Anyway, if I leave you with one takeaway it would be that you shouldn't conflate people disagreeing about something with that thing being subjective or relative. It may just be that either or both parties are wrong.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"r/republican : Leftist judge is out for bla bla bla, Trump is clearly innocent?","title":"Trump calls for New York judge to be disbarred after hush money conviction advances"},{"text":"He wants vengeance on Ukraine.","title":"Trump's strength and unpredictability can help end the war in Ukraine, Zelenskyy says"},{"text":"*intact.

Evolutionary we as a species have this instinct to survive and produce new generations. As soon as we settled down as a species, formed groups, built town and later cities, we, as any social species, had to develop strategies to still reach these goals. You can look at primates, elephants, big cats etc, they all formed some form of society with rules (morals). Most social species know the concept of 'wronging' someone and 'apologizing' to someone. It's not as advanced in every species as in humans, but it's there. Since we are able to have more complex thoughts, behaviours and so on our morals and rules had to grow more complex as well. There are definetly 'morals' that are mostly based on culture, but the basic ones are somewhat biological and somewhat survival driven.?\\nIf you look at it through that lense, which characteristics survived through generations and what benefit for humanity certain characteristics provided, it becomes a very pragmatic discussion. As an example: The ability to be cruel to a certain degree has it's benefits, if everyone is cruel and it has no consequences, our species dies out.?\\nEdit: we are basically individuals with basic needs and wants realising we have the best shot to get these needs and wants met in a group. So we protect the group to protect ourselves and protecting the group and ourselves within it needs some morals and rules and laws.

Instead, you realize just how incredibly difficult the question is.I believe that actual events can sometimes be so complex that it becomes genuinely hard to determine what is wrong and what is right. Maybe thats true for most events in the world. However, I also believe there are some fundamental principles we could call universal or objective morality. The Elan School is a good example if you dont want to invoke an ad Hitlerum argument.

You bring it into my shop to fix it.  You think 'Oh, he'll go into Windows Settings and make adjustments, and Windows will run faster. Total time: 1 hour'.  What I actually do is Wipe the operating system off the PC, and re-install from scratch. Total time: 2 hours.  Why? Because in my job, I know it's a waste of time trying to change thousands of settings, each with a miniscule performance increase. It'll actually take more time than you imagine.  So, I don't offer that service.  In my experience, re-installing the OS works just as well.  So, I do that. And here you come, saying I'm ripping you off by charging you for 2 hours labor when you *know* it only takes, like, an hour or so to tweak a few settings.It's a combination of you not fully understanding what needs to be done (else you would've fixed it yourself), And the limited services I offer (I reinstall, I don't tweak).  To go back to the car example, maybe the shop doesn't offer 'tweak belts' as a service, they only offer 'replace condenser' as a service.   OR, maybe there is an issue with running the condenser on a broken belt- an increased chance of further problems.  In that case, replacing the (possibly broken, due to running on a bad belt) condenser is the RIGHT choice, and continuing to run on the bad belt - while it appears to work fine for now- is the WRONG choice, leading to more expensive repairs down the line.  The cheap option may appear to work, but may cause more problems later.Now, I fully believe that, if this was the case, the shop should have explained it to you.

Once again showing us that their obedience to Donald Trump puts party over country.They have, time and time again, showcased their allegiance to the Trump brand and image, and so much so, that they not only fail to hold him responsible for his crimes and misconduct, but also try frantically to make him out to be the victim of all circumstances.Here's the simple fact, if you take Trump out of the equation, January 6th never happens, it really is that simple.For months leading up to the election, and since thereafter, Trump has promoted election denying propaganda, lies, misinformation and conspiracy theories. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, his lies, his denial, his fruitless legal battles, his violence inciting language, and his invitation to his supporters helped facilitate the events of January 6th. He is predominantly responsible for what transpired on that fateful day.And this is just one aspect of the January 6th investigation's findings.The investigation showed that many Trump supporters did indeed bring weapons with them to the Capitol. However, the magnetometers in place prevented hundreds from bringing those weapons with them into the grounds and rally area.Testimony revealed that Donald Trump knew about these weapons. Trump reportedly claimed that his supporters weren't \\"here to hurt him,\\" and that they should \\"take the fucking mags away,\\" he continued, \\"let my people in, they can march to the capital from here. Let the people in, take the fucking mags away.\\"The investigation also revealed Trump's inaction as events were unfolding. It was reported that for 187 minutes, Trump refused to take any public action to stop the violence.During this time, Trump was watching the events unfold on television from his private dining room next to the oval office. It was concluded that Trump could have stopped the violence but chose not to.Before I continue, let's address the right wing narrative that accuses Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for what happened.Loudermilk's recent report conveniently blames Nancy Pelosi for everything that transpired.Nevermind the fact that those truly responsible are the people who incited the violence, and facilitated the Capitol riot, as well as those that took action that day to clash with police and storm the Capitol.These claims that accuse Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for January 6th are not supported by the facts. Indeed, Pelosi did not have the authority to activate the National Guard, this power lies with the president, The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the army.In fact, records show that Pelosi approved a previous request for National Guard support, and continued pushing for their deployment when delays occurred.Yet still, the MAGA movement has continued to scapegoat Democrats and so called \\"radical leftist\\" groups, while whitewashing and downplaying the events of that day and promoting January 6th conspiracy theories.  Fox contributor Monica Crowley posted on social media last January, 3 years ago today, the System manufactured a riot at the Capitol to crush the powerful America First movement, frame President @realDonaldTrump and prevent him from winning again.Instead of holding Trump accountable, the recent report targets members of the January 6th investigation, Liz Cheney in particular: What caused the third-highest-ranking member of the House Republican Conference, a woman on track to be House Speaker or perhaps more, to turn against an honest and true man like Donald Trump and commit terrible crimes against MAGA? What exactly happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that exposed the security failures?These rhetorical questions serve only to direct blame away from Trump and reinforce far right conspiracy theories.The Wyoming GOP censured Cheney for her participation in the investigation and later made a statement promoting some of these false theories. In its February 2021 complaint against Cheney, the Wyoming state GOP noted that ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.Republicans also claim that Hutchinson was a tampered witness and her claims were unsubstantiated because she refused to take counsel from her MAGA-funded lawyer.Trump called Hutchinson a \\"total phony\\" and \\"leaker\\" because she spoke out against him. The entirety of their case against Hutchinson is based purely on Republicans simply not liking what she had to say.The January 6 investigation also revealed the following: - Donald Trump conspired to overturn the election, took actions to \\"defraud the United States\\" and disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans.  \\n- He also attempted to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, including Jeffrey Clark, who would support his unfounded claims of election fraud and try to use the power of the justice department to overturn the election results. Justice officials threatened to resign if Clark was given the position. \\n- Trump also pressured state officials to change the outcome of the election in their states.  \\n- Trump and his allies attempted a fake elector scheme designed to generate and submit slates of fake electors In several key states to replace the legitimate electors certified by those states.  \\n- He also pressured and intimidated Mike Pence to reject the certified electoral votes in Congress.  And at the risk of repeating myself, Trump and his defenders often focus on a couple of lines delivered by Trump on January 6th during his rally outside the Capitol. They claim that moments taken from this one speech absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. But this is disingenuous and absurd.Months leading up to the election, Donald Trump made excessive speeches, posted a slew of emotional tirades on social media, and repeated over and over again false claims about a stolen election. His rhetoric was incendiary, he spread countless lies and droves of misinformation, he promoted propaganda and conspiracy theories, and invited his supporters to the Capitol. All of these actions and more incited his supporters to violence, mobilized organized extremist groups, and set the stage for January 6th. To think otherwise is beyond ignorant.And to have the audacity to place blame at the feet of anyone else, can only be contributed to fanatical behavior and extreme narrow-mindedness.","title":"January 6 was part of an attempted coup detat in America.

But this was not because of traitor tRUMP, but because of the changes Obama made. Now traitor tRUMP took credit for those changes, but traitor tRUMP never made those changes.  The last year of traitor tRUMP s presidency was when America began to see the major mistakes traitor tRUMP made while being president, because that last year of traitor tRUMPs America went down the toilet quite rapidly.  traitor tRUMPs changes were so horrific that it carried over into Bidens first three years as president.  Biden was able to correct a lot of the destruction in 2.5 years that traitor tRUMP did to America.  Now, what will happen next is that traitor tRUMP will take credit for the economy recovering even though he didnt do a damn thing to make it better as it was all Bidens success.  Nevertheless, traitor tRUMP will take credit for it, because thats the person traitor tRUMP is.

Any attempt to codify ethics is an attempt to optimize for a certain intended outcome. If you want the human race to survive the middle ages so we can get to a point in time where cars and modern medicine exist, you need to establish certain norms of morality - murder is bad, family/community values are good, etc. The morals didn't come from a mindset of wanting to establish objective Realism, they came from wanting to optimize for an outcome, which is, in short, mortality rates. But you can theoretically argue that what outcome we should strive for is subjective.That being said, we do know there is some scientific basis for where our intuitive morals and moral reasoning come from. The prefrontal cortex and amygdala are engaged when someone uses moral reasoning or empathy, oxytocin is linked to trust, bonding and pro social reasoning. This indicates a biological underpinning to some of our moral frameworks. The anthropological observation of cultures isolated from one another both arriving to the conclusion of murder being a moral crime indicates a universality and perhaps, by extension, an objective nature to the belief.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"I still think that they knew he was declining all the way back in 2016 and that's why Obama didn't want him to run.

Of course morality is something that humans invented. It's a social concept, not physics. So I guess there's nothing to argue about that part really. We obviously aren't born with an innate idea of what morality is and we need to be taught what morality is. But still most (healthy) humans have a sense of what is hurtful or beneficial to other living beings. Concerning the subjectivity part: the word is defined as \\"principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour.\\" or \\"the extent to which an action is right or wrong.\\"In which I would argue, that \\"right\\" means: it's beneficial to one or several people while \\"wrong\\" means: it hurts one or several people.Neither are subjective. We can always tell if something is morally reprehensible or morally commendable. If you disagree I'd prompt you to provide me with an example of where that isn't the case. You can't just say you won't provide an example, because otherwise it's not possible to change your mind.

No? Okay, let me explain.  \\nThere are many institutions like this, but Elan was in a class of its own. It was a place where parents could send their childrenfor around $50,000 a year. They even had connections with the court system, so parents would often send their kids there to avoid prison, even for minor offenses.Elan was supposed to help kids and teenagers, but in reality, it was a nightmare. It was a place full of mental and physical abuse, even torture. Im not exaggeratingits practices were modeled on cults. Students were forced to fight each other in a boxing ring, humiliated, and dehumanized. They were even kept there against their will after turning eighteen, leaving them mentally broken by the end.All visits and calls with parents were monitored.  \\nAnd all that money? It went to staff salaries, making the founder rich, and funding programs designed to manipulate parents and hunt down runaways. People who tried to expose what was happening were blackmailed and intimidated. The school also had a history of deaths, including a boy who tried to kill himself with a pencil.Older students were forced into unpaid labor in the founders house. They were also coerced into telling visiting parents how wonderful Elan was, or they risked losing all their \\"progress\\" in the program.Elan School was created to abuse children and make a profit off it. They broke countless lives and directly or indirectly caused the deaths of many innocent people.So now Im asking you: can this in any way be called just *subjectively* evil?

I have had a lot more overt racism leveled towards me in Trinidad where my mom's from (think being called a half breed, mutt, etc.). HOWEVER. The US is FULL of people who are 1000% percent convinced that they absolutely cannot be racist because they don't say the n word and say \\"I believe everyone is equal\\". I have had so many grown ass adults reach out and grab my hair here and see absolutely nothing wrong with that because they're not racist, how could they be? They like black people, they have black friends. They just think my hair is pretty. That shit would not fly in Trinidad. I watched a guy who was drunkenly hitting on my cousin get told off by strangers in Trinidad. In the US people \\"politely\\" turn the other way when they watch racism happen \\"to avoid conflict\\" because it doesn't look like \\"real\\" racism to them.ETA: I've also been called a mutt/half breed etc in the US, but always in situations where the person could \\"get away with it\\". Mostly by children, and mostly when I was a child and didn't know how to defend myself. It's also important to note that when trinis called me a mutt they often included themself in that definition or said they were \\"also a mixed breed\\".

You already could recover those costs  if it was discovered that they lied to you for monetary gain. Making it a crime is useless for several reasons, but most importantly it would never be possible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the diagnosis was intentional rather than an honest mistake. You really can't make honest mistakes criminal. It would essentially never be taken to trial. It's actually *better* for the world if they have to worry about the lower civil court standard of evidence finding them in the wrong and paying you back with punitive damages if evidence suggests it was willful. But another reason it's useless is that most specialists don't actually tell you you \\"need something\\". They can \\"recommend\\" a particular solution to the problem all the way, and this would just codify that. If they literally lie when you ask if that's the cheapest way to get the noise to stop or something, again you can already recover money lost to fraud.

Unless the mechanic you visited tore it down and verified that it wasn't actually bad (he didn't, I can guarantee that), the first mechanic may have actually been correct.

Especially when we have caught them so many times fucking us over without any help from the media or our other elected officials.Again, Donald Trump is the most relatable candidate available that normal, every day people can relate to. Thats why Kamala thought she could tour the country and tell people shes from the middle class and win by a landslide. Youre gonna see exactly what Im sayin again in 2028 with JD Vance because again, he is relatable to average citizens.","title":"Does what Trump did is acknowledged by the Americans voting him?"},{"text":" That was elegantly done.Yes, I too am enjoying the classiness as we walk into fascism and a potential Sunday drive towards dictatorship.

Instead, they say Satan is a metaphor for questioning authority, and grounding your beliefs in science. The sense of community around these shared values makes it a religion, they say.\\nThey do use the symbols of Satan for rituals - for example when celebrating a wedding or adopting a new name. That might include having an upside-down neon cross on your altar while shouting: Hail Satan! - [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65549975.amp)The purpose of this group is to call out the hypocrisy of a nation that claims it honors its constitution yet allows law makers to ignore it. Hence the display, its not to promote devil worship but to grab your attention to say if youre offended by this guess how we feel and invites the hypocrites to respond. The folks blaming Walz are guiltily of allowing this to happen when they opened the door to Christian displays or the Ten Commandments, yet curiously excluded a Torah, or Quran.

I guess thats easy to do when you lie about things being bad in the first place.The #1 thing I heard over and over again for 2-3 weeks after the election was, \\"look at how well the stock market responded after Trump won. Looks like businesses are happy!\\" Like I had a sub who I only share polite pleasantries with feel like it was safe to dick ride Trump in front of me while shitting on another older liberal teacher who expressed their worry about the effect deportation and tariffs will have on the economy. I had to stop the dude and argue against him and it was instantly clear he hadn't really thought anything through.1. Ya the stock market boomed for a few days, which likely had more to do with the election not being close, the election not being contested, and there being no protesting or violence. Every person I talked to was freaking out saying they thought Republicans AND DEMOCRATS were going to contest the election of they lost despite there only being clear evidence of one party attempting an actual fucking coup. 2. Dude was bragging that \\"I made $20000 last week\\". I reminded him he's only actually made that money if he's sold his stock. Did he? No of course not that his retirement plan, he can't sell that stock! Well then you didn't earn shit. Your bank isn't gonna give you a spiffy 1% interest loan on that money either, that reserved for the oligarchs, not for use average Joe's. 3. I also reminded him that many of the stocks that did so well, like Tesla, are basically performing as meme like crypto currency at this point. People are buying stock based on vibes and political loyalty, and not only how some of these companies are actually performing. The Tesla rollout of the cyber truck compounded with almost a half decade of declining quality with all their other models. I talked to him about Dogo Coin and how the price basically is entirely dependent on jokes and influencer support and I asked him if he would be comfortable investing $20k into something like that. \\"Absolutely not, that sounds like a terrible idea.\\" Well that's what you're doing when you buy and hold stock in Tesla at this point. 4. And to bring it all home, I asked him what he thought the impact of tariffs and mass deportations would have on inflation, our economy, and the stock market. He immediately led off with, \\"well I don't think Trump's gonna actually do any of that.\\" I reminded him that Trump at the very least attempted to do everything he promised he would during his first term (except work on infrastructure). Now Trump's only bring in yes men, has an money purse in Musk promising to spend millions to unseat at Republican in Congress that doesn't do as Trump says, and he has at least 5 seats on the supreme Court that either fully support his ideology, or are personally reliant on him for the seats they hold. He's gonna do what he wants. And that ignoring the fact that your voting for someone who you think won't uphold his two major election promises. Says alot about a person. Fact is if either deportations or tariffs come into play, our economy is gonna be toast and inflation will once again be the word of the day. Some fun days on the stock market back in November won't change that.","title":"GOP Cheers Hakeem Jeffries For Saying Trump Won  Until He Notes Which Party Is Home To Election Deniers"},{"text":"And yet they get elected.....??","title":"The House GOP Has Been Ungovernable For More Than A Decade"},{"text":"Lets  not forget  trumps people gaining access to the vote counting machines software multiple times.

Daughter seems to whisper \\"I voted for you\\""},{"text":"So, I was a lifelong Liberal (although Im only 30 now). I was a liberal because I was anti-establishment and I grew up during the Bush presidency so there was a strong anti-government sort of vibe to the Democrat party. As a young adult I felt that Republicans were this paternalistic, evangelical party who were just miserable, stuffy rich people who wanted to control everyones personal lives (this was peak gay marriage political discourse time) and put their noses in everyones business. Social issues like abortion, gay marriage, weed legalization were my main focuses- I was a teenager. I remember the 2016 election, I was pregnant with my first baby and my husband and I have always watched all the presidential debates. I was set up to viciously hate Trump- hes this millionaire, big ego, washed up actor who just wants his 15 minutes of fame at the expense of fucking up an election. I do remember a few moments where I was like wow, wait, I kind of liked that point but I brushed it away. No, we hate him. When he got elected I cried and posted on Facebook that he was probably going to start an annual hunger games ??. When his 100 day plan was published, my husband and I went to the mall and read it, and both said okay, this is all very reasonable, maybe it wont be so bad and that was all rhetoric and hes going to take it seriously. Okay, we will calm down. Most of his presidency goes by with us feeling fine about him. He has several huge controversies but we are getting older and realizing a lot of that is just the media blowing stuff out of proportion. Something I always say is If you are telling the truth, you dont have to make any part of it up or blow it out of proportion for people to believe you- and I find myself saying this often to my husband- look at this article. The headline is X but I watched that speech and he didnt say that! The context was X! There are plenty of things to hate about trump, I just wish we could focus on those real things and not make up storiesthis is propaganda. Then COVID happens. Lets set the stage. I have a 2 year old, 1 year old and a newborn baby. And the local government is all of a sudden forcing women to give birth alone in the hospital, labor with a mask on. Partners cannot be there with them. Babies are separated from mothers who are positive with no symptoms. The POLICE are taking the swings off of the swing sets at our local parks and GUARDING THEM WITH GUNS to keep families like mine from getting any fresh air or playtime. I was immediately enraged- this is so Big Brother, the fucking police? We hate the police! Surely my fellow Liberals are enraged as well. Lets organize! This is unjust! This is insanity! Nope.I looked around and suddenly I just realized everything. That my wealthier, liberal friends were perfectly happy in their 500K houses with huge playsets in the fenced in back yard. They didnt care that the parks were closed. They didnt care that babies were being separated from their mothers. They werent anti-police when the police were protecting their ideals. They were happy. They were not actually anti-establishment, they wanted *their* establishment. Freedom of choice only applied to fetuses and sexuality, not living breathing families who wanted to make their own choices with their health. This sent me into a research hole. I wanted to go back and look into everything I thought was awful about Trump and see if it really even happened. What I found was shocking. Almost everything was made up. It was just propaganda. Then I felt so betrayed by everyone. The media was 100% made up of left winged organizations and journalists and there was no way to get any real information from them. And I didnt want to go to Fox News because thats right winged media. Why is there no genuinely neutral media? Why are people not allowed to draw their own conclusions? Why am I not supposed to think for myself?(I was also postpartum and an underplaying how deeply disturbing this was for me. I cried a lot. I felt very fearful. But Ive worked through it now. )So in 2020 I went to the polls and voted for Trump because *they* didnt want me to so badly that they had fed me propaganda for years just to keep me from doing it. It felt so good. I was still angry. He lost. I was bummed but had reached enough maturity that I knew no matter who the president was, things dont change too much for the common folk in 4 years. And this year I voted for him again. And I dont cite specific policies or platforms as my reason because although I follow those things and generally agree with him on most issues (there are some stand outs that I disagree on)- Ill never get over that feeling of like the powers that be have *conspired against me, a citizen* to *trick me* into not considering one of the two candidates in a sacred American election.  That is unforgivable to me and I will always vote for the person that is so scary to the establishment that they try to force you not to vote for him.","title":"Why did you vote Trump?"},{"text":"Tho some are saying that Johnson getting the Speakership in 1 vote is a bad sign.","title":"The House GOP Has Been Ungovernable For More Than A Decade"},{"text":"Imagine how it feels to be one of so many daughters, whose Dad doesn't care about your right to fundamental freedom of your body.?","title":"Kamala Harris swears in Republican Sen.

Start moving the Overton window back to where it should be and start embracing the policies that the majority of Americans want. 3) the Dems are having a hard time giving up the old guard and the old ways of doing things. Jasmine Crockett went on MSNBC and hit it out of the park on this issue. \\"Seniority vs who is RIGHT for the position\\". \\"We lost an election and the people are looking to us to shake things up to help move the country forward.\\" Yet here they are doing the same shit they've been doing for decades. Number 2 we have got to get a handle on NOW. We are NOT united as a group regarding our messaging and it's killing us. Pelosi, while a great whip, is whipping votes in the WRONG DIRECTION. While Leader Jeffries is new at his current position, he is not new in Congress. Jeffries needs to be setting the tone for the House Dems but he can't because Pelosi (and others) are still playing politics (pun intended) behind closed doors. Then again, Jeffries was Pelosi's protege, so maybe I'm asking too much of him. That's not ok anymore. We're tired of deals being made in the smoke filled back rooms of Congress that only lead to incremental change because \\"oh! The other half of the country isn't ready yet!\\". Or rules for us but not them. And if they can't stop doing that, then they need to go (or in Pelosi's case sit down and let Jeffries and his crew do what they need to do). They literally need to show and prove. Screw the Republicans. It's not about \\"beating them\\" per say, it's about moving this country forward with or WITHOUT them. And the first step towards doing that is to STOP doing things by seniority (\\"it's their turn\\"), let your party vote for whomever for leadership without people putting their thumbs on the scale, and get everyone on the same message. Don't vote for a damn thing unless the Republicans are going to be bipartisan AND it's effective change. Make them whip their own party together if they want to forward their agenda. Don't hold backdoor meetings with them, don't have lunch, don't even say \\"bless you\\" when they sneeze. Let them own this bullshit that's about to happen. \\"Ohh the Dems won't govern.\\" WHO CARES WHAT THEY THINK?!

My mother's side of the family were firm Democrats and my Father's side are republicans. My dad used to tell me the craziest things that were happening 15 years ago before he passed, and I used to tell him he was dumb and didn't want to believe anything. (Things about how they were trying to brainwash kids, force sex changes on people, pretty much all this 'woke' stuff that has actually happened all these years later.) It just sounded so dumb that I thought there was no way anyone would do this stuff.Regardless. I started following a bit in 2016. Became a Bernie bro. I'm from NH, he's right over in VT. I liked how he talked. I didn't care about policies yet. If I did, probably wouldn't have been so into him. But a lot of people around here were on the Bernie bus, and being a great speaker just won me over. Then I watched as they stole the campaign from him. My mother's side of the family all switched red. My grandma who voted blue for like 60 years wanted Trump, same with my mother. I voted red for the first time because they screwed Bernie over. Hilary seemed like the most evil person in the world, and she was their presidential nominee.At this point, I follow politics a lot more. I don't ignore the stupidity anymore. As time has passed, everything my father preached was pretty much this 'woke' movement that I thought was retarded 10 years ago. The next election, Biden got no primary votes and everyone dropped out and endorsed him over Bernie, once again screwing the person they wanted to be a presidential candidate. Yet they think that Trump is a threat to democracy. I don't know how you can be a democrat. I am embarrassed that I once voted for Obama. But I think I had only voted once prior to 2016, so I think I'm at 1 time blue, 3 time red. So forgive me for my sin. How could you possibly be blue with the shit you see all over the internet? Trump is taking women's rights away... No one would ever let that happen. I can't wrap my head around the fact that anyone supports the Democratic Party. I'm assuming they just don't follow the policies like I used to be guilty of. Or the only thing they care about is the trans thing and abortion thing.  \\nThis election, there wasn't even a need to think on it. The economy is a big one, but even I can understand it's pretty messed up all over the world right now. Immigration is a big problem. Every time Kamala was asked about it, she went on to talk about how Trump shot down a bill to make the laws more strict, but never said she wanted to do anything about it herself. She's for illegals from everything I've ever seen on her. The women's right to protect their body or w/e is just bullshit. Almost everyone agrees on the whole rape, incest, life of the mother abortion thing. She just wants to make it legal to abort a baby if they change their mind last minute, crazy.

Could a party like that help tether both parties to more moderate middle ground and help weaken the more extreme on both sides?Probably not, but it does make me question the vilification of the middle.

Trump ran again. The question on that is why? He has billions and has no reason to put himself through any of this and even put his life on the line.  If it were me, I know I wouldn't.  So I believe it when he says he is trying to fix America and hasn't seen any evidence to the contrary.\\n4 years ago, I watched as they installed Biden as president.  I could see with my own eyes how mentally declined he was, then even though they kept telling us he wasn't, this got worse as time went on and how the When something come out that was corrupt it would get quickly denied and denounced by high up in the government only later to be exposed a true and shrugged off with no consequences.When Harris was made VP, I could see how unqualified and incompetent she was, and I really started to wonder who was really running the country. Then they waited till after the primaries and installed Harris as the front runner and told everyone this is who you're voting for and she is going to win.  (This is how corrupt third-world countries work)\\nHarris.... every time she spoke without a script, I could see how ineptit she was.

She was nothing more than the puppet of a corrupted  government state.\\nI fully believe trump has this countries best interest in mind and is truly seeking to right the sinking ship.

Theres tons of H1B visa workers. And unfortunately, theyre akin to modern day slaves. Theyre stuck in their position for years in end because they cant leave the firm while their visa is in process. The firms know this and work them to the bone. They then also pay them the minimum they can get away with. I worked with a guy who was in this process and he was miserable. Id always talk to him about life and how things were, since we were in different cities. He hated it because he couldnt leave (hed lose the progress on the visa and have to go back to china) which took away all his leverage. If that wasnt bad enough, they loaded him up with work and he barely had time for a personal life. This, plus theyre just eroding the accounting profession at an alarming rate. Theyre offshoring work more and more every year. And charge the same rates while trying to lower cost (which doesnt always work because some offshore teams are a lot worse than others). What were seeing in tech and with musk, Vivek, and the H1B is a broader issue thats now getting the attention it deserves. The other thing about it I dont understand is this: I thought a part of the process was to show that a US citizen couldnt do the work, and they needed to bring someone in. Maintaining a shit culture where people dont want to be modern day slaves shouldnt count. Then they list job listings knowing theyll never hire someone.","title":"Trump/Elon Increasing H1B Visas will be devastating for American Tech workers"},{"text":"In a sane and just world enforce the 14th amendment section 3.

I was nearly a Never Trumper when he became the nominee in 2016 but ultimately voted for him because he was running against Hillary Clinton and I was convinced it was a binary choice and while Clinton would probably spend every moment in office doing things I didn't like, Trump at that point was enough of an \\"unknown\\" that there was a chance he might do some things I agreed with.  I think what a lot of people forget is that many of the Never Trumpers were originally such because Trump had a long history of supporting Democrats and coming out for things like gun control and single payer health care and his \\"I love debt\\" comments.  Also his anti-entitlement reform position was a deal breaker for me but I was ultimately persuaded that he might sign a repeal of the Affordable Care Act into law and might be brought on board for something like phasing in a higher retirement age on entitlement programs so I rolled the dice and voted for him.I thought he was a pretty terrible president during his first term.  A lot of Republicans I know said that he was better than expected but their expectations must have been even lower than mine.  He continually created drama and dysfunction because he refused how to learn how to do things and showed no interest in learning how to be better at his job.  He set a record for the most debt added by a President in a single term and I watched the debate over the Affordable Care Act repeal pretty closely and I blame him even more than McCain switching his vote for the result because at the same time Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell were trying to get Republicans to cast votes that they knew would cost them their seats, he was tweeting that their bills were \\"mean\\" and that he might night sign it - basically cutting them off at the knees.Fast forward to Covid and I was initially supportive when I saw him come out for Operation Warp Speed to get a vaccine approved in months rather than years as a lot of his critics said it would take.  But then Trump had to be Trump and at a time when we needed a President to project calm and stability to get the country through a crisis, there was chaos and unnecessary fighting.  I should point out that Tim Walz was my governor and even though I never and would never vote for him (his handling of the riots being a big reason), he was great on public messaging during Covid even if I disagreed with the length of the lockdowns.  I almost didn't vote for him again but Democrats were openly saying that they planned to expand the Supreme Court and make Puerto Rico and Washington DC new states so them winning in 2020 was basically them setting the stage so that they'd never be out of power again.  So I held my nose and voted for him a second time.Trump lost the election and while I saw some irregularities, it was no different than any other election which never go off flawlessly.  His only basis for claiming \\"fraud\\" was because he lost and by embracing his lies, Republicans set back the cause of election integrity because it looked like we were just being sore losers (which Trump was).  He also screwed up our chances to win at least one of the runoff elections in Georgia which would have given us the Senate and blocked a lot of Biden's legislation but he put his own ego first.  I also came to see from working in Republican politics locally that he was bringing out the worst in our party not just by the behavior of some of his supporters (I do blame him in large part for January 6th) but by pushing terrible candidates who either lost elections and cost us winnable seats or if they got elected, were pretty worthless when it came to advancing substantive policy issues or just outright embarrassments.I voted for Nikki Haley in the primary (almost voted for Ron DeSantis) and when she dropped out, I almost skipped the election entirely because I didn't see the Republican Party in its current form as worth supporting across-the-board as I did before because it is no longer a classical liberal / conservative policy but a strong man populist one.  But ultimately I decided that I would continue to support down ticket candidates that were not MAGA and voted for our legislative and Congressional candidates and did a write-in for President and Senate.  I have no intention of ever voting Democrat but I plan to vote selectively for Republican candidates from now.","title":"Why did you vote Trump?"},{"text":"I love how these assholes can find all this information on each \\"terrorist\\" but can't find anything on the Las Vegas shooter.","title":"Whats in Fort Bragg?"},{"text":"Well I can commit massive fraud then?

Many of MAGA solely missed that time. Just look at the Chiefs' kicker Harrison Butker. He told an auditorium full of college graduating women that they shouldn't have even gone to college and that a women's place is beside her husband cooking and raising children. MAGA sees the 1950s and wants to get back to that.","title":"NY Judge in Trump hush money case expected to sentence him to 'unconditional discharge'"},{"text":"Actually its not a founders issuethe book I suggest in my post covers it in detail.Basically, its a solely AMERICAN invention. The modern GOP, and a lot of the religiosity we saw on Jan 6th has its roots in slave owning theology of Americas past.See, following Jesus teachings makes it hard to own another human. Considering Jesus was a first century Jewish man - The Exodus narrative would have been a big deal for Him.When Americas slave owning south wished to maintain their faith but sidestep the slavery aspect they framed the slavery in a way that made it theologically palatable. They even went further and crafted  the Caribbean slave Bible which REMOVED a lot of narratives, including Exodus. This was given to the enslaved to get them on board with the faith, but also to frame their enslavement as divinely sanctioned.In the 1920s the KKK was at their height of popularity with over 2 million. They took that old theology and revamped it with the white nationalist aspect. In the 80s it changed to the religious right and today its what we see on our news feeds and screens.","title":"Mike Johnson Attributes Prayer to Thomas Jefferson.

She was a worthless VP and Border Czar who bypassed the primary system and refused open, unscripted tv interviews. She cant speak without questions prepared by staff and must use a teleprompter. She had zero proposed policies besides giving sex change operations to prisoners and pushing America to be more woke. It was no surprise Harris said she wouldnt do anything different than Biden did.

Christians have said to me they want to share love for Christ, but even more Christians have been unnecessarily hostile when learning I'm not Christian. The nice Christian comments are outnumbered by the negative.\\nThe prospect of a theocracy, enforcing Christianity, doesn't have a good history. Theocracies have a history of lacking benevolence. None of this would bring people closer to Christ. It repells people to make the Bible a tool to punish enemies as would inevitably happen in a theocracy. If the Bible speaks against it, why are they doing it? Why are they also not bothered by literal golden idols being created of Trump, like at CPAC in 2021?\\nIt makes me wonder if they actually read their Bibles, or if they only listen to the failable words of their preachers with blind faith. Does the Bible say anything about that behavior? I'd be open to going to church quite honestly, but too many Christians now can be the cruelest people. That's a sad observation; I thought Christians were instructed to be kind? Don't use force of law to impose Christian faith on the country, and more people might convert.

He warned them not to believe anyone who says they saw or spoke to him in the wilderness, that they were lying.  He said he would not appear TO ANYONE until he appeared to all.  So there are no witnesses to his claims on the road to Damascus to kill Jesus followers.  Not a single one of his men with him personally vouched this occurred.  Only from the lips of Paul/Saul.  The provision was made for a symbolically complete number 12.  Not 13.  Not 14.  12.Further, I do not believe in a triad of gods and godhead.  There is only one GOD and he has a son he made.  By my count that's 2 and they are as separate as any Father and Son as individual persons.  Do not be deceived.

First, I got real tired of seeing/ encountering ppl who said that if you support X then you are Y and should be cancelled/fired/exiled from society.  That approach is horrifically damaging to society as a whole, to critical thinking, to families.  It has to stop.  And the Ds would just continue to make it worse.  Second, the trans issue.  Someone close to me has been sucked in to this &amp; the way the medical establishment handles it is reprehensible.  It has to stop.  Harris's support for the trans agenda, per her 2019 ACLC questionnaire answer #14, would just make it worse.  Third, censorship.  I abhor it, and always have.  The Biden administration's Ministry of Truth alone is enough to make me not vote for them.  The numerous statements Harris and Walz made about restrictions on free speech are chilling.  Fourth, Harris's overt enjoyment of power over ordinary Americans is stomach-turning.  If you haven't watched the MAHA ad that shows her talking about how she loved ruining parents' lives over their kids' truancy, just to put $ in the California school district, you should.  It really seems like she despises ordinary Americans and feels she is above them. Fifth, I was not a huge Trump fan before, but I watched the entire Joe Rogan interview, and am convinced he is a lot smarter and kinder than he has been portrayed as over the years.  He had a lot of really interesting points that I had never heard before on many issues.  I think the long format discussion is great for him.Sixth, the assassination attempt.  Jesus, what a response.  Brought tears to my eyes.  He is in his heart dedicated to making things better.  Even if he doesn't speak correctly, I am convinced his heart is in the right place.  Who among us would respond like that?? And to just keep doing the rallies -- he has balls of steel and a heart of gold.  Seventh, the federal agencies have been captured by globalist and corporate interests.   They do not serve the American people.  The entire establishment needs to be shut down/blown up.  Since Chevron has been invalidated, a huge proportion of federal agency regulations are invalid.  The agencies' powers and scopes need to be severely reduced. There is no way any D is going to do that.  Eighth, the DEI agenda has gone too far and needs to be dismantled.  At my work I am pressured not to hire candidates in certain demographic groups, and to put my pronouns in my email signature, and to treat employees from certain demographic groups differently such as by providing them special opportunities.  I really dislike the hollywood agenda of having so many mixed race couples in media and that a male character can't be a strong lead even in his own show - there always has to be a woman who makes all the decisions and who is the true star.  Ninth, I am just sick of not being able to say what I want.  Like, Merry Christmas is exclusionary?? What??  It has been years since I have felt comfortable saying it.  Tenth, immigration. What has been happening is the systematic destruction of our cities and communities by flooding them with people who don't share our beliefs.  I do not want to drive through a neighborhood in Chicago and see  all the women on the street in hijabs with only their eyes showing.  I don't want a community like Springfield Ohio to have a huge influx of Haitians.  Immigrants should assimilate and adhere to the existing community standards and norms, and there should be few of them.  It is absurd that my elderly parents still have to work to survive while illegals get free housing, food, medical care, and don't have to obey any of our laws.  Every one of them should be rounded up and deported.  I am a very open-minded and kind person.  I have been instrumental in getting three foreign workers hired as permanent employees and getting them their green cards.  I am not in any way hateful or exclusionary.  And I don't *want* to have to have this world view - a lot of ppl on the right are not super nice or easy to listen to - but my brain still works so here we are.  What has been happening to America is insane and is the product of globalist and corporate capture of our institutions.  If we don't stop it, we will end up losing all our rights and 1984 will look like utopia compared to how we will have to live.  I don't know if Trump and his band of rebels can accomplish it, but they are a better shot than Harris for sure.","title":"Why did you vote Trump?"},{"text":"Or usa history","title":"\\"They dont love our country\\": Trump rages over half-mast flags for Carter | \\nCarter's passing means flags will fly at half-mast over the Capitol on Inauguration Day"},{"text":"arrest Trump\\nYou really still think this is plausible?","title":"Judge rejects Trump's motion to dismiss hush money case, sets sentencing for Jan. 10"},{"text":"We should be flying our flags upside down on Inauguration Day, this country is in for a wild ride.","title":"\\"They dont love our country\\": Trump rages over half-mast flags for Carter | \\nCarter's passing means flags will fly at half-mast over the Capitol on Inauguration Day"},{"text":"I first voted for Trump because of his America First agenda and he wasnt a politician.
