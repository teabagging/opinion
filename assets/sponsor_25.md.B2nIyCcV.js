You're right that in the sense of moral relativism, a democracy has no more pretension to authority than a dictatorship or monarchy; it too arose from some moment of plenary power where authorities chose to voluntarily limit themselves. You can see that very clearly in democracies that formed after the total collapse of a former autocracy, usually framed with names such as 'provisional government', 'constitution convention', etc.Where I would push back is that democracies do also have an element of objective value, insofar as they (in theory) offer a framework for former warring parties to pursue their interests without violence, while also offering a stake to citizens - by voluntarily seeking out buy-in from both masses and elites they have scope for legitimacy in a way an autocracy may not always (autocracies are a natural fit for an existential crisis, hence why when the crisis that birthed them recedes, they often need to manufacture a permanent siege mentality).I would also qualify your approach to the monopoly of violence. Max Weber, who coined the term, didn't use that exact phrasing - he spoke of the monopoly of *legitimate* violence. Gangs running a neighbourhood to the point where locals refuse to allow police enter; paramilitaries carving out a minor statelet... Yes, these challenge the state's monopoly of violence, but not it's *legitimate* monopoly. We still know it when we see it that those mafias or militias may exert *actual* violence and authority, but that it's a deviation from an expected rule. Sometimes, a rule is only clear once we see it broken.At the end of the day, might is right.... But not in so mechanical a way. That Game of Thrones parable is spot on: out of the monarch, the merchant and the monk, who is the one with ultimate power? Why, whoever the man with the sword listens to. The man with a sword, on his own, won't create a durable stable system - he can't permanently threaten everyone, and he needs one of those other authority figures to provide him with a story, a rationale for why his Might deserves to be listened to. Tradition, money or philosophy may all influence how Might plays out in practice. So in a sense, you're spot on that our democratic norms are convenient fictions that *could* be stripped away in a crisis or upheaval. But for as long as enough people act as if they are unchanging laws of nature, and so long as those that breach the rules are *considered* to be the exception rather than making a new rule, Might doesn't make right quite so simply. Above all else, we are creatures of habit, and it takes a lot for Might to break one set of habits and create new ones.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Thats not what he said, he was saying the comments about Puerto Rico are garbage","title":"if only Democrats toned down their rhetoric ??"},{"text":"I am definitely against people being able to buy drugs without a prescription bug thats for another day.Also I am for universal healthcare.","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"Well there's no politician that isn't lying to your face constantly.","title":"How come it is never the democrat party fault and always the people's fault who choose to vote neither party?"},{"text":"Ill make an educated assumption.

In the case of democracy, power comes from numbers controlling the will to power. It is expected you must bend the knee to convince most people to vote for you, else you are not elected to hold their collective power. This same situation shows itself in utilitarian circles, in which the moral good is just what benefits the most people. If one were to say that murdering a man would make the collective happy, would it be right? If the law said so, and the collective agrees with the law, would it suddenly be right?? That man could be innocent but if the collective believe they would be much better off with him dead, then they would deem it just. It gets into questions of defining innocence, which is just another aspect of the might makes right discussion. Would killing an objectively innocent man to please the masses be right?I would say no, but on a societal level, the answer tends to be yes. Whatever the source of power wants tends to be what is \\"right.\\" That right there is subjective morality, and why I tend to not be too swayed by utilitarian arguments in general.With that being said, what I would like to convince you on is that rather than purely just physical power, you should instead adjust it to power in general, especially in the modern era. Political power, for example, can be sources through persuasion of the masses. A powerful tongue can be mighty in its own right, and can lead to other forces of might turning on the ones who previously held power. People can be persuaded, militaries can be persuaded, and persuasion is just one example of alternative power.That would be my argument, that Power in general, not just physical might, tends to make what is \\"right.\\" In society.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Oh they do, but it will checks notes also hurt the brown people which is apparently ok.","title":"Johnson vows health care overhaul if Republicans win: No Obamacare"},{"text":"Love is broad.When life is sparked, all souls (potential humans) are born equal.

It doesn't take an election analyst to see what +3 or +4 points in all states would do. The most critical question is that since Trump wasn't on the ballot in 2022, did polls end up that way due to him, or have pollsters genuinely corrected (or even overcorrected) the errors from 2016 and 2020 which missed a lot of red voters?Figuring these things out can be very difficult, and different pollsters have  made different assumptions, as well as used slightly different methodologies to deal with their misses, and one gets different results depending on those assumptions. [This piece has a pretty good introduction](https://goodauthority.org/news/election-poll-vote2024-data-pollster-choices-weighting/).Now my own unasked for opinion: I'm cautiously optimistic that Harris will slightly outperform the polls in swing states. This is primarily due to three things: differential covid deaths, Swifty turnout and the get-out-the-vote work by the Divine Nine), but I doubt it will be as large an error as 2022.  The covid differential translates likely into around 40,000 more votes in the swing states (Upper bound around 80,000 but might under reasonable assumptions be as low as 20,000. I can expand on this reasoning if people are interested. ) The other two are definite wildcards, but harder to predict how large they'll be.","title":"Kamala Harris Wins Big If Polls Repeat 2022 Error: Election Analyst"},{"text":"The right thing is defined by what is true.

And in many rural areas there are never significant lines to vote, so no one ever considers that a plus. Why are folks so insistent that early voting is better? It's fine if you want to or it's easier for you, but it's not like this prerequisite to being the best civic participant.","title":"PLEASE Vote Early"},{"text":"To me the issue is the way it's advertised and the fact that it's all done through an app, making the layers of friction between you and losing your money almost nonexistent. I live in the rural Midwest where it's pretty common to go to the local Casino as a young adult as a place to socialize since there's not much else to do here. To go there and lose money we had to drive a half hour each way and eventually the friend group you came with would want to leave, so you're only even gonna be there for a few hours to lose money. With sports betting you download an app, sign up for an account and after that you can be gambling within second of pulling out your phone.The online/app component also amplifies how many bets you can place and what you are betting on. With a slot machine you pick which lines and how many on each then spin. Sports betting is the equivalent of having 100 slot machines directly in your pocket that you can access simultaneously at any time, there's so many different specific things to bet on with each match it's ridiculous.The advertising is definitely a problem too, maybe the biggest one honestly. If we look at the vices we consider morally questionable/in a gray area such as tobacco, alcohol, or traditional gambling, they are not allowed to advertise nearly as brazenly as sports betting currently does. Imagine if you turned on the game on Sunday, and every other Ad was someone chugging beers, smoking darts and/or pulling the lever on slots and saying \\"This could be you, look how fun this looks! Don't you want to win money and make friends?\\" people would be furious. We actually explicitly prohibit these industries from advertising this way for these exact reasons, especially during programs such as sports games where entire families will almost certainly be watching. So many of these ads have pro athletes saying they use this platform to gamble, directly targeting people who are fans of them, which includes a whole lot of young people.Honestly there's a few more reasons I'm against it in general too but this is turning into a text wall already lol. but I do think there are differences yeah.","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"Pre Trump, Republicans were usually the large the mail-in ballot group.

On your other points though:2. No Credit Cards (Prevent gambling with money people dont have)So then shouldnt we also ban credit cards for basically any purchase that could be deemed addicting, or more broadly, not financially savvy? Should liquor stores be cash/debit only since its also an addiction?For people with shopping addictions overspending on luxury goods, should we make sure Louis Vuitton only takes cash/debit? In short - how are we going to agree upon whats purchasable on credit, whether an addiction or not, if we start to deny the use of credit for things?  *Tons* of the worlds economy runs on credit, so I personally wouldnt advocate for upsetting the apple cart there. \\n3. Protect Vulnerable Bettors So are we going to set up laws that make the betting agencies/sites do what you mentioned?Even if we (somehow) agreed to laws for this, its  not up to the law to protect consumers from themselves - thats up to individual consumers. If theyre going to get themselves into debt over an addiction or worsen their lives due to an addiction, thats something the person has to take action on. Id argue that instead of limiting people, we open up more accessible support and education for those with addictions. It would be more fruitful to offer help to people who are prone to addictions than to just force them to stop one and let them potentially hop right to another. - I do think your first point in limiting ads to help limit temptation could factor in here, but helping limit temptation isnt the same as blocking things. Could we consider taxing the industry and/or taxing players where the taxation goes to fund accessible treatment?","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"I don't disagree with the general premise, and I would say we should tax the industry heavily to pay for treatment programs and fund education. Your approach is a solid start to reducing the damage gambling addicts can cause to their finances, but it ultimately isn't enough unless measures are taken to educate people to avoid gambling and to treat gambling addicts. In general, I tend to preach the differences between dependency and addiction with my patients, as it relates to chemicals, but behavioral addictions are very similar. Ultimately, the problem is the underlying issue that causes someone to be an addict. These are coping mechanisms, and addicts of drugs, gambling, sex, etc are typically treating their despair, PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc with something. Society needs to work on fixing issues that create addicts, but we can definitely educate people who have addictive risk factors to avoid gambling, and we can support treatment programs for addicts.","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"What is said in back rooms is said on the mic by Biden","title":"Biden's 'garbage' comment due to 'missing apostrophe': White House"},{"text":"Punching a bully and watching them whine is underrated.","title":"Harris vows to serve 'all Americans,' trying to limit damage from Biden comment"},{"text":"Oh, to give you a brighter view on the world:I mentioned in another comment, but I think the reason people dislike the idea of \\"might makes right\\" is because incompetent people often acquire power.

We are an international target. We've had years of social media influence via bot farms. We have 5000x more global responsibility than your country, and are 10000x a bigger target to manipulate either via international unrest/war, or via propaganda influence. Super easy to sit up there in Canada and cast stones when your country has no major global influence.    PS much of your economy and safety depends on the well-being of the United States.

Im entering this sub to have a conversation and not be screamed at. Please respond to me if youre willing to have a discussion.Here are some of my political stances:-I dont want my taxpayer money to fund the genocide in Gaza, and I agree that the United States is appeasing Israel and letting its macro geopolitical justification (balancing Iranian power) allow unprecedented uncontested brutality from Israel on multiple ethnic and national minorities.-I support everyones right to bodily autonomy and the right to plan the start of your parenthood for the sake of your children. I believe everyones rights extend precisely to the point where someone elses rights begin.-I believe we are far behind on climate change mitigation initiatives. I believe even our most radical actions in restructuring our energy use will take decades before we see results.-I believe in leadership presence. So dont get me wrong, I understand Harris is ultimately running as the highest profile puppet for the machine that is the Democratic Party and she was chosen quickly by other party elites. I also believe that her WORDS and her public presence make her a very strong role model. Not her support of American imperialism, Im only talking about her presence (a commonality with many Democrats). We all know in terms of character, in terms of blatant racism and fascist speech, Trump is a bad role model. I am not trying to make the lesser of two evils argument here. Im talking about the support base condoning the leadership of a blatant bigot. Trump winning teaches everybody that his lines of thinking are acceptable. I know you know that, because youd use the same logic with the Dems (and youd be right).So Im not here to convince anyone to vote for Harrisit is your right to abstain. I want to ask what your plan is in terms of organizing under a second Trump term. Whats your plan for 2028? Do you think you will be able to form a successful third party? And how? I will join you if so, but I know it will be more difficult to organize under a Trump administration.If we REALLY want to break away from the Democratic Party, planning for the next election starts NOW. Not a year before the election. Let me know, respectfully, if you resonate with this or disagree.

Nonetheless, I believe that religion provides community, which is something that is essentially hard to create, and significantly important to many.More to the point, I think that two things should be heavily considered when discussing the Quran: 1) as a functioning government upon the religions conception, the Quran contains many rules that feel dated, but we're also intended to be pragmatic standards for organizing a society at the time; 2) we have vast historic evidence for when and under what circumstances the Quran was written, as well as a plethora of evidence regarding the life of Muhammad. Furthermore , the \\"revelations\\" are not chronological, nor were they conceived in one instance, which means there is a context to it. As you will be reading it soon, I suggest you consider learning the context when interrogating the text, or at least read the Sunnah in tandem.Crucially, there are several practicing Muslims who are in no way as extreme as is often painted in the media, and communal discussion is a significant part of many Muslim societies.  For example, there is literally the concept ijma, which refers to community consensus, which is consequently the secondary source of sharia law for many as well.Fundamentally, I believe that your \\"empirical data\\" is actually just the loudest voice in the room. There are several good people who practice Islam, and I think they are all beautiful for their steadfast belief in something that matters to them.

When the Supreme Court decision of Buckley vs. Valeo made bribing legal, and the Bank of Boston decision also gave corporations and banks the right to bribe politicians, it opened the door for the first lobbying shop, started by Black, Gates, and Manafort.  They then got an actor named Reagan to run for president. They stole that election as well by working with Iran to delay the release of the hostages until after the election, ensuring Carter lost. And guess what? After Reagan won, Donald Trump was so impressed with their tactics he became their first client.  Black, Stone, and Gates were arrested and became convicted felons, and guess who pardoned all of them? Yeah, Trump. This scheme goes so far back.

WTF","title":"F--k Apathy: Jon Stewart Is Focused on Donald Trumps Demagoguery"},{"text":"I think this mostly ends up being a word game. What do you define as \\"might\\"? I would consider it the ability to get what you want, in which case your point is almost true by definition. Those that didn't get what they wanted died. Societies that wanted growth and had the ability to achieve it are the only ones left for you to be born into.Now, I'm going to try to change your view on this being cynical. What *would* you consider to be \\"right\\" in the first place? There will always be scarcities if not in food, then money, then compute, then entropy. If two peoples' desires cannot both be fulfilled, there are really only two solutions: they cooperate and change their desires, or they find out who is mightier. If you're in the weaker position and are rational, you should be trying to cooperate with the other. Frankly, *you're in the wrong and deserve to get blasted* if you try to fight a losing battle.Things are a little more interesting when there's less information available or precommitments. Precommitments are risky, as people make mistakes, idiots happen, or you could be missing information. For example, Japan committed to winning the second war or killing far too many people during their downfall, which led to getting two cities nuked. However, North Korea's sabre-rattling has warned off its southern neighbor. I think this is generally *not* a good strategy, because rewarding that kind of behavior leads to more and more precommitments, and then suddenly you have the first war all over again.It's also possible for wars to start due to a lack of information. Remember, Aumann's agreement theorem only works if both people start with the same priors. It's very likely that telling another state about your secret weapons will make them much less effective, thus two states can be confidently incorrect in their ability to win and not tell each other.This is perhaps my cynical viewpoint: I don't think there's really a solution to this. You could try for arbitration; maybe states reveal their secret weapons to a third party that decides who would actually win. Even forgetting that such a group is unlikely to ever exist, any rational person should glamorize in this case. \\"My weapons are probably better, but I won't say more in the unlikely chance they aren't.\\" Right now, it seems states just engage in proxy wars to feel out each other's power, and perhaps this is the only solution.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Not OP but there are multiple ways you could argue in favor or against these things.

A central bureaucrat cannot predict exactly what a teacher needs / wants in her class.  My wife is a teacher, and every teacher is going to do things a little differently.  So you let them pick and choose what they want, within limits of course, to run their classroom. There's always going to be large variations in the materials each teacher wants for her classroom. There's always some new thing out there that the school board hasn't procured that new teachers really like and want to try out. The \\"supplies\\" aren't the basics like books, or paper and pens.  Its specialty stuff to make the classroom look nicer, or for one specific project that the teacher likes doing.  But, ideally, this wouldn't be a reimbursement.  You could hand out prepaid Visas or something.  The problem there is that some will abuse it, and ALL bureaucracies are notoriously stingy about handing out cash up front.  Probably the best solution would be to build that discretionary cash into the budget of every school, have the teachers spend from their own pocket, and then get that money reimbursed directly on their next paycheck.  But, again, you run into a problem.  Budgets get fucked, things get cut, money goes missing, etc.  So there's no easy solution, beyond what we've currently got. I just want to point out that teachers going out and getting supplies for the classroom isn't absurd.  Every machinist I've ever met has their own set of gauge pins, feeler gauges, mics, whatever.  That's quite common.  We just need to make sure they are compensated for doing it.","title":"Another Dem Conspiracy Debunked: IRS data proves Trump tax cuts benefited middle, working-class Americans most"},{"text":" The local Republican chairman suggested the incident came in the wake of anger caused by Joe Bidens garbage comment\\n  \\nSo the strategy was...prove Joe right?

The agenda is dictated by the political beliefs of a few owners, and/or to increase consumption for more ad sales.Never before could huge swaths of the public be radicalized unknowingly by consuming what they thought was an open and free platform. The reality is that social media platforms, which are increasingly consolidated into the hands of a few billionaires, are being manipulated for the same reasons that the media has been corrupted.

I never considered Trump to be fit to be President  but in the beginning  I could see some value in his brash and unorthodox approach to politics. Its okay to shake things up. I did not expect a cult of haters to form around his celebrity. Hes become so toxic. Hes surrounding himself with dangerous people. And he has no respect for the Constitution and democracy.

There already exist relatively unbiased media sources that don't have double standards. So let's say some company unilaterally decides to have better standards and add themselves to that pile. What do you think happens to their audience? They just stick around for the ride? A big fraction will defect to a publication with worse standards for the same reason they chose the publication in question over less biased alternatives in the first place. In the end, the actual partitioning of the public into subsets of all available media standards remains relatively unchanged. Which is precisely why the media landscape has the shape it does with some market share held by publications/blogs/podcasts/etc with little bias but vastly more held by biased alternatives. Even if every media outlet took this to heart, you'd have to stop new entrants. Which is basically impossible short of legal personhood for evidence/truth, significantly better education, people actually caring about epistemology, or some other change. Blaming the media is about as lazy and informative as being cynical in politics, which is ironically one of the mechanisms by which this double standard is reinforced by audience self selection. It's a gross misrepresentation of the systems at play that leads to poor collective action in the sense of wasting effort solving the wrong problem.","title":"Harris vows to serve 'all Americans,' trying to limit damage from Biden comment"},{"text":"I share your philosophy.

The point Im trying to make is that once a doctor grows into their income, (a phrase my friend used to hear all the time when she was in premed) they generally dont have a problem not providing services. If there is someone else that they can blame for it.

Inflation has been brought down, GDP has grown, the stock market is at record highs, real wages have risen and we have full employment. Once again, a Republican administration handed the country over to the Democrats in a catastrophic state during a pandemic, with the supply chain in disarray.Interest had been artificially low since the Great Recession, which was free money for the rich, and private equity bought up ridiculous amounts of properties which pushed rents to the limit. Interest rates were raised to  cool things down, which was needed and now we have stability, albeit we are stuck with higher prices for the necessities we all require. Nothing short of price controls is going to do much about that and nobody wants to go down that road.I wish the Dems were better able to get that message out.

They didn't blame Stein in 2016 based on logic (her polls show that, at most, she may have spoiled Michigan for Trump in 2016, but even winning Michigan wouldn't have let Clinton win).The DNC is perhaps the most anti-democratic system in the country.Think about the fanaticism Trumpers showed against the RNC back in the day, and how they grew. Trump was even attacking Fox news to the point he would refuse to attend their debates bc they did something with the rules. A post from [Jan 2016 referencing this \\"right wing infighting\\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20160129150840/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/436l49/sanders_supporter_here_rooting_for_trump/):Sanders supporter here, rooting for Trump.Regardless of the differences they have, I really respect how Trump is taking on the RNC and Fox News. I think a Trump vs. Sanders general election would be the best thing to happen to the political discourse in this country in a long time. I have my reasons for supporting Sanders over Trump, but one thing I really appreciate about Trump is that he doesn't believe people have a right to not be offended. Most of the time, political correctness just obfuscates the real problem.Skipping tonight's debate was a genius move, btw. Trump's political skills and ability to dictate the media are mind-blowing, to be honest.Good luck getting the nomination!If one accepts the premise the DNC is antidemocratic and needs reform, then one needs to also accept they need to be attacked from \\"within\\". Right now the DNC see's self identified \\"socialists\\" as a voting bloc only slightly less likely to vote Dem than \\"liberals\\" or \\"progressives\\". And those people don't even pool their votes into the greens! The \\"other party\\" label means writing in names, or staying home. So no leverage. Compare the \\"socialist\\" group to the \\"moderate\\" group's voting loyalty. https://x.com/SocDoneLeft/status/1831023851477795317","title":"Don't let Democrats blame you one bit if Trump wins, it will be entirely their fault"},{"text":"Sadly true","title":"Billboard Showing Kamala Harris Engaging in Sex Act Erected by Pro-Trump Company in Ohio"},{"text":"could be a big deal, Arnold is widely admired by vast margins, particularly with men","title":"Schwarzenegger has announced that he will be voting for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Apparently the NY Compost doesnt understand that is is used for singular subject and are is used for multiple subjects in a sentence.

The Cold War and associated arms race gobbled up much of the world's production.?

Together these might be thought of as the \\"peace dividend\\".? This increased output was broad.? While the rich got richer the very poor were beneficiaries, at least on a global basis.? Approximately 30% of the world's population was very poor around 1990.? By 2015 that had fallen to about 10%, at a time of growing population.?\\nThe US has continued to enjoy strong economic growth.? There have been short-term setbacks with financial panics and the pandemic. But the average US citizen is richer than ever.\\nThis unprecedented economic production has come with social disruption.? To over-simplify, the rich and very poor have done better, while middle segments have not and have to deal with increased financial and social uncertainty.\\nRegarding a \\"common enemy\\" what I meant is that for US domestic policy there was a broad political consensus that totalitarianism or \\"communism,\\" especially in the form promulgated by the Soviet Union and its allies, should be opposed.? That generally the opposition to totalitarianism should include democratic governments with market economies.? And the world was generally viewed as polarized with 1) the \\"First World\\", which included Western Europe &amp; North America, in alliance against 2) those allied with the Soviet Union, and with 3) the \\"Third World\\" of unaligned nations trying to sit out the Cold War.\\nOther perspectives are welcome.?","title":"CMV:  Compassion &amp; Respect Are Good for Resolving Disagreements"},{"text":"Because shes AWESOME !

Trump has spent the last 8 years since his election complaining about how it's terrible that the deep state was impeding his agenda; the \\"deep state\\" of course being all the public servants, medical experts, generals, etc. who restrained his worst impulses or persuaded him not to take blatantly illegal actions. But this time around his platform (plus promises from his running mate, advisors, likely cabinet appointments, etc.) is aimed at removing those impediments - sacking vast swathes of the public service and replacing them with loyalists who won't restrict his behaviour. Passing over \\"establishment\\" cabinet picks in favour of pliable goons. And so on.So Trump is simultaneously arguing that \\"it'll be fine because last time I wasn't a dictator (due to the deep state stopping me)\\" and also \\"this time I'll be unrestricted by the deep state because I'm going to fire them all and do what I want\\".

During time periods or in regions where the system breaks down and there is no stable government to enforce laws, violence exists in a much more pervasive way. If you live in a small village with no organized fighting force just living your normal life, inevitably people who focus on fighting and violence rather than running a peaceful village will invade and steal things by force. So even if your village/city/country has no interest in violence, it needs some organized way to resolve conflicts with violent forces that are opposed to the well being and rights of the populace.Legal systems and enforcement exist because without them the default is violence and chaos. When a state decides to withhold the legal system from a group, such as criminal organizations, those organizations inevitably resort to direct violence to solve their disputes, which is an actual \\"might makes right\\" system.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Spoiler: He does not love the American peopleHe loves ice cream though","title":"Donald Trump Answers Biden: You Cant Lead America if You Dont Love the American People"},{"text":"Nope.

This is just a physical reality. However the structures we put in place are often to reduce and minimize violence. So although States exist through violence and the fear of violence. Violence is used as little as possible. Police are ready to enforce someone else's rules through violence but everything in society is built around lowering their need to do so. Social services are created to help people who would benefit most from being violent thereby taking away that motivation. Children are sent to school to learn how to be a successful member of the existing society. Places like courthouses are created for people to settle disputes through non violent methods. Crimes are punished by the state using minimal violence so that people aren't taking the law or moral law into their own hands and committing violent acts.So yes society is built on the threat of violence, but violence is not being used constantly","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Not only that but the mere idea of not agreeing with their monopoly can get you incarcerated.?","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Well, we vermin, the enemy within, could care less what the fascist has to say.","title":"Donald Trump campaign attacks Democrats over Joe Bidens garbage fumble"},{"text":"Just remember - who appears ahead today means absolutely nothing to the ultimate outcome.

Not possible for the Supreme Court to step in here.2. The Constitution mandates that each state delegation gets one vote. It doesn't say anything about how the delegations should conduct their vote.Therefore, if Democrats win the house and need to deal with a contested election they could pass a house rule, by simple majority, that states the contingent election will be decided by each delegation electing one member of the majority party to cast the delegations vote.

So it's not uncommon for a House or Senate candidate to perform five or more points differently than the presidential candidate. Sen. Tester in Montana will likely need a sizable gap in his performance from Harris's numbers in order to keep his seat. Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio is another one who will need to do much better than Harris in order to hang on.","title":"Hi, Reddit! I'm Damian Paletta, I oversee the WSJs Washington bureau.

At the end of the day we can come up with far more ways to poison a person than to cure them. Otherwise there wouldn't be so many failed medical trials compared to successful ones, and I've already established the strategies that would be capable of increasing the per unit margins as well as the overall profit of harmful or ineffective products.However result of this all that because it is on average less costly to convince someone of something that is true than to convince someone of something that is false (I will reiterate, on 'Average' this is true, not all the time, or even nearly all the time). You can certainly convince someone without any evidence or support that something is true, but I have difficult conceiving of a scenario where having such evidence or support will be a net negative to persuasion (Since you are able to prove it, it must be false, would be an odd thing to hear) . We can reasonably conclude the the balance of margin and benefit/detriment is either non-existent or slightly leaning towards the beneficial due to the reduce cost from not having to lie.At the end of the day the company is interested in neither benefiting us or harming us. It is simply looking for the most efficient way to take in the most income at the lowest cost, regardless of method. All we can do as consumers is attempt to increase the cost of the company doing harm or reduce the cost of the company providing benefits. Examples of increasing the cost of harm might be regulation, enforcement, or simply learning to be less easily manipulated by them while examples of reducing the cost might include methods such as tax incentives.As an aside, posting long comments correctly is challenging for a newbie like me.","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"Nothings stopping them from having proper policies.

A Legal example being 'I have a patent' while an illegal one would be forcing competitors out of business or using illegal means to extend a patent beyond its normal life. A third category the means to acquire a monopoly would be in the category of \\"Legal but probably shouldn't be\\" a perfect example being the herculean efforts Disney has gone through to extend their legal claims to their intellectual properties. They copyright for Steamboat Willy, the precursor to mickey mouse was copywrited in 1928 and under the copyright laws at the time would have the copyright would have expired in 1955. However Disney, through a combination of political influence/pressure and extensive legal battles managed to extend it's control over steamboat willie until January 1, 2024, more a 69 year extension beyond what would have been its natural lifetime.Now apply that logic for a product such as medicine. I will simply fold vaccines into medicine as their processes and laws are effectively the same, which is to say, any Individual vaccine has undergone as much or more scrutiny as any other accepted medicine. The study that attempted to link vaccines to autism was not only fraudulent it was admitted to be so by its own creator. Alternative medicines however are not included in this category as if when an alternative medicine has gone through this scrutiny it is simply going to be called medicine (Alternative medicine isn't, as I often say).Not only is the holder of this monopoly using the same advertising tactics as are used for the other products, they also are almost entirely immune from the risk that a competitor will choose to narrow their own individual product margins in order to sell a greater volume of their own product. In this scenario the only limit isn't the balance of supply and demand for the product but the ability for enough of the market to be able to purchase to product to push the overall profit as high as possible which frequently results in incredible margins due to the lack of alternatives the consumer has in this scenario. They cannot choose to purchase from an alternative supplier and they also are effectively unable to choose to forgo the product entirely due to the enormous cost of doing so, up to and including death. This category ends up blowing the proposed theoretical relationship between margins and health costs entirely out of the water as it will naturally result in enormous, even bankrupting margins due to the disproportionate balance of power that overwhelmingly favors the seller of the product.I will add an additional comment for products involving direct fraud or deception. These will also have a higher cost as well as margin, however the effects would be about the same as advertising, producing counter-examples and examples at equivalent rates which is simply evidence against the theory you have proposed as well since it would result in a greater proportion of the products having no correlation between beneficial or harmful effects and profit margin.\\\\-Continued in next comment -","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"Hes everything Trump is not.

But it, imo, is extremely obvious that he meant that one particular supporter considering even when he said supporter's he then said his twice. He then even went on to later clarify he meant that one guy. When have Trump or the Republicans ever walked back their statements? When have they apologized for the misunderstanding?  This is why pushing this story is carrying water for Trump. Even if you think he meant all of Trump's supporters, he walked it back. He clarified he meant one person.

Consumer are, limited. They do not have perfect knowledge of the benefits/costs of the goods, nor do they have perfect knowledge of what goods even exist. Consumers can be manipulated, their opinions altered, their awareness increased of decreased respectively based on methods such as exposure or even simple misinformation.For example Coca-cola has a high margin, low benefit product. Because it is high margin they have a significant incentive to invest in increasing the demand for the product by both informing the customers that the product exist as well as minimizing the health impact and exaggerating the non-health benefits of the product (Advertising in other words). If they could they'd like to even suggest it has a positive health impact or is even a necessity. An example of this would be people having previously touted the unproven and ultimately incorrect concept of radioactive substances having significant health benefits and even selling them as medicine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGLoH7pPM7o is both informative and entertaining on this concept). That is to say, it isn't impossible, there have been a multitude examples of 'snake oils' that are either ineffective or even deadly. It just usually takes more effort and hence cost, which is only worth doing on high margin products.Basically, why spend the time lying to sell something when it doesn't earn you a profit greater than you spend lying about it?Therefore we would expect higher margin goods having a greater investment in such touting/deception, which would result in them have equivalently larger advertisement budgets, driving the margins for these products higher. However these goods are no better than they were before the advertising campaign began which means the entire source of the margins born of this process are the result of a combination of product awareness and misinformation.Would Radioactive energy drinks have had such high margins if people hadn't been convince of it's health benefits rather than knowing that it would simply give you cancer and literally cause your jaw to disintegrate? I believe the answer is obvious, and it is the investment in this activity, that inherently adds 0 value to the product that enables this.In comparison, have you ever seen a major advertising campaign for unbranded grocery store broccoli?As a result the person whose rational decision made with perfect knowledge might have been purchasing broccoli will instead spend the money on coca-cola. This process overall will produce counter examples as well as examples of your theory, as at the end of the day, the company doesn't particularly care about whether a product is beneficial or harmful to the consumer. The only priority a company has is that margin at the end of the day. If it is a high margin healthy product? They'll invest in advertising. If it is a high margin unhealthy product? They will invest in advertising. If it's a high margin product that doesn't have any particular effect at all? They will invest in advertising. The benefit or harm of the product is entirely irrelevant.Advertising at its core is a process focused entirely on altering the knowledge the consumer has about a product, whether that knowledge is true or false. Therefore it will result in as many counter examples as examples to your theory which would be evidence for there being no correlation, rather than there being a high correlation.\\\\-Continued in next comment-","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"Maga is hot painted garbage","title":"JD Vance Offended by Biden a Day After Complaining About Americans Getting Offended"},{"text":"Can you please reword that?

There's a rise in grocery stores to sell more locally sourced foods and healthier foods. Healthier meal delivery service kits, low calorie, low sugar items, etc., are examples of high gross margin items that promote health.Companies will respond to consumer sentiment; Taco Bell, for instance, has had a multi decade plan to make their food better. Since 2008, reduced sodium by 15% and they're planning to reduce it by another 10% by 2025. They do it slowly so it won't shock the palates of their consumers. They also added in low calorie ordering like \\"fresco style.\\" Got rid of artificial colors. The whole meme of \\"Taco bell will give you the shits\\" makes people blind to how much healthier their food has gotten. They did it by having hired a team of nutrionists to overhaul their menu and every single company has this capacity. [https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/healthiest-fast-food-chain-taco-bell/?srsltid=AfmBOoooBpPQ33nWmxJqb5Z\\\\_D3n0J3kbmEseiNdl3l-KOVa3OdmMJACe](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/healthiest-fast-food-chain-taco-bell/?srsltid=AfmBOoooBpPQ33nWmxJqb5Z_D3n0J3kbmEseiNdl3l-KOVa3OdmMJACe)That's because all profitability metrics are a relationship between input costs and what you can sell it for. The consumer is willing to pay higher prices for healthier foods now that they're more health conscious. And input costs for foods are pretty low especially at scale.And - the entire point of regulation is to make industry bear its own externality costs. So, if we supplemented market sentiment with reasonable regulations, say put a fat tax, or a sugar tax, then that would create even more drivers towards making more healthful options. It's why public goods with positive externalities, like roads, bridges, schools, mail, are likewise costs borne by the government to provide. [https://www.econ.iastate.edu/ask-an-economist/what-goods-and-services-are-best-provided-public-sector-and-which-are-best](https://www.econ.iastate.edu/ask-an-economist/what-goods-and-services-are-best-provided-public-sector-and-which-are-best)I think to pull this full circle is that government subsidies on corn that creates the pressure to get high fructose corn syrup is a disruption to the private good cost benefit analysis because it's artificially profitable. If we took those subsidies off alone, then you'd have an entire category of inputs that are less healthful. Let alone if we had reasonable regulations that prohibits such inputs from food. I think the entire part of the dynamic that's enabled only by government subsidy shows that it isn't an inherent correlation but purposeful policy making that can also change. But, the public sentiment alone is providing more profitability despite the cheaper, subsidized inputs for healthful foods.","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"There isnt a consensus anywhere on earth where Obama was the best president in American history","title":"Kamala Harris calls for a new generation of leadership in Washington speech"},{"text":"how will harris make the middle class disappear?","title":"Another Dem Conspiracy Debunked: IRS data proves Trump tax cuts benefited middle, working-class Americans most"},{"text":"Just concepts.

There are few opportunities for candidates to move the dial in an election which has been stubbornly close since?[Kamala Harris](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/24/kamala-harriss-closing-argument)?became the Democratic nominee. Todays update will cheer her supporters: the vice-presidents probability of victory rose by six percentage points, making the race a dead heat.There are three reasons. One is the volume of new polls65 were added to our forecast todaygiving the model more confidence about small changes. Another is that there is so little time left before the election. Up until now our model has been a forecast, with weeks or months left for candidates to make gains. Many pollsters are now publishing their final surveys of the cycle, so the forecast will soon become a now-cast.The third is that the race is remarkably close, which means that even tiny changes in expected vote shares can yield large shifts in win probabilities. The most influential polls yesterday were concentrated in four states: Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In those states, Ms Harriss forecasted vote share rose by an average of 0.4 percentage points (see chart)a small move that was nonetheless sufficient to increase her chance of victory by an average of six percentage points across the four.On the surface, the new polls did not look unusually good for Ms Harris. Most showed results that were close to a tie. However, the firms that released surveys yesterdayparticularly AtlasIntel, Quantus and Trafalgarhave tended to give?[Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/10/28/donald-trump-returns-to-new-york-for-a-bombastic-closing-pitch)?better numbers this year than have other pollsters who surveyed the same races at similar times. Our model shifts all poll results to counteract such biases. And on average, these adjustments nudged vote margins in yesterdays swing-state polls around half a percentage point in Ms Harriss direction.Moreover, in recent days the model has been moving towards Mr Trump, and Ms Harriss average projected vote share (excluding third parties) had fallen below 50% in every swing state besides Michigan. As a result, new polls showing a tied race (like those in Pennsylvania did on average after our adjustments) or even a slim lead for Mr Trump (as did those in North Carolina) still represented an improvement for Ms Harris, compared with the models relatively gloomy expectations for her yesterday.New polls also came out in Arizona and Georgia yesterday with a wide spread of results, ranging from an eight-point lead for Mr Trump to a one-point edge for Ms Harris. However, after our adjustments, the average of these new surveys landed very close to the models previous expectation of a two-point lead for Mr Trump in both states. As a result, the forecasts for Arizona and Georgia were unchanged.Ms Harriss small gains have brought her back to parity in Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and made her a narrow favourite in Michigan, whereas Mr Trump retains a small but clear edge in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. The two candidates each won exactly half of our models simulations in its latest run. On average, they both wind up with 269 electoral voteswhich would leave the House of Representatives to break the tie, presumably in Mr Trumps favour. However, the model assigns less than a 1% chance to an actual electoral-college tie, which would probably require Ms Harris to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin while losing Nebraskas second Congressional district.The direction or size of polling errors cannot be predicted. But if history is any guide, surveys are likely to underestimate one candidate by a margin that dwarfs the small day-to-day shifts in our models average estimates. Any such error would probably deliver a decisive victory to whichever candidate it benefits. Despite the tight polls, our forecast gives a two-in-five chance of the winning candidate receiving more electoral votes than Joe Biden did in 2020 or Mr Trump did in 2016.The other main source of uncertainty in our model, aside from polling errors, is the time remaining until the election. The forecast works by estimating the candidates current positions with the available data, and then simulating movement that could occur each day until November 5th. With just six remaining, there is little movement left to make.The effect on our forecasted probabilities is counterintuitive. There are few opportunities for big changes in public opinion, meaning polls published now have greater weight. As a result, the forecasted probabilities may change more substantially from day to day than they would earlier in the cycle. The slight movement in Ms Harriss favour today is harder to reverse in the next six days than it would have been a month ago.The polls in todays forecast update were mostly based on interviews conducted a few days ago, so it is hard to judge what, if anything, caused a small uptick in Ms Harriss standing. Some polls now being published were conducted after Mr Trumps rally at Madison Square Garden on October 27thwhich is now roundly considered to have been a misstep for his campaignbut it is unlikely to be until after the election that we have a clear idea of whether that event moved many voters. It appears as though the final six days of the campaign will go in a similar fashion to the past three months: plenty to talk about, but no decisive leader.","title":"Why Kamala Harriss chances of victory just jumped"},{"text":"Do you think that the media is partly responsible for empowering Trump?

This changes in the case of a monopoly or patented necessity such as medicine as the customers do not have the freedom to choose not to purchase the product without dire consequences.I will address the first point using food as an example.When it comes to a minimum necessary diet, you would expect to end up with extremely low cost foods that fulfill the need to acquire calories in an efficient manner with a certain minimum balance of pleasure/convenience as can be obtained. While the budgets are extremely limited on average, the consumer is left with little option at this level as any further trade-offs would result in severe costs to the individual consumer, forcing them to accept a higher ratio of price compared to the cost of manufacturing and distribution.When it comes to fulfilling the requirements of a more balanced diet, the consumers are generally going to be at a higher level of financial comfort, but by and large are going to remain limited in disposable income. This results in them having a degree of freedom in trading down to cheaper products, and thus if the price becomes too high, they are more likely to downgrade to a lower cost alternative due to the price difference being too wide, or upgrade to a higher priced alternative to cost difference becoming too thin. This flexibility will naturally limit the flexibility on the part of the seller, forcing them to accept lower margins in order to make sales.As we advanced further we enter the realm of what we might call luxury foods. These are foods that are not necessarily purchased for their nutritional value, but rather for other benefits such as direct pleasure, convenience, or even social benefits. In this area we can expect the majority of customers to not 'notice' the increase in margins as much, as the trade-offs they might have to make to pay a higher price for the good. In this case we could expect there to be less \\"direct requirements fulfilled\\" (such as being healthy) and more \\"desired requirements\\" being filled, such as convenience or flavor. This would logically result in there being higher margins for the sellers of these goods while the goods themselves have less direct physical benefits per unit of cost compared to the previous categories item's.So far, this would support your theory that the higher margin items at both the low and high end of the spectrum would have a greater degree of profitability than those found in the healthier middle.\\\\- Continued in next comment -","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"Yeah.

Im not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and dont trust most politicians.I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor.My time as Governor taught me to love policy and ignore politics. Im proud of the work I did to help clean up our air, create jobs, balance the budget, make the biggest infrastructure investment in state history, and take power from the politicians and give it back to the people when it comes to our redistricting process and our primaries in California.Thats policy. It requires working with the other side, not insulting them to win your next election, and I know it isnt sexy to most people, but I love it when I can help make peoples lives better with policies, like I still do through my institute at USC, where we fight for clean air and stripping the power from the politicians who rig the system against the people.Let me be honest with you: I dont like either party right now. My Republicans have forgotten the beauty of the free market, driven up deficits, and rejected election results. Democrats arent any better at dealing with deficits, and I worry about their local policies hurting our cities with increased crime.It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isnt addicted to this crap, you probably understand.I want to tune out.But I cant. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious.And I will always be an American before I am a Republican.Thats why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.Im sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do. You dont recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.For decades, weve talked about the national debt. For decades, weve talked about comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border while fixing our broken immigration system. And Washington does nothing.The problems just keep rolling, and we all keep getting angrier, because the only people that benefit from problems arent you, the people. The only people that benefit from this crap are the politicians who prefer having talking points to win elections to the public service that will make Americans lives better.It is a just game to them. But it is life for my fellow Americans. We should be pissed!But a candidate who wont respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  - that wont solve our problems.It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump wont do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.Thats enough reason for me to share my vote with all of you. I want to move forward as a country, and even though I have plenty of disagreements with their platform, I think the only way to do that is with Harris and Walz.Vote this week. Turn the page and put this junk behind us.And even if you disagree with me, vote, because thats what we do as Americans.

It's just that he has less energy than he used to back in the day. Still enough to run the country, but not enough to run the country *and* campaign at the same time. (Which, in fairness, is absolutely exhausting for people even half his age.) And of course, there's the concern that his energy levels might further decline over the next four years, to the point that running the country becomes a struggle for him, too. So, while I was a Biden Remainer at the time, I've come around to being convinced replacing him with Kamala was the correct call. My bad, guys.Although, I will gently point out that a *lot* of the things being pointed to as signs of Biden's supposed dementia during the \\"Drop Out Joe\\" period were either his stutter acting up, or quirks he's had for his entire adult life in politics. Like, everyone flipped out when Biden called Zelensky \\"Putin\\" by mistake at the NATO summit, claiming it was a sign of dementia... but Joe has been screwing up names like that since he was in his early 30s. (Also, Zelensky's on record saying he didn't care, lol.) This is the guy who was called a gaffe machine when he was Obama's VP. \\"This is a big fucking deal\\", anyone?So while the vast majority of the concern around Biden's age was being made in good faith, some of the criticisms leveled at him felt like borderline ableism. IDK, as someone with ADHD who makes a lot of gaffes the way Biden does, it kinda hurt to hear. (And before you ask, I'm in my early 30s. So, yeah, I *guess* it could be early onset dementia-- except that I've been this way my entire life. So it'd have to be *extremely* early onset and incredibly slowly progressing dementia, lmao.)","title":"What was the story that broke your trust in mainstream media coverage?"},{"text":"Remember, thats just his external, synthetic skin.

You cannot be a good person and vote for trump.","title":"Harris distances self from Biden's 'garbage' comments"},{"text":"\\"By?Hayes Brown,?MSNBC Opinion Writer/EditorAs Election Day creeps closer, the?tension is becoming more palpable. Pollsters are publishing their final surveys, millions are dropping their ballots in the mail and?early in-person voting is beginning?around the country. And theres?no more clarity?on whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump will prevail than there was two weeks ago.As per the two parties usual demeanors, Republicans are blustering in public while?stressing about Trumps chances?behind the scenes, while?Democrats are simply stressed?everywhere. But at least on paper, theres good reason to be hopeful about Harris odds of victory. There are wide gaps across the board between the two campaigns, any of which could be the deciding factor next week.The most eye-catching advantage that Harris campaign holds is a massive war chest thats rapidly built up since she took over as her partys presumptive nominee in July. By early October, she had?raised $1 billion?between her campaign and a joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee. And donors havent slowed the deluge of cash. In the first half of October alone, her campaign and affiliates reported to the Federal Election Commission that theyd?raised another $147 million. In comparison, Trumps network brought in $97 million during that same time.Harris campaign is investing the money both in an advertising avalanche in battleground states and a gargantuan ground game. The Harris campaign has opened 50 offices in?Pennsylvania alone, coordinating a massive get-out-the-vote operation. The?same is true in Michigan, where her campaign is hoping to draw as many Never Trump Republicans to the polls as possible. Trumps campaign is struggling to match Democrats presence, having turned over most of its get-out-the-vote efforts to super PACs and other affiliated groups.As for the candidates themselves, Trump may be benefiting from some voters hazy memories of his first term, but remarkably Harris has managed to?wrest the title of change candidate from him?in the eyes of many voters. Thats no mean feat when shes the one currently serving in the administration under President Joe Biden. And Harris sought to remind voters just how chaotic Trumps term was with?her final major campaign address. Tuesdays speech warning about the danger Trump poses was held on the Ellipse, the site of his speech Jan. 6, 2021, that inspired a mob to attack the Capitol.Much of the campaigns final days will be spent targeting the few remaining undecided voters, and one of the two candidates is better positioned to grow their support. The?last national New York Times/Siena College poll?found about 15 percent of voters described themselves as not fully decided, and Ms. Harris is leading with that group, 42 percent to 32 percent. Its not clear how many of them will break for her but its still an encouraging sign. Furthermore, Harris favorability has rebounded since she entered the race. Though Trumps popularity has increased as well since the first assassination attempt on him this summer, he is still decidedly unpopular. And his previous two presidential runs ended with roughly the same share of the popular vote, suggesting a clear ceiling of national support.Harris also holds the advantage on one of the most motivating factors this election:?abortion. The furious backlash to the overturning of Roe v. Wade drove Democrats overperformance in the 2022 midterms. Theres no sign that energy has dimmed in the last two years, particularly when numerous states this year have initiatives concerning abortion access on the ballot. Trump has tried to?soften his rhetoric, only to boast about his Supreme Court nominees ending Roe.Finally, even the economy has improved beyond what many would have predicted two years ago, with inflation falling back to pre-pandemic levels and interest rates falling. Harris is gaining on Trump in polls on that front, as well. And among?demographic?after?demographic, the polls?have been tightening?in Harris favor.There are enough positive signs that, as?The New York Times reported Monday, Harris aides are growing cautiously optimistic about the race. But the specter of 2016 still hovers over the election. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls going into Election Day, had won her debates against Trump and seemingly held every possible edge against him. But that evening, it soon became clear that Trump would be able to claim victory, thanks in part to a?surge of infrequent voters, a phenomenon his campaign is trying to replicate this time around.With that nightmare still seared in every Democrats mind, the Harris camp wont coast for the next week. There are still plenty of data points out there to give them the jitters. It truly seems like any little change in voter demographics, turnout or enthusiasm could swing things one way or the other.Accordingly, Harris team has framed itself as the underdog for the entire time shes been in the race. Its a good mindset to have when things are this uncertain. Because while Harris has plenty of reasons to feel good about her odds on paper, its impossible not to worry that we could still see the whole thing go up in smoke.\\"","title":"Kamala Harris' fundamentals are strong"},{"text":"He's old-school \\"I'm rich, give me lots of tax breaks\\" republican, not modern \\"I'm a Nazi\\" republican.

This version aligns with his overall message criticizing Trump and his supporters for their harmful rhetoric and actions toward the Latino community.

It fits smoothly with his broader condemnation of Trump's stance on immigration and the treatment of minorities, highlighting the impact of those supporters' beliefs.

Every election, they need to guess the final electorate, but they usually have years to get a sense for what it will look like, and can look at primary votes, incumbency advantage, etc. The polls were configured for Biden vs. Trump. Harris entering the race changed the race, and I have the suspicion that the pollsters either didn't think the electorate would be all that different as a result or didn't have time (or the data) to get a sense of what the final electorate will look like.A recent high quality poll (NYT I think) had the race tied, but Harris winning with independents by double digits. The only way the race is tied with such a huge lead with independents is if the final electorate has Republicans turning out at much higher rates than Democrats. Maybe that will be the case, but it would surprise me. If Republicans and Democrats turn out evenly, a 10 point lead with independents would lead to something close to a 52-47.5% split for Harris.So I don't necessarily buy the Reddit narrative of \\"they just want to say it's close so they get more clicks.\\" I think it's more likely they were caught off guard by the late change in nominees.","title":"Kamala Harris could break 32-year record in Texas, survey suggests"},{"text":"MAGA learning that the truth hurts their little feelings.

Biden's comment was a spur-of-the-moment screwup.* Comedian had an established pattern of racism including other jokes about Latinos illegally immigrating, Black folk loving watermelons, and Muslims being terrorists. Biden's comment was a single line.* Biden immediately clarified what he meant. Then an hour later apologized and clarified again. Comedian never apologized.* Trump and supporters have a long-established history of saying offensive things, with Trump calling Democrats \\"*vermin*\\" and \\"*the enemy within*, and his supporters saying stuff like \\"*the White House will stink of curry if Kamala wins*\\", while Biden has a history of being polite and congenial.* Trump was asked about the comment and said he had \\"no regrets\\".
