The rest vote either R or D based on how the candidates make them feel and there's a few percentage points who vote third party. The opportunity for the independent Left parties is as kingmaker; not having enough votes to win outright but if we build a coalition that's credible and inclusive, we can expect much of the Left third party vote AND disaffected voters who aren't happy with the R or D options.

People often joke that hes the poor mans idea of a rich man. Theres something that FEELS working class to him. Hes not refined, he doesnt really think about what hes going to say, he speaks off the cuff and so on and so on.Kamala and the democrats as a whole think through what they say, they dont want to over promise, they dont want to offend. They seem calculated and cold. Very corporate. Logically theyre obviously better than Trump but for many voters the Democratic candidates feel too rehearsed and too safe. That makes them feel unrepeatable and for a lot of voters that makes trusting them more difficult. Most voters do not vote on policy or really care or know about the policy. They vote on the feelings the candidate gives them. Trumps schtick and his personality is actually very authentically him. He doesnt put on a mask really. Yes he lies, but thats not a mask. I mean he doesnt really mask his personality much at all. Its one reason why something like Joe Rogan is so vital. He has an incredible reach for an audience and the long format gives listeners time to get to know the candidate as a person not a political talking point. Add in the fact that democrats (not really Kamala) kept telling voters that the economy was better than ever and their financial burdens werent real and its no wonder why they trusted Trump more. The issues of trust had less to do with Kamala herself and more to do with the Democratic Party feeling too buttoned up. Too perfect. Not responding well to criticisms or observations that dont paint them as perfect (Economy, Bidens mental decline etc.). The issue was much bigger than Kamala tbh, it was a complete rejection of the 2010s era of the Democratic Party and how they (and the voters) conducted ourselves. But all of those frustrations with Democrats were projected onto Kamala some fair and others not.We can argue policy as much as wed like. This isnt about logic or facts or policy its about emotions and who feels more genuine and Democrats need to really reflect on why Trump feels more genuine in comparison. Were a party of mostly college educated coastal elites. We talk down to voters and call them stupid for not voting like we do. We need to connect with voters on a human level and not worry about policy detail. Treat them like people and listen, promise youll make their lives better. Thats really all people want. They dont care about the billions of dollars or the celebrity endorsements or what TV ad played. They just want to see an actual person who cares and manufactured TV ads and the current model doesnt convey that.","title":"Why did American voters seem to believe Donald Trump more than Kamala Harris? \\"He validates their angers and their fears.\\""},{"text":"Like f*ck it does, third parties didn't force you to put up an old man with dementia and his closeted Nazi mini-me as candidate for your party and lose spectacularly to Trump.

People need to get over their differences in ideology and unite on the issues that affect everyone: globalization and the disparity in wealth, and the ever increasing push for the digitalization of everything. Im sure there are more but they are the ones that immediately came to my mind. The parasites pushing the division now openly mock our collective stupidity and it seems like we take the bait every time. We need to take responsibility for passively allowing the people in power to conduct a controlled demolition of nature and humanity. This shit has been happening since babylon, probably before, and we continue falling in the same traps, which ultimately benefit the psychopathic minority that seems to get off on causing pain and suffering. Once the fourth industrial revolution is fully implemented there will be no chance to escape: even those capable of living off grid will eventually be swallowed by the beast. I chose not to have children because i doubt that humanity will get its shit together, but i am still willing to risk my life in an effort to completely change the way we live and become less dependent on the system that will imprison future generations in a dystopian hellscape. As fred hampton said, if you aint willing to die, you aint a revolutionary. Id imagine we need millions of people in the US alone to adopt this mindset, or all efforts to bring about meaningful change will be futile. I assume people do not see that that their childrens future is essentially hopeless because of the stress of their daily lives, but from where I stand this is the only issue that people should focus on. If people cant get over their petty differences to ensure the future actually has something to live for, and acknowledge the necessity to cooperate with others like mature adults in order to confront this assault, then i doubt there is any issue capable of achieving the widespread unity that would be needed to topple the beast. It wouldnt be easy, and the parasites will meet any opposition with horrific force, but i dont see any other way to bring about meaningful change. Our ancestors, and ourselves, have dug quite the hole to hide our heads in. It wont be easy to climb out. The good thing i have witnessed since covid is that most people know something is off. I dont know if it was hubris, or that the plan had to be rushed, but the parasites have exposed themselves more-so than I witnessed in my lifetime. This is the morsel of hope that i cling to: they will do something so sloppy and insulting that is powerful enough to unite the masses. In the meantime, i will continue building relationships with my neighbors, and focus my efforts on helping those that the system has abused the most.","title":"Divide &amp; conquer"},{"text":"If youre going to lose anyways, you might as well spend it like you stole it.Enjoy it while she can, she aint ever getting that shot again.","title":"Looks Like Kamala Thought She Was Oprah Winfrey and Just Spent the Democrat Party Into Political Oblivion"},{"text":"I seem to remember CNN having a \\"COVID death counter.\\" Saying Trump caused COVID is pretty much how Biden won, or at least blaming him for the deaths.","title":"Beshear: Dems can win by focusing on core issues like jobs, housing, health care"},{"text":"I'm getting tired of all this winning.","title":"Sen.

The majority of them were elected in 2022. Most of them belong to state house chambers and like their Federal counterparts are elected every two years. In some states all Senators are also elected every two years though in most it is every four. In others... they are all elected every four years *except* in the election cycle following a re-apportionment as was the case in 2022. In none do they serve for 6 as do US Senators.The vast Majority of State Legislators *were* re-elected in 2022 five months after Dobbs giving significant time for voters to decide on candidates with different views on Abortion. The reality is that it was very much \\"on the ballot\\" in every state during the 2022 elections when they elected the state legislatures that have served for last two years. Anyone suggesting it \\"wasn't much of an issue\\" at the point they were elected in 2022 is difficult to take very seriously... which is not to say that you are implying that.We can safely ignore these cases - because enshrining abortion in federal law would set a baseline, rather than a capReally? Then why was it such a sticking point that Trump agree he wouldn't sign a \\"national ban on abortion\\" if Federal legislation placing a maximum cap weren't just as possible as them placing a minimum one? The truth is that they could certainly do either should they choose... just as individual states have chosen both methods.To be clear, I don't think it should be banned post viability. I think it shouldn't be banned?at all.Your CMV was literally \\"A Federal Ban on Abortion After 24 Weeks Would Be the Most Optimal Solution\\".

There is nowhere near a consensus on *what* a \\"national mandate\\" should look like even if one believes that one should exist. And until that's the case... one should not be created.

Really starting with Reagan, there has been this trajectory towards increasing the power of the super rich at the expense of everyone else. By the time this election came around, corporations were already policing speech, and not just communications companies, but grocery companies like Unilever and various coding companies were firing people for what was otherwise protected political speech. Citizens United already gave them unfettered power to use their money to promote their views, and an unregulated, wild west internet has given them license to do that with social engineering, with massive bot networks, influence campaigns, and media buyouts. Bezos wasn't able to buy the Washington Post and force it to change its editorial policy because of Trump. Trump wasn't even in the White House when he bought it. It was under *Obama*, in 2013. Since Reagan, the Liberals have controlled the Democratic party. They've done what they can to protect the most vulnerable and uplift them to the status of the general public, which is laudable, and remains critical. But with the exception of some achievements like the Consumer Protection Act during the Great Recession, they have done nothing for their other critical duty to protect that general public from the ravages of the emerging aristocracy, nor to arrest it's rapid centralization of wealth and power into the hands of a tiny number aggressively opportunistic people.This isn't some sudden departure from the past 30 years, any more than climate change is.

I proudly voted for Harris, but I think the democrats overall were not great with messaging.

I don't even think this was discussed outside of tax benefits for first time home buyers, which is like... not a super clear and easy to understand incentive for most people. Saying \\"the economy is stronger then ever!\\" while people are staring at 6%+ interest rates and enormous grocery prices destroys a lot of trust. * Price gouging was the key point the Harris campaign brought up, but I don't think people understand what this means or what the impact is. Eggs are expensive, how is price gouging protection addressing that? When I asked family members what they thought price gouging was, they all thought it was things like \\"hidden fees from ticketmaster\\".* The stock market is up. That's neat, but many americans don't benefit from this in a clear way. Stocks being up makes rich people and investment firms richer. Tell me why that's good for my paycheck.* Job security, particularly as it relates to immigration. This should've been a slam dunk for democrats and they did horrible at it. There's a very popular fear from people, particularly in unions, that undocumented immigrants are going to take away jobs. The campaign messaging was \\"there's room for all of us!

We cant do it (not that I think we should), so talking about it only hurts us politically. Perhaps some level of additional background check or something, but I would just lump that in with NICS reform. Ive posted this before, mostly on other subs, but this is what my Democratic gun reform package would look like:Universal, no cost, no questions asked, mental healthcare for every single person in this country.  \\n  \\nMental health information packets are given with every firearm purchase. Mental health hotline stickers are on every ammo box or printed right on the box.  \\n  \\nAdd a couple of mental health screener questions to the 4473. Just a basic scoring system like your primary care would use to screen you. You fail for mental health reasons, you get an automatic rejection on all future applications for 90 days.  \\n  \\nModern NICS system where you can do the questions online and receive a token that says you completed it that is good for 7 days. The seller can verify that token is valid and it will tell the seller to check your ID and make sure it matches the person the token is for. This would be no cost and would be available for private sellers and dealers. You could also do it in person at a gun store, of course.  \\n  \\nFirearm transfer liability. If you utilize a NICS check when a transfer is done, you arent liable for anything that happens with the gun after that point. Dealer, personal sale, between family members, whatever. If you dont do a check and something happens within one year of the transfer, you have potential criminal liability on your hands, depending on prosecutorial discretion and what a jury thinks. So if you want to transfer a gun to your best buddy who you have known for 40 years and you are confident they are of sound mind and legal to own it, go ahead! If you want to loan a rifle to someone to take hunting, feel free. If you trust them, that is your prerogative. If you dont trust them or you dont know them, then you do a free NICS from number 4. There could even be a NICS app where both parties can consent and a PDF documenting the transfer is generated for record keeping.  \\n  \\nIn exchange for all of this, legalize SBS, SBRs, and suppressors.","title":"Congressman Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) lays out a new party program"},{"text":"Yeah I threw up a little in my mouth when I typed it.","title":"So we're officially done with the whole democracy thing now?"},{"text":"TIL Matt Gaetz has friends","title":"Matt Gaetzs Friend Demands Court Destroy Records About Sex Party"},{"text":"It is common when you bound with someone who shares your issues to get some criticized when you start doing well for yourself.   \\n  \\nLast year I went through a bad break-up and a toxic negative friend was there to \\"comfort me\\" in the sense that they mostly talked about their problems and made a lot of depression/suicide/self-deprecation jokes that we bonded over.

And when rules are handed down the people dont like, they often find ways to downplay or flat out ignore those rules.Take the Old Testament opposition to homosexuality.  Some people get all riled up about that yet ignore countless other obscure Old Testament laws because.  Its easy to accept a rule as divinely handed down when its something you want to enforce anyway.  When god says not to worship other gods, thats an easy one for you to uphold.  But when god says to give away all your worldly possessions, people perform mental gymnastics for centuries finding ways to reinterpret those rules to mean something else.  Now lets say you believe the Bible holds the one true rules for morality.  Dont murder people, dont cheat on your wife, love god, etc.  all good stuff.  You are fully convinced god dictates morality and he didnt pick things because those things are morally good.  The things he picked are morally good because he picked them.  So one day ancient biblical scholars realize 2 pages were stuck together in one of the oldest surviving bibles. The pages very clearly are Jesus telling us that we should rape people.  Yep, you heard right, rape is actually not just morally okay, its morally demanded.  After seeing this, all the oldest bibles are sought out and people find their pages as well were stuck together or torn out.  People in the past had clearly intended to hide this, and as new versions were translated, they missed those lost pages.  So now that we know god degrees we rape people, do you suddenly believe rape is the morally right thing to do?  Or since this clashes with your own personal morality, do you resist?  Why should your subjective definition of morality trump real morality?  Are you really obeying God if you only obey the rules of his that you would be willing to obey even if he didnt have them?  Its easy to not eat broken glass when someone tells you not to.  But that doesnt mean you are obeying them, it just means your actions happen to align with their directions.  Its not until you are asked to do something that you dont want to that you finally make the decision to obey or disobey.","title":"CMV: Without other-wordly knowledge, values are firstly arbitrary"},{"text":"After a few decades in DC, I would, too, but it's incredibly alluring to allow myself to believe even some of that may happen in some agencies.

As was mentioned in another comment the main difference is what Biden inherited. Super high inflation that was driven by a lack of leadership that resulted in an out of control pandemic that broke the supply chain, killed businesses, and created massive supply shortfalls, resulting in the worst inflation this country has seen since the 1970s.By all economic measures, the economy has been recovering perfectly. Inflation is down to 2.6% vs 7% in 2021. GDP for the last quarter in 2024 was 2.8%. Wage growth is 4.7% (outpacing inflation), the economy has grown 12.6% for the last four years. The US economy has recovered more quickly and more efficiently than any other developed country in the world. This is all recovery from 2020. It didn't happen overnight, because you can not \\"turn the economy\\" on a dime. It takes time to course correct, and requires competent people doing their jobs correctly. So when you say you had more more money under Trump than Biden, you're not exactly wrong, but you have to be objective and realize that Trumps and Bidens administrations were not \\"apples to apples.\\" Trump inherited a fantastic economy from Obama. Biden inherited record inflation from Trump, because Trump could not be bothered to listen to competent people. Trump broke it, Biden fixed it. This is all backed up by hard data, which you can find with a 60 second google search.Best of luck to you.","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden on a Record 20 Million New Business Applications"},{"text":"Dorsey left a while back and told people to keep using Twitter and that Elon's not so bad.

To even kill yourself, for nietzsche, is a statement of will to power. To use bit of heideggerian jargon, *Being of dasein is concern* You dont have a choice but to care, to have concern, to engage with the world. You're simply thrown into time, with your past as facticity (of your race, heritage, gender, family etc) and your future as a horizon which is bonded by your past. You simply cannot be aloof because youre not something separate from the world, but a part of the world, and for Nietzsche, part of will to power. Hegel doesn't work, because he implies higher order knowledge about a universe moving towards some state.

Only through that, we can answer what is meant by freedom, the good, and the evil.

They had unilateral authority to pass bans on a previously enshrined right - therefore, the status of whether or not abortion is illegal in a state is not a great indicator as to whether or not its popular opinion that it should be banned, in that state.This is far from uniformly true. The Dobbs ruling happened in June of 2022. The majority of State Legislative representatives currently serving have been elected since (most back in November 2022). Fifteen states have since enacted *new* legislation.  In nine of those access has been further restricted and in six it has been expanded. Only 8 states have pre-existing \\"Trigger Laws\\" that are still in effect and have not been modified. And even in those cases there have been various significant efforts in all of those to modify them at this point that have failed.  Currently... only 16 of 50 states have decided more than two years later that what you propose (a ban post \\"viability\\" and I include in that number those who phrase it as 22 or 24 weeks or simply as \\"viability\\") is what makes sense for them having now had reasonable opportunity to do so. With it being such an important issue... State legislative balances were not significantly shifted in the most recent election and of three chambers where shifts did occur... none are likely to meaningfully affect the fate of future abortion law in those particular states....legislative procedure has maintained abortion bans even in places where it has minority support. Florida stands out here...Again... States have the right to govern themselves in the manner they see fit...  There is no consensus among states about legislative procedures or \\"end of debate thresholds\\"... nor good reasons that they must all be the same. Some that have them are rather \\"Blue\\" states. The tenth amendment makes it quite clear that they should be able to govern themselves when it states *The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.*And even if a small plurality of voters in Florida have an opinion... the Federal government is no way obligated to force that opinion on the other 49 states. It does not necessarily represent a reasonably broad consensus among all US voters. It's not even a reasonably broad consensus among Floridians....are you still vehemently opposed to federal protection of rights, if it defies the states?Not at all and I've never stated such stated such. \\"*Changes* to Federal legislation should occur when there is a reasonably strong consensus\\". Both what I *said* and believe couldn't be more the opposite of what you stated above. I am vehemently opposed to the idea that anything short of a broad and general national consensus should be allowed to infringe on the constitutionally protected rights of either states or individuals.The same logic applies 1 for 1 with the right to own slavesI don't believe that to be the case at all. The 13th amendment is extremely clear. But even if the Supreme court moved in such a way as to somehow invalidate it... I truly doubt that we'd have an insurmountable degree of trouble gathering enough states to ratify a new amendment that more clearly banned indentured servitude. Sure... we'd likely have a brief squabble over the details and scope... but eventually all or at least nearly all states would ratify it. We are clearly nowhere near that level of consensus on the topic of Abortion. Otherwise we'd see a similar process playing out instead of the exact opposite of it with states on average moving farther apart on the issue than coalescing towards a common consensus.","title":"CMV: A Federal Ban on Abortion After 24 Weeks Would Be the Most Optimal Solution to the Abortion Debate."},{"text":"Even if they could somehow tell or catch a neutrino emitted from the first nuclear bomb tests they would've only travelled at most 80ish lightyears.

You think reason cannot give us value, as reason is descriptive rather than normative, and so, to have value you need an otherworldly knowledge for our purpose as our internal universe is meaningless.you name dropped some philosophers which i think have solved the problem. Nietzsche for example makes the claim that the world is Will to Power, as such world transforms itself into more complicated forms, to have more power. This makes the question of value pretty clear from nietzsche's perspective. Values are not arbitrary, they are a form of will to power, and there are \\"bad\\" forms of it such as slave morality, which creates resentment. there is also hegel (who, i believe, makes the best case) who says world in of itself is reason. Problem of philosophy is not there isn't any meaning in the world but rather there is too much of it, and we are not able to grasp it. The fundamental catagory through which meaning arises he calls the *Absolute*. This catagory has been topic of discussion for most philosophers, from india to greeks, all true great philosophers, for hegel, ask the question of the absolute.he sort of writes down \\"the whole comprehensibility and rationality of the world\\" in Science of Logic (among other books), and cames to conclusion that the true value, throughout human history, has been that of freedom.

All of the policy proposals and suggestions requires assuming that voters spend mental energy thinking about politics all the time and this is the kind of out of the touch politics that loses elections. Democrats need to recognize the bulk of the electorate isn't college educated, doesn't read the news on a regular basis, doesn't spend time talking about politics on twitter or reddit. Even among those that are a college educated, a lot of them are barely so. The percentage of electorate that went to a flagship public school or better which dominates  the conversation in corporate america, political america and news room, is very small. The average voter doesn't spend all their mental energy thinking about policy. They don't really think the election matters that much in the grand scheme of things, and that they'll go to work tomorrow get the same pay check and see the same 10 people in their lives. The candidates who connect with these voters are the politicians that they believe basically are the ones that feel like they will fight for them and care about their anxieties. Democrats are essentially losing based on a perception that they care more about their parties fringes, helping immigrants with no right here over citizens.  Causing inflation (not their fault, but they  are in charge so they get the blame.  These issues aren't a democrat v.s. republican issues. They have become salient issues in every developed country. Go read the Canadian Reddit, Or Europe.  Queens NY. AOC's backyard had nearly 40 percent of  its electorate vote trump (up from 20 percent in 2016/2012). Queens is the most ethnically diverse place in the country. When inflation hit here it wasn't rent went from 1500 to 1800$ as it was in most major cities. It was rent went up 1000$ in 3 years.   \\n  \\nIn NY you can see migrants in every single subway stop and train. They come on to the trains with no trains to sell candy (which almost no one buys). They occupy 20 percent of the hotels in the city, mostly affordable ones paid for by the city (due to a dumb right to shelter ruling. which as a result means that you can't find a hotel under 500$ a night during summer or december  (for the record 2 years ago it was possible to find hotels on off weeks for 120$). Why would locals care about that? Well we have also family and friends that eschew coming to see us due to how much things cost.Democrats need to understand the fight right now is about the parties **BRAND.**  If you put a democratic legislation in front of a current democratic president does not matter who it is, they will sign it. Sensible LGBT rights (signed), Expansion of health care and bills to lower health care cost (signed), Bills that reduce costs of college and forgive student debt (signed), a bill that protects environmental and strengthens climate legislation (signed), bill that increases housing supply or reduces housing cost (signed). No democratic president is going to veto any the current agenda. However, democrats have failed to nominate candidates who are effective standard bearers for their party platform and have let republican party control the narrative about democrats stand for. The biggest fuck up the election was picking Kamala Harris to by VP. Not because she was a bad VP. Its because a 78 year old president should realize that the most likely democrat nominee for the next election and the choice of VP should be a candidate that is MOST likely to win the general election.   \\na","title":"Congressman Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) lays out a new party program"},{"text":"Ive always said that every new small business is an act of hope.

He realized how much sway social media had over elections, and decided to try and buy an election for only 40 billion dollars.   If successful, this would give him quite a bit more power as well as massive government contracts.  Even though he had supported democrats in the past, he had to swap to supporting Trump to gain his trust and an ability to have some control over him.   Elon didn't get stupider as the years went on, he just had to mirror Trump and his supporters to get himself into position to control Trump.   He didn't care that Twitter was losing tons of money because he didn't buy it to be profitable, he bout it to influence elections and policy.  Honestly, a pretty genius move imo.  The one issue is that I am not sure he has enough over Trump to keep Trump's loyalty.   Loyalty goes one way for Trump.  Also, many people before Elon have failed when trying the same tactic.  People think that Trump is a useful idiot and can use them for their ends, only to be cast aside once their usefulness ends.

Live until it kills you!\\")However, the issue is that first step. We don't get to choose to be born, we don't get to choose to die, but every moment in between we are stuck with this awareness of a self that has the sensation of making choices. We have to make choices, there is no \\"not choosing,\\" and yet the universe is indifferent (effectively value-neutral). It doesn't care if we decide to be life-affirming or to reject life outright, it doesn't care if we decide to be coherent and sensible and well-grounded in reality or to throw our hands up in the area and always choose the first option that appears. It doesn't care if we flip a coin for every decision, it doesn't care if we respect that coin flip. This makes any decision subsequent arbitrary. Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche say \\"choose life\\" and I say \\"I flipped a coin and got tails, so no ??\\" and there isn't a way to say who is right without arbitrarily accepting one, or believing you have higher-order/other-worldly/external knowledge, and working from there.I'm not really sure why you're rejecting this. Biologically, we are social. We, as a species, value socialization. Hermits exist, but they're outliers. It's why people live in communities, form relationships, help others, etc. When these relationships are harmed (ex. murder causing relationships with the individual to abruptly end), we conclude that it is bad. When these relationships are strengthened (ex. gifts), we concludr that it is good. This is not arbitrary. This is a direct result of biology. While the line may not always be so obvious, I think many of the common values that we see across cultures throughout the world do find their origins within our biology. Of course, some values likely are arbitrary. But many are not.We can see this behavior in other species as well. For example, cockatoos also have single partners, just like humans. This isn't an arbitrary value that the cockatoos just sat in a meeting and decided one day. It's origins are somewhere within the biology of the cockatoo.The universe doesn't care, but the biology does.","title":"CMV: Without other-wordly knowledge, values are firstly arbitrary"},{"text":"Every single end around will set a precedent and be used against a future GOP minority.

It is that event that is memorialized by the MDCCLXXVI at the base of the pyramid, and not the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, as the uninformed have supposed. ^1The significance of the design is as follows: the pyramid represents the conspiracy for destruction of the Catholic Church, and establishment of a One World, or UN dictatorship, the secret of the Order; the eye radiating in all directions, is the all-spying eye that symbolizes the terroristic, Gestapo-like, espionage agency that Weishaupt set up under the name of Insinuating Brethren, to guard the secret of the Order and to terrorize the populace into acceptance of its rule. This Ogpu had its first workout in the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, which it was instrumental in organizing. It is a source of amazement that the Catholic electorate tolerates the continuance of use of this insignia as part of the Great Seal of the U.S.ANNUIT COEPTIS means our enterprise (conspiracy) has been crowned with success. Below, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM explains the nature of the enterprise; and its means a New Social Order or New Deal.**It should be noted that this insignia acquired Masonic significance only after merger of that Order with Order of Illuminati at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, in 1782.**Benjamin Franklin, John Adams (Roosevelt kinsman) and Thomas Jefferson, ardent Illuminist, and defender of Adam Weishaupt, proposed the above as the reverse of the seal, on the face of which was the eagle symbol, to Congress, which adopted it on June 10, 1782. On adoption of the Constitution, Congress decreed, by Act of September 15, 1789 its retention as seal of the United States. It is stated however, by the State Department in its latest publication on the subject (2880), that **the reverse has never been cut and used as a seal,** and that only the obverse bearing the eagle symbol has been used as official seal and coat of arms. It first was published on the left of the reverse of the dollar bills at the beginning of the New Deal, 1933.What is the meaning of the publication at the outset of the New Deal of this Gestapo symbol that had been so carefully suppressed up to that date that few Americans knew of its existence, other than as a Masonic symbol?It can only mean that with the advent of the New Deal the Illuminist-Socialist-Communist conspirators, followers of Professor Weishaupt, regarded their efforts as beginning to be crowned with success.In effect this seal proclaims to the peoples of the U.S. that **the entire power of their Government supports the conspiracy to undermine and destroy it and the Constitution on which it rests** - that it is **a Government of traitors.*REFERENCES**^1 Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

He has connections to the Jesuits. I also recall Biden having some Freemason connections.That brings me to Dr. Emanuel Josephson. Josephson was a Columbia and Johns Hopkins graduate, and longtime NYC ophthalmologist. Dr. Josephson ran into problems with the corrupt Rockefeller Syndicate and AMA. He would go on to write several books aimed at the Rockefeller Syndicate. Josephson also wrote of Weishaupts historical Illuminati saying that theyd merged with European Freemasonry in 1782, and forced the Vatican to reinstate the Jesuit Order. Nesta Websters earlier work mentions this. Josephson acknowledges the Rothschilds as more of serving the Vatican/Jesuit/Illuminati. Josephson writes:Several groups of members offered Weishaupt special problems. The Protestant princes and rulers of Germany and Europe were delighted with Weishaupts plan to destroy the Catholic Church, and they flocked to the Order. **They brought with them control of the Masonic Order, in which they initiated Weishaupt and his fellow conspirators in 1777.  Subsequently, at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, they effected a merger of the Order of Illuminati and the Masonic Order. Weishaupt sought and welcomed the powerful support of these rulers.** But he realized that he must not permit them to suspect that, in furtherance of his internationalist goal of One World dictatorship, the Order was dedicated to destroying them also. Weishaupt craftily solved this problem by limiting the princes and rulers to the lower degrees and barring them from the knowledge of the true purposes of the Order, that were revealed, cautiously, only to those in the higher degrees. ^1Renegade Jesuits, whom Weishaupt initially welcomed, then rejected, and finally welcomed once again into the Order, and Jews, who were initially rejected and later were welcomed, also constituted special problems.  Eventually, however, Weishaupt and his successors welcomed into the Order these groups, and all others that could be trusted to be thoroughly discontent with the prevailing order. And it was primarily, renegade Catholics, chronic malcontents and revolutionaries among the Protestants, and Jews who were selectively advanced to the highest degrees and innermost secrets of the Order of Illuminati and its successor organizations.An amusing story is told of the earliest relations of the Rothschilds with the Vatican. The Vatican found itself short of ready cash after almost half a century of war waged on it for the Jesuit Order by one of its unordained members, Adam Weishaupt, to avenge its abolition, in 1773, as immoral and a menace to the Church and the Faith by short-lived Pope Clement XIV in his Papal breve Dominus Ac Redemptor. Weishaupt and his fellow Jesuits cut off the income to \\nthe Vatican by launching and leading the French Revolution; by directing Napoleons conquest of Catholic Europe; by the revolt against the Church led by such priests as Father Hidalgo, in Mexico and Latin America; by eventually having Napoleon throw Pope Pius VII in jail at Avignon until he agreed, as the price for his release, to \\nreestablish the Jesuit Order. This Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret, 1822, Treaty of Verona. (72:8 ;73) ^2The Jesuits thus so completely impaired the credit of the Vatican that no Christian banker would entrust it with a loan of needed funds. Only the nouveau riche Jewish upstarts, who had made their fortune in the latter part of the Napoleonic wars, the Rothschilds, would trust the Church with urgently needed 5 million pounds. Pope Gregory XVI was so grateful to the Rothschilds that he conferred on Kalman Rothschild a Papal decoration. In deference to the Jewish faith of the philanthropic banker, the usual cross in the decoration was replaced by a Star of David. Rothschild was incensed at this discriminatory gesture. He demanded, and was awarded, the decoration with a cross. Ever since, the Rothschilds have been the \\nfiscal agents of the Vatican. The Rothschilds sought to extend their financial and political dominion to the United States, for themselves primarily to serve the interests of their Vatican masters.**REFERENCES**^1 Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

Take with it what you will.1st: You don't need to prove anything to us. While i can't speak for everyone who supports the MAGA movement, I can at least say that anyone willing to stand up for what's right- and for common sense- is welcome in my book. That's all the cred you really need.2nd: Family is family, and while they don't agree with what you believe in, there's really no reason to put political differences in the way of those you care about (if you care), unless it comes to blows and abuse (or more often than not, they disown you first for being a MAGA trumper fascist, or whatever). At that point, it's better to keep an amicable disatnce and just live your own life to the best and fullest. Don't let shit like that get you down or make you hate, but always protect what's yours and what you believe in.3rd: If you want to do something, then work on joining a cause that is worth joining or start your own. If you think joining a mormon church will better you as a person and those around you, then go for it. If you think spreading a message is something you want to do, then learn how speak in public, make videos, or write music, and start engaging with other people. Anything (non-violent) to get your message out. Look into ogranizations that follow your own beliefs. See people like Charlie Kirk, who has the vision to create Turning Point to help the younger generation.Read alot, be informed, and don't avoid conflicting views. Know your opponent better than they know themselves, and you'll never lose an argument. Who knows, maybe you can help your family too.I personally try to ascribe to the same beliefs, but I am admittedly limited in my own space, and I don't have the mental nor physical capacity to do what others can. Maybe you can while others can't.","title":"I've been fence sitting all my life, now I'm ready to MAGA!

Trump is already empowering individuals who view the very existence of the Palestinians people as some kind of liberal myth (ironically echoing one of the more out-there antisemitic tropes in the process: the idea that, akshually, there is no actual such thing as a Jewish people or religion, somehow), and who want pro-Palestinian activists deported, expelled from universities, fired from jobs, or even jailed as terrorist supporters.

Even FDR, who was undeniably pro-working class, explicitly said that his goal was to undercut left-wing movements and to save the capitalist system. Though, if we were to point to a decisive moment where the Democratic Party dislodged themselves from working class interests, I would argue this was in 1972 with the changes to the party instituted by the McGovernCFraser Commission as a response to the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Prior to this, the campaign groundwork of the Democratic Party relied heavily on the party retaining strong connections with union grassroots organising, and unions held influence within the party itself and over the selection of party delegates as a result. Effectively this meant that the Democratic Party had to ensure that their program resonated with working-class interests in order to not lose their organising base. The resut of the McGovernCFraser Commission was that the selection of delegates became a purely inter-party issue, which undercut the influence of the unions.It should be said that some of the changes instituted by the McGovernCFraser Commission were positive, such as leading to an increase in female and black representation among delegates from southern states, but it came at the sacrifice of working class interests. When analysing the attitude of the Democratic Party towards organised labour, we can observe them gradually abandoning working class interests from the 1970s and onwards. [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/) from the Atlantic cover this abandonment starting in the 70s. The recent demographic shift of white working class voters becoming a strong base of support for Trump and the GOP is simply the ultimate consequence of this half-decade gradual abandonment of the working class by the Democratic Party.","title":"Dems need to stop being nice to Republicans"},{"text":"except the over 20 court cases that never even made it to trial because the lawyers could not come up with the most base amount of evidence for it.","title":"Now we mustn't be rude to the existential threat to Democracy, dears."},{"text":"They're all coming as well","title":"Matt Gaetzs Friend Demands Court Destroy Records About Sex Party"},{"text":"Honestly, I was pissed when I saw that Biden had invited Trump to the White House for this.

If we are going to talk about it at all, we need to talk intelligently and with policy specifics. Instead of saying \\"universal background checks\\" we should talk about \\"NICS reform\\" and propose a system where you can *optionally* do a background check when transferring to someone. Currently that is impossible without paying an FFL. We could even go a step further and say \\"If you perform a background check when transferring, you get immunity if anything happens with that gun after you transfer it. If you dont and something happens, you might have some kind of criminal or civil liability, depending on the circumstances\\". We could also talk about other things to make the background check system more robust, and to reduce the amount of mental health gun deaths. Most importantly, we could offer something in exchange for all of this. Suppressors are harmless. In fact, they are a health and safety device.

The Democratic party is the oldest political party on the planet.Part of the reason these parties survived up till now and have had over 100 years of largely stable politics, is because the parties acted as gatekeepers to keep the crazies out.Bernie isn't a crazy, but he does represent a huge shift from corporate to union interests. After Regan gutted the unions, Dems have had a tough time building a fragile coalition of donors from both the unions and corporate elite in order to compete with the monied Republican backers. Sanders represents a risk to that base that the Dems weren't willing to take.While the parties need gatekeepers to keep out the Trumps of the world, those gatekeepers can also be too cautious and prevent progress. It's a catch-22, but I *would not* suggest that we follow the Republican's lead here.

I dont deny that Trumps effect on the FDA may have exacerbated the outbreak and it is unfortunate.  Barnica died in 2021, a year before the repeal of Roe v Wade, and Crain was pro life and expecting.  The problem there was misdiagnosis.  Medical malpractice happens all the time, often unknowingly and its always a tragedy.  Not to say there havent been direct problems because of the repeal.  I myself am  a previous democrat and mostly pro choice.  Though I disagree with the choice to not federally protect abortion, I also see why the choice was made.The immigrants in Ohio are legal due to an intentional temporary protection act from Harris that has nothing to due with protecting immigrants and everything to due with a clear attempt at gaining votes from immigrants who rely on democratic policies.  The intentional flooding of illegal migrants into the U.S. is staggering and should raise some serious questions as to why.  The amount of lives lost from irrational border policies and lost or trafficked children far outnumbers any of the damages from previous topics.  The homeless epidemic is not a blue or red issue.  For decades, captured agencies have set the agenda for increased inflation, housing crisis, and the lack of proportional wage increases.  The government doesnt care about us because they are not our government.  They are an oligarchical, globalist elite, whos decisions reflect the desire to dumb down, demasculate, depopulate, sicken, and strip the constitutional rights of American citizens.  I am not a particularly huge fan of Trump and Im sure that some of his choices will have negative consequences.  However, when compared to the agenda set by the current administration and its consequences, he appears to be the obvious choice to return the power to the citizens instead of the global elite.","title":"Now we mustn't be rude to the existential threat to Democracy, dears."},{"text":"\\"As of Wednesday, McCormick led by about 28,000 votes out of more than 6.9 million ballots counted  inside the 0.5% margin threshold to trigger an automatic statewide recount under Pennsylvania law.\\"You post the most inflammatory shit.","title":"It's Disgusting How Bob Casey and His Lawyers Are Trying to Steal an Election He's Lost"},{"text":"And leak of records in 3, 2, 1","title":"Matt Gaetzs Friend Demands Court Destroy Records About Sex Party"},{"text":"Well, I did.I did too (I started kindergarten in 1980), but you're either exaggerating or you grew up somewhere that was drastically different than where I grew up (Maine).Just like they talk about \\"mass shootings\\" today, they talked about the threat of \\"nuclear war\\" back then.They talked about it from time to time in school, but it seemed like a very remote threat. It wasn't anything like the stories I heard from older people who grew up in the 1960s during and immediately after the Cuban Missile Crisis. They said they had drills in school where they were supposed to get under their desks. We never had any drills like that in school, and it was perceived as something corny that was done in the distant past; even some of our teachers who grew up in the 1960s perceived it that way. We knew that if you were close enough to a nuclear explosion for it to cause the school to crumble around you, you were screwed from the intense radiation even if being under your desk did manage to save you from falling debris.Every kid was terrified of that shitI wasn't; not even close, and no one I knew was either. Like I said, it seemed like a very remote threat; not something we ever dwelled on. We were taught the concept of \\"Mutually Assured Destruction\\"...MAD is based on the idea that nuclear weapons are so destructive that neither side would use them because both would be totally destroyed. The threat of MAD is intended to deter the use of nuclear weapons.... as well as the similar concept of \\"Peace through Strength,\\" which we heard from President Reagan.it was in lots of hugely popular movies for all ages of people, it was in the songs and predictively programmed in the TV shows, etc. etc. etc. I think you're overstating this by a lot. I don't remember nuclear war being a popular theme for movies, songs, or TV shows in the 1980s. I remember WarGames (1983) and the made-for-TV movie The Day After from the same year, though I never saw either one of those movies until many years after they were released. There was Red Dawn (1984), but that was about a Soviet-backed invasion of the US, not nuclear war. The Terminator (1984) was premised on a nuclear war happening in the future, but the focus of the movie was saving a woman from a \\"cyborg\\" assassin. As for songs and TV shows, nothing comes to mind. I'm not saying there weren't any, but I doubt there were lots of hugely popular ones.Like today in schools they have \\"active shooter drills\\" we had \\"bomb drills\\"Like I mentioned above, we never did. The only drills we had were fire drills.It sucked very much.\\nAfter a childhood of being scared of that shit, you realize it's just propaganda at leastI loved growing up in the 1980s and rarely gave the threat of nuclear war a second thought.","title":"I remember hearing that nuclear weapons cause damage to the space-time continuum and that was detected by many extraterrestrial species and that is why some of them came here."},{"text":"\\"I see this as an absolute win!\\"","title":"Liberals are fleeing X again  this time for Bluesky"},{"text":"By either projection, if the 2032 Democratic nominee carries the same states that Kamala Harris won this year, the party would receive 12 fewer electoral votes.

I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.Some had cast doubt on Mr Trumps chances of securing a hostage deal in the Middle East after naming a series of foreign policy hawks to his cabinet.In a video from December last year, circulated as Marco Rubios nomination as secretary of state was announced, the Florida senator said he opposed a ceasefire in Gaza and wanted Israel to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on.Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor appointed ambassador to Israel, asserted there was no such thing as a Palestinian during his 2008 presidential campaign.Mr Trump also told the Post that his presidential transition team and the Biden White House enjoyed a very, very good relationship.The meeting between the two men on Wednesday was their first direct interaction since their presidential debate in June, in which Mr Trump suggested his opponent was mentally deficient.At the same event, Mr Biden said the Republican had the morals of an alley cat and had sex with a porn star, referring to his alleged affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/)","title":"Biden asked Trump to work with him for hostage deal in Middle East at White House meeting"},{"text":"I would have loved to be a fly on the wall for this conversation","title":"After tumultuous campaign, Biden and Trump chat for 2 hours"},{"text":"Democrats should just release it anyway.

After the 2030 Census, the home of Hollywood and Silicon Valley will likely be forced to reckon with its stagnating population and receding influence. When congressional seats are reallocated to adjust for population changes, California is almost certain to be the biggest loserand to be seen as the embodiment of the Democratic Partys failures in state and local governance. The liberal Brennan Center is projecting a loss of four seats, and the conservative American Redistricting Project, a loss of five. Either scenario could affect future presidential races, because a states Electoral College votes are determined by how many senators and representatives it has. In 2016, after her loss to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton argued that shed won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forwardan outlook that she contrasted with Donald Trumps Make America great again slogan. But now Democrats self-conception as a party that represents the future is running headlong into the reality that the fastest-growing states are Republican-led. According to the American Redistricting Project, New York will lose three seats and Illinois will lose two, while Republican-dominated Texas and Florida will gain four additional representatives each if current trends continue. Other growing states that Trump carried in this months election could potentially receive an additional representative. By either projection, if the 2032 Democratic nominee carries the same states that Kamala Harris won this year, the party would receive 12 fewer electoral votes. Among the seven swing states that the party lost this year, Harris came closest to winning in the former Blue Wall of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvaniaat least two of which are likely to lose an electoral vote after 2030. Even adding those states to the ones Harris won would not be enough to secure victory in 2032. The Democrat would need to find an additional 14 votes somewhere else on the map. Population growth and decline do not simply happen to states; they are the result of policy choices and economic conditions relative to other states. Some states lose residents because their economy hasnt kept up with the rest of the countrys. But in much of blue America, including California and New York, economic dynamism and high wages arent enough to sustain population growth, because the skyrocketing cost of shelter eclipses everything else. The amenities that these states offerthe California coastline, the New York City cultural scenestart to look like the historic molding on a house with its roof caved in. Policy failures are dragging down the Democrats prospects in two ways: by showing the results of Democratic governance in sharp, unflattering relief, and by directly reducing the partys prospects in presidential elections and the House of Representatives. California, New York, and other slow-growing coastal Democratic strongholds have taken an explicitly anti-population-growth tack for decades. They took for granted their natural advantages and assumed that prosperity was a given. People willingly giving up their residencies in these coastal areas is a sign of how dismal the cost of living is. While the media are likely to pick up on anecdotes about wealthy people complaining about tax levels and political norms in liberal states, data show that population loss is heavily concentrated among lower-income people and people without a college degree. In an analysis of census data, the Public Policy Institute of California found that more than 600,000 people who have left the Golden State in the past decade have cited the housing crisis as the primary reason. When people vote with their feet, theyre sending a clear signal about which places make them optimistic about the future. What does it say about liberal governance that Democratic states cannot compete with Florida and Texas? Remarkably, none of this happened by accident. A hostility toward population growth and people in general has suffused the politics of Democratic local governance. The researcher Greg Morrow meticulously documented the political effort in Los Angeles to stop people from moving to the city over the back half of the 20th century. In the early 1970s, the UCLA professor Fred Abraham pushed for growth limits, arguing, We need fewer people herea quality of life, not a quantity of life. We must request a moratorium on growth and recognize that growth should be stopped. Morrow also points to comments from the Sierra Club, which recommended limiting residential housing  to lower birth rates. Such arguments preceded a now infamous downzoning in the 70s and 80s, which substantially reduced the number of homes that could be legally built, slashed the potential population capacity of Los Angeles from an estimated 10 million people to 4 million, and spurred one of the nations most acute housing and homelessness crises. Self-styled progressives and liberals in blue communities across the country have taken similar approaches, all but directing would-be newcomers to places like Texas and Florida. Contrast this attitude with Florida Governor Ron DeSantiss boast, in a press release during his unsuccessful presidential-primary campaign, that people are flocking to Florida and fleeing California. DeSantis has pursued pro-growth housing policies that allow working-class people to afford housing in his state. For a long time, failures of local governance have remained divorced from the national political conversation. What can President Joe Biden have to do with the decision of Marin or Westchester County to refuse new housing supply? But national Democrats cannot overlook the issue any longer. As researchers from the Economic Innovation Group recently noted, the biggest declines in Democrats vote share from 2020 to 2024 occurred in the most expensive and most populous counties. In the days since Harriss defeat, Democrats have defended Bidens tenure by arguing that inflation was beyond the presidents control, or pointing to other economic accomplishments. But no Republican stopped San Francisco from building housing, and Trump is not responsible for New York Citys byzantine housing-permitting regime. (In fact, as I write this, New York is on the verge of watering down a proposal that would ease the construction of apartment buildings and smaller homes. In the course of my work, I hear many policy makers and residents in blue communities lament their intractable housing crises, seemingly unaware that many places have solved a supposedly insurmountable problem. The only difference is those places are in states run by Republicans. It is not too late to reverse Californias stagnationor that of New York and other expensive states. The cost of housing is quite literally a signal for how many millions of people would love to live in those places. Yet, in the aftermath of Trumps reelection, as several Democratic governors have telegraphed their intent to act as bastions of resistance in the coming years, none has focused on the issue that has most hollowed out the promise of liberal America. Nowhere in these headline-seeking pronouncements is a plan to address the housing and cost-of-living crisis or even a reckoning with the failures that produced the status quo. In part this is due to Democrats failure to understand the link between their anti-growth policies at the state and local level and the national viability of their party. For years, Democrats have gotten to represent the growing, vibrant parts of this country and have become complacent, presuming economic dominance even in the absence of good policy. But last weeks results should not have shocked state and local Democratic policy makerspeople have been voting with their feet for years.","title":"The Democrats Are Committing Partycide"},{"text":"All around everywhere.

And it happened in numerous states. NO WAY did all of those rural RED Republicans show up in NC and only vote for the president OR vote for a raging lunatic Republican for president, then say, \\"But locally, within NC, yeah, I trust this Democrat guy to run things well.\\" That doesn't happen. And it doesn't happen across numerous swing states in the same election.I don't buy the election results for a second. And I'm not sure why so many of you are as well. I'm calling for a close examination of the votes, I'm calling for a closer look at places where bomb threats happened. This is different than just saying, \\"They must have cheated!\\" This is saying the voting numbers in numerous swing states look HIGHLY unusual, so let's do a recount and see.Eight years of \\"the election was rigged!\\" has people fearful of saying that maybe Trump and Musk just rigged this election. I'm happy to be proven wrong, but let's recount the votes in the swing states before we hand over our democracy to Trump/Musk.","title":"Elizabeth Warren sounds the alarm on potential Trump corruption"},{"text":"Fuck bozos and his Washington post for allowing trump to be sanewashed","title":"Liberals are fleeing X again  this time for Bluesky"},{"text":"I saw this before, and it is glorious.

That's the entire point of the thing to be a safety check in case the American people elect a potential tyrant. But electors haven't worked that way in well over 150 years. Then another mechanism is to have Congress refuse the results and elect someone else, but Congress is full of people loyal to the man and not the country. Then finally, Congress could remove him once as he takes power, but again loyal to the man, not the country. Finally the Supreme Court was designed to remain completely neutral and would always side with the Constitution and preventing any branch from gaining too much power could limit the damage, but they have been compromised as well. But the framers of the Constitution never dreamed that a party would be more loyal to a man than the country itself and never installed any real consequences should a president become a tyrant. They believed that there would always be enough people in the government who would act in good faith, and people would instead remain loyal to their home states needs. They also thought that while the Federal government was of a higher authority, it could never be used against the individual states.This has happened before. Andrew Jackson was a bomb to the established government that was still on shaky ground and upended everything while destroying the economy and trampling rights. But the only silver lining was that Jackson still loved the country itself and believed what he was doing was for the betterment of the nation. Trump is just burning it down to establish himself as a dictator. The only thing that can resist him is the bureaucracy of the Federal government, which is what generally blunted his damage last time, so he is specifically attempting to target that first.","title":"Elizabeth Warren smells something fishy going on with Trumps transition team"},{"text":"Insincerity will be the death of us all, even if youre playing a game.","title":"A compassionate critique of progressivism"},{"text":"trump will be too busy with his bullshit deportation policy so the whole \\"jail Pelosi and Biden\\" bullshit will fade away.","title":"Biden Overcomes His Aversion to Gripping Slimy Things"},{"text":"MSNBC ratings collapse:- Joy Reid - down 54.6%\\n- Ari Melber - down 49.6%\\n- Chris Hayes - down 47.2%\\n- Alex Wagner - down 53.6%\\n- Morning Joe - down 39.6%\\n- Stephanie Ruhle - down 67%\\n- Andrea Mitchell - down 39.7%This is a beautiful list of failure ??","title":"Does the left know that Fox only has 2.5 million viewers and 72 million poeople who don't watch Fox voted for Trump?"},{"text":"Makes me wonder how long the filibuster is going to survive","title":"How the Senate Filibuster Will Force Trump to Negotiate With Democrats"},{"text":"Standard Operations.pay no attention to the man behind the curtain","title":"The Onion and Connecticut Democrats Destroy Freedom of Speech"},{"text":" Don (, in Russian)Your obscure reference to this Russian river clearly shows that you're a secret \\"Putin puppet\\" too!","title":"Q: where are the smug toxic Biden bros and Kamala Stans?

Dennis:*  \\n  \\nWith President-elect?Donald Trump?and his fellow Republicans winning control of the White House plus?both chambers of Congress?in the Nov. 5 election, the Democrats will have one important tool for checking the power of the majority party: the filibuster. Thats the prerogative enjoyed by the minority party in the Senate to demand never-ending debate to thwart legislation, which must be approved by both that body and the House of Representatives.Filibusters once required senators to stand and speak for hours, but since the 1970s, the mere threat of one has been enough to grind a bill to a halt. Almost all bills are doomed unless supported by the three-fifths supermajority required to end a filibuster. With 53 of the 100 seats in the new Senate, the Republicans fall short of that. As a result, many pieces of Trumps agenda will require negotiating with the Democrats. The minority party can also use the filibuster to slow, though not stop, the confirmation of nominees to?more than 1,000?positions the president can fill?only with Senate approval, including cabinet members, Supreme Court justices, federal judges and ambassadors.","title":"How the Senate Filibuster Will Force Trump to Negotiate With Democrats"},{"text":"Ah yes, another failed 2020 primary candidate, exactly who we need to be listening to rn","title":"Seth Moulton Says Dems Proving His Point After Backlash to Trans Comments"},{"text":"She tried (see: CFPB).

I pointed out that this commenter's argument against misogyny was based on very fundamental fallacies.  It's almost like it was taken from a textbook where the students would then be asked to explain why the argument is faulty or something that someone might post sarcastically.Your argument also exhibits some basic issues, although not obviously ridiculous ones.  Your base assumption that the Democratic party doesn't harbor any bigots or misogynists is pretty easily disproven.  There literally videos and interviews of people saying things like, \\"I don't have anything against women, but I just don't think a woman should be president right now.\\"Democrats act misogynistic against Republican women candidates all the time.  Why do you think that the Harris campaign sent her proxies out to talk to groups of black men to get them on board with voting for a woman?Hispanic culture, much like Northern European culture, is strongly patriarchal.   It is hard to look at the vote split between Latino men and Latina women and conclude that misogyny doesn't play a role.Misogyny isn't even uncommon among women, much less men. In the final tally, Harris will probably be well within 2% of Trump.  If you can make a solid argument that less than 1% of potential Democratic voters don't display misogynistic tendencies, I would love to see it.  But even in that case, about 50% of the margin could still be caused by misogyny.Data from Reuters/Ipsos polls (6116 respondents) conducted shortly before and after the 2016 presidential election (from 4 to 17 November 2016) were used to test whether: (1) women and men differed in favorability toward Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, (2) sexism (either hostile or benevolent) predicted favorability ratings toward each candidate. Overall, men and women rated Clinton similarly, but men favored Trump significantly more than women did. Hostile sexist attitudes were second only to general political orientation in predicting positive attitudes toward Trump; however, hostile sexism predicted disfavoring Clinton only among women and not among men. By contrast, benevolent sexism weakly, but significantly predicted greater favorability toward Clinton but was unrelated to Trump favorability ratings. Thus, hostile sexist attitudes among voters significantly helped Trump, whereas benevolent sexism yielded only a weak protective effect toward Clinton.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21565503.2019.1633931","title":"Letters: Americans should admit that we rejected Kamala Harris because she's a woman"},{"text":"You've ignored my arguments and created strawmen to push over instead.You didn't acknowledge the point about listeria cases popping up like crazy after Trump's last round of deregulatory actions.You also have ignored the news if you are saying that women aren't dying from lack of abortions.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/texas-woman-death-abortion-ban-miscarriagehttps://www.propublica.org/article/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtalaHere are two that are reported.  It is becoming common for hospitals to refuse to perform an abortion until a fetus's heart ceases to beat.  Despite the medical impossibility of viability or that the situation will change, doctors are refusing to provide the legally allowed services due to hospital lawyers trying to avoid lawsuits and legal charges.This is just with a quick google search.  Many, many more cases are out there and have been reported on since Roe was struck down and the states started enacting abortion bans. If you break into this country, or any other country for that matter, you have committed a crime and are therefore a criminal and should be deported. It is an slap in the face to all of the immigrants trying to enter our country legally. Especially when if you break the law, you are granted food and housing access, all while actual American citizens and veterans are homeless and hungry. The logic there is non existent.Did you miss the part where I said that Vance talked about removing legal status? The Haitians in Ohio did not enter illegally and were granted Temporary Protective Status.  Why should these people be deported?  As a result of their legal status, they are paying taxes, building businesses, and thriving communities.Oh and you are trying to paint a false scenario where citizens are going hungry while ignoring the massive push from the GOP to cut free lunches and meals from schools.  On one hand, you complain that immigrants are getting free food and citizens go hungry.  Then on the other, you rip the food out of the mouths of citizens.Veterans and citizens are not hungry and homeless due to Democratic policies.  High housing interest rates, lack of medical care, and giving banks freedom to jack up housing prices are the biggest reasons Americans go hungry or lack proper homes.

I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.Some had cast doubt on Mr Trumps chances of securing a hostage deal in the Middle East after naming a series of foreign policy hawks to his cabinet.In a video from December last year, circulated as Marco Rubios nomination as secretary of state was announced, the Florida senator said he opposed a ceasefire in Gaza and wanted Israel to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on.Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor appointed ambassador to Israel, asserted there was no such thing as a Palestinian during his 2008 presidential campaign.Mr Trump also told the Post that his presidential transition team and the Biden White House enjoyed a very, very good relationship.The meeting between the two men on Wednesday was their first direct interaction since their presidential debate in June, in which Mr Trump suggested his opponent was mentally deficient.At the same event, Mr Biden said the Republican had the morals of an alley cat and had sex with a porn star, referring to his alleged affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/)","title":"Biden asked Trump to work with him for hostage deal in Middle East at White House meeting"},{"text":"The Biden Administration and the Federal government or Federal law enforcement isnt going to do shit.

Point 2 is simply incorrect. We can argue until we're blue in the face about what the best industrial policy is, but the one we have (or rather did because Trump started a shift and Biden continued it) is very pro finance and lawyer. There's no such thing as an unbiased industrial policy, and it's wrong to pretend that \\"third way\\" laissez faire industrial policy is anything but industrial policy that favors finance.2. I'm not sure of the details of the mentioned regulations, so I guess I'll just say that there is a sweet spot for regulations. In many places we're way over that sweet spot, and in others we're under it. Caveat emptor.3. I'm making this a separate one because it's a big deal. This might be unpopular here, but prosecuting gun manufacturers for crimes used by their guns is quite possibly the dumbest idea I've ever heard and is clearly unconstitutional because it's a de facto gun ban. I see the democrats have also still not realized that gun control is only popular in the coastal cities and Chicago. If it's a politicians pet issue they're free to try and get elected, but it's clearly not something you build a platform on.4. The entirety of point 4 sounds good but is also saying \\"draw the fucking owl\\". 5. As much as it'd personally enrich me, I'm not sure if the American public has much appetite for more R&amp;D spending. While Academia and the National Labs are hurting and have been hurting for a while, I'm not sure if they're good enough systems to really justify significantly more investment. It really does move at a glacial pace and only a handful of people in any given field actually do worthwhile work. I'd be on board with increasing it like 10% to help the devil you know which has been getting squeezed for decades now, but doubling is a big ask. What actually needs to be done here is properly punishing CEOs who make dumb ass decisions like Agilent laying off an R&amp;D department even though their business is making fancy \\"shovels\\" in an incredibly competitive space. Your \\"shovel\\" needs to work better, require less maintenance, or be easier to use for anybody to actually buy it, and that means you need to not be out R&amp;Ded by your competitors. Sadly he got his bonus for getting profit back, and he'll be gone by the time Shimadzu and Waters et al completely kick them out of entire market segments and Agilent is a shell of their former selves.6. 9 doesn't make any sense to me. The beginning feels like a non sequitur to the explanation. Beginning is a \\"draw the fucking owl\\" again, but sure I guess.  Either way, it's the \\"explaining as if you're just stupid\\" that's condescension. Not the pretending you didn't hear it.7. On 11, I'm not entirely convinced that it's anybody but the Ivy League getting burned there, and that's probably a good thing.  They've been held in unreasonably high regard for a really long time even though undergrad education is the same everywhere. 3000 level E&amp;M at MIT covers and uses Griffiths, and so does 3000 level E&amp;M at East Central University in middle of nowhere Oklahoma.

This is a widespread misunderstanding of the economics of plant construction. Learning curves in nuclear are just like every other industry except the learning curves are site specific or at the very least construction team specific. The regulatory environment has just made it hard to pass learning from one construction to the next because construction starts happen so rarely and because new requirements get stacked up over time, often in the middle of a unit's construction.Nuclear can and does experience the same learning curves as other industries but plant construction must be continuous, which means regulatory burden must be reasonable, and ideally the same site should be used for as many units as possible. (4 or more is ideal, 1-2 units is insufficient). It also means there has to be room on the grid to add that much stable power so we ideally have to either have a carbon tax or mandated retirement for the legacy fossil plants we are trying to replace.","title":"Congressman Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) lays out a new party program"},{"text":"Exactly. Musk bought it to change it from an ostensibly open public square into a centralized, privatized sphere that consolidates control and visibility according to ideological and economic criteria. To use a term from Foucault, Musks management of Twitter is a direct exercise of power/knowledge: modified algorithms and content policies (unilaterally decided by Musk) now privilege specific ideologies, reinstating voices previously banned for hate speech or misinformation. Hes turned Twitter into his personal panopticon, where Musk controls the visibility and legitimacy of discourse.The decision to sell blue checks was another critical piece. Here, visibilityan essential element of political voicewas contingent on users economic capital, turning Twitter into a gated community rather than an egalitarian forum. This shift turned the public square into a marketplace, where influence is wielded through wealth and conformity to Musks favored ideologies. As a result, the diverse, pluralistic discourse has been significantly diminished, stifling the exchange of ideas that once thrived in this crucial space. This effect is compounded more if you consider that these social spaces have replaced traditional third spaces. In essence, Musk reconfigured Twitter into a curated, ideologically filtered platform, where discourse is increasingly shaped by capital and ideological alignment, dismantling its democratic potential as an open public square. He used it successfully and is now expanding into other politics.I've said it before, but I think Musk is the best example. Global corporations are modern empires that wield significantly more power than any historical empire.  Musk is no different than Napoleon, Leopold II, or Ivan, and this is how he should be viewed.","title":"Liberals are fleeing X again  this time for Bluesky"},{"text":"Bad news: Bluesky doesn't have ads.","title":"Liberals are fleeing X again  this time for Bluesky"},{"text":"Its funny to say it was obvious the depression in votes is not something I think anyone saw coming.

They fear his commitment to the everyday American soldier and to Trumps dreaded America First agenda. They dont fear that he will bungle the job because of a lack of qualifications; they fear he will shake up the Deep State status quo and undo all their work to subvert the military.Thats why the Left fears the idea of Pete Hegseth as SecDef. He is a warrior and a leader C not a soft D.C. bureaucrat C and an existential threat to a woke military, and that is why he is the right man for the job.Brief summary: \\"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and Army combat veteran, for Secretary of Defense. Hegseth's nomination has sparked controversy due to his lack of senior military or national security experience, despite his impressive academic and military credentials. Critics argue that his background as a media personality and junior officer may not be sufficient for the role, while supporters believe he will bring a fresh perspective and focus on efficiency and reducing bureaucracy in the Defense Department.\\"","title":"The Left Loses its Mind Over Hegseth as SecDef | Frontpage Mag"},{"text":"With a crack pipe","title":"Biden should invoke the insurrection act to overturn the electionto protect democracy"},{"text":"She could've just watched a Bernie stump speech, and repeated it verbatim, and would've frankly gotten a lot of excitement from the left.

The reason she lost is because she ran a bad campaign.

That being said, I do sympathise with the feeling of wanting to do literally anything to avoid seemingly inevitable and catastrophic disaster. But unfortunately America already had that opportunity at the voting booths, and the American people voted against democracy. Also democrats are partially to blame for not just sticking with Joe.

History doesnt align with what you are saying.Trump got roughly the same amount of votes as he did in 2020, no one switched votes.  A contingent of Hispanic and Latino men have always been more socially conservative than the rest of the Democratic base.  The reality is that the millions of irregular younger Democratic voters sat out the election.Americans are dumb as fuck and think and believe whatever they are told.  There is no moving of goal posts.  There is no accurate way to measure the DNA of North American indigenous peoples with a simple test because there isnt a large enough pool of people contributing their DNA.  Contributing to this fact is that people were nomadic and moved from North America into Central and South America.  So someone who is 100% indigenous to North America will show up as having a connection to Central and South America, just due to larger pools of people submitting their DNA in different regions along the continent.  The Cherokee Nation doesnt care about DNA its concern is primarily citizenship, the manufactured scandal generated by the Right was about Warrens ethnic genetic heritage, these are two separate issues.  You dont see the Secretary of State of Ireland complaining that Kevin Mccarthy says hes Irish...You have to be mentally stunted to not understand just how idiotic this attack on Warren is.DeJoy holds massive conflict of interests, and in his role at the USPS has shown that he has sought to gain personal benefit from his position at the enormous expense of the American public.'Mainstream economists'  Are you fucking kidding?  The majority of the U.S. has been in a recession since the Trump administration.  You look at growth of GDP per capita and its been down for years, while debt has skyrocketed.  That is the definition of recession.  Mainstream economists push the success of Wall Street as an indicator of economic prosperity.  A couple thousand multinational corporations listed on a few stock exchanges do not represent the American economy, the tens of millions of American businesses being destroyed by the private equity styled smash and grab method of business is the American 'economy.'  What you are referring to are 'Wall Street' economists, their agenda isnt the well being of the average American.  Being a 'mainstream' economist in the current political climate means you are an enemy of the average American tax payer.Republicans changed how the inflation rate was measured back in the 90s to benefit large corporate interests to fuck workers out of fair pay and benefits.  Its no longer measures price increases on a fixed basket of goods.  They allowed substitutions of cheaper goods at random to replace price increases on product invalidating the recording of real world inflation.  And there is zero oversight, all the data is private so no independent group can comb through the consumer data and validate or question it.The CPI price index does not measure price increases relating to temperature increases, like climate change.  Food price increases from crop losses from drought or winter freezes are not factored in.  Rural America is not counted at all.  Insurances services are not counted at all.  Major cost of living increases are not being observed by the CPI.The PCE price index doesnt measure food or energy prices at all.The Federal Reserve increased the money supply by trillions of dollars more than what was necessary to address the pandemic, increasing inflation, promoting the private equity style of investment.  The consolidation of business by large corporations, generating massive lay offs, the manufacturing of supply chains to increase revenue.  This is what has caused our economic crisis.  The goal of Trump was to reduce the value of the dollar, to reduce the debt of the 1%.  To reduce his personal debt.  And now you have national debt exploding, the interest on the debt growing larger.  Republicans address this by exponentially making the issue worse by cutting taxes of the wealthy and placing larger fiscal burdens on the bottom.  There has been no 'soft landing,' its why Harris did not get elected.  A massive amount of Democratic voters are still struggling while leadership lies to them about the economic reality of the country.  All Biden and Harris did was generate an extreme amount of voter apathy. My problem is with unregulated capitalism bordering on fascism.  Which is what the modern Republican party has moved into, Italian styled fascism with a Christian nationalist bent.The E.U. isnt a state, you cant really compare it to the U.S., it employed quantitative easing and other policies that generated inflation along with sanctions on Russia having a far more significant impact on their currency than it does the U.S. dollar.If anyone was paying attention to what the incoming Trump administration has planned, you wouldnt be calling me a 'Doomer.'  Bidens failure to act is going to result in the end of the U.S. as a world power.The absolute insanity of what is happening is lost on the majority of the country, thats how you can gauge just how fucked the U.S. is.","title":"Now we mustn't be rude to the existential threat to Democracy, dears."},{"text":"\\"these people\\"?\\nThe lesson is that image trumps substance whenever dealing with the masses.?\\nImage is junk food, substance is bitter medicine.

Democrats talk to us and about our issues way more than Republicans do. Democrats have a more rational stance on immigration reform that involves a combination of securing the border and a path to citizenship for those that are already here and functioning members of society. Outreach isnt the problem. I would argue that even governing isnt the problem since Democrats have actually tried to get bills passed in congress multiple times.Turns out, Latinos arent really one group of people. We come from 33 different countries with different cultures and we have multiple generations at different stages of the American assimilation process. Latinos are mostly losing the war with the Marco Rubio-like, Ted Cruz-like Latinos that are far removed from the immigration issue because their families have been here for multiple generations. Their number one aspiration is to be accepted into suburban White America. Theres a huge cultural gap between first generation immigrants and multi-generation Latino Americans.Also, Latino dont see themselves as Latino. They seem themselves as Mexican, Cuba, Puerto Rican, Dominican, etc. So its hard to unite all of us on certain causes. If you come from Cuba(to pick a random nationality), who hasnt had mass immigration in like 20-30 years, its not automatic that you relate to the Venezuelan people, whose mass immigration crisis is happening right now.","title":"Democrats are losing Latino men.

Gallego focused on bringing his campaign to Latino voters  sometimes, without talking about politics at all. His campaign hosted rodeos, boxing match watch parties, and carne asada cookouts. His team took food to construction shift workers at work sites after theyd clocked out in the early morning. Knocking on peoples doors, after shift workers are exhausted and preparing for the next day, wont work, he said.?Talk to them. And talk to them as often as possible, Gallego said. And dont expect you to be able to talk to them one way through TV.?\\nThere are millions and millions of Latino men out there, Gallego said, and theyre not afraid to speak their mind.?Democrats on the national stage also missed the mark in how they spoke about immigration. Gallegos first Spanish-language TV ad was about border security. Latinos in Arizona looked at the migration crisis at the border, with refugees pouring into the country, and called it chaos, Gallego said.?While campaigning, We didnt actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesnt believe it anymore, Gallego said, meaning, Latino voters dont believe Washington will actually pass a massive immigration reform bill in the near future.Growing up working class, theres nothing more hurtful than working hard and then not being able to provide for your family, Gallego said. And I instinctively knew thats what these men were going through.This is the first time Ive ever seen men say I cant do this, Gallego said.

Been on my mind since the moment we lost and keep in mind I'm a former rural Republican, so I get how these people tick better than most.Yes, you're right. We can accept that the media landscape isn't in our favor and just bend over and take it, or we can try to do something about it. If we know media silos are the problem and that the bottom fell out with non-college working class voters, then it seems the best place to start is (1) not a run a 2008 campaign where you just jump from national news to national news and spam rallies preaching to the choir, and instead utilize your assets such as your billion dollars raised and Tim Walz who can speak to guns and sports and go into the smaller media silos and places like Joe Rogan. Additionally, (2) You take that billion dollars and start *educating* the electorate and influencing where they are. I've been saying it for years, but if you have a growing education problem in America, the only solution is more teachers. The vast majority of money would be better spent using ad-buys and talk-show time re-teaching Americans the fundamentals of civics, dispelling myths, teaching pieces of critical-thinking and showing examples of fallacies one piece at a time. Lies told often enough become true; but telling the truth often enough *also* becomes true. Not saying it's perfect, but it's the only option we've got unless we keep letting the blind lead the blind. So activism in the off-season is key. But look, ultimately I don't blame the Harris campaign too much. If they had more than 3 months, maybe they would've done this. The blame for this loss falls much more on Biden for not committing to stepping down sooner; as well as the DNC who did not see the writing on the wall when both pre and post-2024 primaries, 2/3 of Democrats and the majority of Independents wanted someone else. What I know doesn't work is playing into the hand of Republican narratives that only further shifts what is defined as \\"center\\" in the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) as more rightward. That's a losing game.Democrats need to actually stand up for something because they'll otherwise always just be perceived as a weaker, less authentic version of Republicans. As a result, their own base of supporters will sit out, be unenthused, while Republicans will attract people because they are at least committed to a vision.Edit: I'm generally not an accelerationist, but we just lost everything running your playbook against one of what senior Democrats once perceived as the weakest Republican candidate. If there isn't much more to lose, then this is the best time to build ourselves from the ground up and create a vision and theme that is our own and that attracts others through conviction.","title":"Elizabeth Warren sounds the alarm on potential Trump corruption"},{"text":"Genuinely curious, where do you try to get your news/political sources from?","title":"Elizabeth Warren sounds the alarm on potential Trump corruption"},{"text":"I'm ok with going after Dems *when appropriate*, but he needs to be ready to go after *anyone* where it's warranted.

The headlines after the election focused on several groups (e.g. Latino men) that changed their voting preferences by large margins. I don't blame any particular group for losing the election, but we shouldn't ignore people who do switch. a DNA test end up proving it correct.Yes like many Americans she has a tiny percentage of indigenous blood. Too bad it's voters opinions and not DNA tests that matter. She looks and acts white as hell and she's not recognized by any native tribes. And the argument you made about non-US located native Americans? That's called moving the goal post.it was the lack of support and sabotage from Democratic leadership that caused most of her problems.It's always someone else's fault, isn't it? Nevermind that it's the candidates job to win support from party members in a party primary.called out the media and then the Cherokee Nation for being pedantic none of this would be an issue.Damn now we're blaming the actual indigenous people for Warren's gaffe. Interesting take.Biden could have removed board members of the USPS for cause, which there is plenty, and replaced them people who would have removed DeJoy. And with Powell, Biden could have removed him and the Vice Chair for cause, which again there is an overwhelming abundance of evidence to do so.What cause exactly?Powell is the one who ruined the economy, who is at the very forefront of the massive transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top.Powell has near universal support among mainstream economists for his job tackling inflation without running the economy into a recession. Many pundits doubted he could pull off the so called \\"soft landing\\". It sounds like you have a problem with capitalism or fiscal policy, not the fed's monetary policy.Trump has repeatedly stated his objective was to weaken the U.S. dollar and cause inflation, guess whats happening.The dollar has strengthened vis-a-vis the Euro, so I guess in your view Powell must not have gotten the memo.t would have been completely 'legal' for Biden to act on these issues.

This is a big deal for nuclear as the biggest thing stopping it from being built is upfront capital costs. This could be done by say, adding carbon taxes to cheaper fossil fuel based power or promising contracts for base load power. If an operator can make a business case for building a reactor based on these policy solutions, why would they?The first potential problems I see with this is just straight competition with wind, solar, and battery storage. The prices and effeciencies or these technologies are dropping continuously. I think there is still room for nuclear in our power mix, but a lot of those reason are disappearing as we find reserves in North America of the materials needed to make solar and batteries and prices come down and effeciencies go up. Nuclear hasn't seen the same reduction in costs per unit of power and instead has seen the opposite.?\\nThe second is that demand signals only work for long term projects like this is if they companies that would build the reactors believe these factors will stay in place past the current government. For example, a nuclear power plant that breaks ground today wouldn't be complete and operational in 4 years meaning the market conditions could be different then which defeats the purpose of the signals unless they can survive the following administration.?\\nAs an aside, this is another big problem with the Trump admin. His existence is an uncertainty for business which stifles long term investment. Ie if a political is willing to tear up the rules, how can you reduce the risk and plan a long term capital project when you don't know what the psychopath will do next?","title":"Congressman Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) lays out a new party program"},{"text":"Absolutely.

On something like bathrooms offer tax breaks for businesses and funding for public schools to build 1 or 2 additional single toilet, single sink bathrooms in a private room. Label them whatever you want but I think \\"privacy bathrooms\\" is fitting. They can be unisex, have handicap access, and any other features to give the most people the most access to a bathroom. I'm sure as kids we've all had the poop of shame that is.... explosive in nature I sure would have loved to have a access to a privacy bathroom instead of having my loud farts echo from the cafeteria all the way to the gym. Same when I had a cast on my shin I couldn't put much pressure on it and it was extremely awkward trying to use a urinal with a crutch and attempting to pull my pants down with my legs spread eagle as people passed by. Progressive leaders and democrats can tout them as unisex bathrooms if they want but I think there are so many more uses that everyone would appreciate I mean think of elderly people needing assistance in sitting on the toilet or getting up or if you have a father out with his young daughter and she needs help going to the bathroom.On school sports, mandate that colleges must  allocate a certain percentage of their scholarships without gender being a factor. Many colleges have stuff like archery, pickleball, billiards, and bowling where gender really has no impact and teams are mixed-sex by choice. If they want to use some of the allocation from archery because they don't have such a team or it's needed to give a trans person a scholarship for the womens track team they can do that and no biological women lose \\"their slot\\" because of it.

Free speech is absolutely necessary for democracy, because voters need access to information. But when one political party weaponizes speech to spread misinformation, they can bring down a democracy. Unfortunately our US Constitution and system of laws has no protections against that.So let's acknowledge that tens of millions of voters, not all were not MAGA cult members, were conned into choosing Trump because Republicans taught them to mistrust both parties, and they were a wash in a tsunami of misinformation. Others sat out the election for the same reason.So when someone sends their money to the Nigerian Prince, do you say oh well, that's what they chose to do?

Whereas people will look at those external factors and go \\"Oh, okay then, that's a 'proper' reason to be depressed, we'll leave off\\" - when people seemingly have no 'real' reason to be depressed, this is often where toxic positivity really comes to the forefront. \\"You should exercise! It really helps!\\" or \\"You should get out more, it'd do you good to see people, take your mind off things!\\"&amp;nbsp;You see this as neutral, unharmful and possibly 'slightly annoying' at worst.&amp;nbsp;I disagree. Vehemently. &amp;nbsp;Firstly, people suffering from intrinsic depression often have intense feelings of shame. They can see their inability to deal with life like 'normal' people as a fundamental failing, and it can often be a stick they use to beat themselves with. \\"Other people can do X, Y and Z - why can't I? I'm such a fucking useless piece of shit!\\" on top of \\"There are other people out there who have it far worse than me? What have I got to complain about? I'm so fucking pathetic, I'm just a burden to everyone around me...\\"&amp;nbsp;Add to this that often when in the depths of depression, the most basic everyday tasks can become insurmountable challenges. Literally spending days in bed because you don't have the energy or motivation to do anything, even things necessary for survival, like eating. Not washing or brushing your teeth for days because you can't even manage that. Barely managing to use the toilet because you don't want to literally be sleeping in your own shit, but only just.&amp;nbsp;People who've not suffered from depression are simply unable to comprehend how debilitating it can be. They can't understand how you can not eat for a week because you couldn't muster up the energy. They cannot put themselves in the shoes of that person and try to feel what it's like to be them.&amp;nbsp;So whilst these cheery encouragements might *seem* well-intentioned and harmless, what you fail to recognise is that what seems simply and easy to you is akin to suggesting they go climb Everest. And the \\"You should try it, it might help! Just give it a go!\\" is subtly reinforcing that deep-seated notion they already have, that *this is their fault and if they weren't such a lazy fucking loser they could just be better, and normal*.&amp;nbsp;That may not be the message being broadcast, but it's the message being received. When communicating with someone that's depressed in this way, you need to remember that everything you say goes through the depression translation filter, which figures out how to interpret everything in the most negative way possible and align with their own feelings of self-loathing.&amp;nbsp;So kind and thoughtful and possibly helpful but maybe useless advice becomes reinforcing judgement that confirms they're a fucking pathetic piece of shit that can't even function as a basic human being and should probably do everyone a fucking favour and just die now, because at least that way they can get over it and live their lives without being burdened by thus shit for years.&amp;nbsp;I know that makes no sense to a rational person, but believe me - I'm not the only one to have had that thought process. You can check out r/depression or r/SuicideWatch to see those sentiments echoed on a near daily basis.&amp;nbsp;You'll also see a shit-ton of toxic negativity on there as well - and to address your CMV, is it infinitely worse than toxic positivity? Maybe.&amp;nbsp;But the point I'm specifically challenging is your idea that toxic positivity is harmless, and at worst neutrally useless and slightly annoying.&amp;nbsp;I say it is not. It is harmful and damaging and potentially life-ending","title":"CMV: Toxic negativity is infinitely worse than toxic positivity."},{"text":"Biden did fix the issue.
