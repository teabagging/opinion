They had an emotionally powerful candidate in Bernie Sanders but they didnt let emotions run the show because it seemed uncontrolled. Then Trumps emotional base won control anyway, half on the apathy and uninspiring stump of Hillary Clinton but half because there was so much more emotional charge behind the Trump campaign. Emotions got people to the polls, and apathy kept people at home. We have to stop imagining that the middle is swayed by logic and well spoken candidates, and realize that this is a popularity contest and we need people to be emotional invested in a candidate for them to win.","title":"Bernie Sanders in 2003 - How Republicans Win"},{"text":"Probably looking for womans underwear.","title":"When Democrats are baffled by Trumps picks, remind them of some of Bidens picks."},{"text":"The Supreme Court ruled that corporations are people.

Voters on the fence had a lot of opportunities to see the damning facts against Trump. I mean for crying out loud he tried to usurp our democratic institutions. The media couldve done a better job of it, but even Harris was calling Trump a fascist.The bitter truth that so many dont want to face is that Harris was never that popular and most people dont care for identity politics or culture wars. They really dont. Im not saying that to belittle minorities, LGBTQ+ people, or non-Christians its just thats exactly why Trumps fear mongering worked. I really dont understand why the left is so stubborn about this. The right took complete advantage of this and won votes with a bunch of crooks.I dont know how people can say rhetoric needs to change yet not acknowledge that Americans are not liking the rhetoric they were using. Democrats need to understand who they are trying to court. If you want to take votes away from Republicans then you have to understand who votes for Republicans. And the crazy part is, they do understand because they demonize Republican voters constantly. 2016 and 2024 are almost indistinguishable. Way too confident in the polls. Way too confident in the assumption that Americans are not single-issue voters. Way too hopeful that spite doesnt drive people to vote or not to vote. Way too complacent that the checks and balances are going to save us.People are ignorant. The average person is not a scholar or poet. The average person doesnt think about the past week, never mind years, or plan beyond the next couple of days, never mind years. The average person isnt a saint that has no unfounded hate in their hearts. The average person will not discern that trying to tear down racist, sexist, and phobic institutions is not wholly targeting them for simply being white, male, Christian. The women on the right will feel defensive of their own.The problem isnt rhetoric. The problem is that democrats are too naive to accept that tribalism is alive and well in the modern world. The problem isnt American. The problem is that Democrats think the grass is greener across the border/ocean. The problem isnt convincing Americans they actually have good lives. The problem is Democrats thinking Americans will believe Republicans will make their lives worse. The economy is booming. Yet democrats lost the popular vote. That should tell you something about 72+ million voters out there who despite all the dangers of a Trump presidency and Republican control of government, voted red.Stop underestimating the rubber band effect of progress. Reactionary politics thrive on the naivety of intellectuals. Even Americans fighting and dying to free slaves were racist against blacks. Even Americans who fought to be free from a monarchy tried to install a homegrown monarch after winning the Revolution. People hold onto anachronistic notions despite having every reason not to.

Gay marriage was the norm. Zero tolerance for hate crimes. Religious participation was falling. Social media gave everyone a voice. Food was diverse, and ingredients were plentiful. iPhones were powerful, and things were being digitized.Millennials were traveling and realizing life was great in many places.But then... in 2021 Trumps ultimate lie and treasonous act was evident to only 50% of the country.This  50%, who drive RAM 1500, Ford Explorers, and Nissan Rogues, Lincoln Continentals, Lexus GX350s, Chrysler Pacificass, Ferrari 488s started to go crazy for their cult leader. (All trump demographics are covered there from working class, to suburban zombies to FL seniors to tacky new money hedge fund bros).The wackos deepened their love for their pedophile heroes like Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly. They worried about bathrooms and Bud Light promoting trans people. They openly flew Confederate flags. They built taller walls around their communities and happily shot up their own schools, retailers and churches with AK-47s. They believed that Mexico had mental institutions and the government just bought them all a human trafficker to send them to the USA to murder and rape little girls and boys. They happily ate foods with so many chemicals that insects and mold wont eat them. They thought art was putting beads and bedazzles on Chinese-made sweatshirts made of polyester. They are ok with lead in water and oil spills in national parks. They were ok voting for women to NOT have equal pay.These knuckle-dragging Neanderthals became the norm in much of the country. One only needs to leave the bubble of Massachusetts for a few towns in New Hampshire or Ohio to see this.And here we are. Two nations trying to live in the same house. One that wants to go back to 1910 with all of its suppression of women, blacks, and non-landowners.And one that wants to have a great life like they have in Europe. A life where a garbage truck driver and a manufacturing plant CEO are equals and have similar pay and happiness. A life where sick people dont show up to work to make money and get others sick. A life where there is freedom from the fear of guns. A life where there is a train on every corner and there is little need for a personal car. A life with free education and environmental protection. A life where humans are free to be humans and have dignity and food and shelter and healthcare no matter their beliefs or handicaps.And remember in 1910 the handicapped were used as entertainment at the circus or left to die in an alley.Some of us dont want that.Some of us want a life without the hundreds of chemicals in foods and drugs that are banned in Europe and Japan.Sure Europe and Japan has racism and bigotry too but their citizens dont have guns and are not brought up to be macho rugged individualists.Im afraid that in 2025 we will see gangs of F350 drivers having fun mowing down immigrants and shooting up places where non-Trumpers gather.The USA has always been a country where greed, racism, misogyny, and bigotry thrive.

When the show is over they hug and kiss like boxers after weeks of phony trash talk made solely to sell pay-per-views.One may say his opponent is the next Hitler, coming to end democracy and take everyone's votes and destroy the country. The other may say his opponent is a communist dictator, come to do the same. But when the play is over the performers hold hands and bow, and then they go out and have a drink together.They each pretend to be fighting against each other in defense of you and your interests, when in reality they're on the same side, fighting against you, in defense of the interests of oligarchy and empire.You can see it right there. They're not hiding it anymore. They don't have to. It was all a show, and they're openly admitting it. A friendly match, like two rich ladies playing tennis at the Hamptons. They can show it openly because they know most of you won't pay attention to what you are seeing, or if you do you'll forget all about it and get swept up in the heat of the next election cycle. There's so much messaging reinforcing the illusory partisan divide that these tacit little admissions tend to go completely overlooked.Don't get me wrong, the depravity of Trump himself is not illusory. Real people are going to suffer and die under his administration, just as real people suffered and died under Biden's. But they themselves know they have nothing to fear. They and the powers they serve will go completely untouched by the imperial murder machine. They will die of old age surrounded by wealth and luxury, completely free from any consequences for their actions.It was all a sham. Always is. The elections are fake and the game is rigged. The empire will march on completely uninterrupted and entirely unchanged, served by one fraudulent president after the next until its eventual collapse.Stop buying into the performance.

The Democrats line that they must \\"trust the experts\\" rings hollow when they are the party of the experts and their livelihood depends on being trusted. That Democrats do not produce policies that challenge the mega rich and keep trying to make it seem like \\"everyone wins\\" from their policies only adds to the suspicion, because they once again know something that Democrats do not: There is always a winner and a loser. Because they aren't being told who the losers of the policies are, they assume -they- are the losers of the policies.Trump came forward, and directly talked to the working class, as did Biden, and that is why they won their elections. Mind you, Trump's solution, radical tariffs, is a bad one, but he has clearly identified the winners (Those who need manufacturing brought back to the country) and the losers (China) to them. That's why they trust him, even though he is a liar and a con artist. Because, on this issue, the one that is the most important to them, he is being pretty forthright about what he thinks he will happen, who will win and loser, and has proposed a radical policy to address their problem. This is what Democrats need to actually learn from Trump. Not that they need to dump trans rights, start putting migrants in camps, or that they need to engage in gutter politics. They need to learn that there must be winners and losers of policies, and that they need to identify them clearly and aim for the working class to be the winners.","title":"Too Many Americans See the Democrats as a Hostile Elite Even though that perception is partly the creation of right-wing media, the Democrats surely need to hone their identity."},{"text":"I cant even submit a post on this subreddit.

Later literally saying they were there to 'document the event'.They worked for a company called urban moving systems, and one of their work vehicles was stopped and a bomb sniffing dog reacted to their van.When they were arrested, they were found to be in communication with another group of israeli students. They worked for a company called Classic International movers. That company had been paid to literally move the hijackers into their new home in the States.Now let's go back in time to 1954. Israel had recruited Egyptian Jews to plant explosives in American and British government buildings. The plan was called operation Susannah. It failed when one of the bombers was caught. The point in it was to gain support for Israel in the west, while damaging the reputation of Islamic states. The false flag later became known as the Lavon affair. Before 9/11, a think tank in the States called The Project for a New American Century wrote up plans that called for military dominance in various parts of the world, stating that a 'new Pearl Harbour' event would help speed this process up. This think tank was made up of several prominent zionist members with dual citizenship in the US and Israel.The war on terror, and later ISIS in Syria and Iraq, cleaned up Israel's back door, removing the threat of Iraq and Syria. Israel would have faced the threat of an Arab coalition had they attempted what they are doing today.I believe that Iran would have also been on the list of invaded counties, but the ability of the Taliban and Afghan people to tie the US and UK down was massively underestimated. (It amazes me how many people don't realise Iraq shares Iran's western border, and Afghanistan is on Iran's East.) Iran was the filling in a huge shit sandwich throughout the whole campaign, and I believe they were supposed to be the final mouthful but we choked on what we already bit off.There's nothing on this Earth that will convince me that Israel wasn't the main orchestrator of 9/11, and the resulting war on terror was both to further their dominance in the Middle East, and funnel huge amounts of tax payer money into private hands through military contracts. It also set the stage for what we are seeing unfold today. Please, if you're reading this, research the Lavon affair, the USS Liberty, Urban Moving Systems, Classic International Movers and the dancing Israelis. It will piece together so many dots for you.I also believe that members of Bush's administration were either on board due to their zionist goals and the potential to earn billions, or they were forced to get on board due to being compromised (remember the paining in Epstein's hallway of Bush with the two paper airplanes and the knocked over jenga towers?)Fun fact, Larry Silverstein (the little rat who bought the towers and insured them against terrorism) is a good friend of netanyahu, and served as his campaign manager.","title":"To believe the official story of 9/11 you have to swallow an awful lot.

That'll give you the tools you'll need to look into the bills discussed and how anti-BDS stances are both pro-israel and firmly unamerican.Tulsi Gabbard's Israel StanceBased on the search results, here is a summary of Tulsi Gabbards views on Israel and Zionism:    Support for Israel: Gabbard has expressed her commitment to maintaining a strong alliance with Israel and has co-sponsored bills reaffirming the US commitment to Israel. She has also stated that a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come from both sides negotiating a two-state solution.\\n    Criticism of Israeli settlement activity: Gabbard has expressed concerns about Israeli settlement activity and its impact on the prospects for peace. However, her criticism is limited to specific aspects of settlement activity, rather than a broader condemnation of Israeli policies.\\n    Opposition to BDS: Gabbard has co-sponsored a bill condemning the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, which has been criticized by some as anti-Palestinian and pro-Israeli.\\n    Pro-Israel lobby connections: Gabbard has received funding from pro-Israel groups and has spoken at a conference for Christians United for Israel, a far-right organization that opposes Palestinian statehood and supports Israeli settlements.\\n    Mixed signals: Gabbards statements on Israel and Palestine have been criticized for being inconsistent and lacking nuance. While she has expressed support for a two-state solution, she has also used language that some see as pro-Israeli, such as describing Israel as a democratic Jewish state.ConclusionTulsi Gabbards stance on Israel and Zionism is complex and open to interpretation. While she has expressed support for a two-state solution and criticized specific aspects of Israeli settlement activity, her overall record suggests a strong alignment with pro-Israeli and Zionist positions. Her connections to pro-Israel lobby groups and her opposition to the BDS movement further reinforce this assessment. However, it is essential to note that Gabbards views on Israel and Palestine are subject to interpretation and may be influenced by various factors, including her political ambitions and her desire to appeal to different constituencies.","title":"Trump has decided to appoint Gabbard as DNI."},{"text":"Reddit use to represent free conservation, now it's become the site of heavily manipulated algorithms, disinformation, and corrupt mods.

They shoved a terrible candidate down our throats without a single primary, then turned around and arrogantly demanded that we vote for her, or else.You don't seem to understand this, but Democrats are NOT entitled to our votes!  So if you're unhappy that we didn't vote for your candidate and you're unhappy that her opponent won as a result, then you need to be asking yourselves what you could've done differently to earn our votes instead of whining and berating us for not giving your candidate a blank check to continue funding genocide with our tax dollars.Genocide is a deal-breaker.  Figure it out. No one will ever be the most perfect candidateStop right there.  Democrats have long been using that talking point and it simply doesn't hold up.  Why?  Because you're falsely portraying this as a battle over perfectionism.  It is not.Let me explain this for you in simple terms:  Opposing genocide is not \\"perfectionism\\".  It's a very basic, non-negotiable requirement that the Democrats are unwilling to meet.  So they failed to earn our votes.  So they lost.  That is just one of countless examples.The Democrats are not \\"less evil\\".  They're just evil, same as the Republicans.  They both support genocide.  They both support neoliberalism and neoconservatism.  They both have demonstrated nothing but contempt for our democracy. Liberals seem to have much to high of standardsI'm a progressive, NOT a liberal.  The term \\"liberal\\" has been redefined in the last few decades.  When most people use the term now, they are referring to neoliberal democrats.  Neoliberalism, despite the name, shares a lot more in common with conservatism than it does with progressivism.That said, if you think that demanding a candidate who opposes genocide is having standards that are too high, then maybe the problem is that people like you have been unwilling to raise the bar and start demanding more of our politicians.**Seriously, you failed to earn our votes.  You don't agree?  Fine, but you're not the one who gets to decide that.  We are.  And we have.  Either respect our decision and learn from it or GTFO.** and then he we are with having the imperfect candidate blame.Kamala Harris wasn't \\"imperfect\\".  She was downright awful.

Diamond told me several years ago, I am cautious about reasoning by comparison because the circumstances of a long-institutionalized and wealthy democracy like the United States are very different from India, for example. The plain and sobering fact of the matter is that there has never been a democracy nearly as long-established and liberal as the United States experiencing such a deep and potentially existential crisis of democracy.The circumstances here are indeed quite different from other countries, and the expansion of disinformation and the fracturing of the information ecosystem have made it easier for authoritarians to wage war on democracy. But it is encouraging that other nations have reached the brink and stepped back. Doing so is not easy. Ginsburg and Huq noted, There is no single magic institution that can be adopted to prevent democratic backsliding or to arrest it once it has begunSustained antidemocratic mobilization is hard to defeat. In some instances, a small group of officials safeguarded a democracy by openly resisting the machinations of a would-be autocrat and his henchmen. Other times, people power fueled democracy-defending defiance.In assessing the experiences in Asia, Croissant and Diamond observed that for democratic resilience and resistance to triumph, a sufficient number of citizens must still prefer a democratic form of government and have some degree of trust in democratic institutions. Throughout his presidential campaigns and presidency, Trump exploited widespread dissatisfaction with establishment institutions, and during the 2024 race he banked on the calculation that his cult of personality could overpower concerns about his trashing of democratic values and practices. His assault on democracy can be repelled, but only if there are enough citizens who give a damn.","title":"Can a Democracy Reverse a Slide Toward Authoritarianism?"},{"text":"They back him because he puts money in their pocket.

This is in part because they deceived people about respecting democracy. And once they were in power, they instantly started to dismantle democractic institutions until their countries were no longer democracies. Trump also waged an assault on democracy last time, but the famous guardrails held. This time around, democractic institutions are much weaker - you only need to look at the blank check that SCOTUS gave to the president. Trump and his enablers do not care for the rule of law or separation of powers at all, and they stopped pretending. I sincerely hope that some of the guardrails will still hold, but I am very concerned... and I will call out anyone who calls this hyperbole (not that I count for much in the face of the right-wing media machine). Especially when they do so in bad faith, because Chris Licht, the Fox News people, etc. know full well that this *is* another assault on democracy, and they are gaslighting their viewers - because they believe that they will not be affected, or that they will benefit.

It is not adding anything practically. A rape victim can abort their fetus within six months, yet choose not to do it in any of those months and then decides to do it at the last three months of pregnancy, but they need to have a whole court case and hearing about it within that time frame. It is so impractical where we would need them judicial system to work at an alarmingly fast rate where people could be more incentivized to convict non rapists to help give mothers the chance to abort their fetus within that short window. Convicting a rapist is different than convicting a rapist with a 3 month window to allow a woman to have bodily autonomy which will skew people's views in court. Tbh, I guess i changed my mind a bit because now it seems like it could cause negative effects where there are very few ways this actually benefits a woman that wants to abort her fetus in the third trimester, but doesn't go through with it in the first or second which is not close to one of the main reasons why a third trimester abortion even happens.","title":"CMV: A Federal Ban on Abortion After 24 Weeks Would Be the Most Optimal Solution to the Abortion Debate."},{"text":"Shhhh.

Once you put time limits or vague limitations in place, women will fall through the cracks and die. Lets look at Texas. They have a near-total abortion ban, with exceptions for if the mothers life is at risk. Yet women are dying due to the vague wording. At what point do we decide a womans life is threatened enough to allow doctors to make medical decisions? Is it when she first has a miscarriage, and an abortion is necessary for helping the foetus pass? Or is it once the foetus has stayed inside her for long enough that shes at risk of sepsis? Or is it when she develops sepsis? How much blood does she need to lose first before doctors can step in?Then you take into account cryptic pregnancies. I had a friend at school who kept having her period, gained basically no weight, and had next to no signs of pregnancy. She found out she was pregnant when she was already 29 weeks along. She was a smart girl, we were about to sit our a-level exams, but because the foetus was healthy, she wasnt able to get an abortion. She couldnt sit her exams, and when she went for resits, she failed. She didnt get into university, because of legal limits. No woman is getting past the 24 week mark (knowingly) and choosing an abortion. Hell, I knew a woman who found out very late that her baby wouldnt survive. She was given the option for an abortion, and she chose against it.

She then sent former President Bill Clinton to the state to deliver a speech that tried to justify the mass killing of Palestinians. Liz Cheney, the Republican daughter of Iraq war architect and war criminal Dick Cheney, also made an appearance in the state to campaign for Harris. Congressman Ritchie Torres, who spent the past year accusing anyone demanding an end to the bloodshed in Gaza of being an anti-Semitic terrorist, was another surrogate Harris sent to Michigan.","title":"Dont dare blame Arab and Muslim Americans for Trumps victory | We did not betray the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party betrayed us."},{"text":"Interesting that your concern only goes one way but whatever","title":"The democrats will turn against the gangsta rap era and claim it was a right wing movement"},{"text":"Tulsi is a CFR stoogeAll you guys new to conspiracies are getting a crash course in controlled opposition and what it looks like","title":"Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard once joined relatives of Sept. 11 victims in demanding the federal government release findings of its investigation into the Saudi governments role in the Sept. 11th attacks.

During the Cold War, coups dtat accounted for nearly three out of every four democratic breakdowns. Democracies in Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, Turkey, and Uruguay all died this way. More recently, military coups toppled Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. In all these cases, democracy dissolved in spectacular fashion, through military power and coercion.But there is another way to break a democracy. It is less dramatic but equally destructive. Democracies may die at the hands not of generals but of elected leaderspresidents or prime ministers who subvert the very process that brought them to power. Some of these leaders dismantle democracy quickly, as Hitler did in the wake of the 1933 Reichstag fire in Germany.

Their groups are hemorrhaging members at a rate way faster than the DNC.Williams is elected and paid (way more than me) to represent the interests of his union.  Biden was a very pro-labor President.  Trump is about as anti-labor as it gets, as we will soon find out.  If he knows so well that union workers aren't interested in the larger social stuff and only in their one wages, the choice is pretty obvious.  Which is why his union endorsed Harris.  He and other union leaders are having a hard time selling it to union members, because union members are socially conservative.  So what they need is for Democrats to stop talking about social issues.  The thing with progressives is, they are far to the left on both economic AND social issues.  And they care a lot about both.  Like they care so much that debate is always whether by being so uncompromising, they're actually letting things go backwards.  The \\"stop playing identity politics\\" crowd gets a bit of traction every election cycle that is bad for Democrats, but it doesn't last.  And they know this, which is why half those guys end up crossing over to MAGA, which is where they really belong or at least where they get the best grift.I have some sympathy for the union leaders, because they got to play the hand they are dealt.  It's not easy.  Except when they start blaming the DNC for failing to do the same thing that they failed to do.  Dude has a straight information pipeline to the means of production, and the means of production still thinks Socialism sucks.  It's harder for me to have any sympathy for the DSA, Jacobin or the general US/internet Rose Twitter shit, beause they are a tiny amount of people largely because they can't even get along with themselves and are constantly in-fighting or fighting other Socialist groups.  And all they do is sit around and hope for a BLM or a Gaza so they can issue some outraged takes and maybe get some money for a bit, until everyone realizes they don't actually give a shit.  All they do is co-opt causes.  The only reason why the DSA made a little comeback in membership this year is because of Gaza.  But then they're going to lose them all again when everyone realizes they're not going to do shit about Gaza.  They just try to co-opt every issue into being about Socialism.Like anyone who thinks the Democrats are corrupt or incompetent should look at how bad the DSA is run.","title":"Union Leader: Its Time for the Democrats to Wake Up"},{"text":"Yeah.

However, for whatever we think of the current system, there is something to be said about the value of institutional knowledge. The immediate difficult of Demarchy is just onboarding people. It takes several years for our current system's legislatures to get the lay of the land.I know you said you don't want US specific examples, but just case in point, there's 16 states that have term limits, and it lets us see what the value of institutional knowledge is. The lobbying groups have more power because the legislators aren't as knowledgeable. In fact, it has lead to the rise of non-government groups that write model state laws that states pass. If I recall correctly, there's examples where they forgot to change the state in the bill.What it has lead to is lobbyists going directly to the executive branch since the legislators don't know anything about government and you want to go to those who are implementing the law.  The other thing it does is divorcing the need to appeal to constituents just means there's way more self-dealing. What you'd see in Demarchy would be more self-dealing than the status quo. You didn't say in your CMV if you meant all 3 branches of government, but I focused on just the legislature. If you also mean the judiciary, the US has things called justice of the peace who don't have to be lawyers. They're elected. One huge problem is then the justices of the peace can't understand the rules of evidence let alone what they accomplish; if you have only lay justices even at a supreme court level, what you'd have are people creating constitutional level case law without any regard to the past. This means no stare decisis - stare decisis at least gives certainty that like cases will be tried like like cases. What we see in just trial courts is that justices of the peace will give sentences that the law doesn't permit. I can't even begin to imagine having lay people in other critical areas of say the executive branch in charge of national security.

I know Trump is part of the elite. But Ive also seen moderates consistently lose elections because they love to pander to the corporate elites. There is a crisis going on that Democrats are unwilling to confront. We saw it with Hillary. She won the popular vote but lost the election. At first, people speculated that she had so many controversies, like Benghazi and her emails, that made her unpopular. But 2020 we flip script to Biden and he passes the Green New Deal. We go from that to Kamala Harris, whose most progressive idea was codifying abortion. We look back at Hillary and then at Kamala and say Kamala can win because she has no baggage. But she loses and we begin to think our enemy is women. Is it women? How many vocal MAGA women are there? Theres so many from Laura Loomer to MJT to Kristi Noem and we keep telling ourselves its sexism so that the Democrats can bring another Moderate to the table. And this time it will be a male and we will once again reassure ourselves that we learned from Kamala and Hillary and that a male candidate can win, thereby cementing our own prejudices. Lets be real, the Democrats arent the elite, but they sure do want to be a part of it so bad. I know Trump has really twisted the word to weaponize it against Democrats.But most importantly, I think moderates cant win because they are unwilling to uproot the status quo. Theyre okay with racism, sexism, antisemitism, homophobia in some parts of the country. Apparently we need to meet at the middle of tolerance and hate to get this country working. Apparently, we need to have some poverty so that the country can run smoothly and we need some election interference from authoritarian regimes. We also need the children of janitors to also become janitors. We also need to bolster the prison system to churn out more criminals, or else what would our police unions fight for? Why not use the National Institute of Health to find evidence-based criminal reform? Why not expand college access and make it cheaper and more affordable? Why not institute Social Media controls to control misinformation? And why not try to de-radicalize people through community-based interventions??I know Kamala probably would speak up against any of this. But her comments on Fox News when asked about immigration, they were horrible. She hinted that she too might support large-scale deportations, which end up costing money and bring more violent crime. We heard her stance during the debate, but she made sure to go out of her way to reiterate harsher words on a more radical platform. She really didnt need to do that and it is nothing short of pandering. Moderates like to say that doing Progressive things will lead to predictably unfavorable outcomes, but Trump gets to pass so many controversial policies.?So we gotta ask ourselves, 1) who are the elites? 2)why do people believe the Democrats are the elite and 3)is there any truth to that","title":"Too Many Americans See the Democrats as a Hostile Elite Even though that perception is partly the creation of right-wing media, the Democrats surely need to hone their identity."},{"text":"I swear there were some political positions still up through summer in the last election.","title":"Be cautious optimistic"},{"text":"I hope that AOC, Bernie, Ro Khanna, Katie Porter, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Summer Lee and other grassroots progressives spend as much time as they can in the next 2 and 4 years promoting economic populism and fellow grassroots democrats running for office.In 2020, there were actually about 150 or so grassroots progressives running for Congress (both chambers) and besides Bernie being the nominee, I was actually deluded into thinking that all or most of them will win the primaries and that 2020 will be something of a revolutionary year.Well, people were so focused on defeating Trump that they barely registered that there are congressional primaries at all.

Especially workers in tech, who suffered badly from the rate hikes.The working class voters in manufacturing, union jobs, the service sector and health services haven't seen times this good in decades. The 1.9 trillion spending blowout was really aimed at them, their wages massively outpaced inflation, and it became really easy to find a job or job hop if you were in those sectors. End result: they absolutely hate Joe Biden's economy.If this election had been lost because the Democrats got trounced by the losers of the Biden economy then it might've made sense.

I am not asking about a theoretical interpretation of the law and what's illegal and what's not. Ok, so Trump establishes some weird \\"war council\\" of retired senior military members who have authority to make recommendations on relieving generals of command who don't demonstrate leadership or whatever.   Like I said, I'm not pretending it doesn't move the needle. The next time Trump wants to call up the military to suppress a major protest, maybe they don't refuse and you end up with soldiers in the Street. The last time that happened was 1992, but it could happen.   The Normal ROE for soldiers is WAY more restrictive than cops, but maybe even he tells them to shoot and no one stands up to them and we end up with a Kent State incident where protesters are shot by the US military.    That alone would echo for months. OP is positing something that is a whole order of magnitude different.  That Trump is simply going to order the military to go to the California governor's mansion, arrest Gavin Newsom, and take over the government of the state of California simply because he doesn't like Gavin Newsom. I stand by my prediction that's not going to happen.  If he did issue that order, it would probably be ignored.  If he forced the issue, it would probably involve relieving a whole chain of command until he got to someone who would do it, and it would split the US military right down the middle. Unless there's a huge backstory for justification and we've been in a constitutional crisis for months,  It would be a fort sumpter moment signaling the beginning of a shooting war.Sitting here today, that's a fantasy.","title":"Democratic Governors Form a Group to Oppose the Trump Administration"},{"text":"110% this is from distrust in politicians.

Sure, it's not painting men as bad per se. In fact, it mostly doesn't mention men directly at all. But indirectly it VERY clearly does paint this blank slate man as 1) someone who is not going to be voting for Harris and 2) someone who is very obviously the antagonist in this little story.And the rebuttal to that is usually \\"but if you're a good man the ad isn't talking about you!\\" and if you think that, all I can tell you is that you have no idea how ads work. Ads are about conveying ideas quickly, all while AVOIDING conveying negative ideas indirectly. What you don't say and what you say indirectly is just as important as the ideas you're conveying directly.And the subtle implication the ad makes that the husband in question = not a Harris voter is also just a bad idea from an ad perspective. You never want to set up a negative association with your own product from a demographic you're trying to attract, and you don't want your ad to be written in such a way that anyone could make that assumption.It's actually such a bad ad that if I was a marketing professor it would be my gold standard ad for showing what not to do in an ad campaign. Sure, it probably does well with some women. But the BEST CASE takeaway for a man watching that ad is \\"this is not about me\\" in which case it's completely useless, and the worst case is \\"the democrats are telling my wife to lie to me\\" which also isn't going to win you favors.That was a longer soapbox than I meant it to be but I think that ad is such a great example of why a lot of men feel somewhat alienated from the democrats and why the \\"dems hate men\\" rhetoric actually resonates with people. Because I think one of the feelings men can get is that you're just being tolerated, and not actually embraced. And when you voice opposition to that the only response is \\"that's not about you, you're being too sensitive\\". And maybe that's true, but men still vote and you're not gonna be able to scold someone into chanting their perceptions.","title":"Kamala Harris ditched Joe Rogan podcast interview over progressive backlash fears"},{"text":"Autism.","title":"Two top Biden administration officials warn of threat to U.S. children if anti-vaccine views prevail"},{"text":"they really got spooked by his joke this morning.","title":"House Democrat to introduce resolution reiterating that Trump can only serve two terms as president"},{"text":"Soooo, one could say it was lost, by people who would otherwise vote liberal, not voting.","title":"Two top Biden administration officials warn of threat to U.S. children if anti-vaccine views prevail"},{"text":"Im sure there wont be any issues with a DNI in Putins pocket, no way! /s","title":"Trump names former House Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence"},{"text":"The head scratcher is that Rogan isnt a partisan podcast.

The airlines would likely have a list of names of people who booked the flight but people can give wrong names so this would be worthless.Authenticated boarding passes showing that they boarded the planes;Once again authenticated how and by who? I imagine the airline staff would have just checked the boarding pass presented against the specific flight to confirm they were boarding the correct flight. There would be no physical record of this.Sworn testimonies of anyone who witnessed any of the accused boarding;Have you ever been to an airport? There are thousand of random people and from my visits to airports I couldn't point out a single one in a line up except for those people I already knew. Authenticated security videos showing them boarding the planes and;What if these videos don't exist or don't show any relevant information? People would already have passed by security at that point and why would airline compaies care to do this there wouldn't be any point. Security was very minimal prior to 911 and no one thought about this type of thing.Physical remains with chain of custody reports.Are you talking about the remain of the hijackers? They would have been destroyed beyond any recognition by the high speed plane crashes. You are asking for the impossible.Davidsson shows that evidence proving that the guilt of the accused hijackers simply does not exist.Well the actual evidence of guilt would be almost entirely witness based. Lets say I was to provide airtight evidence for everything you asked for, that would only show that the individuals got on the planes not that they performed a hijacking and thus would be almost completely worthless as you could just move the goalposts. People on the planes would be able to give statements but a) they are all dead and b) you wouldn't believe them anyway thinking that they were in the conspiracy too. Also if all the hijackers were dead then what would be the point of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they did it? You aren't going to put them on trial.Beyond that, the names on the official list have changed multiple times with no adequate explanation for why or how. I don't think that US agencies are all-knowing and regularly make mistakes when identifying threats. And actually if there were a conspiracy by the US gov to stage an attack on the US, they would probably have a well established list of people to take the blame and would have had bumped off to make sure they couldn't disprove them. This point seems to actually go against the conspiracy theory rather than support it.So to summarise I think you are asking for impossible evidence that would not actually prove anything. Instead I think this post is just an advertisment for a new book to trick people into buying it. I suppose the real conspiracy is the friends we made along the way.","title":"To believe the official story of 9/11 you have to swallow an awful lot.

No matter how depraved the atrocity, or overwhelming the evidence, or confessed-to the crime, the fortress will not crumble. In fact, even when Israel flagrantly insults its main sponsor, the US, as it did this week, nothing changes.SnipIsrael appears to be able to do anything without the fortress falling. It could safely ignore the tears of British doctor Nizam Mamode yesterday as he told MPs that Palestinian children were deliberately being shot in the head day after day by Israeli snipers and drones, a testimony effectively corroborated by dozens of US-based medical professionals who served in Gaza. Mamode had worked in Rwanda during the genocide, but declared he had never witnessed any horror on the scale of Gaza.The narrative withstands the UNs most senior humanitarian official, Joyce Msuya, declaring, The entire population of northern Gaza is at risk of dying. It endures without a scratch when an IDF spokesman declares that violently displaced survivors will not be allowed to return there. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in an editorial, even stated that the Israeli military is conducting an ethnic cleansing operation in the northern Gaza Strip, but the de-facto cartel of western media outlets and politicians keeps the hideous truth at bay.Nothing leaves a dent. Not UN analysis finding that 70% of verified violent deaths in Gaza are women and children, with the age most represented between five and nine. Not 710 babies killed by Israels military in Gaza by this September. Not Israel wiping out a minimum of 902 entire families by last month, with whole lifelines, from days old infants to great-grandmothers, permanently erased from the civil registry.Starvation, butchering children, ethnic cleansing, violently erasing a healthcare system: all done deliberately by a state whose leaders have not even pretended not to believe in the collective guilt of a civilian population. If the official narrative lined up with reality, it would go like this. Israel is a state perpetrating a genocidal bloodbath involving not just bombs and bullets but alleged torture and sexual violence. Those who defended or belittled this abomination would be publicly disgraced, those who facilitated it would face arrest. There would have been a deafening chorus from our politicians, media and public figures many months ago, demanding something, anything, to make this end.","title":"Is there any red line that Israel will be held to?

That because she either wasn't advocating for a people's revolution or wasn't willing to run on a platform mandating black transgender underprivileged catboy story hours in libraries across the nation she could never create a compelling vision of a better America.The problem isn't that she couldn't excite or appeal to progressives, it's that she couldn't excite or appeal to anyone.

One of your links cites Stephen Spoonamore's \\"Statement About Hacking Voting Machines\\". It opens with this statement,  \\n  \\nThe Tabulation Systems at the County level were hacked far in advance of the election. The hack was **probably** written into the code even before the code was installed.  \\n  \\nElsewhere he states,  \\n**Perhaps** 300-500 tabulators\\".    \\n  \\nUsing words like \\"probably\\" and \\"perhaps\\" indicate the author just doesn't know, he is guessing. Same type of language used by the lunatics Kari Lake and Trump. If Spoonamore had actual facts, his statements would be definitive. Such as, \\"Firmware version 3.1.7.941a, dated 2023/07/24 behaves in this manner\\" etc.  \\n  \\nThe author does not cite specific machines. If he had actual evidence, he'd make definitive statements like, \\"Smartmatic Model X79i does this suspicious thing, and that thing is repeatable when run between these dates\\".  \\n  \\nFurther analyzing his language, using this sentence,  \\n  \\nprobably written into the code^1 even before the code^2 was installed.  \\n  \\nThe above sentence tells me he is clueless. If he knew what he was talking about, he would know the code^1 most definitely *would have had to be written* and compiled before installation. Second, he would not have used the term code^2, he would have used the correct term *Firmware*. I design complex software systems for a living. Been doing it since the 1970s and still work 40 hours a week at it. So I have a little expertise in this matter. Here are a few more clues this guy is off base.  \\n  \\nSoftware used to run machines will be written as firmware. Firmware is mostly written in C or C++, which have no \`IF/THEN \` functions. Instead, C languages use \`if/else\` functions, all lower case not upper. He also tells us this hack uses a \`WHEN\` function. There is no such function in C or C++ used for timing nor branching logic. Other than sql query language, I've never seen a \`WHEN\` function in a Firmware language.  \\n  \\nThird, and this is the biggest tell this guy is nonsense, the results of elections are audited: including up to a full audit at the county boundaries if required. In PA as in most other states, it is actually written into law audits must be done. So until Gov Shapiro states otherwise, I'll trust the 2024 election was secure rather than a bunch of randos; randos who don't even understand computer languages they claim to master, to describe a hack that never existed.","title":"Top Pick To Be Trump's National Intelligence Director Is Former Democrat: Report"},{"text":"is \\"quitting twitter\\" the new \\"i'm moving to canada\\"? because i could have sworn like half the people who have \\"quit\\" twitter since trump's win last week are people that quit it back when musk bought the company.","title":"Jamie Lee Curtis, Who Endorsed Kamala Harris, Quits X Following Trump Victory"},{"text":"They will say thats just because progressives didnt turn out to vote","title":"Kamala Harris ditched Joe Rogan podcast interview over progressive backlash fears"},{"text":"Rogan himself said they wanted to do 1 hour of interview but with campaign staff in the room and in DC , not his studio He didn't feel it would be true to his style and rejected it","title":"Kamala Harris ditched Joe Rogan podcast interview over progressive backlash fears"},{"text":"But we are right.

At the same time in the case of the EU, we only deal with people from sub-Saharan Africa   I'm Belgian. Not American.    Also strange how you claim that Europe only deals with sub-Saharan immigration. Marrocans are the biggest immigration group in Belgium and Germany and they're decidedly *not* sub-Saharan.    The recent Syrian refugee crisis was also made up of.... Syrians. Who are also decidely not sub-Saharan.

Did the Democrats run the government well? Are the lives of voters better? Are you as a political party credible when you say youll do something?This question is never asked, because Democratic elites  ensconced in the law firms, foundations, banks, and media executive suites where the real decisions are made  basically agree with each other about organizing governance around the needs of high technology and high finance. The only time the question even comes up now is in an inverted corroded form, when a liberal activist gnashes his or her teeth and wonders  why cant Democrats run elections around populist themes and policies? This is still the wrong question, because it assumes the wrong causality. Parties dont poll for good ideas, run races on them, and then govern. They have ideas, poll to find out how to sell those ideas, and run races and recruit candidates based on the polling. Its ideas first, then the sales pitch. If the sales pitch is bad, its often the best of what can be made of an unpopular stew of ideas.Still, youd think that someone, somewhere would have populist ideas. And a few  like Zephyr Teachout and Elizabeth Warren  do. But why does every other candidate not? I dont actually know, but a book just came out that might answer this question. **The theory in this book is simple. The current generation of Democratic policymakers were organized and put in power by people that dont think that a renewed populist agenda centered on antagonism towards centralized economic power is a good idea.**The article goes on to explain the \\"reforms\\" that changed the Democratic Party under Al From and Bill Clinton, into the New Democrat's Circle D Corporation it is today.It's been a long, slow, but very effective [betrayal...](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fetv81qk4ujw61.jpg)edit - Also, a [relevant assessment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=ElvSYVswnIo) of the Circle D Corporation in it's current state of rot...","title":"Betrayed by Design: How the Democratic Party Handed Us Over to the Billionaires"},{"text":"It's prob. cold- wtf does that have to do with anything?","title":"To believe the official story of 9/11 you have to swallow an awful lot.

If I had to guess on the median outcome at the moment, and I could only pick one number, I would say Rs end up with 221 seats.This is a good chart: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/results-house-races-tracker.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Zk4.G3UB.LZK3GaK4vmMg&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare.But remember that most of the outstanding California seats are slowly trending D, as the remaining ballots are counted.

You can reasonably expect all 3 of these to go to the Rs.On the other side, considering races where Ds lead, Kaptur is going to a recount, I believe. But again, its unlikely to change the results. Golden still needs the RCV tabulation. This one is actually the most likely to flip of all the ones that have a current D lead. That being said, its probably still lean-Golden.

Just look at Biden's favorable numbers as more and more aid like the EITC ended. Even Bush gave people a tax credit when gas prices rose. But all of corporate media called it \\"moderate\\" to remove benefits from most every American with children during an inflationary crisis That certainly lead to Trumpism. but the way Biden was called a \\"moderate\\" despite helping Republicans pass some of the most extreme and unpopular polices of the last 40 years also bolstered the Republican party. Reagan trickle down was now moderate. the Iraq war was moderate. repealing necessary banking regulations was moderate. making medical debt harder to discharge in bankruptcy was moderate.   \\nThe same tools used by corporate media to marginalize Sanders are being using to normalize the Republican party.

Aren't you generalising?What you are trying to do is clever manipulation, unfortunately I will not fall for it. we are not dealing with individual cases here we are talking about the general process. trying to reduce this to an individual level combined with accusations of racism is nothing more than trying to avoid uncomfortable questions. unfortunately for you from my statements so far my racial prejudice is not evident, nor is my negative suggestion about your colleague. nice try using racial accusations to your benefits.In reality we probably both know that it is impossible to consider phenomena on a scale of the entire society without certain generalizations. we are not considering here individual examples of individual people, but the whole phenomenon on a broad scale.but if we use the individual example of your colleague, this only shows how different the nature of the phenomena of emigration to the USA and to Europe is. while people from all over the world come to the USA with different levels of education and different cultures, this multiculturalism and all variations make it easier to blend into society. At the same time in the case of the EU, we only deal with people from sub-Saharan Africa, often without education, knowledge of the language, firmly embedded in their cultural framework very different from European culture.  unfortunately, such are the directions of migration that we have nowadays. it is naive to claim that both cases are the same, treating migration as one identical phenomenon, you yourself are making a great generalization.there are certainly exceptions when it comes to Europe, like a certain percentage of Asians among immigrants, but they choose other migration routes and often a legal way. When it comes to illegal ones, very fact that people who cross the border illegally go straight to Germany is a significant argument. nobody looks for a place in Greece or Spain which are the first country on the EU border, because there the social support is much lower. it is still worth noting that by using accusatory accusations of racism, you are trying to avoid answering how actively you help immigrants in your location, and what support will there be for those who are not successful in the future, are they supposed to join the homeless masses, can they count on any support in a situation where the US does not even support its own citizens?","title":"CMV: Left-wing parties should challenge right-wing parties on mass deportation (because right-wing parties can't actually do it)"},{"text":"Sorry for the late reply lol but I'm not on much social media for now, I've been trying to stay grill-pilled.
