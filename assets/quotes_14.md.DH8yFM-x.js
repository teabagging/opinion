In fact, any who believe in the Old Testament being literally true cannot logically believe either, since God admits to making mistakes in the flood myth and the Sodom and Gomorrah myth, and neither an omniscient nor omnipotent God can make mistakes. God also often takes a sledgehammer to things in the old testament when a scalpel would do, which implies he doesn't have the capability to act with extreme precision. For example, why did he have to nuke Sodom and Gomorrah and put Lot's life at risk of he could have just killed every sinner there individually? Why kill every first born of Egypt if just killing Pharaoh's son was sufficient? The Christian God as depicted in the Old Testament is something like a human trying to direct the lives of single celled organisms, incapable of using the level of precision necessary to interact with them the way he truly wants to.There's also the possibility that there is an omnipotent and omniscient God, and that everything as it is its exactly how he wants it.So can that God create a boulder so big he can't lift it? Yes, but he could also have given himself the ability to lift it. Then he could make an even bigger one, then give himself more strength ad infinitum.

Particularly compared to the over 6 trillion dollars spent in 2020 ALONE before Biden stepped into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and Trump in the White House.The inflationary trends we witnessed during the first half of Biden's term, were caused by a multitude of factors, many of which had roots extending back years. Nuance is not American's strong point though.I guess the national debt ballooning by nearly 40% while Trump was in office doesn't count towards inflation?And the whole point about interest rates being too low, and for far too long, because Trump decided it was best for his political career to pressure the Fed to keep them there.Not to mention the trade war he instigated, and the problems that caused, especially for American industries, farmers, laborers, consumers, etc... Oh, and the trade deficit of course.The trillions of dollars that Trump's tax cuts are estimated to cost the government...Let's not forget the global pandemic that shocked markets across the world, crippled supply chains, and turned the global economy volatile.This is among other things that all contributed to future inflationary trends before Biden was even inaugurated.But the American rescue plan, oh no the American rescue plan! Let's put a magnifying glass on that, so we can blame Biden for inflation!I don't know what you're talking about, childcare costs have gone down In response to the child care stabilization program. There's also the childcare block grant, and like dozens of executive orders from Biden addressing affordable caregiver support and worker support, including improved pay and working conditions.There was also a bill expanding in-home caregiver support for veterans, I forget the name. Mothers have been returning to work as well. As far as the chips and Science Act goes, where the US was providing damn next to nothing of the global supply of semiconductors, it's already estimated that over the next decade, that percentage will increase exponentially. Which means, in the end, this is beneficial to American unions, because this is an industry where union labor is often employed. Not to mention the union contracts this will create, especially for construction unions poised to build more factories, oh, and the act itself including provisions for workforce training and development, which  Union members can take advantage of. And then there's just the economic security of it all, considering job creation and more domestic manufacturing.And as far as unions go, Biden has objectively been one of the strongest pro-union presidents in recent memory. Especially compared to the previous administration which hamstringed the labor movement. Despite what you might *feel*, his admin has provided much better protections for laborers, among other things, than several of his predecessors.As far as the rest, use paragraphs. Just because you have a little gripe here and there about issues that are complex and can't be solved comprehensively in one term, and especially due to how previous administrations and policies have made these issues complex, doesn't invalidate what I've laid out about a lot of the achievements of the Biden administration that tend to go unrecognized by bitter people like you, cherry picking whatever you can to minimize those achievements, while also blaming Biden for the actions of Republicans.

Wheres the proof god isnt real?I can answer this for you.  There are an infinite number of wrong answers, and a finite number of correct answers.  If the question is, \\"Do gods exist?\\" or \\"Does the Christian god exist?\\" there should be some quantifiable way to either answer the question or reduce the possible wrong answers enough to make a good guess.To put it another way, look at the whole \\"flying spaghetti monster\\" concept.  You, OP, and I don't believe that such a being exists, despite not having any proof.  You could apply similar logic to the Christian god, except that it's less obvious if you grew up within the framework of a culture involving Christianity.  There's simply no evidence that he/it exists, and there's no way to proof it true either way.  As a result, it's simply more logical to put the Christian god in the bucket of \\"does not exist\\" since throughout human history there's no valid evidence of it. We dont need to prove god exists to believe in him, theres no proof he doesnt exist and for billions of people faith in a creator and higher power is enough.This also falls flat because lots of people believe in lots of false things that we do prove false eventually.  The concept of people, including the church, believing in an Earth-centric universe is a great example.  Christians murdered scientists over it, and eventually had to accept that the Earth was not the center of the universe.  Beliefs change as new information comes about.  However, the harder part is rejecting beliefs that have no evidence because it's difficult for the human mind to not try to fill in blanks in our gaps of knowledge.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"It doesn't excuse it, but it can help explain it.Either way, this isn't why he was elected and he needs to be gone.","title":"Enabling Trump is a bad look for Fetterman | Pennsylvania's senior senator was elected as a progressive Democrat.

If the answer is no, theyre not omnipotent because they cant create the rock. The concept collapses under its own weight.No. It doesn't. God has all power within the universe but he cannot exceed the laws of universe that pre-existed him. The better question is \\"Is it possible for a rock to exist that is too heavy for God to lift?\\" The answer is no. It's not a paradox to not be able to create something that literally cannot exist within our physical universe. Why would a loving God create individuals destined for eternal suffering?The eternal suffering isn't punishment. It's not something extra God imposes. It's literally existing outside of his presence. Earth is currently under his influence, albeit not fully so. It will be again after the resurrection and judgement. Sinners who reject Jesus will be withdrawn from the presence of God. That and that alone is the \\"punishment\\". But they had the choice and rejected it. The Bible itself adds to my doubts. Its full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30.Sure, the old Testament is full of contradictions. I'll let the Jews hammer that one out because the Law of Moses has been fulfilled and it's literally nothing more than historical context at this point. Romans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and worksRomans was written by Paul (who actually contradicts Jesus on a lot of shit) Paul was never a disciple of Jesus. Jesus was long dead and ascended back to heaven by the time Paul showed up. Paul's writings should be taken with a grain of salt. But in this instance, he's not wrong. Faith alone saves. You cannot *earn* your way into heaven. But \\"by their fruit, ye shall know them\\" means that if you aren't doing good works in the name of Jesus, you don't actually possess the faith you claim to. It's not that you're saved by good works. It's more that without the good works you can't be saved because it is a demonstration of you failing the prerequisites.Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapistThis is a mistranslation. They're referring to premarital sex, not forcible rape.1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church.Sage advice, tbh. How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?Every soul who has ever lived will pass before the judgment seat and they will know that Jesus is who he claims to be. Some people will still reject him even that. A lot of people are confused by some of the teachings in the New Testament. After you die, but before the resurrection and final judgment, all souls are in what could be called a purgatory, but that term is very loaded with Catholic meaning. People who do not know the gospel and who are close-minded will find that existence stressful and demoralizing while people who understand what's going on will be happy. But nobody enters heaven proper until after the final judgment, which has not happened yet.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Hopefully, they spend a lot of money in the attempt.","title":"Liberal is threatening to sue me (a teenager who literally doesn't have a job) over my politics."},{"text":"Pope Francis is a great man and a great leader.

You can select between pieces of truth, but truth remains truth.Second: No, you fucking can't factcheck everything you hear. That's bull. We get news thrown at us at an unprecedented rate. How are you supposed to fact check it all? Where would you even go?The solution exists. It has existed for decades. It's just that the US doesn't want to use it. It's called a *Press Council*.What is a Press Council, you ask? It is an independent commission established by representatives of its members which are news media outlets. Their task is to discipline members that print untrue stories. Their mandate involve forcing news media to print retractions of misleading stories. What about news media who decide not to join the council? Well, then you already know that you can't trust their stories.The point is that you need a reliable baseline. You need a place that you know that you can trust. If such a thing does not exist, good luck fact checking articles. But an independent council representing the political spectrum with ability to discipline the members?

Are coincidences really just coincidences, or have you had a remarkable number of serendipitous experiences throughout your life?If there is something there, forget about omnipotence, what level of superhuman abilities would this entity have to possess to be fairly called a god?

What _is_ incompatible with autonomy is interfering with the decision-making process.Im not really religious, but this comes up in science and brainscan experiments, where certain actions can be predicted reliably before a person chooses to do them.My definition of free will - being based on autonomy as a human need - is slightly different from traditional definition.  But then the traditional definition usually devolves into a persons actions must be unpredictable, or at least occasionally completely decoupled from the persons motivations and goals, for there to be evidence of their ability to choose their actions.I fundamentally believe each person makes the best decision they can given the constraints and information they have, even when they think they havent.

You cannot modify the rate of space-expansion by banging two particles together or by flying fast enough. Space-expansion is unaffected by such things.

Time is a measure of change, by definition, and things that don't change (like God) cannot be measured by it. Time is as meaningless for God as it will be following the heat-death of the universe. In the absence of change, time ceases to exist.Scripture says that it is by God's word and upholding of all things that reality exists. So if you think about it, God is functionally *another force of nature*.

Ideally free healthcare for all would be great, but that seems to be unrealistic for now.

This misinformation and manipulation is more like asymmetrical warfare (for lack of a better term). It isnt simply good information vs bad information or right philosophy vs left philosophy. What we have is exploitation of biases using misinformation and disinformation to create political narratives. First, people dont necessarily search social media for news. There is this faulty assumption that a person on social media is the consumer of that product. The reality is that the opportunity to influence social media consumers is what is being sold. This may be something relatively innocuous, like what brand of soap you use, but it can also be used to convince you that some other group is responsible for all the evils in the world. Social media is our culture, it isnt simply people looking for news there. It is grandparents looking at pictures of their family then being targeted for misinformation, it is people looking for general entertainment being targeted, etc.Second, the ap and more conventional press gravitates toward stories that appeal to the mean level of interest. This means manipulated news gets more of a platform. Moreover, the ap rightly sees these movements as influential and then factually reports on the existence, often leaving out the propaganda or manipulative origins. Consider the following. AP: Trump is stating he wants to buy Greenland. There is often few details about this being part of a targeted strategy to harm the US and create divisions on NATO and between the US and Europe. Additionally, gaps in the factual reporting. The context people crave is filled in by the original manipulative campaign when they go to post pictures of the last meal they had with their besties.Third, the narratives that are part of this asymmetrical warfare. The left and the mainstream is often trying to fight with facts. The manipulators are exploiting that because lies are much more influential than facts. A lie spreads much faster and factual rebuttal takes a lot of time. Meanwhile a new lie is already spreading; Gish gallop, firehouse of falsehood, whatever you want to call it. Currently, the press is on a tear about the democrats failing at messaging this cycle. The reality is that fact based messaging has little chance against groups exploiting its weaknesses. The groups pushing misinformation/disinformation know this and they exploit it. This is easy to see if you ask someone saying the dems failed at messaging what they specifically failed at. Ive seen liberal dems go after  others for centrist things, like including Cheney at some purple state rallies. Ive seen centrists go after the more leftist side because they think there were too many Gaza based protest votes. This isnt a failure of messaging it is how disinformation was used to create a wedge created to weaken the left. This isnt new. It has been almost a decade since we learned the Russians were creating propaganda to exploit Bernie supporters, while at the same time manipulating the Republican base. It is the same today but it isnt only Russia now. The American response to their attacks a decade ago seems to be led by a group of American billionaires and they are using the same techniques to seize power here, rather than to defend the country.Anyway, this is why Ive become disillusioned with the press, our politics, and the state of the world. You simply cannot build, or maintain, a government when there are only two parties and one is hell bent on destroying the country as it is. It is even worse when the party trying to dismantle the government has such easy to use tools that  exploit opinions and cannot be matched with simple factual reporting. On a side note, the best defense the liberals had against misinformation and disinformation was humor (Job Stewart and the like). Laughing at nonsense is quicker and more effective than a factual response. Anyway, I think that the right targeting comedians as influencers is no coincidence.","title":"Fake news is driving us apart amid disaster  but slanted news is slowly drowning our democracy"},{"text":"The weird thing about Fetterman is that I feel like hes a bit of a victim of *neither* part actually moving forward on any kind of labor reform.

Sears: How the federal Liberals have opened their leadership race to foreign interference"},{"text":"Archived version: https://archive.fo/qj4dHSummary: Justice Marie-Jose Hogue will soon reveal her findings on foreign interference. (Disclosure: I was an invited presenter to the Commission). She has already noted the parties defences against penetration do not appear robust. Her recommendations will be wide-ranging. If she recommends that all parties should be subject to supervision in their conduct of nominations and, more importantly, leaderships, the reaction from Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats will be unanimous: No! They are wrong and the justice would be right. Heres why. The Chinese Ministry of State Security may once again decide to put its thumb on a Canadian leadership contest. Its first target would likely have been blocking Melanie Joly, as the face of Canadas increasingly anti-China posture, but Joly has said she is taking a pass this time. Chinas project, given the Liberals have rejected any meaningful new protections, will again be able to be conducted in secret with improved chances of success. The Liberal Party will still allow permanent residents, not just citizens, only 14-years-old, to join the party online for free  yes, free. Online memberships will still face only an easily deceived vetting process  also true of the other national parties. Liberal national directors voted Thursday to make some gestures toward reform. They were not persuasive. The vote will be held March 9. Candidates must stump up $350,000 by Jan. 23 to enter the race, then have just six weeks to campaign. A new member must now have joined by Jan. 27. That gives candidate just two and a bit weeks to find new members. The Liberal party is estimated to have a membership of less than 300,000. If together, the candidates sell 50,000 memberships in two weeks, close to impossible, that means the winner, in a six-candidate field, could be chosen with fewer than 50,000 votes. Could the Chinese Embassy, all their consulates and Canadian-based, Beijing-controlled organizations round up 25,000 new members, the number to almost guarantee blocking any candidate? Yes, in a matter of days. Thats how dangerous this leadership contest could be. Joly publicly pleaded with her party to undertake reforms on foreign interference last week. She was apparently ignored. With great indignation all the parties say that as private civil society organizations the government has no business in their internal affairs. However, the parties already accept heavy regulation and reporting requirements on other activities and spending. Why is this acceptable to them? Perhaps because they receive millions of dollars annually in subsidies from the people of Canada. Maybe their irresponsible obduracy on leadership processes might soften if they were tempted by a subsidy for the cost of managing a contest, as unpalatable as that might be to many Canadians. But there is a much larger question here. National party executives and directors are not running the Oakville Seniors Lawn Bowling Club. They are the governors of organizations who control who gets to compete to be prime minister. The comparison to any other civil society organization is laughable given that power. They determine who leads our government, and have this time heavily tilted the scales. The Liberals would have risen in public esteem if they were to have set membership as restricted to 18 year old citizens, who can prove they gave their own money to become a member. And if they had taken the admitted risk of setting a fairer campaign period  I suspect that the NDP could have encouraged not to defeat the government in return for the appropriate policy concession, for example. Finally, they could have helped erase the memory of their unbelievably lax approach to foreign interference by creating a vetting process advised by a group knowledgeable about national security warning flags. They chose to do none of these things. So this race remains wide open to foreign interference and closed to any candidate who is not already a front-runner. This is a blow to Canadian democracy. It will be the most rushed and nontransparent process in the choice of leaders in recent Canadian history.Further reading:https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/liberals-will-remove-fraudulent-memberships-as-some-register-their-pets-to-vote-1.7170983https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-steve-mackinnon-drops-liberal-leadership-race-bid/https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2025/01/11/liberal-leadership-candidates-can-pay-350000-entry-fee-in-instalments-but-unclear-if-any-portion-is-refundable/447298/https://nationalnewswatch.com/2025/01/11/former-b-c-premier-says-she-misspoke-when-claiming-she-was-never-a-conservativehttps://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/musk-canada-poilievre-trudeau-influence-1.7426954https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/canada-election-elon-musk-justin-trudeauhttps://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/9.6609234https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/01/11/liberal-officials-say-its-essential-their-next-party-leader-is-bilingual/Other news:https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/former-pm-chretien-says-liberal-party-must-move-back-to-radical-centre-1.7172306https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/everything-is-on-the-table-joly-won-t-rule-out-cutting-off-energy-exports-to-u-s-in-face-of-trump-tariff-threat-1.7172631https://nationalnewswatch.com/2025/01/12/with-conservatives-promising-to-defund-could-the-next-election-kill-the-cbchttps://nationalnewswatch.com/2025/01/12/quebec-liberals-at-a-crossroads-as-leadership-race-kicks-off-mondayhttps://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-chretien-51st-state-ad9749047d0b627eed56be22f43ea7cd!ping Can","title":"Robin V.

You are writing a story. In this story, you create this world that is similar to our own. You draft this out, creating notes and designs that you want to incorporate into a story boarding process for a movie or TV show that you one day hope to make this out of. And over the course of a day, you flush out a concept, a world, a couple of characters you want readers and other consumers of this story to follow, and you go to work on it.You are a madman. You work day and night building this thing. Takes you 5 days to make the story. You are satisfied, so you take a break, then you presented to publishers. They love it. But instead, the feel a procedurally reactive game that people can play is better, a la No Man Sky. Let's add some AI to help make it more random they say. You do it. You build rocks in this world that you know you couldn't lift in reality, but it's cool because it's an element in the game. You know how the game ends because you built the over arching framework, but maybe not the finer details. AI is handling that for now. You could know, but nah, who cares.At some point a group in the game begin to worship a god that, kind of sounds like you. Little strange. They write a book explaining what you are doing. Creepy. Years ago by in the game. Book changes tiny bits because of languages and interpretation and whatever. But it still at its core seems to know what you are doing. But you never really interacted with the characters in the game, except a couple of times to add some flavor to specific quests for players to experience. Your just doing your thing.Do you exist to the group of people in the game? You've never been seen. Are you omnipotent in the game? Well yeah. You can create that rock, destroy it, move it around, even if you know you yourself can't lift it, using the tools you are using to make the game. You know how the game will end. You spent 6 days working like a madman to design it. But you decided to leave AI to add a little random flavor to keep it interesting. You just gave it a character or two to run with. You didn't design those characters with evil intent or set outcome.That is God, Abrahamic or otherwise. They exist on a plane that we don't know how to reach, just like you would with respect to your game in this scenario, or any writer with respect to their books. Scientifically, hard to prove what you don't know. But that doesn't mean they cannot be out there, designing the game, and working on things. We as the creations have to understand that.

As of this morning, the Kenneth Fire has been 100% contained, Hurst Fire 89% contained, and Creek Fire 90% contained. As for the big ones, no change in containments but an increase in acres; Palisades at 23707 acres and Eaton 14117 acres.Great news though for Eaton, as the flareups that happened were no issue over the night and were dealt with accordingly. Also, among the downgrades evac orders included the JPL, which is a huge relief to see.Over night, Palisades were looking great with water drops and the work done during the daylight. Flareups were dealt with quickly earlier and might have stopped some eastward movement. However, it seems that the north part of the fire is kissing Dirt Mulholland, a fire road at the top of the mountains that separates Encino and Pacific Palisades. The old Project Nike site is probably gone, but thats totally fine if the fire stops there.As for me yesterday, I tried to just disconnect and relax for the day. I had a meal with a friend who just got back from Japan. I also reached out for a few possible other roommate situations (fingers crossed). The skies looked much better, even with the smoke. The best part for me? I cant see the Palisades flames from my place anymore, and theres barely a glow. Some places were still closed (good for them and their workers) and the amount it of community support has been amazing to see.

We dont have the ability to understand his existence because we are flawed. Thats why Christians run on faith; it allows them to believe in something that could be completely made up. Its ultimately all they have in this argument, and if you dont have faith, youll never believe in God. Theres no real proof that cant be refuted, so in order to change your view, youll have to change your mindset completely and stop doubting. Talk about being a sheep. In that case, well never actually know, at least while being alive. There will always be a chance that he exists or doesnt, I would say the chance is pretty equal on both sides as well. No real evidence to refute his existence, and no real evidence to prove it. The Christian God, or the God of the Bible, is definitely a logical fallacy but that doesnt mean there isnt a God at all. We might just be no where close to finding or understanding it. It might not be a figure but life in the air for all we know. This being said, its up to you to believe. You can literally believe in anything you want and be just as right as anyone else. Thats why I dont like religion, its basically useless. Its no better than not believing at all but it also exploits your faith by taking your money and time. This question is also useless. No one knows, so changing your view is completely based on your own belief and what you want to believe. You have to take logic out of the equation and conjure up your own faith, belief, delusion, and then run with it. Faith is literally the opposite of logic and proof, so believing in something you cant see, hear, smell, touch, or taste is completely faith based and up to you.

Youve also missed tge point entirely.Politics in this country has changed, mobilizing and motivating voters was once pretty easy, because everyone was a member of one or more social clubs (VFWs, elks clubs,masonic lodges, union locals, rotary club, etc). Pre internet era, everyones social lives revolved around these clubs, and political candidates would show up at the local spaghetti dinners or the regional/national club gathering, give a stump speech tailored to the organizations goals, etc, do a q&amp;a, discuss amd hear from the clubs member rolls what their concerns were, and then incorporate those things into their platform. It was a very interactive and participatory process. These clubs would then vote on endorsements for these canddates and club leaders would whip at the community level to convince members to vote for the preferred candidate. Because this was still an era of participatory politics, it was very possible to get people to vote across the aisle or convince people to vote for a different candidate - partially because people felt they had a more personal relationship with the candidate because they shared a table at the spaghetti dinner, but also because the candidates heard the concerns and goals of the members of these orgs and pitched policy and built a platform around that  that voters could more directly associate with. The orgs could then base their endorsements and members their votes around the policy and platform that was most beneficial to them.It didnt matter that different voters had different interests and goals, voters were largely self-sorting based on their memberships in these clubs. Voters who were veterans and emphasized veterans issues joined VFWs and AL halls, working class blue collar voters were in labor unions, upper class whites were in country clubs, the black community could be found in its own religious and community organizations, etc. You could tell a lot by what a voters priorities were based on the groups they affiliated with.Today membership in these types of groups is a fraction of what it once was and what groups remain arent really participatory. I work with a unionized workforce, for example. To most that basically just means a line on a pay stub that collects a few dollars worth of dues out of each paycheck and which sends them marketing emailsthey dont read asking them for donations or sending messages they dont care about. Due to consolidation and merger the nearest \\"local\\" hall is in an entirely different state and most of the members have never been there and dont participate in gatherings there. They are as disconnected from the union organization as you can imagibe, which is why most voted for Trump despite the union endorsement of Harris - because tgey arent attending a spaghetti dinner with these candudates and having their issues and concerns heard, nor are they in regular meetings and discussions with union leaders who are explaining how the different platforms will help or hurt them, its all just impersonal emails and advertising.But you know who does still have that type of clout and organization? The right - young republicans/college republicans, the NRA, etc. These orgs have much larger membership than similar orgs on the left, and they are still vsry much community focused. Local chapters of these organizations host weekly get togethers, outings, gatherings. Membership in these organizations comes with community, and community means an easy avenue to be propagandized. You want to know why your 3 reductive bullet points work so well? Because millipns of republicans are members of one or more of thise types of organizations and their social circles revolve around them - \\"theyre going to take your guns\\" isnt an attack on something they owj, its an attack on their personal identity, family, friends, all their major social circles and community activity, etc. It means no more range night every tuesday and skeet shooting every saturday, no more monthky spaghetti dinber, no more quarterly group outings to the military history museum or civil war battlefield tours, or camping/fishing trips, etc. As for your other two, while thats what we on the left see and hear when we boil it down, whats actually being messaged and discussed at these clubs (which are overwhelmingly white and male) is much more nuanced and complex than that (though no less gross) - thats an outcome of those groups lacking diversity and only being messaged (and propagandized) from one side, as pnly the GOP engages with them.Anyway, your focus is in the wrong place. Youre concerned with marketing and messaging - thats useless. Marketing and messaging is the 5 emails a day we all receive from MoveOn and ActBlue begging for money during election season, and impersonal emails \\"from\\" whatever candidate but actually written by an intern asking for donations or begging for your vote. The commercials that nobody pays attention to, the billboards we all ignore.  None of that changes anyones minds, youre being marketed competing products and in most cases brand loyalty will always win out in that scenario, by the time all that crap starts showing up most people have already made up their minds on who they are voting for, even if they say they havent decided. No amounts of advertising, marketing, or messaging is going to pull a voter in one direction or another, because its all meaningless background noise that we are constantly bombarded with and very easily tune out. Thats us changing the channel, hitting ubsubscribe on an email. And how much of that marketing and messaging actually hits anyone who wasnt already voting for them, do you think? Republicans arent getting the marketing and messaging from dem candidates, and vice versa. Im not on those email lists, nor are republicans on moveon and actblue lists, same with independents. Republicans and dems get our news from increasingly different sources, we consume increasingly different media. Theres very little reach across the divide there, and a dem showing up on joe rogan may change some minds at the margins but its likely not going to move the needle unless they make a concerted push to pop up repeatedly across rge rightvwing infosphere, which will only alienate the left (see also all the flak that Kamala got for hanging out wiyh Liz Cheney and doing interviews in Fox News - thats what you need to do for marketing and messaging to reach all the voters that arent already in your information bubble you chuckleheads, tgey arent going to tune into your speech on CNN or care about what you have to say if your only surrogates are people youre not tuned into).Nor is mobilizing small armies of mostly white 20-somethings from nyc and bussing them to rural working class pennsylvania to knock on doors and preach pre-canned talking points going to meaningfully change anyones mind one way or another (and the idea that those two groups can meaningfully relate to one another and have a discussion based on some sort of common ground or understanding is laughable when they exist in very different worlds and have very different sets life experiences and concerns).

It is translated by humans. It is interpreted by humans. Certain people of the years have said they have heard the voice of God, or been sent a sign, or are the mortal instrument, but they are human, and thus might not be reliable narrators. I can say that I am a world-class athlete, or others might describe me as \\"fun, sociable, and reliable\\" - none of those are true, that person as described doesn't exist, but it doesn't stop me existing.By the same logic, the God as described might be unlikely to exist, but that doesn't stop God existing. Our brains are limited by how the world appears to us - perhaps God does not have to make choices, but can do all things even if to us they would contradict each other. Perhaps the humans writing the Bible couldn't find a better word for God's behaviour than \\"benevolent\\", but actually God is different from that. Perhaps there are layers of eternity as there are kinds of infinity, and \\"eternal punishment\\" is different from how we are capable of imagining.I don't believe we can say definitively either way that God does not exist, only that the Biblical description does not make sense.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"My understanding of what's impeachable is, \\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\" which in my view is flexible enough to cover almost anything.

What I will do, however, is to try to expand the idea you might have of very powerful, non-human entities that may exist (or have exited) and sparked the religions we see in the world today. In many of the early oral traditions (and early writings) from the pre-Hebrew people, there were several different names used for God or Gods of the region. The early writings indicate that the God that is talking to the Hebrews referred to Himself as one of many Gods, speaks of mankind being created by \\"us\\" rather than by He, speaks of being jealous of other Gods, and tells the Hebrews that He wants to be their God, and they can be His people. These facts were once taken as a given, due to the language used (Elohim, for example, is a plural word meaning \\"Higher Beings\\" or equivalent). Muslims claim that the Christian Bible is corrupted, and what is written there today is not what the original writings were.  They then claim that their book is 100% accurate and faithful to the original. A careful study shows that their book is not, in fact, unchanged, and that we can find many deviations in writings depending on when and where the book was transcribed.  But, the idea that our Bible isn't the exact same as the oral traditions it comes from several thousands of years ago is probably accurate.We do, however, have archeological evidence that many of the stories in the books are essentially unchanged from their originals. One problem with this is that idioms come and go, and some of the words and phrases used today don't carry the same meaning as they did several thousand years ago.  We arrive at the problem that people who translate old language into new, modern language have to make word choices that are predicated on their understanding of what the original phrase actually meant. We now have a bunch of different Bibles, with many being re-translated from very early writings, without re-translating from a Greek translation several hundred years after the original was translated into Greek. Even these are colored by our modern understanding of what the original probably meant. Most of our understanding today of the Bible comes after the King James re-interpretation, with their moral dictates and prejudices altering the meaning of the Greek they were translating from.Assume, for a moment, that very powerful, non-human entities existed at the beginning of human civilization, and that those entities had capabilities we would have interpreted as god-like. We very well may not have considered them to be \\"all-powerful and all-knowing\\" at the time, but the power disparity was so vast that we would not have been blamed for making that assumption. What if some of those gods picked groups of people to \\"shepherd\\" from borderline animal level creatures to a higher level of consciousness.  Whether the gods are supernatural or simply so far advanced in technology, the impact on humanity would be the same.Jesus of Nazareth (not his actual name, of course) was not the biological son of Joseph. The Bible stories indicate that he possessed an unusual level of knowledge of the Hebrew religion at a very early age, and spoke of his knowledge and abilities coming from his Father (again, not Joseph). When he claimed to be the Way, the Truth, and the Life, he was stating that the Jewish obsession with trying to follow the Law to gain entry into heaven was flawed, and that only by surrendering to full belief in his Father would a person gain the Father's trust and salvation. When this was begun, it was purely the Hebrew people who were expected to follow the Jewish Laws and give themselves to the worship of the Hebrew God. It wasn't until after the death and resurrection that it became clear that the Church was to be expanded to the Gentiles as well, that Christianity was to be open to all people. At the end of the day, it's impossible for us to know, for certain. I, personally, believe in the Hebrew Father-in-Heaven, who has a plan for humanity. He might not be the only God who has a plan, but when we look at the rules he's suggested we follow, the focus on forgiveness and love of one's neighbor, it's a plan I can get behind.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Wow, so thoughtful.

You're concluding there's no God when you're not getting a logical answer to an illogical question. This isn't a gotcha but a pre-determined conclusion based on the parameters you've set. If a math teacher can't answer why 1+1=3, does that mean he doesn't know math?It suggests He created them with the purpose of being condemned. That doesnt align with the concept of benevolence.God loves you so much that He wants you to exist even if you do end up not reciprocating that love.Why would an all-just God base infinite rewards or punishments on such a fleeting moment? This feels deeply disproportionate and unjustGod is not subject to your own narrow view of justice. You're the creation, not the other way around.but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:3033:11 might be a better example, since God took human form in order to wrestle with Jacob. But either way this is God *allowing* what we're able to see or not, just like we're not allowed to have a cookie before dinner but sometimes we get permission to do so.James 2:24By Grace you have been saved, through faith, and not by works. Even James earlier in the letter notes that it's faith is what saves us. But *works* are the natural end result of faith. It's what comes out of it.Morally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today. Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapist. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church. Christians selectively ignore these teachings, undermining the Bibles authority as a moral guide.Mosaic Law can get a little more complicated. Moral Law is what references the 10 Commandments, which show us our sin and thus our need for Salvation. Ceremonial Law is how the Israelites were to do about it. You can also throw in Purity Law, which were to remind Israel of the coming Savior. Now since we still sin, we still have a need for Moral Law to show us that sin. But since Jesus has already come and fulfilled the ultimate punishment for that sin, the Ceremonial and Purity Laws are paid for and no longer apply.But to be more specific to the verses you gave...Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapistThe word \\"rape\\" in this case is probably better translated as sex in general, including consensual sex. This was a *protection* for women of the time that the man who had sex with the woman before marriage would *have to* marry the woman and therefore provide for her, since non-virgins weren't exactly a hot commodity on the open dating market. This is the New Living Translation of the verse you quoted: Suppose a man has intercourse with a young woman who is a virgin but is not engaged to be married. If they are discovered, he must pay her father fifty pieces of silver. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he may never divorce her as long as he lives.But if you want something specifically on rape, don't ignore what was said just a few verses before the verse you quoted in 25-27:If out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die. Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death.1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in churchPaul is talking to the church in Corinth about how to have an orderly, respectful worship service. This verse has been taken a few different ways by different denominations, but most typically it isn't that women can't talk at all, but more to the role of women in the church, that they aren't to take leadership positions in instruction of men. *Speak* in a Biblical context more relates to instruction than just talking. Granted, the church in Corinth was pretty wild before Paul wrote his letter to them.How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?The Bible doesn't specifically speak on this, but we know Jesus will judge fairly (Acts) and that the unbelievers will acknowledge His justice (Romans). 2 Thessalonians seems to have a verse which separates those who know of God but choose not to obey, and those who don't know anything of God. So all in all we see that everyone will acknowledge Jesus' judgement as fair, but we really don't know just how that will play out for those who couldn't have possibly known about Jesus.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Ukraine, maybe.

The classic paradoxCan an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they cant lift it?reveals a flaw in the very concept. If the answer is yes, theyre not omnipotent because they cant lift the rock. If the answer is no, theyre not omnipotent because they cant create the rock. The concept collapses under its own weight.First of all the Bible itself says that there are things god isn't capable of, like lie or deny Himself, that's the nature of God and the nature of reality. Just like he can't create a two sided triangle or a married bachelor, just because you can string a bunch of words together doesn't make it non contradictory.Or alternatively. Yes God could make a rock so heavy he can't lift it, but He could then also lift the rock.Christianity often justifies suffering and evil with the idea of free will, but this raises more questions than it answers. If God is omniscient, He created humanity knowing exactly who would sin, suffer, and ultimately end up in hell. Why would a loving God create individuals destined for eternal suffering? It suggests He created them with the purpose of being condemned. That doesnt align with the concept of benevolence.They're not destined for eternal suffering. He gives humans a way out, it's just up to us ourselves to take it.The Bible itself adds to my doubts. Its full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30. Salvation is another inconsistencyRomans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and works. If this is the infallible word of God, why is it so contradictory?The bible isn't the infallible word of God. It's written by fallible mortal men with an agenda. Finally, Jesus is claimed to be the only way to heaven (John 14:6), but billions of peoplesuch as those in North Koreamay never even hear of Him. How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?We don't know. You can choose to believe that anyone that hasn't heard of Jesus is destined for hell, but why would you?

The classic paradoxCan an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they cant lift it?reveals a flaw in the very concept. If the answer is yes, theyre not omnipotent because they cant lift the rock. If the answer is no, theyre not omnipotent because they cant create the rock.The unstoppable force meeting the immovable object is another seeming paradox but which does in fact have a solution (immovable object wins). An omnipotent being would be able to create an object they cannot lift, but then also be able to lift it. Its a mind warping kind of logic akin to trying to imagine an infinity. Next, omnipotence and omniscience are incompatible. If God knows everything, including His own future actions, He cannot act differentlyKnowing a future is not the same as being locked into it. With todays fictionalized instances of the multiverse it should be pretty easy to conceptualize god being capable of seeing all possible futures, rather than one single unalterable timeline.Christianity often justifies suffering and evil with the idea of free will, but this raises more questions than it answers. It suggests He created them with the purpose of being condemned. That doesnt align with the concept of benevolence.Knowing they will fall short is not the same as creating them for that purpose. The purpose would be their freedom. Gods knowledge of their future does not lock them into that future. They will still have to choose it for themselves. Benevolence is giving them life even knowing where theyll ultimately land, just to give them the opportunity to change. Like one of us giving someone a second chance after theyve wronged us. Then theres the problem of eternal consequences. Our brief time on Earth is insignificant when compared to eternity. Why would an all-just God base infinite rewards or punishments on such a fleeting moment? This feels deeply disproportionate and unjust.Youve talked a lot about gods omniscience, so I think its weird that here youd choose to substitute your own judgement for his? If the dude is the smartest being ever, and he feels ~70 years is enough, then hes probably right. This is one of those where you either need to be all-in or not. If the biblical god does exist, then his logic is *way* beyond our mortal ability to judge, or he doesnt and its not, but theres isnt really a middle space where he exists but we have the capacity to reasonably judge his actions.The Bible itself adds to my doubts. Its full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30. Salvation is another inconsistencyRomans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and works.Not sure about the first example, but I know god was up to some shit in genesis, and it could be as simple as both things were true at the time they were recorded. The second one isnt a contradiction. In Romans 3:28 Jesus is talking about salvation, while in James 2:24 hes talking about faith itself, not salvation.Morally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today. Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapist. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church. Christians selectively ignore these teachings, undermining the Bibles authority as a moral guide.Deuteronomy is Old Testament and so is pretty easily dismissible in regard to rules Christians should follow. There are plenty of other examples though, like your 1 Corinthians example where modern morality seems at odds with biblical morality. There are some creative ways of interpreting these writings to let themselves off the hook, but at the end of the day the Bible is supposed to be the final word on morality. If we as a society have shifted away from those morals, then the answer would be that were wrong, not the Bible.Finally, Jesus is claimed to be the only way to heaven (John 14:6), but billions of peoplesuch as those in North Koreamay never even hear of Him. How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?Theres loads of debate about this. Some people think they get in by default like children. Some folks say that gods love is self evident and they should have figured it out. I would imagine the average Christian lands somewhere in between those.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Whatever helps her sleep at night.

Similarly, God cannot cease to exist or perform logical contradictions, as these would contradict His perfection in morality, existence, and logic.If we include the ability to do the logically impossible in our definition of omnipotence, then challenges like \\"lifting an unliftable stone\\" become meaningless. Logical contradictions like lifting an unliftable stone become non-issues.This question is not new. A quick search reveals that Saint Thomas Aquinas addressed it centuries ago. He explained that contradictions (e.g., square circles or married bachelors) fall outside the scope of divine omnipotence. As he put it, *Whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility.* You can explore his writings for a more detailed discussion of this topic.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"But I benefit immensely from \\"turning my life into GDP\\"","title":"Korean men are one factor in low birthrate, says demographics expert"},{"text":"Despite the outlandish anti-Republican slant of your post, would this bill from last month have helped at all had it been approved?

Today I learn the trash is trying to start trouble at the Bingo Hall at Turning Stone Casino where the old lady and handicapped girls sometimes go. Shameful! Well, not much has changed, except more fear and intimidation for the 80 year old woman and her family in Oneida, NY. Quick recap: years of abuse, baiting and gaslighting directed mostly at her son, but also her handicapped daughters, from neighbors and police (the neighbors all, coincidentally, claim to know the police) Of course since nothing has been achieved the harassment has been escalated. I do not know real estate, but it seems as if for a long time it has been planned a NYSP Officer or other local agency officer would be buying the home recently purchased by the State Trooper. It, almost perfectly, fits the money laundering or kickback playbook of organized real estate crime.It just keeps getting more pathetic the more videos I see. It seems the perpetrators desperation to achieve something with their harassment outweighs their cowardice in perpetuating it, as theyre leaving quite a video and paper trail!Today I get a video of a cop parking in a residential driveway, the recorder saying, as a Walmart delivery pulls in So, what youre going to see , since weve had to hear about (Cashier at Walmart) dating a trooper so much lately is something scary and intimidating on this delivery guy pulling in. Something meant to be taken in concert with Trooper boy next door, so, a delivery guy gets out and makes a point that his Dont Tread On Me hat is shoved in the Blink doorbell. Coincidence? Maybe, but Ive seen dozens of similar videos from this same house going back years. There is definitely a pattern of organized harassment and intimidation.Anyway, within a week the female cashier mentioned has the recorders 80 year old mother kicked out of Wal-Mart. No real reason is given, definitely no proof of any kind to any harassment or wrongdoing.The cashier responsible claims to date a NYSP Officer, her sister frequently is seen with the Wal-Mart renacop (wannabe cop?) socially. The cashiers sister, like the guy who sold the house to the cop, tried suing the 80 year old (for about the same amount of money) for not relinquishing life use of a property on the opposite side from where the cop now lives.The cashier responsible was reported multiple times doing the same cowardly and generally weak form of harassment neighbors and police have been apart of, Wal-Mart did nothing. This is documented.The 80 year old woman mainly visits Wal-Mart because they fill the (approximately) 30 medications that she and her 2 mentally handicapped daughters need every month.Seriously. Wal-Mart security even tried forcing one of the, very clearly, mentally handicapped women to sign a sheet admitting wrongdoing. She had a clipboard violently shoved into her chest. This was done to provoke an outburst the family believes. Local Police however found no wrongdoing on either side (I.e. no real reason to be kicked out of the store).Now, the guy recording all of this says hes turning it into the FBI, but hes been saying that since before the cop moved in! I think all the files he has on them that show their system of harassment and intimidation should be made public. I feel embarrassed for these people, what theyre doing is really, really pathetic, but the public should know what their tax dollars are buying, shouldnt they?Is there a place I could share these? My favorite is the cop who cant remember her name or how to spell it, but it was needed for an email address to send a video clearly showing the 80 year old being attacked in, so it makes sense they wouldnt want to see it. That was in July. In the same video the son says when you research the activity at that house all you get are articles about fraud, the RICO Act, stuff like that. The next month a State Trooper buys the property and the family is sued frivolously.What can be done to help these people? Her son is much more intelligent than they have expected, but he is more concerned with the writing of a novel, so this is all just an unwanted distraction and potential toxic influence.","title":"Real, Live Authoritarian Conspiracy"},{"text":"More like last 4 years.","title":"Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.)

I've studied various African traditional religions and Eastern philosophies that conceptualize divine power completely differently - not as a binary omnipotent/non-omnipotent construct, but as a more fluid, interconnected force.Your paradoxes about omnipotence assume classical logic, but even modern quantum physics shows us reality isn't that simple. Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Why couldn't a divine being transcend our limited human logic in similar ways?The moral arguments you raise reflect legitimate concerns about justice and equality. But consider how religious movements have actually driven progressive change - look at how liberation theology shaped anti-colonial struggles in Africa and Latin America, or how religious leaders like Desmond Tutu used faith to fight apartheid. The problematic biblical verses you cite were products of their time, but the core message of radical equality and justice has inspired movements for social change.The existence of suffering is complex, but maybe it's not about a puppet-master God controlling everything. What if God represents the potential for positive change within systems of oppression? That's very different from the simplistic sky-daddy version you're arguing against.I'd encourage looking beyond just Christian theology. There are sophisticated philosophical traditions from across Africa and Asia that might resonate more with your progressive values while still maintaining space for the divine or transcendent. The question isn't whether a specific narrow concept of God exists, but what deeper truths various spiritual traditions point to.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Democrats need to reinvent themselves.?

The verse is talking about a case where the man *seduced* an unmarried woman, not raped. The Hebrew word used literally translates as something like \\"afflicted\\", but it's clear from other passages where it's used that it refers specifically to \\"loss of virginity\\" (eg Genesis 34:2).The omnipotence problem about an unliftable rock is a well known and fairly silly paradox which results from inadequacies in human language, not God's abilities. It resolves fairly quickly once you realise the question is essentially just \\"Is there anything God can't do?\\", to which the answer is, \\"No\\".This and most of the rest of the arguments boil down to false assumptions, and specifically the arrogance of humans presuming to understand the divine.

The problem with most Reddit atheists is that they subscribe to a pop culture, superficial view of Christianity that doesn't even truly exist. Then they use that as the basis to assume there is and can be no God. You're starting with a false premise and making a judgement based on that. There are multitudes of different interpretations of Christianity. I think it's best to look into information from religious scholars they are both Christian and non Christian before you draw any final conclusions. There are many different descriptions of hell in the Bible that range to the description of a quite literal contemporary garbage dump that was perpetually of fire out side of Israel to simple non-existence. There are many Christians that believe the atheist notion that you live and die and that's it, is what happens to non Christians. Eternal torment in fire is not an absolute belief for all Christians. Some people take the Bible literally which is the superficial and shallow understanding. Other people realize that the Bible is filled with allegory and cultural and historical context that requires consideration to people grasp the message of the content. Personally I like the secular Gnostic take. God is simply pure consciousness he/it exists in a larger reality that goes beyond spacetime and is a concept incomprehensible to humanity. Just like the Internet is an incomprehensible concept to a dog. From there you have the Gnostic Aeons that are basically siloed \\"split personalities from pure consciousness. You could also consider them simulations within the ultimate simulation. From there you have more Aeons and further \\"simulations\\" within that which ultimately lead to our physical reality. We are essentially a split personality of a split personality, of a split personality, of a split personality, of pure consciousness. If you look into the work being done in the \\"theory of everything\\" thought space you'll see there are many academics postulating about the nature of reality. Many of them arrive at a similar conclusion that is, reality may exist behind spacetime and consciousness may be inherent rather than emergent.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Please, please, please will you explain why you think Trump is a dictator?

Let's talk about omnipotence and omnipresence. If you were able to comprehend the nature of God, then the Abrahamic God would be a contradiction. Bible explicitly states his ways are incomprehensible.3. I used to have that same exact question with those who never had the chance to know God. But if you believe God is a just god, you'll trust he makes the right decision. The Bible also states that because of the beauty of creation, you should at least know a god exists and that man would be left with no excuse. A lot of Christians believe when you come face to face with God after death, that the question will be asked there.4. For the duetoronomy verse, that's why you read the original Hebrew.

Some axioms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_axiomsAdd to this G?del's incompleteness theorems which states that, in any system of knowledge there will exists certain unprovable truths. Therefore, every consistent system of knowledge will always be incomplete. Which means, the list of axioms will always keep growing. The other statement of this theorem is that if we create a system in which we can prove every true thing, then in that system we will also be able to prove any untrue thing. (I know, this broke my head too). Therefore, any complete system of knowledge will always be inconsistent. Hence, a system of knowledge can either be incomplete (we need some axioms) or inconsistent (we can prove something to be both true and false). And here's the kicker, given a system of knowledge, operating within its bounds, it is impossible to know whether it is incomplete or inconsistent. Therefore, while we are happy that our existing maths/science is consistent (we haven't been able to prove 2+2=5), we can't be sure about.Therefore, faith/belief in God is not provable, it is an axiom.

Taxing the rich to give to the poor on the long run makes everyone poorer. Whether that be through corruption or just decreased economic activity broadly. You could disagree with this but its an easily arguable position with tons of solid data. Its a more believable argument that instead of thinking Obama is a class traitor and a simplistic take that he just cares about his investments. Its way more likely as he gets older and sees how things actually works he becomes more free market oriented.

Instead, as I have gone back to school in my later years to become an RF engineer and picked up a bit of physics, I see a universe that might have been created by some god, but probably not God.Consider gravity. Gravity, at it's simplest, is just an attractive force that any two objects with mass experience. It is a fundamental force found in nature. This means that the gravitational constant does not change for all things. But, what if the \\"pull\\" from gravity were just ever-so-slightly moved in either direction? Even just the slightest change in the positive direction would cause stars to burn too fast and collapse into black holes. The slightest change in the negative direction would mean that the stars never form in the first place.On it's own, one might just dismiss this as luck. But these kinds of things are found all throughout nature. It is called the Anthropic principle. It is a major area of study in cosmology. The Anthropic principle says that either we exist in a fine-tuned universe because, of all universes that could possibly exist, we could only possibly exist in one fine-tuned for us, or a fine-tuned universe was created for us.What has changed my mind is the realization that the frontiers of theoretical science are completely full of pseudoscience. No no physics has really been discovered since the 60s. We have had a generation of sub par physicists working in tenured positions at schools scamming students into thinking that they could be just like the nerds on \\"The Big Bang Theory,\\" and this started well before the show was ever broadcast.

However let me try to answer some. One thing I should mention is every religion and consequently every person has their own interpretation of God. Some adhere to doctrine and some blend their understanding into something that fits better to their reasoning. Can God create a rock he cannot move is a flawed question and though this might seem as an intelligent question. It's premise is predicated on a simplistic understanding of the nature of God as it infers he has a form ( Like a human ). Reframed in a different way, one could see how the question doesn't make sense when applying a different understanding. A different way to ask this is to say \\" Can God do anything stupid\\" . The obvious answer is no. If we Believe he's omniscient then he cant do anything \\"stupid\\". It would go against his Divine nature and that would mean that he isn't God. In the same sense he doesn't do anything meaningless, what would be the meaning of creating such immovable object? Also this is predicated on a God that has a physical form which my understanding of God is he is outside the realm of time and space. Jewish and Christian understanding and description of God is very limited and flawed. The teachings of the Bible on women ( and frankly a lot of aspects of life) are flawed and backwards. If you choose Christianity and the Bible to be your judge of what God is and who he is, then you are right to land on the conclusion you have landed on. The Christian- Jewish faith asks to accept somethings and ignore others. If this is how you want to understand God then by all means. I find it very limiting. All this to say is to don't assume the Christian/ Jewish faith is the standard we should all measure God on. My understanding of God is that he is one ( unique) He is what all depend on ( in the universe etc) He doesn't beget nor can he be begotten ( no children and no parents) and there's isn't anything like him.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Why people say Biden said this when he can even talk right.

The atheism mindset seems to always be its not objectively proven that he exists so therefore he must not, but why shouldnt it be the other way around? Wheres the proof god isnt real? You wont find any. Most of your questions assume there is locked in understanding in the nature of god and then challenge that nature as if thats proof he doesnt exist. But the truth is we dont actually know the true nature of god, we simply have theories based on the scripture weve been given through centuries and our own life experiences.I also dont buy your argument about free will being contradicted by omniscience. Just because god can see everything and know what people are going to do does not mean those people are not freely making choices. And to the point about why suffering exists, theres an explanation in scripture about being kicked out of the garden of eden, but I think the more practical interpretation is that humans are a species uniquely capable of understanding the difference between good and evil, which is both a blessing and a curse. Our conscience creates the possibility for real differing but also for us to actively do good, and the ultimate question IMHO that religion poses is how you live a life to actively choose good in a world where plenty of bad temptations exist. In terms of whether any of this convinces you, Im sure it wont, but I guess thats also the point Im making.

Can they make 2+2=5? This seems more like wordplay than a serious objection. You could consider omnipotent to mean the ability to do anything logical.Next, omnipotence and omniscience are incompatible. If God knows everything, including His own future actions, He cannot act differently, which limits His power.I don't think that's incompatible. Someone playing basketball has free will, someone watching a tape of it later can know the future actions. It's not inconceivable for a divine being to both have free will while instantly knowing all future consequences. Presumably, God would exist outside of time and see all time at once.If God is omniscient, He created humanity knowing exactly who would sin, suffer, and ultimately end up in hell.Back to the basketball example, if someone is watching a tape of someone playing basketball, that doesn't infringe on the basketballer's free will. Knowledge of an action doesn't mean you caused it.Then theres the problem of eternal consequences. Our brief time on Earth is insignificant when compared to eternity. Why would an all-just God base infinite rewards or punishments on such a fleeting moment?I actually think this makes sense if you look at it differently. It's not about punishment for specific actions, but about who you choose to become. If you consistently choose to move toward love, truth, and goodness (which is what God represents), you naturally end up closer to those things. If you consistently reject them, you move away. The eternal part just reflects that these are fundamental choices about who we are.The Bible itself adds to my doubts. It's full of contradictions.Most of these \\"contradictions\\" make sense when you understand the context and literary style. Like, the two creation accounts? They're serving different purposes - one's about showing God's power, the other's about humanity's relationship with God. It's like how you might tell the same story differently depending on what point you're trying to make.Morally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today.Yeah, some of those passages are rough. But here's the thing - even Jesus challenged literal interpretations of scripture in favour of the deeper principles. He was constantly getting into arguments with religious leaders who took everything super literally. The point isn't to blindly follow ancient rules, but to understand the underlying principles of love, justice, and mercy.Finally, Jesus is claimed to be the only way to heaven (John 14:6), but billions of peoplesuch as those in North Koreamay never even hear of Him.?This is actually addressed in Romans 2:14-15. The idea is that people are judged based on how they respond to whatever truth they have access to, not on specific knowledge they couldn't possibly have had. Someone who's never heard of Jesus but lives according to their conscience and seeks truth? They're probably better off than someone who goes to church every Sunday but treats people like crap.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Simple physics you say?","title":"Biden just authorized $17.9 billion in aid to Californians who lost everything in the fires.

Let's talk about impeachment first.  The left, obviously, has had a hate on for Trump since he first ran for president.  I would say an unreasonable hate.  That was what actually got me supporting Trump in the first place, seeing how the left was steady calling Trump a racist day in and day out, and publishing his personal financial information in the paper, and stuff like that.  I just thought that was pretty low.And so it's no surprise they wanted to impeach him.  But impeachment isn't supposed to work if just one party wants a guy out of there; both parties have to agree, on that.  And he hadn't done anything to the Republicans; in fact, he helped get a few people elected.  And apparently hurt a few others, but whaddayagonna do.  People loved the guy.  And so Republicans really couldn't go along with it, and neither impeachment took.Then there's the charges.  And over all these charges hangs the taint of lawfare.  Letitia James ran on the policy of charging Trump with something.  When she did, the case was in a posture that was almost unique.  The only other case of its nature had been brought by Letitia James, and lost.  By posture, meaning there were no complaining witnesses.  No one had gone to the DA saying I wuz robbed.  The banks weren't complaining; no one was complaining.  But she brought the charges anyway, and guess what, she won.  Well, Republicans said, New York State, whaddayagonna do, it's a very blue state, we all know the libs hate Trump.Alvin Bragg ran on the policy of charging Trump with something.  I think this was the hush money payments, that he finally got a conviction on.  I don't think most USAicans really understand why it's illegal to pay someone not to speak to the press.  I'm sure those who wrote the laws had good reason; but it's just not... I mean, who is harmed?  Really.  I'm not seeing it.  And so he got a pass from the voters on that too.Then there's the sex assault case.  This sex assault occurred thirty years ago, and apparently the lady didn't complain to the cops at the time.  I don't doubt it happened; but you know, if you don't go to the cops when it happens... it can't have been that much of an assault.  No broken bones, not enough offended dignity to complain to the authorities.  Who knows, maybe she was still thinking Trump might be able to do something for her.  Just sayin'.  Possibility.Then there's the election interference case.  Now it took me a while to realize this was real.  Trump really did try to win an election that he knew he had lost.  But the left spent so much time caterwauling about an assault on democracy that none of them seems to realize that Democrats and Republicans alike do what we call gerrymandering right now, today, which is an attempt by the legislature to make sure that the will of the people will be unfairly represented at the ballot box.  An attempt, that is, to steal not just one election, but all of them.  And so it's hard to take all this too seriously.  Trump was working hard to win the election; we like a guy that thinks it's that important.  It says something positive about him, that he'll work that hard to get 'er done.In addition to which, of course, we have hundreds of thousands of federal felonies, and who knows how many state felonies, and how can you walk down the street without breaking some law or other?  It's hard to imagine.  And so until someone is actually harmed, Trump gets a pass on all that.Up to a limit.  This limit.","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"The incoming fascist-elect did not place his hand on his heart, because he either does not know where it is or, more likely, he does not have one.","title":"Kamala Harris posts Jimmy Carter funeral photo with notable exclusion; internet reacts"},{"text":"It's much harder to motivate a group of different voters with different backgrounds and motivations but share the ideal that people should have access to rights.  Republicans are very easy to motivate, all you have to do is tell them one of 3 things and they will absolutely turn out in numbers.  1; \\"They're coming for yer gunz!\\"  2; \\"\\\\[Insert minority\\\\] should have rights taken away.\\"  And/or 3; \\"Vote for us to make liberals suffer!\\" That's a winning campaign for a Republican.Not so for a liberal candidate.  Much more work is needed as the group has far more varied people who aren't hateful and vengeful as Republicans are.  Could Dems use a reform?  Yeah, sure they could.  But the Dem brand is not awful.  Everything is better under a Democrat; the economy has better numbers, better results for working people, even corporations have better profits.  Nearly all recessions happen under a Republican, most wars are caused by Republicans, and more unrest and violence happens under a Republican President than any other due to their explicit motivation to cause racial unrest.  These things need to be marketed better.  Too much focus on high level stuff, and not as much on what affect peoples lives.  The grocery store issue was a great missed opportunity.  Trump's plan will skyrocket inflation and cause people direct pain in the supermarket, whereas Harris's plan would not do this.  These types of messages were not made well imo.  But do not think the Democratic party is anything like Republicans, they are not the same.","title":"Democrats need to fix their own shit before they can fix America"},{"text":"Just a few links that popped up when you google instances of Trump bullying.

Mocking disabled reporters. Attacking gold star military families. Even just his campaign bluster. He doesnt just attack other politicians for their platforms or policies, he attacks them with mean nicknames and slings lies like Obama was born in Kenya and Ted Cruzs father killed JFK and Kamala lied about being black. People might not like that hes now bullying allies, but bullying on its own is part of why he was elected and why people think hes real and tells it like it is.Putting the issue of whether or not hes always been a bully, I have three other problems with your view:1. The most concerning is that you seem to be advocating for impeachment/removal based on one thing that isnt illegal (bullying) but formally impeaching/removing him based on other charges. Its wild to imagine charging and prosecuting someone for a crime NOT because they committed the crime, but solely because they did something legal you dont like. The idea that the justification would be widely understood to be for a different reason than the actual charge is such a slippery slope for politics and the criminal justice system.2. Do you have evidence that there is a significant change in opinion from the people who just voted for him? He just won the election, and while you claim that this was before people knew he was going to bully these other countries, I dont think that a significant portion of his voters would have voted a different way if hed been making these comments on the campaign trail. 3. Even if Republican voters had serious regrets, the Republican political establishment does not. Theyve spent a decade trying to take control of government like they have now. They wont sabotage their own interest by pissing off their Trump-loving base. Besides costing their own elections, it would throw instability as they try to push Project 2025 into law.Lastly, impeachment doesnt really mean anything. Trump was impeached twice in his first term and was never removed from office. Because 2/3 of the Senate, which is Republican controlled, would need to convict. Theres no world where that many Republicans in government take a stand against Trump for this.","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"You are wrong to speak about one race.If we talk about peoples in high places including every country and every race could involved in that:It is closer to the truth.","title":"Just imagine the laugh they all had after demolishing 3 Buildings in 1 Day and the majority buys the official story to this day..."},{"text":"Most likely the Democratic Establishment will ensure that their preferred candidate wins.

Youve made so many wild claims. Many many liberals are critical of the establishment and their donor influence, which is something that republicans and democrats have. Generally the moderate democrats/republicans tend to vote for establishment leaders. Elon openly discussing his plans is not any better as long as he is exerting his unlimited influence that drastically influences policy. If anything it exposes the establishment to people who actually dont realize whats going on.Trump, a billionaire, has much more in common with Elon than he does with the people, which is why he was quick to go back on what he said about opening jobs and improving the economy for Americans. The H1B visas only improve businesses for the rich.And there are more to regulations than just shaping competition? For example, Trump tried to destroy the EPA as well. Environmental regulations may hurt business in the short term, but the next generations will be fucked if we dont do anything about the environment. Hell, even China is improving their ecosystem faster than America. CHINA. China known for having awful air quality realized they fucked up, and is now trying to drastically fix their environment.But anyway, how the world can trust the richest man on earth to shape policy for the common person when Elon is openly an establishment elite.","title":"Why does the left hate Elon so much?"},{"text":"Hmm.

But the fact that some Muslims and people that shield Islam from \\"Islamophobia\\" don't know is what [Imam Al-Tabari (prominent scholar from that time) tafsir (interpretation) means here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.islamweb.net/amp/ar/library/content/50/752/%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2582%25D9%2588%25D9%2584-%25D9%2581%25D9%258A-%25D8%25AA%25D8%25A3%25D9%2588%25D9%258A%25D9%2584-%25D9%2582%25D9%2588%25D9%2584%25D9%2587-%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2589-%25D9%2584%25D8%25A7-%25D8%25A5%25D9%2583%25D8%25B1%25D8%25A7%25D9%2587-%25D9%2581%25D9%258A-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AF%25D9%258A%25D9%2586-%25D9%2582%25D8%25AF-%25D8%25AA%25D8%25A8%25D9%258A%25D9%2586-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25B1%25D8%25B4%25D8%25AF-%25D9%2585%25D9%2586-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25BA%25D9%258A-) is that there is is no complusion to other monoteistic religions (Abrahamic + Zoroastrians) as long as they pay the Jizya tax but for the rest of non-believers the option is to either conver or die. Now you will say oh this is just one radical scholar which is idiotic as at that time the interpretation of these scholars was the main reference to study the Fiqh, Shariah...As for homosexuals the fact you say \\"discipline\\" means you fell for the propagandized translated version. Just like the other Nisa verse that teaches to beat wives if they don't obey but is translated \\"disciplined\\". A euphimistic approach used by apologists. But let's ignore this verse and ivoke the [Lut story in Quran](https://islamtomorrow.com/gays/quranongays.htm) which is if you ask any Muslim will know is about that parable Allah made to warn believers from homosexuality.And the fact you dismissed pedophilia and slavery like that means you have no idea about Islam.Here is the self-narrated Sahih hadith about [Aisha age during marriage and consummation](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134)Here is the Quranic verse that implies Muslims are permitted to have concubines or sex slaves.Also ?forbidden are? married womenexcept **what your right hand possessed** This is Allahs commandment to you. Lawful to you are all beyond theseas long as you seek them with your wealth in a legal marriage, not in fornication. Give those you have consummated marriage with their due dowries. It is permissible to be mutually gracious regarding the set dowry. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. [Al Nisa:24](https://quran.com/en/an-nisa/24)I fixed the right translation in (the right hand possessed) cause Quran.com is used by apologists to sanewash the right meaning. In arabic it's ?? ? ? which is term accepted by the scholarly consensus to refer to the extra concubines a Muslim could have alongside the wives and also can be contracted through the slave market.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

The Croatian national character was defined in opposition to all of its neighbors depending on which one was more powerful at the time. In the early 1800s, it was in opposition to the Ottomans. In the late 1800s, it was in opposition to the Hungarians. Throughout most of the 1900s, it was in opposition to the Serbs/Serbians. Now, that Europe and the Balkans specifically is reconciling, it has defaulted to the Ottomans again, or rather their \\"key\\" difference from the Croatians, Islam.This is not to say that there were no abuses under the Ottomans. Devshirme alone is a massive crime, but we should be clear that the Austrians, Hungarians, Serbs, and even Croatians themselves (like during the Ustashe Period) committed numerous atrocities against Croatian people. That people focus on the Ottoman period is because of this reflexive need to create an \\"other\\" in order to create their own nationalism. Most Muslims are not desirous of recreating the Ottoman Empire, even if Erdogan is. Most Hungarians are not in favor of Magyarization policies, even if Orban is. Most Serbians are not in favor of Serbification, even if some of their less recent leaders were.

Let me just define some term before I reply.The first question is of course which values we are talking about. The nebulous term \\"Western values\\" can conceivably contain anything from capitalistic economy, the monogamous husband/wife core family-structure, belief in Christ, liberal values, and Germanic or Slavic culture. Before we can discuss if something is a threat to Western values, we need to define which values they are. For me, the \\"Western values\\" that are worth preserving and discussing are first and foremost liberal democratic ideals like participatory elections, civil liberty, minority protection and the cultivations of the marketplace of ideas.\\"Normalising\\" Islam also needs to be defined. I will assume you mean accepting Islamic thought into the mainstream in the West, like allowing political parties and private schools based on the ideology, as well as protecting everyday practice like giving Muslims a day off for Eid, using public broadcaster funding on showing Islamic celebrations on the television, as well as facilitating for Adhan calls and wearing headscarves in public.It follows from classical liberalism that any faith or belief system should be \\"normalized\\" under this understanding. Not because all ideas are of equal value, but rather because we can never know if our ideas or values are good, and only by allowing a free transaction of ideas, can we as free members of society choose which value systems, traditions and religions we want to embrace. Religious freedom is a core expression of freedom of thought. You cannot have freedom of thought if you are not allowed to convey your beliefs to your children or express your beliefs in a manner in line with your values (as an example, you don't REALLY have the freedom to believe that God says women should cover their hair if you make it illegal to wear headscarves). But of course, as you mention, there are certain systems that we do not allow to normalise. Your example is neo-nazism. If somebody wanted to start a private school built on Nazi ideals, or wanted to take the day off to commemorate Hitler's birthday, I think most people in Europe would agree that it would be \\"too\\" tolerant of intolerance. We also have to create limits of your freedom when in impinges on others' freedom (for example your right to raise your children in your faith meets their right to their body if you believe they should be genitally mutilated or married off before the age of consent etc.)So the question should be if Islamic values fall into the same category as nazism in this case. You have chosen to look at the foundational texts of the religion to support your argument that the religion is intolerant and incompatible with Western values. And if we looked at them in isolation, that might be true. But this is where the comparison with Christianity becomes relevant. That might also be true if we looked at just the Bible in isolation, or the Communist Manifesto. Yet both Christianity and Communism are allowed, tolerated and \\"noramlised\\" parts of Western Society. And these societies are still recognisably liberal/\\"Western\\". Because the practice of Christianity and Communism is a lot more than just their foundational texts. In my country Norway, we have had loads of specifical cultural practices that align with traditional Norwegian Christian values that to a certain extent break with the liberal/Western ideals (laws against blasphemy, against homosexuality, forbidding certain religious minorities etc.) We were able to cultivate a liberal/Western culture with these laws in place, which over time led to them being revoked, and in turn made the country a better place for more people. It is relevant that a vast majority of Muslims in Europe live their everyday life shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts of other faiths. The majority of Muslims in Europe may have a perspective on homosexuality and women's liberation that deviates from the normative foundation in Western societies (but perhaps not from the European majority's own values), but as long as they are not actively calling for a jihad to cleanse the infidels (which they don't), we have to allow for disagreement as long as we wish to follow our liberal heritage. Is it possible that certain branches of fundamental Islamists could gain power in a Western country and degrade its liberal values? Yes. Just like a small group of Socialists did in most of Eastern Europe. Or like some would claim that fundamental Christians have done in the US. Does that mean that all Muslims are a danger to the liberal values of the West? No, because unlike the Nazis, we have loads of examples of regular Muslims living their day to day in Europe, contributing to society, participating in elections and allowing to live and let live.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

Similarly, decades of research on personalized persuasion highlight how appealing to a persons psychological traits  e.g. their personality or moral values  can sway hearts and minds without the need for content that is factually inaccurate.\\n \\n . . .\\n \\n The bottom line is that to rekindle a sense of shared reality and establish a more unified democracy, we need solutions that tackle more than just misinformation. To counter the impact of news that is factually accurate but misleading or highly polarizing, its not enough to simply rely on systems of convenience that do the job of fact-checking.

But firstly, this is not always the case. And what's more, this is generally the case with Christianity and Judaism as well. They are twin religions (well, triplets) that have extremely similar bases. And to say that the West is progressive is false. You just have to see the rise of the far right everywhere, or simply who the president of the United States is... No country is truly progressive in the sense that there is no consensus in the world between conservatives and progressives. Although some countries have more progressives than others. (Canada has more progressives than Japan I think, with equal population.) But overall, it's wrong to say that the West is progressive and the rest is NECESSARILY conservative. Especially since in most conservative non-Western countries (not all, most), part of this non-progressivism finds its roots in the colonization of white peoples. Many countries were relatively free on subjects to which whites were not at the same time (notably homosexuality). And through colonization and ESPECIALLY learning about Christianity, they became conservative. This is why Africa has a lot of very conservative countries. Generally speaking, I think that in their essence, classical religions are not compatible with progressivism.But religion is strongly based on the interpretation that its followers make of it. And thats not set in stone. This is why there are many Christian movements, particularly progressive ones, or Muslim women's movements who do not wear the hijab. And over time, religion could be practiced in a progressive way, and therefore compatible with the progressive ideal. Because for me, it's like a language. And a language changes with the people who speak it.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

For every person that insists that it's (their interpretation of) shari'a or bust there's ten that just want to live a peaceful life. second there is an idea in islamic thought that, yes, if you govern a society then you can govern it to your liking; but if you do not you can not, and you shouldn't try to achieve domination. Muhammad did not come into power from trying to come into power, he was invited. If his example is your guiding star, which is what it should mean to be muslim, then afaik the correct analysis is that Muhammad never tried to get political power. Afaik, it is after he gets political power that an islamic judicial system is established. Things like fornication were sins before, but they were not punished. Afaik. So in a scenario where muslims do not have power, it is doubtful whether it is in line with islam to try to get power, and in a scenario where muslims do not have power, it is doubtful whether or not shari'a is to be enforced.I have it from credible sources, both sunni and shi'a, that the correct thing to do if you choose to live in a country is to abide by its laws.There are muslims who are a kind of revolutionary utopians, who, like bolsheviks, for instance, would crack a few eggs to make an omelet. My understanding is not that this is from the example of Muhammad, and not that they are anywhere near being the majority.What you say is right if you assume that muslims will fight for the right to practice shari'a in certain ways, but it is doubtful if the religion really tells them they should.That's what I think.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

All religious people accept that their religion is the right one (otherwise they are not religious). Then some go to the extreme to follow the orders in the religious texts or by religious leaders to do things like in the example. But the starting point is the religion whose truth value is not challenged. The point is that by the use of religion it's possible to get the \\"troubled\\" members to commit those crimes. You take away the religion and it doesn't happen. You don't have suicide bombers in secular western countries in anywhere near the same number as in Muslim countries even though there is no particular reason to believe that there are similar number of mentally unstable people everywhere.

If youd actually read the Quran, youd know that it absolutely **doesnt** say that Muslims should go out and kill people willy nillySurah 2:191: And kill them (non-Muslims) wherever you find them  kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers (non-Muslims).This is referring to the Quraysh who used to persecute Muslims brutally, to the point of torturing and even killing them en masse. You actually missed out half the verse itself to make it sound worse. Its specifically talking about wartime and rebelling against persecution, which youd understand had you read the verses around 2:191.2:190; Fight in the cause of Allah only against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors.2:191; Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. **For persecution is far worse than killing.** And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight themthat is the reward of the disbelievers.2:192; But if they cease, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.2:193; Fight against them if they persecute you until there is no more persecution, and  your devotion will be to Allah alone. If they stop persecuting you, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.Surah 9:5: Then kill the disbelievers (non-Muslims) wherever you find them, capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush Again, youve taken it out of context. Its referring to Quraysh who broke a peace treaty, so its telling Muslims to retaliate against them specifically. Heres the context;9:4; As for the polytheists who have honoured every term of their treaty with you and have not supported an enemy against you, honour your treaty with them until the end of its term. Surely Allah loves those who are mindful of Him.9:5; But once the Sacred Months have passed, **kill the polytheists who violated their treaties** wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.9:6; And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection O Prophet, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge.2-Torture homosexual men\\nAn-Nisa 16: And those two of you who commit it (the shameful act), torture them both.I dont think the Quran ever explicitly says that homosexuality is a sin barring condemning sodomy. But this verse specifically is talking about adultery not homosexuality, and the word used doesnt mean torture but discipline or punish.3-Child marriage/pedophilia\\nAccording to Sahih al-Bukhari Aisha was engaged to Muhammad at six years of age, and the marriage was consumated (sex/rape) when Aisha was 9 and Mohammad 53 years old.Okay so the issue with this is that theres actually a lot of evidence that suggests that she wasnt actually 9 years old. It doesnt make sense chronologically, or Islamically as it contradicts other authentic sunna and verified Hadiths. The only reason its even a discussion is because it was quoted in the Hadith books of Bukhari and Muslim, but came from a man called Hisham who was considered senile at the time, and lived in Iraq, some 150 years after the reported events. In fact, the founder of the second largest Islamic madhab, (schools of thought), Imam Malik just flat out rejected it because of said contradictions. There was also a political aspect to it as some factions at the time of Hishams narration wanted Aishas age to be younger to say she was more pure.As I said above, the reported age just doesnt add up chronologically. For example, all historical references state that Asmaa (sister of Aisha) was (10) years older than her sister Aisha. The same references agree unanimously that Asmaa was born (27) years before the migration to Medina. This means that Asmaa was 14 years old at the start of the revelation of Islam in (610) and Aisha was 4 years old. This means that Aisha was born in the year (605 AD).We have seen that the prophet married Aisha in the year (620 AD), which would make her (14) years at the time. It is also stated that the prophet started having sexual intercourse 3 years and few months after the marriage which would be the end of the (1st) year after Hijrah and the beginning of the (2nd) year, which was the year (624 AD). If Aisha was born in the year (606 AD), then she would have been at least (18) years old when she started a full marital life with the prophet.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

In fact, this is the majority of what lobbyists do. They prepare and communicate reports to inform the lawmakers.

Hell, this even extends to processed food I buy in the supermarket.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So much to address it's hard to know where to start.First, you are characterising an entire group of religions by the worst interpretations by the worst members of those religions. There's a reason you tried to cry off talking about Christianity etc from the start - it's because your argument as provided applies equally well to almost any religion. What you're doing is no different to someone bringing up awful quotes from the Christian bible and then pretending that every Christian lives by those quotes.Second, you are confusing two different things - criticism of a specific belief with criticising the people who believe it. There is nothing wrong with criticising any religions, including Islam. There is nothing wrong with saying \\"no, Muhammad didn't split the moon in two, that's a ridiculous idea\\". And practically nobody calls anybody \\"Islamophobic\\" for doing so. What is Islamophobic is pretending that all Muslims believe the same thing, or that they're all backwards with incompatible values, or comparing them as a group to Nazis, and so on.Third, you seem to be under the mistaken notion that the \\"Western world\\" is some monolith with one set of values and a single culture. It's not. You can find people in the \\"Western world\\" who are actively trying to remove protection for human rights (the right-wing in the UK for one obvious example), people who think abortion should be punished with the death penalty, people who think convicted felons are fit to lead a country, people who think that non-believers in their religion are evil and should be punished, people who believe homosexuality should be punished, people who believe slavery was and is absolutely fine because black people are inferior, people who believe in beating children for minor things, and people who believe all sorts of insane magic shit (ask a Catholic what happens to a cracker during communion for one example, or ask a homeopath about how sugar cubes remember what some water once experienced). These aren't all views limited to crackpots living in shelters in the woods either, some of these things are [government-level](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/05/opinions/un-death-penalty-resolution-usa-lgbt-ghitis-opinion/index.html). A lot of the people who believe those things will tell you their religion says it's ok (and there's almost always a quote from their special book that supports that).Fourth, you seem to be unable to differentiate between the person, and their belief. Talk to any religious person and they might tell you they believe all sorts of bizarre things. But do they live their live as though those things are true? No, not usually. Muslims are supposed to pray 5 times a day. Do they? No, the vast majority don't bother. Christians are supposed not to wear clothing with mixed fabrics. Do they? Yes, all the time. If someone ticks the box saying they're part of one religion, that doesn't mean you can immediately infer everything about their character.When you see people saying \\"that's Islamophobic\\" (and thanks for giving no examples), is it usually because the people being accused of Islamophobia are generalising an entire group? I would think it probably is. Obviously rare exceptions exist, but in my limited personal experience most of the time when people are accused of that it's completely fair.Now, are there awful Muslims? Yes, same as any other group. Do some believe awful shit? Yes, same as any other group. Do we vilify the entire group because of the beliefs of actions of some minority? No, that would be stupid. Do we criticise bad ideas? Yes. Is it bigotry when we do? No, of course not.  I recommend you try talking to a Muslim. Your current view of Muslims is cartoonishly absurd, and completely detached from reality. It reads like all you know comes from Daily Mail comments and far-right political leaflets.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

The United States has been consistently behind the curve on essentially every human rights development in history, and while we have some decent protections against outright suppression and oppression, there's plenty of oppression that can happen outside of the letter of the law.Anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, OP is very wrong about the effects of Islam and shouldn't treat it as a monolith.

Now, depending on country, heritage and culture this can vary a lot - for example, most modern \\"Christians\\" in Europe are to large extend agnostic, they believe in the potential of an existing God, but refute large parts of the bible.

Western people have worshipped Christianity for centuries, it's obvious that you will find some origins of their values in the Bible. But most modern Western values that we cherish today came from Enlightenment teachings and through the outright rejection of religion. You can cherry pick verses from any holy book and claim how it advocates for peace and equality. Here are some from Islam:From the last sermon of Muhammad: \\"All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a White has no superiority over a Black nor a Black has any superiority over a White except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly.\\"Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:8) - \\"Do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness.\\"Surah An-Nisa (4:1): - \\"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women.\\"Religious people like to attribute everything to their holy teachings, but the truth has a lot more to do with modern history and geopolitics. One can easily imagine a parallel universe where a reformist Islamic population would have become what we consider modern and liberal today. And if the Western values of equality and justice were so deeply embedded in Christianity, where were those values during centuries of colonialism and slavery?","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

In 7 AD Arab colonization led to the indigenous Jewish population who remained after Roman diaspora being forced to convert to Islam and mixing with Arabs, the land was conquered and changed hands with many different groups for over a thousand years and in the 1800s after the ottoman empire was disbanded Jews and Christians mainly from Germany, Russia and England began immigration to the land. This was during the same time Egyptian immigration to Israel increased due to Egyptian's fleeing multiple revolts and military conscription as well as the building of the suez canal which brought in builders who came for the work and never left, this is why one of the most common name's in Palestine is al masari which means the Egyptian due to Egypt being the homeland of a estimated 1/3 of Palestinians.

In 1929 Muslim mobs killed over a hundred innocent people in the Hebron massacre where they went door to door killing civilians starting with a four year old boy and his father, after this tensions raised leading up to multiple bombings and knife attacks by Palestinians which were described in papers at the time as \\"Arabs attack Palestine\\" the reason being that until leader's of the PLO rebranded themselves as \\"Palestinian\\" the people in the region now known as \\"Palestinians\\" were proud of the origins as Arabs from the Arab peninsula and EgyptiansPalestinians previously distanced themselves from any connection to Israel because they didn't want to acknowledge that they weren't entirely Muslim Arab as they share 80% of the same DNA as Jews, the identity of \\"Palestinian\\" in the late 60s by the founder of the PLO was to both draw on public sympathy by piggybacking off civil rights movements at the time as well as making the connection to Israel palatable to Muslims who refused to acknowledge they had any connection to Jews, it allowed them to usurp the history of the Jewish people by claiming themselves as the indigenous people and to separate themselves portraying themselves as a distinct ethnic group and culture instead of Jewish/Arabic.In 1948 five Arab countries armed with the best weapons money could buy attacked a day old Israel which was under a arm's embargo at the time and still lost miserably.","title":"CMV: Defending or supporting Islam and Muslim people as a liberal is not progressive and is a case of tolerating intolerance.

But if your state is secular and wants to remain so, the community has to be managed and their leaders have to be given an in to the state to co opt them.

The second quote from 9:5 is also taken out of context, and apparently frequently so because the Wikipedia article points this out immediately by adding the further context.\\"The?Sword Verse?(Arabic:? ??,?romanized:?ayat as-sayf) is the fifth verse of the?ninth?surah?(at-Tawbah) of the?Quran[1][2]?(also written as 9:5). It is a Quranic verse widely cited by critics of Islam to suggest the faith promotes violence against pagans (polytheists,?mushrikun) by isolating the portion of the verse \\"kill the?polytheists?wherever you find them, capture them\\".[9:5] But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform?prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[Quran?9:5]The next verse, often excluded from quotes, appears to present a conditional reprieve:[9:6] And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection ?O Prophet?, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge.[Quran?9:6]Quranic exegetes?al-Baydawi?and?al-Alusi?explain that it refers to those pagan Arabs who violated their peace treaties by waging war against Muslims.[3][4\\"So that verse is refering to a specific time and a specific arrangement, and even still it is not refering to all non-believers as you have said but polytheists specifically.The verse you say encourages Muslims to \\"torture\\" homosexuals is translated on quran.com as \\"discipline,\\" not \\"torture.\\" This is still problematic but not uniquely so and a far cry from \\"torture.\\"Your other claims regarding pedophilia and slavery don't really source anything to refute, it's just conjecture.

It's not simply a ''game'' of some sorts, that would undermine the complexity that goes behind all this stuff of politics, but the panorama of politics is certainy less hostile than people believe it is.These are people at the end of the day, they have lives, they suffer and they enjoy. Basically... why fuck around? be a better friend to everyone included yourself. Obama laughing with Trump could actually be a good thing but that's not any of our concern either.Regarding Trump's past with his opposition, think people should sit a second and put themselves on the position of a president or a candidate, what is the best and most direct way to gain popularity? throw shit at someone of course, so that's why Trump does it. But that doesn't mean he really follows what he says completely, he might agree with some things his enemies propose. At the end of the day once all the campaign is done you are left with 2 guys, you and your rival... why keep fighting anyway? let's just have a laugh and enjoy the rest of the day because what else are we living for? No sense in keeping shit going like it's WW2 24/7.Actually I'd go as far as to say the people high there would be better with us believing it's just a ''game'', making people think these things are more complex than they are makes then shift their interest to something else, more simple, and decide based on meaningless facts that don't do a good job at convincing you wheter someone is really fit for the role of a president or not. After all, the well known despicable figure of a leader that we all known would always prefer a uneducated, pesimist and weak minded follower that obeys anything than a well suited and ingenious follower who could rebel if he saw something out of the rightful norm. In reality politics it's a very simple thing, though with a very complex base that takes to me to get the hang of, and one thing that EVERYONE should know to the point of mastering, the world moves by politics, and he who knows how the world moves, MOVES ALONG IT. If not, you're handpicked by the despot of turn to follow the trail he chooses you should follow. There's an excellent quote I know very well, which is one of my favorites ever and says:  \\n''Beware he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart, he dreams himself your master.''But of course this means nothing, only a basis to follow, after all unless we get up there we can't be so sure how things move in the world of the ''elite'' all we can do is either stay as good citizens in the name of democracy or work hard to get up there and choose by ourselves what the next step will be. If anything else I could be granted to say, then it will be a very personal note that doesn't have mcuh to do with this topic but still, it's one that anyone can read if they wish: I haven't made any enemies troughout my life that have really meant a pain in the ass to the point of hatred, yet I have had enmity with people I disagreed... But you gotta make the most out of that rivalry, take in account everything he has agaisn't you and everything you have agaisn't him and contribute to make of you two a better version of your former selves.

The whole reason why people lobby in the first place is because their elected officials aren't giving them the thing that they want.

However, when some interest groups are able to influence the vote due to financial pressure then the vote skews away from the public interest towards the perspective of the specific financial backer.

It proved definitively that we live in a post-truth society.

Trump and his ragtag bag of soft-brained-yet-hard-headed fascists will completely disregard the rule of law if theres even a hint that nobody will enforce it.And its officially been made clear, by the highest court in the land no less, that nobody will hold him legally accountable for any of his actions while he is president.

And now that we're seeing the economic damage that Reaganism and its legacy is causing, they're still just trying to make peace with it, and not rock the boat too much. The only ones who really even seem to be angry, as far as politicians, are a few isolated and outspoke progressive voices (such as Bernie Sanders and AOC), and Trump and his ilk.

It makes no fucking sense that she wants you to manage the finances completely but simultaneously has a problem with how youre doing it. *Why* does she feel that way? Are you putting her on some sort of shoestring allowance? If she doesn't want to worry about finances at all, she likely doesnt want to have to worry about what shes allowed to spendand she shouldnt. Its not *your* money. Its hers too.Figuring out finances as a couple can suck. Been there. I manage our finances, and what Ive found works in my household is: I pay all the bills and budget for all *household* expenses, spending, and savings goals (short-term stuff and *both* of our retirements). Anything left over is considered disposable income, and there are no rules about how that money can be spent by either of us.

Voters are dumb. Democracy is good in spite of its voters, not because of them, because they open the possibility for changing leadership when things get bad enough, but the average person just isn't gonna be able to discern all of the information we have at our disposal. It seems the idea at one point was that the main barrier to progress was a lack of information, that people simply didn't know better, and that the internet would solve this by allowing people to know *everything*, but I think the problem is a lot more deeply rooted and I don't think that's going away.That said liberal democracy is still the best option, or at least, the worst one except for the rest. It's a flexible set of principles that promotes inclusive institutions and gives us a non-violent method of removing bad leadership. Ebbs and flows and regressions in the long arc of history are inevitable because humans themselves are flawed. I think Western culture as a whole places too much focus on perfect systems when in reality humans are too messy for any kind of perfectionism. It's the fatal flaw of traditional conservatism, of fascism, and of communism. I've detected an impulse in this sub to treat liberalism as similarly monolithic, the status quo as something to be preserved at the expense of perhaps democracy itself, but I think that violates the flexibility that is liberalism's greatest strength, that as a matter of principles it draws the benefits of other ideologies and pasteurizes them into something more workable in favor of human freedom. We just have to keep fighting even if it'll be a rough road ahead.

They're not all ideological MAGA and in fact many of them voted for Obama and then Biden. Most people don't really pay attention to politics at all. There's also this underlying assumption that Trump is so detestable (which he is) that he *must* be easy to beat, but this doesn't have to be necessarily true for a lot of voters and this seems to break a lot of liberals' minds, since it goes against a core belief people in these spaces seem to have that most people have firm convictions about decency and democracy and all that when the reality is much more fickle. People will turn against liberalism's most sacred cows if they perceive them as not working for them, whether that perception is true or not is immaterial. The fact is that Trump is genuinely an enduring political figure and his repulsiveness is either not apparent to most voters or they don't seem to care at all, which is of course a problem, but one that liberals only seemed to start reckoning with after losing the popular vote this election.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"ghouls like debbie wasserman schultz are not getting enough blame","title":"Knives come out for the D.C. consultant class as Democrats search for a new leader"},{"text":"Prohibition is never the answer.","title":"President Biden just made a proposal to ban cigarettes on January 7th.

On top of that, even the initial estimate, which was admittedly way too low because they didn't have any designs yet, was around $33 billion. Why would you expect there to be a functioning rail system completed when they've spent less than 50% of the (initial) estimated budget? The track and systems need the guide-way to be finished before they can go in, it's not built mile by mile.But ignoring that, it's so easy to see that there's way more than 1600 feet of concrete in place. The Hanford Viaduct alone is over 6300 feet long and is closer to being finished than not https://buildhsr.com/project/hanford-viaduct/.

Standard level crossings aren't compatible with high speed rail, so they're investing heavily in grade separations. And because a significant portion of the route is near freight tracks, those grade separations are already benefiting communities by removing freight rail crossings. There are plenty of other examples, most notably the electrification of Caltrain, which was largely funded by CAHSR because they will be sharing tracks when CAHSR gets there.","title":"Governor Newsom quickly secures Major Disaster Declaration from President Biden for Los Angeles fires"},{"text":"Facts","title":"Biden calls Meta's decision to end fact-checking 'really shameful'"},{"text":"People think they wouldnt set LA on fire, though.","title":"Just imagine the laugh they all had after demolishing 3 Buildings in 1 Day and the majority buys the official story to this day..."},{"text":"Isn't California the state with the most stringent of environmental policies?And this is the result?","title":"Dem senator warns 'LA fires are preview of coming atrocities,' claims Trump bought off by 'Big Oil'"},{"text":"Yes, but sadly not everyone is as curious as you.

It will also prove him right."},{"text":"Now, let's take a moment to recognize some of Biden's achievements in office - His American Rescue Plan, which he campaigned on delivering, was estimated to have helped our country avoid a double digit recession early on in his presidency. And while it originally received bipartisan support and was popular at the time of its passing, Republicans later criticized Biden for it while taking credit for its positive outcomes.  - The plan also invested in child care. Which helped keep care providers open, lowered the cost of child care and increased pay for child care workers. It also invested in home and caregiver support services.  - Biden's agenda was more \\"America first\\" than anything Donald Trump delivered. - His policies were strongly pro union, and protected worker's overtime pay and pensions. He was the first president to show up on the picket line. Biden also championed legislation that ensured federal support for union jobs, construction projects, higher wages, collective bargaining and labor standards.- Under Biden's admin, the gender pay gap narrowed. His administration also targeted workplace discrimination and the PUMP Act provided workplace protections for pregnant and post-partum workers.- Biden's infrastructure agenda invested in rebuilding roads, highways, and bridges, in replacing hundreds of thousands of lead pipes, in expanding access to clean drinking water and high speed internet, and in electrifying  public transit.- It also funded tens of thousands of infrastructure projects nationwide. Many of these projects require that all manufactured goods and construction materials be made in America.- unfortunately, we won't see the benefit from these infrastructure projects right away, and while Republicans have lambasted Biden's infrastructure legislation, they have taken credit for many of the projects the bill has funded, while often showing up to things like tape cutting ceremonies.- Biden's CHIPS and Science Act invested in the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, in workforce advancement and training, and in chips research and development. As a result, the US is expected to produce a substantially greater global supply of chips over the next decade.- The Biden administration has helped lower the cost of prescription drugs and insurance premiums for those on public healthcare and pushed for the negotiating of lower prices on prescription drugs for the disabled and seniors. Those enrolled in Medicare will have their insulin costs capped at $35. Unless Republicans have something to say about it.- Republicans aren't happy about the Biden administration's investment in climate initiatives. Measures like the Inflation Reduction Act cut pollution, and invest in US clean energy manufacturing. These laws provide Americans with consumer tax credits on clean energy technologies, and have helped create hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. - Biden signed an executive order that enforces the Buy American Act, which forces the prioritizing of domestic manufacturing.- Under Biden, small businesses in the US boomed. Almost 20 million new businesses filled out applications, which is a near record and a higher number than prior to the pandemic.- The Biden admin helped to implement a corporate minimum tax and a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.- although it may seem contentious, especially to Republicans, the Biden Administration provided more funding to the IRS so they could crack down on wealthy tax cheats. They've since collected billions in unpaid taxes from the wealthy.- And yes, believe it or not, under the Biden administration, the US saw one of the strongest economic recoveries in the world.- Last year, the US reached one of the lowest rates of violent crime in recent history, while murder rates decreased sharply.","title":"Only 22% of voters believe Biden kept his promises in office, poll shows"},{"text":"Biden gets a bad rap, and while some criticism directed at his administration is warranted, especially when it comes to his admin's communication problems and some policies that were a bit out of touch with liberal voters, Biden achieved *some* things while in office, while some of the benefits won't be felt for years to come. (See my reply for more information)I mean, my biggest criticism of Biden was his decision to run for a second term, this put Democrats in a tough spot, and this decision, in no small part, contributed to a Trump victory.I want to recognize however, that not only was Biden stuck between a rock and a hard place when he first stepped foot into office, and thanks in part to the failures of the previous administration, as well as the economic and political fallout from the pandemic, but over the past 4 years, a portion of the American electorate have been far more concerned about their immediate circumstances than any messaging emphasizing some of Biden's successes, as well as Trump's inadequacy.And this is especially true as propaganda and misinformation continue to dominate the \\"news cycle\\" while receiving far more engagement on social media platforms than anything resembling nuanced or informed points of view... And these are platforms, mind you, where an increasing number of people are getting their \\"news\\" and information.At any rate, if Biden can put up some roadblocks, there may be a thin silver lining here in the fact that he will be sandwiched in between two Trump terms. BUT, he'll most likely be remembered more for ushering in a second Trump presidency. And this is underscored by the fact that the Trump/MAGA coalition has had four years to prepare an agenda that will bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level government, and pave the way for Republicans to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.That being said, Americans should understand that, no matter who won in 2020, it was always going to be an uphill battle.Inflationary issues, economic fallout from the pandemic, foreign conflicts, increased immigration, all of these things would have still occurred under a consecutive Trump presidency. (If you're skeptical about that last one, remember that there was a massive slowdown in immigration due to the pandemic, and subsequent migration/asylum restrictions, creating a backlog of border crossings that extended into Biden's term). And judging by Trump's previous economic and foreign policy record, which was disastrous mind you, it's very likely that some of these issues would have been made worse by another Trump term.However, precisely because Biden is sandwiched between two Trump terms, his admin can be scapegoated by Republicans for any and all problems that may arise over the next four years. Whereas, if Trump won in 2020, Republicans would have, realistically, no one to blame but themselves.What's really unnerving is the fact that Donald Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. He'll take credit for everything he can take credit for, and he'll blame others for everything he can avoid taking responsibility for.History is repeating itself. At the end of the last two Republican administrations, an economic crisis emerged, both times a Democrat stepped into office and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. And in the midst of this fallout, Republicans took advantage of the opportunity to turn crisis into campaign talking points, choosing to divide Americans during this time of crisis, escalating their culture wars and focusing their message on scapegoats instead of pushing for solutions.Donald Trump claims he's inheriting a mess, but in reality,  It was Trump who left a mess for Biden.Donald Trump rode the coattails of a growing economy under Obama, until of course a real challenge emerged, which he mishandled at nearly every turn, leaving office in 2020 with the economy in tatters.What's more:Under Trump the national debt exploded.Under Trump Republicans passed tax cuts legislation that permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations, legislation that is estimated to cost the government trillions. During his first presidency, Trump instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. While his tariff proposals for his next administration are estimated to be far more economically damaging for most Americans. While he was president, Trump pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize, weakened labor regulations and protections, reduced overtime pay eligibility, and implemented policies that generally favored employers over employees, taking power away from unions. Trump not only mishandled the pandemic, but was responsible, in no small part, for encouraging Republicans to politicize every aspect of COVID. The culture wars that ensued divided Americans during another crisis.It can't be emphasized enough that all of these things and more contributed to economic issues that extended into the Biden administration.In terms of his foreign policy, and I'll have to make this as brief as I can, he also cozied up to the world's autocrats and dictators, and escalated conflicts in multiple theaters. In fact, during Trump's presidency, Congress had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions due to Trump's dangerous interventionism and his actions that directly led to increased provocations in multiple foreign regions. Trump weakened our alliances, emboldened our enemies, withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, abandoned our Kurdish allies, aided the Kremlin agenda and Russian proxy wars, sought to weaken NATO and rescind Russian sanctions, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, crippled our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians, made allies with the Saudi crown Prince and intervened in his violent war in Yemen. Trump literally negotiated with terrorists, caved into the Taliban's pressures, made concessions that were dubious at best, and provided no Afghanistan withdrawal or evacuation plan for the next administration. And this doesn't even scratch the surface. Unfortunately, the fallout from all of this will be blamed on Biden in perpetuity, but ironically, if it were not for Biden winning in 2020, the outcomes under Trump would have been far far worse. That's the silver lining here I suppose, and maybe, considering everything, it's thinner than I imagined.It's a shame that such a large percentage of the American electorate does not make politically informed decisions, that they care more about their immediate circumstances than knowing anything I've mentioned previously about Trump's record.The general public, quite frankly, is an irrational force. Americans aren't making politically informed decisions, instead, they're letting their feelings decide the outcome of our elections, and that's what got Trump elected, *feelings.*Since there aren't enough characters left in this Reddit post to comment on Biden's record, I will reply to this comment with a list of some of Biden's achievements that deserve recognition","title":"Only 22% of voters believe Biden kept his promises in office, poll shows"},{"text":"Their performative cruelty is so disgusting.

I'm realizing in this conversation that it's flawed to not separate them as lobbying is a broad term. I appreciate that. Is there a term for what I'm referring to specifically? The pharmaceutical industry worked closely with the government on developing the Covid 19 vaccine. They provided insight into the regulatory and manufacturing process. This got it developed and approved more quickly and saved lives.This seems like the government reaching out to them more so than them lobbying the government, isn't it? Or am I misunderstanding?I could go over countless examples. People in industries tend to know the most about those industries. Coffee brewers know about coffee. Farmers know about farming. Car manufacturers know about manufacturing cars.Doesn't mean they offer that information up for he good of those outside of it. Ok, so are you against people working in an industry lobbying as well then? You seem to be saying the doctors are also too corrupted by money to be trusted with talking with legislators about medical regulations?As a whole no. Some? Certainly. It depends on the basis of their argument. Like who are the people with pure motives and sufficient knowledge that you want talking with legislators?People whose arguments are not based on profit. If the motivation for what is being pushed boils down to simply making money, I'd personally disregard them, but realistically, I'd want them taken with a bottle of salt. Are you fine with companies lobbying but not donating to legislators? More so than I am with the actions combined, but I'd still personally dislike it. Realistically, they deserve to be heard on the same level as anyone else tho. So again, I'd go back to seeing what their argument actually is. Nuance would be needed. And private citizens and non-profits donate to legislators, too. Should they not be allowed to lobby if they also donate?Gut reaction, no. Thinking about it a bit more, I do wonder how the average person would get their reason for donating across, but as it can be abused, probably not. Would you agree that just because profit-seeking is not present does not mean that the groups are highly altruistic?Completely agree.","title":"CMV: corporate lobbying should be a heavily restricted activity and corporations should have no say in politics."},{"text":"The Germans are genuinely bad at guilt.

In general I disagree with the expansive bounds of American speech protections, especially in considering corporations to have speech protections. Giving money to causes is fine but regular people dont have the ability to give a million dollars to a super pac. Legal and illegal are not the same as something being definitionally true. The courts could rule that the sky is red but that cannot make it true. Similarly I do believe that corporations spending money to influence politicians is bribery definitionally no matter what legal justification is used.I think we may just be coming from a set of ideas that is too different. I am most fundamentally concerned with restricting the actions of corporations so that they do not have abilities above what citizens have access to. I think that a big part of this is restricting their ability to spend money in politics. Theyre free to hire people and write letters like the rest of us but they have funds that can never be reasonably matched by the public. To fix this imbalance we have to restrict their ability to spend money on influence. I also dont think that businesses having shareholders is a good counter to this. They as people are already represented by their actual representatives who they are free to elect to support their interests. If their businesses arent good enough to provide value to society at large and therefore be valued by society at large, then they should simply die in the marketplace of ideas instead of living on by giving money to politicians.","title":"CMV: corporate lobbying should be a heavily restricted activity and corporations should have no say in politics."},{"text":"Wow war bad.","title":"Why is Biden making sure to escalate the Ukraine war right before Trump takes office?

That's because all of your donors know that while it is popular to campaign on these things, actually implementing most of them would be destructive to their businesses, especially pharmaceutical industries. What liberals actually end up doing is regulation. The good thing about regulation for an already established business is that regulations act as barriers to entry which discourage competition. People who already own most of an industry hate competition and greedily hold into their market share. Republicans, as well as Elon, are anti-regulation. The oligarchy is being created by using regulation to entrenched and protect large donors to the Democrat party, and they continue to be large donors so the democrats can continue to outspend Republicans. Elon is collaborating openly with Trump. Democrats do it with their donors behind closed doors and you have no suspicion of that because you are biased and refuse to admit it to yourself and reevaluate.

Even if it would be better to not put in additional barriers, they'll support those additional barriers to reduce competition for their jobs.This is an argument for profit still. Instead of for the medical industry as a whole, it's seeking decreased competition and further salary negotiating power through  greater entry barriers. Also, what about independent workers? They are profit driven as well, aren't they? So would you say they shouldn't have a say? Like a doctor who runs a private practice shouldn't have a say while doctors who work for someone else should have a say?My personal stance is the doctor running a private practice would be less likely to make decisions for themselves. They obviously can't be kept out. Their take could be argued to have less value to the whole of society tho. I thought we were talking about \\"lobbying\\"? Lobbying is not about financial contributions to legislators. It's about having direct face-to-face contact with legislators. It usually is just a collection of people hiring someone to make their case to \\"the people who make the decision\\". Not paying \\"the people who make the decision\\".Lobbying of some form is unavoidable in any political system yea? So to elaborate my main issue is the fact that organizations that are lobbying often donate money to the campaign of people making decisions in order to influence them. I'm against for profit lobbying as I believe they're (people driven by profit) the main contributors to this practice.

No.But they have different incentives that can dis-align them from everyone else's interest just like with profit-seeking groups.

Even if it would be better to not put in additional barriers, they'll support those additional barriers to reduce competition for their jobs.Also, what about independent workers? They are profit driven as well, aren't they? So would you say they shouldn't have a say? Like a doctor who runs a private practice shouldn't have a say while doctors who work for someone else should have a say?\\\\And they can make those arguments like any other and be considered without providing financial contributions to the people who make the decision, can they not?I thought we were talking about \\"lobbying\\"? Lobbying is not about financial contributions to legislators. It's about having direct face-to-face contact with legislators. It usually is just a collection of people hiring someone to make their case to \\"the people who make the decision\\". Not paying \\"the people who make the decision\\".I'm saying that legislators need to meet with representatives of groups. They can't meet with everyone in that group. And not everyone's input is equal (Facebook mom's views on vaccines are not as valuable as a doctor's view on them).

Rather a large omission.   Today's lesson: Don't marry feminists.  They make terrible wives and worse mothers.  Not always, but usually.Original reply for posterity:Do NOT under any circumstances have kids until things are working properly in the relationship.  If she wants to proceed, you will have to be in charge of birth control.I respect my wife and her rights as a strong womanThat sounds like code for letting her veto your decisions.  That isn't going to work.  She isn't a traditional woman, but you seem to be giving her the privileges of one.  Untraditional women have to work.  So should she - she's not a mother.  It's a cardinal mistake to give people the spoils before they've earned them.  That's universally true for everyone.This is the last chance to assert and enforce proper boundaries and proper behavior.  And yes, there must be consequences for breaking those boundaries.  She may rise to the occasion, or she may not.  That's not up to you.  Your job is to make the rules and enforce them.  But if you don't, you will be saddled with a miserable life, probably a divorce with kids.You only get one life, better make it worth it.  Depending on your state (look it up) you could be on the line for alimony, especially if she doesn't work.  She'll probably hold out 10 years so she gets the long-term cash and prizes.  You'll definitely get hit with child support too.  Look up how much it will cost.  See what you'll be left with, then go looking for apartments big enough for kids to live in 50% of the time with that money while paying utilities, food, etc.There are two types of people in this world:  Those who blunder into things and hope it works out for the best, and those who assess it beforehand and have the courage to act in advance to avoid a catastrophe.  As bad as putting your marriage on the line and risking it now looks, you have no comprehension how bad it gets if you delay and get it wrong, then are compelled to deal with it later.You are allowed to have boundaries too, and enforce them.  Do not give any free passes on transgressions.Problems that exist now get amplified later.  This should be the easiest time of your life.

Who decides what reasons are valid and which teeter too closely to wanting more money? Why is profit seemingly the only factor being used to evaluate whether or not lobbying is moral?Other interests are often served in the pursuit of profit, as well. If I want to buy a piece of unused federal land in an economically depressed area to build a factory on, I might have to lobby the government for permission to do so.

Enough said.That wasn't ad hominem. I'm pointing out that your post is not compatible with the reality of who the candidates are. As such, it comes off as if it was written by someone who is unaware of their ideologies. Second paragraph: theyre certain to not go full Sanders bc even Sanders has largely given up on the fight after decades of appealing to a party that has only moved further since he entered politics.The Democrats have certainly not moved 'further right' since he joined the party. At no point has Sanders been the norm for the party. You also need to accept that Sanders policies are not at the point where they are broadly accepted yet. The electorate still does not accept socialism as a viable way to run the country and the economy. If it was, those candidates would be winning no matter how hard the DNC was 'rigging' things. klobuchar is also one of those rhetorically progressive, practically moderate (right wing) politicians, as her record shows.Just not even true: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/amy_klobuchar/412242 Pushing for Warren says nothing considering Sanders was already there &amp; her ultimate betrayal in 2020 solidified the death of any hope of a left wing movement within the Democrat party.He was pushing for her in 2016, not in 2020. So this 'betrayal' of Bernie is irrelevant. It also does not mean that he wasn't pushing for a progressive candidate over an establishment candidate. Which is exactly what you are advocating for.  Fourth: already addressed, money is pointless if the politics suck and/or are just moderated views of your opponent, as Harris found out, as Clinton found out.Money is not 'pointless.' Just because it's not an autowin does not mean that fundraising isn't important. You aren't going to run ads, book rallies, travel the country, pay staff, etc on good vibes. Fifth: its nice rhetoric, but until there are arguments over ideology, any strategy will be undermined by the fact capital will always default to supporting their best ally, who is the GOP, &amp; any strategy that maintains the ideology weve seen will not solve our problems in any serious way. Our problems are not just about winning but about the system we live under. If youre not discussing ideology then like you just end up with more Fettermans, more Manchins, more Sinemas. Its not a solution, just feel good rhetoric.So, in one breath you say that money (capital) is irrelevant because it doesn't win elections. As demonstrated by Harris having more of it, meaning that capital backed her. Presumably because you believe she would only uphold the status quo which is good for capitalists. And then you suggest that capital will always back the GOP because it is beneficial to them. So, which is it? Are the Dems beholden to corporate interests because corporate interests back them or is the GOP the party that capital will always back?Additionally, discussing ideology is not solely the role of the DNC Chair, nor is it the sole role of the DNC Chair. The DNC Chair is mostly focused on the mechanics of the organization rather than deciding the policy. Of course these two things can go hand-in-hand but of course these candidates are going to focus on how they are going to run the party rather than deciding on a policy platform before Trump even takes office.Additionally, both of these candidates represent change from the previous chair who is, in fact, an ex-lobbyist. I agree that the Democrats need to regroup, they need to embrace more economically left policies that benefit the working class, they obviously need change. However, this DNC Chair 'election' isn't really indicative of them **not** doing that.","title":"Little daylight between the candidates hoping to lead Democrats out of the wilderness"},{"text":"First amendment You know, numero unoCongress shall make no law ... abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances","title":"CMV: corporate lobbying should be a heavily restricted activity and corporations should have no say in politics."},{"text":"I think it's less about conservative democrats and accepting the fact that progressives deserve a seat on the table.

But it wasnt always that way, political machines were originally based on voter turnout and personal favors, not money. Being able to mobilize and turn out voters gave you clout, the more you could turn out, the more clout you had. So Joe Shmo who was the head of the local VFW hall could turn out 50 votes, he was the bottom rung in the ladder for a regional guy named Bobby Mozarella who had connections to 6 VFWs, 4 masonic lodges, and 20 union local chapters, next came state senator Billy Blow who had Bobby Mozzarella and 6 other guys like him, etc etc etc. The machine was about patronage, Joe agreed to get Bobby his votes in exchange for Bobby gettong Joes brother a job on the water commission, Bobby would pledge votes to Billy in exchange for Billy pushing through legislation to build a bridge or tunnel which Bobbys union buddies would gst to work on, and which Bobbys cousins company would bid on the contract for, etc. etc.At the end of the day, people made money on it, but what was being bartered and traded wasnt money, it was favors, opportunities, and access. Somewhere along the way, folks figured out that they could make a lot more money more easily through fundraising than by trading favors for votes, as those raising the funds could just skim off the top and set up circular economies where they raised money through a PAC from which they collected a paycheck, then spend the PAC dollars on advertising or oppo research at a firm that they or their friends also owned, so all the money went right back into their pockets, etc. so the focus became on who could bring in more campaign dollars more than it was about voters. That worked because there has traditionally been a strong correlation between fundraising/spending and electoral outcomes, the assumption has been that more money = more advertising = more votes, but over the past decade or so that correlation has started breaking down and its become clear that the correlation was at least in part due to a relationship opposite of what was previously believed - the funds were being raised as a result of enthusiasm for a candidate, more enthusiasm meant more votes and more dollars, the money wasnt actually moving the needle much itself. Over the past couple years the correlation has basically broken entirely due to the wealth disparity between the elite and the average voter, 80% of the funds raised are coming from the bank accounts of a handful of really ruch assholes who are using election fundraising as a way to make themselves richer - the money = votes concept was just a circumstantial illusion.","title":"Democrats need to fix their own shit before they can fix America"},{"text":"Ive been calling the Republicans who supplicated themselves to Trump Vichy Republicans for 10 years and nobody has ever gotten it","title":"Vichy Democrats Take Note: The GOP Is Coming for Everything"},{"text":"Lobbying is just talking to your elected representatives about a topic you care about.

In 1.5 books, Jesus ascends to Heaven, body and soul. The 0.5 is because one book has both endings, labeled \\"Alternative Ending\\", one where Jesus ascends, and one where he doesn't.   So, Jesus is alive at the end of his story; he rose from the dead, and remained risen (alive). But no one else thinks so. So, why is there a storyline where he died and remained so, true death.

A Representative or Senator has limited time in the week, and limited staff time.  When something comes up for consideration in Congress it is normal (almost universal) for the Member of Congress to have little background on the subject.  How is he or she supposed to learn and make an educated vote? Interest groups will solicit their support as well as give them resources and will either present (or can be asked to) their case for their position.  If a company wants privatization or reduced capital gains tax or whatever, they can present evidence that supports their belief and a compelling case for why/how it will improve whatever they think improving that will help.   Example: if capital gains tax is cut to 10% instead of 20% investors will invest more in start ups and the kind of companies that yield high growth rate and it will help the economy.  Another corporation may oppose (Google doesnt give capital stock for most of their employees) and they will advocate against the tax cut, and the Representative will give that data his/her consideration before voting.  Even spending cuts, the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget could do an analysis on savings, and a company that stands to make millions by taking over something the government does can put their evidence together to show how its cost effective.  Another company may do the same and counter it and say their cost is actually not calculated properly.  This can be EXTREMELY valuable for the member of Congress.  While their motivations might be as sinister as you describe, ultimately the Representative is the one elected, and can weigh that out and see the arguments and decide if it has merit.  Then they can have town hall meetings with the data and evidence on both sides (from lobby groups) and ask their constituents, and you can still have the power in the people. The problem I see now is lobbyists arent as concerned with making the case to the member of Congress.  They make the case with campaign contributions.  And donations.  And instead will make demands instead of making convincing arguments that something is a net good. When we end up counting up Congress and it turns out more from a party supported a position and therefore it was partisan, I would like Representatives to be asked why their party or a majority of members of their party opposed something.  ENFORCE the mantra Republicans liked to adopt good policy is good politics.  Remove the direct benefit to THEM and Representatives and lobbyists will see it work better and you can call them out on why something that appears good in fact isnt or make the argument why it is.","title":"CMV: corporate lobbying should be a heavily restricted activity and corporations should have no say in politics."},{"text":"(*And of course, none of this should be interpreted as an attack on Bernie or Feinstein - my issue is with how people treated the entire situation).*Agreed - Im not here to attack Democrats.

So the NAACP, AARP, ACLU, NRA, and a million other organizations shouldn't be able to call up representatives and say that a policy is bad because of XYZ reason? They shouldn't be able to rate politicians on scorecards or do any thing else to try to sway the government. You're view is outrageously broad and not something that you probably believe.Two important pieces of context. 1. A corporation is anything that can sue or be sued and isn't an actual human person. Now we generally associate various rights and responsibilities to corporations, but at their core this is what they are. They are \\"legal persons\\" in the sense that they exist as separate entities for the purpose of law suits. That means, among other things, most non profits and political advocacy groups are also corporations.  \\n2. Lobbying is incredibly broad. For example, Merriam Webster defines it as aimed at influencing public officials and especially members of a legislative body on legislation.\\" Different states have different definitions of lobbying (and lobbyist) for the purpose of regulation, some are more narrow than others. For example, Florida requires that you try and influence outcomes through written communication. Either way, it includes many things including writing the NRA or ACLU writing a letter to a Congress person saying that they think a law should not be passed.Given that information, your view requires that political advocacy organizations should be heavily restricted from attempting to influence public officials or at least influence them by talking to them or writing them letters. That's a pretty clear free speech and freedom of association issue, and probably not what you actually think (given that it isn't supported by most of your explanation)  \\nNow there are two main ways you can limit you're stated view to more clearly match your reasoning. First you can limit to for profit corporations, or at least corporations whose main goal is not political advocacy. Second is instead of limiting \\"lobbying\\" in general, put limit on monetary contributions.
