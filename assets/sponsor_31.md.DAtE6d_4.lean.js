There's even a mosque right next to the largest LGBTQ street here. Nothing has happened, we coexist. I know a lot of people who do things against my religion and I don't care.Speaking of Jewish people, Islam and Judaism have a lot in common in terms scripture and dietary laws. The thing is, we're against hatred of Jewish people and Judaism. But Israel... When people mix Jews/Judaism with Israel and hide behind that to whitewash or deflect from the crimes of the Israeli state, that's when we have a problem. Ever since October 7, my local mosque has had a swastika painted on it, people proclaiming to be Jewish people have targeted Muslims physically and verbally here.

Are we forgetting the West's history of colonization and imperialism?because of their (depending on the school) strict religious legislation on the behavior of women, going as far as women not being allowed to talk to any people outside,This is false. My mom immigrated here and she took English classes and now speaks English very well. But also, with the rise of the Internet, it's easier to learn any language.Many also oppose the legitimacy of a secular state and even oppose democracy in general, because it doesn't follow the ruling of their religion, which emphasizes that only muslim scholars should rule the stateAlso false. Islam says to follow the law of the land.but simply my own experience in clubs and bars in cologne (the city I live in), the vast majority of fights I've seen happen, have been started by turkish or arab people.The thing is, if they were actually practising Muslims, they wouldn't be in such places in the first place. But also, that environment is notorious for people misbehaving because of drugs, alcohol, etc. It's not a Muslim only issue. Go to England and see how rowdy the native brits act in clubs, bars, football matches. You can't complain that Muslims aren't compromising when those same Muslims aren't following their religious principles by going to bars and clubs, drinking and doing drugs, etc. \\n familieshttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/staggering-cost-nhs-alcohol-abuse-reporthttps://www.thenextchapter.org.uk/news/euro2024\\nI've seen lots of domestic violence in muslimNot exclusive to Muslim families.and parents straight up abondening and abusing their children if they turned out to be homosexual or didn't follow religious rulings.This isn't exclusive to Muslims either. I've seen a ton of non-Muslim families do the same when their kid converted to Islam.Edit: I forgot to add. The German government and police have been notorious for cracking down on peaceful Palestinian protesters. Even flying a Palestinian flag or wearing a kiffiyeh is considered a crime/supporting terrorism. I get it, the Germans feel guilty for the Holocaust, but the answer to that isn't to allow Israel to do whatever they want and also curtail any pushback to that in Germany. Germany is also the second largest  arms exporter to Israel. Those arms are going towards murdering kids. Israel is ironically creating more refugees and also sowing hatred between different groups in Germany. Also, doner kebab, one of Germany's most favorite street foods, was brought over by Turkish Muslim immigrants.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"I'm glad.

Often they're symptoms of something that is undesirable for all sorts of reasons: lack of training/education in sought after fields, aging population, a bubble in some sector. Saying labor shortages are a good thing seems to imply that we should seek to create them, but I'm curious what non-harmful process you feel would cause this.More fundamentally though, a disequilibrium is not typically a source of real, sustained improvement. A labor *shortage* implies that there is some value that the labor provides, but as a society we need to sink *more* than that value into attracting labor toward it - temporarily. If we take your best-case scenario, that all the resources simply come straight out of profit - then this would simply be a signal *not* to create more businesses and jobs in that sector. The shortage could simply lower the demand for labor toward the real supply. If you still want to label this a labor shortage, implying that *society* actually wants more of that labor but it is temporarily unavailable, then all the labor shortage represents is an unmet societal want/need.Take an example like a teacher shortage or nursing shortage - jobs we place a positive moral weight on. You can say it's a good thing, because it might cause teacher/nurse wages to rise, and draw more people into those fields, but this is a bit of a broken window fallacy. The shortage necessitates that something went wrong in the first place - and as long as the shortage persists, education and healthcare suffer for it. It would be better to draw those additional workers in *quickly*, and even better to never have the shortage in the first place. The costs of the disequilibrium are paid by everyone, monetarily and in outcomes.As far the idea that shortages are a positive way to increase real wages - try extending this logic across the entire economy. The problem is that prices and wages are both *relative* measurements, and represent *opportunity* *costs* between mutually exclusive alternatives. If customers are demanding relatively higher labor in one sector, their demand is shrinking in another (unless we're inflating the money supply). Reallocating labor and capital toward what people want is the never-ending process of the market, but we never claim that large shortages or surpluses are a *good* thing to be maximized. They're temporary shocks that should ideally be minimized, because as long as they persist we create deadweight loss, and are *not* allocating resources well.","title":"CMV: Labour 'shortages' are a good thing"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/zsumq0qwulxd1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bedd96b01dfad8a517f53e77a3d2384aa0a2abf6","title":"The gop are running ridiculous ads against democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown.

Not based on statistics, but simply my own experience in clubs and bars You do see the irony in this? You claim muslims don't compromise with other cultures... and follow up with your experience with muslims in bars and clubs.Additionally, acceptance of LGBT has a correlation with education. You'll find that more traditional, less educated people tend to have stronger conservative views on this topic. Conversely, at least in the USA, [states with larger shares of college graduates were associated with higher acceptance towards gay men and lesbians](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00380253.2023.2189465), including amongst those who did not have college degreesImmigrants usually come from asian countries which were either royally fucked since all the shit in the middle east, or royally fucked by colonisation. The conservative culture there also has some roots in anti western ideas. In India for example, you'll frequently see real problems dismissed as 'western liberal problems'. This anti west sentiment has separate reasons, but I'm sure it'll take just a few seconds to get it.Also also, muslim beliefs are dictated by at least 3 things in their lives. First, their family, secondly, their culture, and thirdly, the scholar they listen to. I list the scholar last since more often than not, people end up searching the internet far and wide just to find someone who agrees with them, no matter how insane.The major factors are cultural, and you can see that again if you compare their behaviour with that of other people in their country. The blame then, falls on the countries and cultures themselves and part of the reasoning there can be attributed to the anti west sentiment I mentioned above, and the education issues.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"They are looking for way for cost cutting and laying off people as a result.

But I can tell you that in a more Christian country like the USA, even in the more progressive and atheist areas, you still meet plenty of people who will look you in the eyes and tell you that you're going to hell unless you repent and swear your soul to Jesus. And in the highly conservative and devout communities, there's so much authoritarianism and bigotry and violence. After all, the bible says stuff like \\"Wives, submit to your husbands\\", and \\"Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death\\", and \\"Obey your leaders and submit to them\\". I've known far too many people who were beaten or thrown out by their parents for stuff like being gay or questioning their religion. Meamwhile, did you known that charity is literally one of the Five Pillars of Islam? There are special rules dictating minimum charity amounts based on wealth, and all Muslims are expected to give alms every year. And the word \\"Jihad\\", which literally means \\"struggle\\" or \\"strive\\", has a variety of uses in Islamic historicsl and cultural context, including personal internal struggle, standing up against tyranny, practicing faith despite opposition, and a system of checks and balances between different Muslim religious groups. \\"Holy war\\" is just one way of interpreting it, which many denominations strongly disagree with. The Quran also explicitly says \\"Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression\\" and \\"Let there be no compulsion in religion\\", and many other exhortations towards peace. But plenty of people ignore that as easily as plenty of Christians ignore \\"Love thy neighbor\\" and \\"Turn the other cheek\\".","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/zoe2hlcgulxd1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d65b43e920fefd721194009363bfd02f58828a58","title":"The gop are running ridiculous ads against democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown.

This is really just a difference in how Democrats and Republicans work culturally.  Which is a fascinating thing from a marketing perspective.  Republicans, for whatever reason (no judgements), tend towards a hero-worship of their political appointees.  You can see it as recently as the 2024 biopic of Ronald Reagan, which completely ignores large swaths of his incredibly controversial and divisive years as a public figure in favor of presenting him as a near prescient figure in modern history that saved the world from total destruction.  Democrats, for whatever reason (and, again, no judgement) tend to be more cynical.  They see their political appointees as human and fallible, and will be quick to point out any shortcomings.When candidates, especially presidential candidates, present their platforms, this divide becomes incredibly clear.  The Republicans look at someone like Trump and say, this person is pushing our country in the right direction.  The Democrats look at someone like Biden and say, this person isn't doing enough for our country.The last super clear delimitation that I can think of is the 2008 financial crash.  This led to 2 very influential camps: the Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street.  Arguably, these 2 camps had basically the same goal, to put more power into the hands of everyday people and to distribute wealth among the people.  But the way they went about it in messaging and the way they believed it should be done was so divisive that it led to infighting that ultimately resulted in the status quo.","title":"CMV: Whoever loses the presidential election, controls the culture"},{"text":"They would have been happy to continue propping up dementia-addled Biden with some strings and a big stick but he publicly humiliated himself beyond repair.

On the other hand, right wing parties, some which can be considered far-right, as they support policies which were until recently considered wrong and controversial are gaining ground.In my humble opinion, alot of these new right wing supporters were, not so long ago, supporters of liberal policies and ideologies, but have disengaged completely from the liberal left because they've failed to find nice and respectful conversations with strong and unashamed groups/individuals that claim to represent the liberal left.I even believe many of these disengaged voters will prefer to elect radical right wing politicians simply because they are that much disillusioned of the liberal left.

The whole thing failed catastrophically.

Tulsi and RFK amassed their own followers of disaffected Democrats.A Kennedy(who reached up to 20% in some national polls during this very cycle) endorsing a Republican is bound to be much more influential than Cheney and Bush endorsing a Democrat. The Cheneys and Bushs of US politics have undermined the voters too many times for them to have any tangible following these days. DC is a cesspool of networking individuals who will switch the color of their tie depending on the best job offer. Its really not crazy to see them switch sides; I mean, theres a former Obama WH advisor who shows up on Fox News just to stump for Trump whenever a Dem talking point is discussed. My money is on the people who have more recently secured ballot signatures having a greater impact than the people who were forced out of politics in disgrace nearly 20 years ago for their universally hated policies. Harris might have a longer list of former Republicans endorsing her than Trump has Democrats, but the number of endorsements isnt what matters, its the amount of voters those endorsements encourage and mobilize. Kennedys ~100,000 nationwide volunteers are likely to sway more voters than a washed up Congresswoman(Cheney) who lost her reelection campaign **in the primary** by a 37% margin. For additional context, practically every Republican you mentioned endorsed Cheney in that race, so I struggle to see where the payoff is for Harris here. These people very clearly do not appeal to Republican voters. The possibility is there, and it will continue to be there until we see the final results on election night, but my personal view is that people like Kennedy, Gabbard, and Musk are simply more popular/appealing than people like Cheney, Kinzinger, Flake, etc. As an Independent, Im not happy with the fact that one of these two will end up as President, but I must admit, the chaos is a bit entertaining(at least if I tune out the feelings of dread and terror).

The way to get the most votes is to win over the most *voters*.How do you know what the voters want? By looking at old elections. If the voters wanted Democrats and you are a Republican, you move toward Democrats to sweep up those in the middle. If the voters wanted Republicans and you are a Democrat, you move toward Republicans to sweep up those in the middle. For example, in the FDR era when Democrats were heavily favored, many Republicans signed onto New Deal legislation to keep their power. Richard Nixon signed onto many Democratic policies.Then the pendulum swung: people who bothered to vote favored Republicans (minus skew and cheating again). After 1994 when Republicans swept the Congress, Democrats moved toward Republicans often signing onto the Republican agenda.So you have it backwards: If we *don't* tolerate the lesser evil, we can never get to the greater good.

Biden waited in line to make his choice official at the Department of Elections office near his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The president chatted up the people standing in line as he waited his turn. After casting his vote, he shook hands with few voters and posed for a photo. When asked if the experience had been bittersweet, he said it was just sweet. Biden said he was dismayed at former President Donald Trumps Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. The event was marked by racist comments and vitriol by multiple speakers. Comedian Tony Hinchliffe, one of the featured speakers, called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage and talked about carving watermelons with a Black friend. Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent and the Democratic presidential nominee, a \\"very low IQ individual.\\" It was simply embarrassing, beneath any president, but that's what we're getting used to, Biden said. That's why the election is so important. Presidential scholars often point to a presidents character as the single most consequential thing, he said. Before casting his vote, Biden had an almost two-hour long breakfast with Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester in New Castle. Rochester became the first woman and first African American to represent Delaware in Congress when she was elected in 2016. With just eight days to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, Biden said he planned to campaign for Harris in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the coming days.","title":"Biden votes early, calls Trump's NYC rally 'simply embarrassing'"},{"text":"Damn I wish Mark Hamill was still doing these\\n \\nhttps://youtu.be/SLS2D_UREQE?si=FBczkPbpswCQk28q  https://youtu.be/yFpq3-GtnJQ?si=RyM5F65SFBX37eGa","title":"\\"Always so nice and respectful\\" Trump hints at seeking retribution against Michelle Obama "},{"text":"The main thing I'm paying attention to with the early votes that are coming in isn't demographics but honestly just the sheer count.

First of all, what are these fundamental Muslims you're meeting doing in clubs? Also, they don't integrate? Sounds to me like they're doing that just fine. Using anecdotal evidence instead of statistics should already worry you of how biased you may be. And claiming \\"the Quran itself\\" in your title while later admitting you haven't read it just shows dishonesty.Many other people in the comments are pointing out how Islam and the Quran are not any more intolerant and xenophobic than Christianity and the Bible, so I won't focus on that. I'll tell you my experience, cuz apparently that's all one needs, of meeting Muslims in both Germany and Muslim majority countries. These are incredibly kind people always willing to help, connect and make people feel included. A few weeks ago I was out with some muslim friends and a larger group when people started to leave and someone said the rest were going for dinner. I went to the restaurant and it turned out all the people I knew left already. So these people who had never met me, invited me to dinner, changed the language of their conversation so I could understand them and asked me questions to bring me into the conversation.Islam, especially during Ramadan, puts a strong emphasis on sharing with those who need it. The organization we usually call \\"the Red cross\\" is actually part of \\"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\\". Sure, you can find some quotes in the Quran which are hateful or promote terrible actions, but you can 100% also do that for the Bible. The beliefs of a religious community are based on general ideals and evolve as those communities change. Christians differ on their belief of how the Bible should be interpreted or what should even be in it. For Muslims, interpretation is also a big point of contention and opinions change with time and across countries. Maybe not in a night club but at some other time I suggest you approach some of these people, keep an open mind and ask them to know more about their culture, religion and beliefs. They will probably surprise you. Muslims, just like Christians, can range from radically conservative to extremely progressive. PD: I'll remind you there are many countries that are secular and majority Muslim such as Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Azerbaijan and like 15 more. The idea that Islam is incompatible with Secularism is simply absurd. Secular Turkey under Atatrk gave women the right to vote in 1934, years or even decades before many western nations like France (44), Italy (46), Switzerland (71) or Greece (52).","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"Theyre already teeing up the Russian interference story","title":"Report: Brace for 'Unrest' if Donald Trump Wins, Democrats Warn"},{"text":"Honestly like, good for him ??","title":"Kamala Harris' VP Tim Walz had a secret romantic fling with the daughter of top Chinese Communist official, Daily Mail reports."},{"text":"My local sub has a person who always posts a \\"progressive voter guide\\" in the days before the election.

It was an angry response after someone had ridiculed Mohammed, and I couldnt help thinking that religious zealots remind me of rabid dogs when they threaten violence over an insult. When will they grow up? People who would commit murder over of an insult, real or imaginary, are a disgrace to humanity.In the past, I was active in stopping Christian prayers that had been creeping into government meetings. My efforts included articles, letters, emails, phone calls, and numerous occasions where I spoke or gave presentations in front of Boards of Supervisors. Some of those meetings were full houses, jam packed with Christians and their priestcrafters, most of whom were hostile towards me, while the others quietly supported their hatred.Yet, for all of the hateful looks and snide remarks, for all of the angry emails and nasty calls I received C not once was I physically attacked, or even threatened with such by Christians. Had I done those same things regarding Islam in a predominately Muslim country, not only would I have been beaten and jailed repeatedly, I would have been killed on some occasions.So between Christian and Islamic influenced cultures, there is a tangible difference in the degree of mental illness they represent (only we know the true God and you must agree with us). That having been said, much of the betterment is due to western laws guaranteeing freedom of religion and separation of church and state.In closing, **Islam deserves derision, which should continue non-stop until the violent mutts within that religion are cast out by its other followers.** So with that in mind, and knowing that any religion is a terminal illness when its held in higher esteem than loving each other, *perhaps the next time someone tells me theyre a proud Muslim I will offer my condolences.*","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"She would be by far one of their best recruits","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 28, 2024 - 8 days until election day!"},{"text":"I mean, they could have gone with a shot that doesn't look like she's about to sneeze, but...Oh well, let's call it Unexpected Bojack.","title":"Fighting for Democracy"},{"text":"Good on you.

Lacking in sciences, lacking in knowledge of the world and the universe at large.The discussion that should really take place is: which region seems to be more effective at radicalizing their citizens?In this sense, the behavior that you find to be objectionable is likely to be a nurture problem over a nature one. Which is to say, it is highly dependent on how their doctrine was taught to them, and this is going to primarily vary based on region and environment in which the person was raised.That's why vast majority Muslims in America are not throwing gays off of rooves.However, oppressive theocratic movements aren't non-existent either. There's a constant effort by devout religious folks in the states to do tons of legislative things based almost purely on religion, such as banning abortion nationwide. I'm aware there's much of that also in the middle eastern nations.So then the question becomes what sort of environment leads to more extreme radicalization, with religion only being the mere tool to drive those fundamentals.The middle east is an extremely volatile region that, try as they might (whether they did their best can be debated), even America has failed to help instill liberal democratic values. A person who grows up in certain areas of this region is going to be more susceptible to radicalization simply due to that sort of environment. Why things are like this can be a whole host of things, including theocracy, but as I said basically every country suffers from the occasional theocratic power grab.So really I think your issue is less with Islam, and more with countries/governing bodies that have not yet accepted democracy and broad liberal equity as a norm. If you do any kind of reading about North Korea, you'd see that KJU radicalizes his country on the basis of nationalism rather than religion, and the result isn't very much different in the sense that your average North Korean citizen will believe some pretty out-there stuff about the rest of the world, because he closes the country off to everything else. Religion isnt a factor at all really, and yet the outcome on people is still a sense of radicalization in how they think about the rest of the world that isn't North Korea. That's due to KJU's isolationist policy and propaganda almost entirely.So just apply the same feelings to religion. It's simply a tool to drive people to feel a certain way about other people, whether good, bad, or anything inbetween. If it wasn't religion it would be something else.So in all of that sense, to me the concept of Islam doesn't really enter in to the discussion in the first place. Its a non-issue. I'd rather discuss how to encourage progressivism in certain countries that have fallen behind in the Freedom &amp; Equality index and work on the reasons that has come to be. If Afghanistan, for example, had a functional democracy in place of sorts, and gender equality in all forms was an inherently held moral value that was preached by its government, guarantee you women would be able to talk to others on the street, as you mentioned.The whole world unfortunately isn't all at the same place in terms of their progression. This goes for many countries you might not even think of. For example: as a person that lived in Japan for many years, their views on women are still pretty far behind (on a broad scale) even in 2024. I've seen women in parliament be berated by their colleagues in public for not being housewives instead of pursuing an independent career in lawmaking. You think I'm kidding, [but it's true.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/20/tokyo-assemblywoman-sexist-abuse) Flat out open sexism like that in an official government setting would feel unconscionable in some countries and would be harshly condemned. Japan is one of worlds leading economies, and one of the most advanced economies to boot, and even they still have work to do. They aren't even religious! Vast majority of citizens are Buddhist!So yeah, every country is in a different place on their path to improvement. Some are lagging behind more than others.

Not all industries can do this, but that would be an objection where a manufacturing plant closes and outsources jobs. Another objection could be in the general loss of productivity. Say all we had was 100 computer engineers, and all the technology companies in the US had to compete for these workers. We would see a lot of businesses close that otherwise could be productive. Meanwhile other countries might pull ahead who don't have a labor shortage. Compare that to having so many computer engineers that we had a 100 surplus then all the companies would be able to be productive at some maximum, and they would be able to hire the top engineers and not settle for bad workers. When there is a labor shortage, companies may need to cut back on productivity and growth, and they may be forced to hire lower skilled labors for what the jobs demand. My wife hires at a grocery store, and she is dealing with this because hiring is expensive, but retention is hard and finding quality workers is hard, despite raises. They are trying to keep costs down, while raising wages to get better workers that stay longer.

It is indeed unfair to mention this in my post though. It's easy to get the impression that cologne muslims use their religions as shields when they want to and don't follow the religion otherwise. It's the same with the italian mafia, which often cited christianity as inspiration, while literally commiting all sins possible. With arab cartels its similar and they are big in cologne. Many of those people I've seen might simply not have been muslim though, so that's fair. I'll see to step down on such viewpoints, it's a slippery slope. Generalizing is rarely good in that regard.About your last point, I'm talking about Germany, or specifically cologne. Asians, Africans and Eastern-Europeans (the biggest other immigrant communities) are all not associated with these integration problems nearly as much. But they're also not present in ghettos, as turkish people are. That might be a big factor. Maybe it's not just the culture, but the past German generations making a terrible job at integrating foreign people. I'm not a fan of strong christian believers either, they just don't really exist here.Edit: Grammar.Edit 2: On re-evaluation my comment here is bs.

Extreme homophobia is an example of a viewpoint that was shaped within this context.?\\nHistorically, homosexuality in Islam prior to the 19th century was culturally practiced and silently accepted. There was outward disdain for the act - similarly to adultery - but the rules were similarly hard to enforce (need x amount of witnesses). So it was a practice that was pretty common, especially among the rich. This continued for most of Islams history (periods of more and less tolerance occured) until colonization, where Britain imported their MUCH more overt and legally enshrined homophobia. That dramatically changed how homosexuality was handled in the middle east. This was then compounded when the West turned away from that homophobia towards tolerance and secular values at the same time that islamic countries were becoming independent and shaping their identities in opposition to their previous colonial masters.\\nIslam had many dramatic changes in thinking on many subjects, and much of it was regional given how there were at least three \\"centers\\" of the Islamic world. But I've spoken on two renaissances in Islamic thought - one during the height of Baghdad's fame and influence and another over the course of the 1800s where new interpretations were dramatically evolving to meet the realities of the changing world. Unfortunately, more tolerant thought was lost or swept away in the face of mainstream islamism - at least as far as political power and leadership are concerned.?\\nSide note: there's a famous Islamic poet that was very very queer and was celebrated for his mastery of the Arabic language and the Bedouin poetic style which he evolved and innovated on over his life. I forget his name rn sadly.

The fact that our congresspeople feared for their lives and were hiding in closets, barricading the floor.

Russia's invasion has been incredibly inefficient, but their resources are so much vastly greater than Ukraine that it almost \\"doesn't matter\\". (Not real numbers, just generalities to further explain the point) - If you have 10x as many soldiers as the nation you're invading and you lose 3x as many soldiers as they, you still have a huge advantage.

But I think that the reason why many dont see it as an issue per se is because they arent as much thinking of it in terms of what is the one evil group of people we can pin our problems on as theyre trying to communicate that these individual components of straight, white, and male each have their own set of stereotypes and historical evidence to have apprehensions about them. Straight in this light isnt necessarily going to mean to most that you just prefer heterosexual partners. Straight, especially to many who arent, is the thing that we are told we are supposed to be in many cultures. It in many ways assumes itself as the default.White is also an interesting term because what it means to be white has shifted with time. There was a time where Italians werent considered white meanwhile nowadays Id venture to say some will say that theyre more white (especially Italian Americans) than most other groups. It has historically been a moving goalpost meant to certain people included and others excluded. Now men I think is an obvious one as to the kinds of issues that men have caused others so I dont feel the need to elaborate as the examples you yourself provided seems sufficient. Now let me add: I dont believe that anyone believes that any one group has a monopoly on any vice or virtue. What intersectionality does is it creates avatars that sort of personify groups of people to make them more manageable to understand while taking into account that no one is just one thing. What people mean when they say Straight white men should share the power, I imagine the balanced and less baity way of rephrase would be Historically, society (namely especially American society) has had the norm that the expected person in power would be a straight white man who in many ways would enforce that as the norm. Sometimes they would do this to such a degree that they would justify enslaving their fellow man and call that normal. Having less people that are straight white men in power is going to be an important landmark in seeing progress. Straight white men in power arent inherently evil. But people in the groups that straight white men often persecuted, having representation of your values, culture, and even appearance goes a long way in having a diverse population feel as though everyone is truly represented. That doesnt fit so easily on a poster and no one would stop to read it though. Are there some who perhaps either cant articulate that to that degree or perhaps even find themselves truly believing as you said that straight white men are inherently evil? Yes. Do I think that it anywhere approaches the level of issues we still face surrounding discrimination of minorities and queer people? Not even close. Does that mean we should want everyone to suffer equally? No, Id say rising tides raise all ships. But what youre describing isnt the explanation of a solution as much as its supposed to identify a problem. Again, the problem isnt someone of a certain gender or skin color or sexuality being in power. Its about who *isnt* in power when the representations dont resemble those they represent. Its not that there are any white guys in power thats the problem. Its when in councils of 9, 8 of them are white and decide everything even if the white population is really high, if someone exists in society, people want a way to feel represented.

Maybe I don't know many of these more balanced muslims, because my observation bias goes towards recognizing muslims exactly by these problematic beliefs.

When I do, I'll post an update.My anecdotal incidents are surely not to be taken as solid evidence, nonetheless, I'm not talking about 1 or 2 cases where I've seen this happen. 2 close friends were abondened by their fathers for leaving islam, and 5 other people that I personally know, and that's only the ones I can recall, have experienced domestic violence in muslim families. Sure it's anecdotal, but I would have to close both eyes to strictly assume that I just unfortunately met exactly the 7 families where it happened.

Discrimination is oftenly a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you constantly criticize and discriminate against an ethnic group, the likelihood of them actually following these prejudices skyrockets.

It boils down into a much more different arrangement of values and prospects: Vote for Kamala Harris to expand the scope of federal government, further develop social programs, and prioritize our role in international affairs. Vote for Donald Trump to restrict the overreach of federal government, increase economic opportunities, and better secure the border. Given the economic downturn these last few years, as in, my wallet has really felt it despite what the numbers say, and given the bureaucratic money drain that is the federal government, and given the excessive influx of illegal immigration right now, Trump has my vote. Done. I also am very fucking tired of the TDS from the Left. It's ridiculous, get over it. Do I love Trump? No. Do I think he's a genuinely fine candidate who I agree with more than Harris? Yeah, so I'm voting for him.

I have a family member I respect that is a contractor and a bidder who I respect less that is also a contractor.  The family member will do the job cheaper.  Both situations are cooperating.  I provide the scope of work, vision for the project, and funding. The contractor provides labor and materials.  But I dont go with the respected family member.  Why not?  Because Im more concerned with maintaining the relationship and I want to be able to enforce a contract without harming the relationship.  Choosing the private bidder actually harms the relationship with the family member, because they are offended I wont work with them, but I sacrifice a short term slight to maintain a long term relationship.

She came in with some tough language and I was hopeful it meant she'd run on taking a harder line against Netanyahu and the Likud, but then she started to moderate that language and ended up in the useless \\"war needs to end\\" position. I think it was the result of some polling numbers.  It's the same as when she started talking about price controls and then it got backlash and she immediately changed to taking on price-gouging.

We could take facts into account when identifying basic things that served our mutual interests, and we were fine with competing in the democratic system to uphold the interests that belonged only to our side.

They arent the headliners anymore. Politics example look at the respectable people in each party today and you will see people who are actively respectful and compassionate. They are also boring and seen as lacking fight.  Find an old Obama speech and you can hear him truly understand the other side and explain their case and why it is a reasonable solution and then explain his side and explain why he believes it is superior for all parties including the opposition. Find an old Romney speech and you will see him do the same. Neither of these people are assholes or demonizing anyone. They are people who actually want what they believe to be best who disagree on how we get there. Bush vs Clinton, same. Today, its a death match. Outside of the leaders, look at the coverage and what actually gets the most airplay. MSNBC and FOX are both demonizing the other side and telling you how stupid they are. TikToks of witty insults. Hot takes. Funny memes. Who is actually trying to agree. In personal life, everything is I am right and respect me. Im done talking. Disagree one more time and go no contact.

The core answer was actually pretty simple.  Escapism.  The stresses of my life at that time were overwhelming, and alcohol helped mask them. And mask them well!The problem was the issues either continued to fester, or grew in their magnitude, causing me to consume more \\"masking\\" juice.In my sobriety, the hardest part wasn't avoiding the alcohol, yes, that was hard enough, it was taking on the unresolved issues that I had side-stepped for too long.  The taste for alcohol waned faster than the fixing of the problems, for sure!But, again, personally, I really started to get a \\"high\\" off of making good and positive corrections and adjustments to my formerly highly toxic life.  And I learned how to better manage stress and stressors as they arose.Back then, looking at where I was, I was totally in over my head.  I had to bullshit my way through so many things, in order to maintain my position at work, a position that I wasn't as qualified for as others, but, I ran a better social game with the bosses than most.  I was a lot of fun to party with!But, the party stopped when project deadlines loomed, or management of people in my charge was failing because of my lack of attention to ever growing conflicts, mistakes and inefficiencies.  At home, the problems were just as plentiful.But, I'm not here to drone on and on about my past, suffice to say, with a sober head, I've been better equipped to help others find clarity in sobriety.Back then, if I would have been running for POTUS, I should have never been elected.  I was too irresponsible and clouded to make best decisions requiring research, dialogue, discussion, and impact of those decisions without regard.All these years later, with much greater clarity, I might entertain the thought, knowing that I'm doing so much better, with better tools and outlets to handle the high stresses as they pour in, on the daily.If I had the ability to go back in time to those days, if I was running for POTUS in that moment, I'd tell everyone to please, for their own good, not to elect me.  I would not be anywhere near as effective in that position as I'd need to be.  My irrational decisions would have too great of an effect on too many people, making too many unnecessary problems.If Ms. Harris has a need to operate with the \\"help\\" of a substance, I'd wish a clean and sober future of herself would pay her a visit and give her Mr. Biden's classic advice.  \\"Don't.  Don't.\\"But, if she's not battling demons with the assistance of substances, and this is her at her very best, I sincerely wish we could have someone that's a better option than this public presentation of herself.  This really can't be the best offering available, is it?Moral of the story, everything, in moderation, is your right, IMHO.  But, things that surpass moderation and have their effect on me is not your right.  It can quickly become your AND my problem.  A problem I didn't plan on having.  And a problem you shouldn't be giving others.","title":"Propaganda: Kamala Harris and Probable Alcoholism or Substance Abuse"},{"text":"Lucky.","title":"Kamala Harris' VP Tim Walz had a secret romantic fling with the daughter of top Chinese Communist official, Daily Mail reports."},{"text":"I'm laughing but I'm also annoyed at how he spelled alluded.","title":"A good reason to vote for Democrats up and down your ballot, it's the only way you can be sure it will count"},{"text":"My favorite is Cenk Yugar from The Young Turks melting down.

They are claiming its likely that theres a campaign to mass report the interview going on online. \\n \\n Perhaps there is an online forum, or thread, where this is happening?

That's what wiped out Beto in his election run.  He was getting 55% or so of the vote in the major cities (except Fort Worth) and getting huge leads because of all the votes in the cities.   Then, the many, many rural counties came in with their vote totals, trickling in, and they were 90% Cruz.  The cumulative effect of so many small vote totals that were 90% Cruz is what what killed Beto's run.Fortunately, several things have happened in the six years since 2018 -1. Well over two million more people moved into Texas, primarily to work in the state.  It is unclear how they will vote, but they are almost certainly going to be less Cruz friendly than rural Texans.\\n2. Rural populations in Texas have continued to decline -  automation continues to take away jobs, forcing rural people to move.   Dunno if their politics change when they move to a big city, but, maybe.  For sure they will see a more diverse population at work.\\n3. Abortion rights are now a huge issue in Texas.    More women vote than men anyway, and this is going to increase.\\n4. More GenZ are turning up to vote than previous generations of people in that age bracket.   Say what you will about GenZs, but they vote a lot more than their predecessors.\\n5. Trump was a shock to the system in 2016, and a lot of people voted for him for the shock value.   Plus Hillary ran a terrible campaign.  Calling Trump supporters \\"deplorables\\" was not going to win her any of those votes and was only going to incite more of those people, who had previously tended NOT to vote, to come out and vote against her.   Harris has run a very smart campaign, actively campaigning with Liz Cheney for anti-Trumper Republican votes and being very careful to say only positive things about bi-partisanship.    When 20-30% of Republicans continued to vote for Nikki Haley in the state primaries even AFTER she dropped out, well, those Republicans made an effort to send a message.    Trump continues to try to shock the system, but really, his act is growing old and tiresome with absolutely nothing new, and you can see that in the sheer lack of energy at his rallies.   Lots of former Trump voters are just tired of his aging Clown Car Circus act, and are just hoping the wheels fall off for good and he exits the circus tent.These changing demographic factors all weigh against Cruz.  Will it be enough to overcome his 3% vote advantage over Beto?  I have a sneaky suspicion that when you add it all up, it will.Add to that the fact that Cruz has done nothing to redeem his reputation and the Cancun vacation during the time of the Big Freeze in Texas I think will hurt him.Notice I did not say anything about the Latino vote.  In the past so many of the predictions that Texas would turn purple or blue were based on the huge and growing percentage of Latino voters that were going to be coming of age.   Well, so far, that just hasn't happened.  Latino voters have the lowest turnout of any group, and any politician trying to get the Latino vote is just wasting their time and money.A lot of Latinos are very Catholic and deeply conservative in their personal values, being anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ and all that, and I really doubt those Latinos will be voting for the Democrats in any case, even if, as working class people, their economic interests should align them closely with the Democrats.","title":"Can Colin Allred pull off a victory against Ted Cruz in Texas?

She is saddled with Bidens agenda and, for better and worse, is tied to it because of her role in the Senate. If topics like wind turbines, covid, leftist cults (still laugh at the forest fire theory), womens rights are brought up it puts Harris in a position where she would have to say some things that would alienate both her base and Rogans listeners.Beyond that, Rogan has had a lot of guests that make his platform a bad fit for Harris. Her appearance would have potentially exposed her audience to the fact Rogan has interviewed Alex Jones, Graham Hancock, Stefan Molyneux, Steven Crowder, Milo Yiannopolos, Candace Owens, Robert Malone, and Jordan Peterson. I feel that a lot of her base would judge her being on the podcast differently than her appearance on Fox News.A good example of what she could lose can be seen from Bernie Sanders appeared (and was endorsed by Rogan). After that he lost a sizeable amount of support from the left (orgs like Moveon and Human Rights Campaign) and alienated people like AOC for little to no appreciable benefit.If Harris had been on the podcast a month an ago I think it would have been good as her campaign would have had the time to moderate the backlash and smooth over her voting base. Doing it now would only divert attention away from her final campaign messages and her attacks on Trump.Her not appearing is not cowardly or foolish but merely something that doesnt offer benefit at this point in the race.","title":"CMV: Kamala not going on Joe Rogan is cowardly and foolish"},{"text":"Aka youre denying reality?","title":"Whats happened to all the recent top Reddit posts saying Trump was mentally unwell like Biden?

Their choice.I'm gonna hard disagree with you on that. Nobody I've ever known with a murdered friend/family would give a shit over the \\"smearing of their memory\\" if it meant letting the killers escape justice. Because Aaron Rich specifically started a lawsuit against Wikileaks and co for \\"libel\\" specifically on the claim that Wikileaks wired $10,000 to them (for Seth, with Aarons help). If Wikileaks is conflated with Russian intel (and it is right now), then that could be argued as treason.Aaron even attempted to have Assange himself served several subpoenas via Twitter: https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/julian-assange-subpoenaed-in-defamation-suit/Anyways, the original 2017 plan Trump proposed was he was going to let Assange get a pardon if he publicly revealed the DNC leak source and debunked Russiagate, which never happened cause of Mueller et all.  The case can be summarized and boiled down to (summary via AI): https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4423421/3-26-18-Rich-v-Butowsky-Complaint.pdfThe 2018 lawsuit filed by Aaron Rich against Ed Butowsky, Matthew Couch, America First Media (AFM), and The Washington Times alleges that the defendants defamed Rich by **falsely accusing him of conspiring with his brother, Seth Rich, in the theft and leak of Democratic National Committee (DNC) data to WikiLeaks**. Seth Richs murder in 2016 led to various conspiracy theories, which the defendants allegedly promoted to advance their political agendas, **including the false narrative that Seth, with Aarons assistance, leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks**. Rich claims that the defendants continued spreading these allegations even after being informed of their falsity, causing him significant emotional, reputational, and financial harm. He seeks damages for the alleged defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.The direct quote from the introduction:For close to a year, Defendants Edward Ed Butowsky, Matthew Matt Couch,\\nand Couchs organization known as America First Media (AFM), have falsely and repeatedly alleged in public statements that Plaintiff Aaron Rich (Aaron) is a criminal. Specifically, Defendants have claimed to have proof that Aaron (i) worked with his deceased brother Seth Rich to steal data from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), (ii) **provided that stolen data to the hostile intelligence service WikiLeaks in exchange for payment into Aarons bank account**, and (iii) engaged in deceit and obstruction of justice to cover his tracks after Seth was murdered.See here the most important, central claim is involves Wikileaks is defined as \\"hostile intelligence service\\", and the use of Aaron's bank account. That is \\"treason\\", brother. Aaron also apparently works in tech for military contractors and such, so that claim would additionally stop him from getting a job again most likely.","title":"Democratic organizer Jordan Bowen faces backlash for screaming at child during Kamala Harris rally | The Express Tribune"},{"text":"Trump will fuck it up.

Systems can be inconvenient, but inconvenience is very much surmountable when you truly care about something: we are all fundamentally responsible for our decisions.

I know that trying to shop ethically can be inconvenient, and the choice is yours - you do not need anyone's permission to make choices about your life - but it seems like you seem to be focused on the online sense of ethical shopping, where it's more as a personal statement than an evaluation of the impact of your actions. I think it's important to think about what, specifically, unethical working conditions/supply chains mean in terms of real-world consequences.

It is roughly unchanged over this time. The massacres of 1929 were identical to those of 2013 down to the details of mutilation and, interestingly, those of 1934 in Algeria where there was no land dispute.Regardless of assumptions from Western scholars, the violence could never have been just a response to belligerent occupation unless someone is running around with a time machine. As much as I like Doctor Who, that's not happening. The major implication of this here is that Israel cannot possibly hope to address the underlying causes through a negotiating strategy.Entirely aside from that, most societies have historically not lashed out the way Palestinians are portrayed as doing while under belligerent occupation. The usual tradition is to maintain peace, with rare rebellions, after the initial violence in which the land was claimed has quieted down.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"I can vividly imagine what a trump term would look like for Gaza, AND protesters in the US.Gaza: BB finally goes Full Genocide and forces Gazan teenagers into military service, to be used as fodder for the invasion of Lebanon (or Syria.

The people that like them are also fans. If they enjoy them and and support them they don't consider them 'invalidated beyond redemption'. The fans who don't enjoy them or support them and believe they are 'invalidated beyond redemption' are speaking a subjective opinion, not objective fact. Far too many people believe that their personal preferences or tastes in media are objective facts.The sheer magnitude of anger against them is so immense that they are unanimously viewedBut they're not unanimously viewed that way. For something to be unanimous there can't be a single person who disagrees.They are a no-go zone, deemed non-canon and youre expected to dislike them.Again, this is a case of some fans taking their subjective opinion and expecting it to apply to everyone, as if its objective fact. Whether or not someone else expects you to dislike something is irrelevant.Sequels fans arent considered true fans of Star Wars by most fansThis is the fandom gatekeeping the fandom. And contradicts your point about unanimity above. Gatekeeping and applying broad generalities does not transform subjective opinion into objective fact.Liking them on any level is unacceptable.To whom, and why should someone who enjoys the new movies care about what that person or persons feels is 'acceptable' in what they do or do not enjoy? Literally any defence of them has been debunked and viewed as invalidYou can't 'debunk' subjective opinion. And it doesn't matter if someone views someone else's subjective tastes as 'invalid'. None of these things transform subjective tastes into objective fact.Attempting to defend them in main fandom spaces simply invites controversy and debateSo what? Why should anyone who likes a series of movies, a book,  a flavor of ice cream, or a certain genre of music have to 'defend' their subjective tastes? If someone tries to debate with me about whether or not I'm 'wrong' or a 'true fan' of ice cream if I say I like one flavor of ice cream more than another, I laugh at them. Peoples likes and preferences are not a contest. You cannot be wrong about your own likes and preferences, and no one else's likes or preferences is subjective fact, regardless of how few or how many people share the same likes or preferences.If there is a level you can like them on in the fandom, its a I think they suck but I just turn my brain off when I watch them level.Or, and hear me out...people can also *not* think they suck and enjoy watching them?There are virtually no major names in the fandom who will defend them.Who cares? 'Major names in the fandom' agreeing or disagreeing don't turn subjective taste into objective fact.In fact, its genuinely now impossible for any sequel fan to explain their reasoning for enjoying them without having to explain their specific stance on every single character arc and writing decision.Because of gatekeeping fans who think their subjective opinion should somehow be objective fact to others. People who have one opinion attacking others who have a different one and considering those others somehow 'wrong' are just behaving badly. And someone else behaving badly about their personal opinion is not grounds that someone else is 'wrong' about a different personal opinion.Theyve been so heavily analysed and scrutinized, that theres now nothing left to enjoy.For you. Other people enjoy them. Other people don't care about the 'heavy analysis or scrutiny'. Some people are aware of the heavy analysis and scrutiny and still enjoy them. Unlike other Star Wars media, the ST has undergone constant analysis, with literally every single aspect of them broken down by countless Star Wars YouTubersSo what? I think its safe to say that the majority of people who like Star Wars, including the new movies, don't watch countless Star Wars Youtubers. Or care about the opinion or analysis of countless Star Wars Youtubers.Their legacy is almost irredeemableAgain, don't mistake subjective opinion into subjective fact.So, personally I believe its been game over for too long.And that is subjective opinion. You're fine to hold this opinion, but holding it doesn't make it objective fact. There is no reason to continue to support them or even watch them.You're free to support or watch whatever you like. But your choice not to support or watch a film series because you personally don't like it and don't think its redeemable doesn't make that objective fact for everyone. It doesn't erase the people who will continue to watch and support them because they actually enjoy them.The fandom has spokenNo, it hasn't. The fandom isn't some hivemind conglomerate whose word is somehow law. Parts of the fandom have spoken and given their personal opinions on the matter. Bully for them! They can stop watching and supporting them if they like. If there's enough of them, maybe the franchise dies or Star Wars goes in a different direction. But no one else in the fandom is beholden to the opinions of others in choosing what they enjoy watching and supporting. and those who enjoy it therefore support its ruination.Or just maybe, they don't consider it ruined and enjoy it? I mean, this is kind of like saying 'I like chocolate more than vanilla, so therefore those who enjoy vanilla support chocolate's ruination!'Like, no? It may be 'ruined' for you and maybe even others, but that applies only to you and those others. The OG trilogy is still out there. You can still enjoy it. Other people enjoying the new movies or some of the new movies doesn't take that away from you. At all.They will never be seen as anything other than the most hated trilogy in existence, which makes them pointless to enjoy for me.For you. And that's fine. So go do something else. But you cannot apply this condition of your subjective opinion onto others.","title":"CMV: There is absolutely no reason for fans of the Star Wars sequels to continue to enjoy and support them as they are invalidated beyond redemption."},{"text":"Fuck, you missed the biggest one - NO INCOME TAX","title":"Trump is so mean!

Exerting counter-control over not just political ideas, not just morality, but against basic common sense and logic makes them feel powerful - they feel beaten down by those things, and Trump (and historical fascist leaders of all stripes) encourage them to just look at those things and tell them to fuck off, to say, \\"I don't have to try to understand and fuck you for trying to make me. You have rules, like laws and physics? Well my rules say yours are bullshit.\\" It's the ultimate rejection of progress, the endgame of conservatism.EDIT: The exact quote, which is much better than my words:*\\"The reason they aren't more bothered by [Trump] constantly getting things wrong, why they aren't more bothered by the extreme inconsistencies and outright contradictions, by the claims that are just materially wrong, is because it gives them power over others who are bound by something as weak and flimsy as 'reality.' They claim to be against corruption while hanging their hopes on an openly corrupt man, and that naked hypocrisy is the point.

The goal of the organizations that are self-selected to be social engineers to the modern internet based information culture (humorously self described as \\"intelligence\\" organizations in an attempt to satisfy their obvious inadequacy in the realm of cognition and apprehension) is to control the public narratives by defining the boundaries of that which is acceptable discussion to engage in.  YouTube and other large social media platforms offer the perfect opportunity to do this by making what appears to be an infinite source of information that every citizen can contribute to thus on the surface it represents the ideal democratization of knowledge.But with even a little probing you'll see that the whole thing is an illusion designed to A) distract people with trivial content that promotes their primary values (which are really just tactics designed to divide and conquer).  B)The creation of individuals that are extremely successful and popular to further the MYTH of meritocracy, to make people believe that mr beast and Elon musk and joe Rogan are somehow extra intelligent, or driven or talented and that's why they enjoy the profits that they do and subsequently the power they have consolidated is a key part of the narrative.It is completely false but It keeps people focused on materialism and consumer culture just like the sports industry does with star athletes that come from the ghetto or the music industry does with every pop star and hop hop star of the month.  Keep the kids thinking that they want to emulate that lifestyle so they keep buying the clothing lines, and liquor and jewelry and cars so the men who run the game guarantee profits and keep the sick cycle of manipulation and marginalization and debt and abuse at the core of western culture.   We all know this is happening and yet we all allow it to continue.  Instead of turning the tables and cutting the cables we just watch it and say eh, best not to rock the boat. We only get the world that we deserve.  The world that WE CREATE.  But yes it is true there are highly skilled forces at work to subvert all that is obvious and true. To subvert what is self evident (as in something so obvious that it need not even be said) and put in its place an explanation to justify or explain away something that we are supposed to accept as legitimate simply because it has been obsfucated with $12 words.  What is badly needed is what Nietzsche referred to as \\"the revaluation of all values\\"  what we have been guided by this far in civilization has lead us to this moment that is fraught with hypocrisy and inconsistency. What we have now is truly an inversion of all Natural values or a perversion of natural values where we are told that our most natural drives and inclinations are immoral or sinful. We have, through hundreds of years of religious aristocracy, where the only people capable of reading and writing have been the richest people and those indoctrinated in religious priestcraft.  These people wrote all the books and law and were the architects of our reality.  The masons of our minds.  Yet they believed because they were told to believe that the desires of the flesh are to be shunned because they were evil.  Well surprise surprise this kind of perversion of all natural inclinations leads people to a state of mental aberration where their suppressed inclinations find ways to surface that the rest of us find to be antisocial or peculiar.  \\nAnd yet up until very recently many of us have still gotten up early and put on our most uncomfortable formal clothing to go once a week on one of our days off to sit for an hour and let these confused men (and women) who in any other context we would certainly lable as crazy or schizophrenic for ya know...talking to God and whatnot...tell us made up stories in a twisted tongue that only makes any sense if this nutter attempts to modernize and translate it for us.  Why? Because we haven't yet collectively begun the REVALUATION of Values that we so desperately need to in order to combat this passive complacency that has lead to this point where we are tasked to choose between two incomparably terrible options for new president.  One a complete media fabrication that has very little experience to give the public the confidence we need to back her and one very old and simple man baby with such poor judgement and a massive criminal record that is desperately trying to stay out of prison by becoming president again.  I think the choice is clear, too bad he dropped out of the race.   If you read this far into this rant give yourself an ice cream cone and celebrate the fact that you have an attention span still.

And those systems are more prone to instability than \\"just\\" disfunctional government. Average turnout in Czech republic is 55% in Netherlands 72 % What needs to change is government system. Government should be in perpetual motion (with exception of Prime minister which I cover next) and ministers should be exchanged based on parliamental consensus. That would force parliament to cooperate to pick best people for the job and mitigated instability. Also  there should be prohibition of coalitions. Again parties should be bound by their programs and not being able to throw away its elements for warm seats in government. Then again it would force parties to cooperate to beneficial outcome without fear of reprimand from electoral base. Prime minister would be picked from winner party but he would not be able to choose members of its government that would be strictly parliament priviledge.Everything of this would lead to proper representation, more stability and basically would eliminace democratic deficit.Especially our recent government which is frankenstein of ideas and ideologies would really benefitted from more fragmentation and obligatory programs.

The problem of the scale doesn't apply. And even here it's only for the cases when the majority wasn't found.Well, I would argue that it wouldn't - I see you have Budapest in your nickname, so I'll use the last Hungarian elections as an example. In the last election, only about 5 % of the vote fell under the threshold. The difference between the coalitions was so large, that the 5 % could have been assigned in any way, and it wouldn't have made any difference at all. So, why re-do the entire election if the election already reached a decisive result.On a country of 8 million eligible voters, assuming voting will on average take 20 minutes per person, a round of general elections costs the country  2 400 000 hours of effort, plus the entire administration around vote counting + election management. That's a gigantic cost to spend on something that would have been completely meaningless.Two rounds systems are used in a single winner systems, because their the runoff is always very limited in scale (only the district that didn't reach a decisive result in the first round). A PR system doesn't have a clear way to define a winner, so the scope  for the second round would be everyone who can vote.Also, they have the turnout problem - on the example of Czechia, parliamentary elections have about 60 - 65 % turnout.Senate elections, which are two rounds, had 30 % turnout in round 1 and 17.5 % turnout for round 2. That's an absolutely massive loss, so extrapolating this system on parliamentary elections would lead to a much lower total votes counted than keeping it as it is.Ranked proportional representation voting has a problem of how to evaluate it, for it to be intuitive to the people who're voting as that the people understand how voting works is an extremely high priority.","title":"CMV: Electoral tresholds are unfair, unnecessary and undemocratic"},{"text":"Its probably because modern day conservatism became too extreme and went to other online platforms such as 4chan?","title":"Why is Reddit predominantly liberal?"},{"text":"it's not though.maybe for people's retirement funds, but people are getting fucked left and right when it comes to the price of groceries, energy, and housing.

I appreciate it. You make many good points, and your concerns are well noted.Im trying to make a point of learning more about what politicians say before I get upset by it. When my wife and I make an agreement about something, like lets say, whos going to bring the garbage cans back from the street once a week. The agreement is understood by both of us to be an experiment. We try it out. Does it work? If yes, weve got a law. Now its my job. But lets say I sprain my hand and the doctor tells me to rest it for two weeks. Now, my wife and I will modify our agreement temporarily. And if my hand continued to be impaired, we would modify it further.Situations change. There were probably a lot of laws about how to treat slaves. But once slavery ended, those laws were no longer relevant.For years marijuana was considered the devils drug. It was supposed to definitely lead to heroin addiction. Tens of thousands of Americans were imprisoned, sometimes for decades for possession of small amounts of this substance. Now that it is legal in many states, there has been talk about changing the sentences of those who were incarcerated for possession of marijuana. Thats because the context in which the laws have changed. As a society, we want to be flexible enough to be able to respond in real time as situations change. Most situations that we try to fix are not black-and-white solutions. Most situations contain multiple layers of complexity. And many laws do not address this variability, leading us into trouble.Your statement that the law doesnt matter up until now is not entirely true for me. The law matters deeply to me. All of it. Should I signal before I take a left turn? Theres a law for that. Am I allowed to film or video in a public place? Theres a law for that. Can I publish a photo of a person in a public domain without a consent form being signed? Theres a law for that. Can a policeman enter my home without a warrant? Theres a law for that.The law matters exquisitely, and no one should be exempt. That is why it is so important that we get the laws as right as we can. and thats why it is imperative that we work together, so that all of our needs can be listened to, heard, understood, and taken into account. If a Democratic Congress passes a law that pisses off Republicans, its a bad law. If a republican Congress passes a law that pisses off Democrats, its a bad law.we have to work together if were going to get our needs met. And getting our needs met is imperative and is not optional. we need to be healthy in order to live a satisfactory life. We need an income if we are to be able to feed our families. We need to be free of crime if we are going to have security and safety. And we need to work together to make sure that these things happen.and we need to work together respectfully, and enjoyably because it is extremely difficult work to work with people who have different opinions about how things should be done. ive seen photographs and videos of Trump rallies and there is an incredible atmosphere of fun, love, respect, and hope at those rallies. Thats the spirit I wish we all had when working together to solve our problems. It almost never works to blame the other party for my own problems. I have to look at myself and make sure that I are doing the right thing. am I being respectful with the people I am negotiating with? Am I going out of my way to listen to their concerns and needs with the attempt to understand them instead of the attempt to put them down?The reason authoritarianism, survives in countries like North Korea, Russia, China, and Iran is that these were countries that never experienced real freedom, the way America has. Because of that, I do not think authoritarianism is going to work here. Every American has experienced freedom of speech. We want to be able to put down our opponents. To call them names. I dont think were gonna ever give that up. Either side.I dont think America is a country of patsies. And there are more guns in this country than there are Americans. I appreciate the Republicans talking about the things that matter to them. Immigration is huge. Its a real problem. Student college loans are real problem. Jobs and labor are real problems. Womens reproductive health and abortions present real societal challenges, and solutions that meet both sides in the middle have to be found.For me, humans are too susceptible to allow anyone human the responsibility for my own well-being. I dont care if that person is a democrat or a Republican. I dont want them making decisions that affect my life because they may have conflicts of interest or differences of opinion about the things that are incredibly important to me. What I like about the American system we have in place is the that the judicial, the executive, and the legislative branches of government all balance each other out and keep each other in check. Or at least thats supposed to be whats happening isnt it?I like this system. This American system. Its messy, we have to go through this nightmare every four years of a presidential election, we have to elect our representatives, and vote on the initiatives that are presented before us. It takes a lot of time, money and effort. It would be so much easier and cleaner for just one person in authority to make all the decisions for us and then we could just get on with our lives. The problem is it is usually the person thats in charge has a different agenda than many of the people who are being governed. If thats half or a slightly over half of the country its going to be a real problem.Like right now in Russia if you have military age men, they are going to be forced to go to Ukraine to fight, and possibly die or be wounded for life. I dont want that in my country. And gun control is much stricter in Russia. And peaceful protest can be punishable by jail time.Theres nothing wrong, in my mind with Medicare for all. I want every American to have high-quality, free, healthcare that supports them in a high quality of life for as long as possible. How would I pay for it? I would start by auditing the damn Pentagon. Ive heard that 62% of the Pentagon budget is unaudited and therefore unknown.  The Pentagon gets one of the largest shares of our tax dollars, I think its a crime that they get to spend it however they want without any oversight. Especially when young and old Americans are dying due to lack of adequate medical care.There are just some thoughts with about a week left to the election.","title":"Jews Flock to Trump Event at Madison Square Garden; Dems: Nazi Rally"},{"text":"Pray up Gas up charge up stock up pray up","title":"Report: Brace for 'Unrest' if Donald Trump Wins, Democrats Warn"},{"text":"do you really expect Trump voters to be capable of thinking?","title":"Do people who vote for Trump based on his economy being better forget there was a global pandemic?"},{"text":"No take the ACT.

Among them are:** $10 million to General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, for a new energy-efficient air conditioning system in Terminal B.    \\n* $9 million to Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in Guam to fund the terminal roof project, which includes the installation and integration of a renewable energy system, including solar photovoltaic panels and components for the safe storage and output of energy to the airport terminal. \\n* $3 million to Columbia Metropolitan Airport in South Carolina to fund a solar photovoltaic array installation and battery electrical storage system to provide a sustainable and resilient power source for the airport terminal.*Several grants contain an element that will go to improving airport access in smaller communities. Among them include:** $2.5 million to Key West International Airport in Florida for a passenger boarding bridge with an elevated walkway and a secure U.S. Customs and Border Protection connection with related hold room improvements.\\n* $1.8 million to Thief River Falls Regional Airport in Minnesota to relocate nearly 500 square feet to optimize space, security, and traffic flow for general aviation users.\\n* $1.6 million to Palau International Airport to replace outdated lighting systems and rebuild an airport access road.\\n* $730,000 to Gallup Municipal Airport in New Mexico to improve the terminal buildings structural integrity, accessibility, and operational effectiveness.\\n* $400,000 to Addington Field Airport in Elizabethtown, Kentucky to renovate and expand the terminal building.-Todays funding is from the Airport Terminal Program, one of three aviation programs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The law provides $1 billion annually for five years for Airport Terminal Program grants. In total, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided a historic $25 billion to modernize our countrys airport infrastructure.Over 100  projects from earlier Airport Terminal Program grant awards have been completed or are nearing completion. Examples of completed projects include: * $14.4 million to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona in 2022 to replace a temporary four gate facility with a permanent five gate modernized ADA compliant terminal. \\n* $11.8 million to Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport in Washington in 2022 to replace the terminal to accommodate larger aircraft and an increase in passengers. The new terminal is equipped with energy efficient systems and meets ADA compliance.\\n* $13.3 million to Key West International Airport in Florida in 2023 to fund a portion of construction for a new airside terminal building equipped with seven passenger boarding bridges and an expanded baggage claim and passenger security screening checkpoint.  \\n* $11 million to Missoula Montana Airport in Montana in 2022 to fund a portion of construction for new energy efficient terminal to support increased demand.President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment in our nations infrastructure and competitiveness by rebuilding Americas roads and bridges, upgrading and expanding public transit and rail, and modernizing the nations ports and airports. To date, the Administration has announced over $500 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for over 63,000 infrastructure projects across the nation and has mobilized nearly $1 trillion in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States.Statement from U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg:Investing in Americas airport infrastructure isnt just about upgrading runways and terminalsits about growing local economies, creating jobs, and ensuring the safety and efficiency of travel, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. With the grants were announcing todaynearly $1 billion in totalwe're helping modernize 125 airports across the country in order to make their operations safer, more accessible, and more convenient for travelers.","title":"Investing In America: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $1 Billion in Funding to Modernize Airport Terminals Across 46 States"},{"text":"Can confirm.

No matter how hard they try to make it Democrats fault, they are not to blame for Trumps assassination attempts. \\nThe idea that Republicans are urging Kamala Harris to tone down her campaign rhetoric is not only hypocritical but demonstrates a selective approach to accountability. For years, Republican leaders have used highly charged and divisive language, often targeting minority groups, undermining democratic processes, and pushing polarizing narratives without restraint. Its striking to see them now attempt to police the tone of Harriss campaign. \\nThe medias responsibility here is to hold all leaders accountable for their words, not just one side. If Republicans genuinely believe rhetoric should be toned down, then they should lead by example. Holding Kamala Harris to a different standard is a disservice to voters and encourages the very divisiveness they claim to oppose.

But does correlation equal causation? This is where we risk the kind of identity essentialism I cautioned against in my OP; the circular logic that suggests \\"Oh, here's a straight white man with a bad idea - how typical of a straight white man, we should therefore be cautious of straight white men and their ideas\\". I'm not saying this is what YOU think, but it is an easy slope to fall down.On top of which; I would hope in my OP I proved that non white men (and, indeed, women) are *more than capable* of having ideas I would assume you'd find abhorrent - in India, for example, their supreme court recently refused to ban marital assault as it would be \\"too stringent\\" on Indian men. Add this to the common belief among British Muslims that homosexuality ought to be recriminalised,  the Taliban shredding women's rights - Never in a million years would I suggest a correlation between \\"brown men\\" and bad ideas -that's exactly the sort of thinking I'm railing against!- but surely it shows the flaws in such thought processes? int when these old men relinquish their grip on power and we allow for new ideas on the political realm, there is no argument that can be made that says we will not be in a better place.But again, this is my point; I hope I have shown the ideas that do emerge may not necessarily be better than what has come before - and that ideas are not tied to race and gender in a meaningful fashion.

Adriano Espaillat and Nydia Velzquez are following up Monday with a press appearance in the diverse neighborhood of East Harlem to condemn the Trump rallys racist and anti-American rhetoric. A source close to the Harris campaign confirmed its urging Latino Democrats to keep speaking out about the Trump rally.The mobilization by Latino Democrats signals that the party sees Hinchcliffes remarks potentially breaking through with undecided voters in the final week before the election, as Trump and Kamala Harris are neck and neck in most polls. Harris campaign amplified the contrast between her own release of a specific plan to assist Puerto Rico hours before the Trump rally.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/latino-democrats-keep-amplifying-trump-rally-remarks-about-garbage-puerto-rico?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Harris camp urges Latino Democrats to amplify Trump rally remark about garbage Puerto Rico"},{"text":"That's perfect.

In fact, Reagan did ruin the economy, caused the savings and loan collapse, tripled the deficit and paved the way for fascism. Bush Jr. wasn't just a moron, he was a moron asleep at the wheel when the intel community tried to warn him about 9/11 before it happened, botched the occupation of Afghanistan and fabricated the case for the disastrous invasion of Iraq.

The Democratic Party have taken a long time to realize that. What I mean is that most people, including the Dems, presuppose the whole game is to persuade people to vote for you. What Lee Atwater realized is changing people's minds is hard. But most people will trust the parties for different things and what you do is make your issue that you poll well on salient for the electorate and that'll make low proclivity voters to either vote for your or at least not vote.That's why ALEC (american legislative exchange council)'s president, Paul Weyrich said, \\"I don't want everyone to vote . . . as a matter of fact our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down\\" and on that basis, promulgated 30+ state model codes to make it harder to vote.The Project Redmap of 2010 made it so that even when the Dems do turn out despite the voter supression that the votes don't really matter.

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, some people with high drug costs have their out-of-pocket drug costs capped at around $3,500 in 2024. Next year that cap lowers to $2,000 for everyone with Medicare Part D. The report shows that if the $2,000 cap had been in effect this year, 4.6 million enrollees would have hit the cap by June 30 and would not have to pay any more out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year.  \\n...  \\nPrior to the Inflation Reduction Act, there was no limit to the amount of out-of-pocket drug costs Medicare enrollees might pay for their medication. Out-of-pocket costs for people with Medicare who do not qualify for the low-income subsidy program and need some of the most expensive drugs could total $60,000 per year or more. The Biden-Harris Administration implemented the first ever cap on out-of-pocket drug costs in the programs history on January 1 of this year. Todays initial findings shed light on who has benefitted from this cap as of the first half of the year, and it is expected that additional individuals will benefit over the remainder of 2024. Key findings include:* Nearly 1.5 million Part D enrollees hit the cap by June 30, 2024 and will have no out-of-pocket costs for the remainder of the year.\\n* More than 500,000 people with Medicare Part D who do not qualify for financial subsidies based on income saved a total of $979 million, with average savings of $1,802 per enrollee for the first half of 2024 C with additional savings expected over the remainder of 2024.\\n* California, Florida, New York, and Texas had the highest number of people hitting the cap by midyear among all states. A full state-by-state break down can be found in the reports appendix and on LowerDrugCosts.gov.\\n* Younger enrollees, American Indian and Alaska Natives, and African Americans hit the cap at higher rates compared to other enrollees.\\n* People who need cancer drugs had particularly high costs in the first half of the year.\\n* If the $2,000 cap, which will go into effect next year, had been in effect this year, about 4.6 million people would have hit the cap by June 30.The out-of-pocket drug cap is a major benefit of the Biden-Harris lower cost prescription drug law, but it is not the only provision lowering drug costs for people with Medicare. The Administration has lowered out-of-pocket costs on Medicare Part B drugs each quarter    thanks to the laws Inflation Rebate program, which penalizes drug companies for raising their prices faster than inflation, incentivizing them to keep their prices low. Additionally, the law caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month for covered products, and makes recommended vaccines, like shingles and RSV, free to everyone with Medicare Part D, an especially important benefit as we enter respiratory virus season.The lower cost prescription drug law also allows Medicare, for the first time ever, to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower the prices of some of the most expensive and most commonly used prescription drugs. In August, the Administration announced the completion of the first round of the negotiation program, resulting in new, lower prices for all 10 of the selected drugs. Beginning in 2026, lower prices ranging from 38 percent to 79 percent off of list prices will take effect for these drugs.And, the Inflation Reduction Act locks in savings on health insurance premiums that are saving millions of Americans hundreds of dollars per year on health insurance. These cost-saving measures have helped contribute to record low uninsured rates under the Biden-Harris Administration.  \\n...Statement from White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden:By capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare Part D, President Biden and Vice President Harris have saved 1.5 million seniors nearly $1 billion in the first half of this year alone, said White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden. Starting next year, with a new $2,000 cap, were expected to save 19 million seniors, and others on Medicare, an additional $7.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs. Thats real change, delivered. Todays announcement once again illustrates President Biden and Vice President Harris unwavering commitment to lowering drug costs for seniors and all Americans. While Republicans continue to try to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and thereby raise prescription drug costs for all seniors, the President and Vice President will never stop fighting to ensure that no senior has to choose between life-saving prescriptions, or any other essentials, ever again.","title":"Biden-Harris Administrations Inflation Reduction Act Saves Medicare Enrollees Nearly $1 Billion in Just the First Half of 2024"},{"text":"It's almost like we live in a capitalist system and therefore have to do capitalist activities?

He was indeed in the Georgia weeds, and since I was deep in the PA weeds, it was appreciated! My weeds were more outliers--my mom, a Republican, was one of the nearly 30k people given incorrect ballots in Western PA. They did not send her a corrected one, and she didn't feel safe to go in person (big bad respiratory issues, no vaccine yet), but there was a Whole Thing to do with those ballots.Basically, of the ones they supposedly sent out that were corrected, *those* would have to be counted instead of the previous one sent out, for each person, but not everyone would have a new one on the day or mailed. They decided to count them last, on Friday evening, with a sworn-in panel--because it was possible to track down the names of the people who got the wrong ballots, and that would meant they were much easier to fake. So I think the process was to find all of those particular voters' ballots, then match up the 'corrected' ones to the originals, and then meticulously check each one to be sure they were the right person, and THEN count them.It meant that my mom's vote for Biden was one of the last ones counted, and technically among the votes that put him over the top, but it was definitely stressful worrying about whether it would be counted at all.edit: I did a quick twitter search for an image of the ballot, I posted about it multiple times but this is the easiest one that I found: [November 5, 2020](https://x.com/darsynia/status/1324417724433551360)","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Chair Spots Turnout Detail That Explains Why 'We're Very Confident'"},{"text":"That depressing, repeating pattern...

Pilots have to analyze and adjust twice as many instruments while going more than twice as fast, with an extra spacial dimension, all while constantly changing orientation. Easily more than twice as difficult.\\n3. Lap times are just as close in air racing as motorsport, and the stakes are so high that you're not allowed to clear stakes by mere millimeters, not that it would save time anyway. When each lap is as long as an entire F1 race, you need to be shaving meters off your competition for that 1ms advantage. The pilot is also the mechanic, and a single mistake isn't just race ending or even career ending, it's nearly guaranteed to be life ending. Per capita, air racers have the highest mortality and most career in all of racing. Air racing is the sport with the lowest margin for error, end of discussion.

How do you guys know what information is true and what isnt?The trick isn't to think you have to know all the things and that's impossible. It's actually figuring out the right questions, evaluate the claims/warrants, evaluate what do people benefit from, and then come to a conclusion.Let's take Trump's take on tariffs. Trump talked about it in the Joe Rogan podcast, and he insists that tariffs are paid for by the foreign countries. How tariffs actually work: it's paid for by the importers (so American companies). Here's a primer that comes from the Congressional Research Service - they provide information and explainers to Congress: [https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11030](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11030)So what we already know is that if Trump is confused on how the thing works, then we know that the benefits he claims that will occur are faulty since achieving a benefit is reliant on the thing working in the way you think it will. We also have a record of how things worked out. When Trump was in office, he did raise tariffs and the EU raised retaliatory tariffs. We already know from US history that this happens and which is why free trade agreements have been the way to raise the economy since the 19th century. What we also know is that the Trump administration had to use the federal government to give aid/subsidies to those negatively impacted by such policies such as farmers.

I am not sure what the explanation of these inconsistencies will eventually turn out to be; but I suspect that the deeper reason for this loyalty to a typical nineteenth-century doctrine has something to do with the concept of **Progress**, with the unwillingness to part with this notion that has always united Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, but has nowhere reached the level of plausibility and sophistication we find in the writings of Karl Marx. **(For inconsistency has always been the Achilles heel of liberal thought; it combined an unswerving loyalty to Progress with a no less strict refusal to look upon History in Marxian and Hegelian terms, which alone could justify this belief.)**NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS, **A Special Supplement: Reflections on Violence,** Hannah Arendt FEBRUARY 27, 1969 ISSUE.

Soccer players require lots of physically demanding things. They need to be able to go from zero to a high sprint in no time. They also need to be able to stay focused for around 2 hours at a time. Few breaks. If they lose focus, they could give the other team a goal. They also have to endure jet lag. It's not uncommon for one week to be in Europe and the very next week they have to be in Asia. Also, it's an entire team of players that must by in peak physical condition.\\n2. Soccer players, need to be constantly making adjustments and analyzing. They are one of the most important bits of data the team could get. And they have to make adjustments on the fly. If you watch soccer players approaching a goalie, you can see the goalie making minute adjustments to where they think the ball will go milliseconds before the ball is kicked.\\n3. Precision. Soccer is all about precision. Players need to be extremely precise when they play, especially when running with the ball. They need to find a tiny hole between the defense, goalies, and net; thread the ball through to the goal, and if they make a single mistake it can be game ending. It's not just the players as well. Soccer teams have coaches, etc on the sidelines analyzing the field, the opposing team, the players, etc to help give their team the win.Your view is all about the way you presented the facts. Your facts aren't wrong, they just aren't particularly unique to motorsports.Also, I'll just tack on here at the end, while driving a F1 car for 2 hours is certainly demanding, as an amateur ask yourself: would you rather drive a car for 2 hours straight or play soccer for 2 hours straight?

Marx says this is how human societies operate and change, he says his ideas (historical materialism) are essentially a science. he doesn't say these are my political ideas or my take on capitalism. He says this is the objective truth and the reality, all I am doing it is exploring and explaining it so that we -as humanity- can transcend the limitations imposed on us and create a society free of shackles of any kind.\\nThis makes Marxism a modernist philosophy, as it presents a grand narrative and claim to objective truth. Post-modernism on the other hand questions possibility of an objective truth beyond social or historical dynamics. They suggests everything we think we know for sure is actually only one possible interpretation or one possible way out of many. Which interpretation we take as the objective truth depends a lot on who has power in our societies and how that power operates (hence their focus on power) Post-modernism rejects all grand narratives (any story that is universal and certain about who things are - exactly like the one Marx proposes), and instead focus on deconstructing such narratives to see the power dynamics that created them in the first place (not all post-modernists do this though).Yes they are both interested in power because post-modernists think power dynamics is at the core of the way we see or interpret things. Marx's interest in power is about understanding its sources and about how to wrestle it from the hands of capitalists for the working classes. They are both interested in capitalism; since we live in a capitalists world post modernists think it shapes our systems of knowledge, morality, and all other social relations. Marx is interested in capitalism to understand its workings and to see how its inherent contradictions will eventually result in its collapse and the establishment of a utopic social order. It is a hard sell to be a Marxist while not believing in the grand narrative of historical materialism, and as hard sell to be a post-modernist and have certainty and belief in a singular path that human history unfolds.This is very surface of course but I hope this helps a bit.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.
