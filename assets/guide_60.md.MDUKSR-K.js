I totally get you on how it upsetting it is to feel like people are talking down to you. I see folks in this thread telling you that you're being manipulated, etc.; I hear your story about being told you're sexist for disliking Captain Marvel. I can see why that feels unfair and frustrating. I also agree that it's not OK to demonize white people (or any group of people). Nobody's better or worse than anyone else just because of their skin color. At the same time, it sounds like you think the biggest problem in video gaming is \\"wokism\\", but... remember just how awful gaming culture was for women, 10 or 15 years ago?I watch a variety of competitive video game streamers, some of them women. One of them, 15 years ago, played in a regional tournament, sponsored by Blizzard, in which another team named themselves \\"rape\\" and then her name. She was 17 at the time. That wasn't a fluke; look up basically any female streamer and you can find them sharing horror stories about just how toxic gaming was for women not long ago.Sequels are becoming ever more popular with film and video game developers because they're \\"safe\\". It's risky to make new IP. That's a discouraging trend, and it seems more like the real problem to me than \\"wokism\\" in film. Put another way: which is worse, an actually very talented black actress getting cast as a mermaid - a fictional being - in the live-action Little Mermaid... or the fact that Disney has spent billions on relatively uninspired live-action versions of all its greatest hits?As recently as 2010, according to the?[Hollywood Diversity Report](https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2023-Film-3-30-2023.pdf), about 10% of lead actors were nonwhite, while 40% of Americans were nonwhite.?In other words, 14 years ago, nearly half of Americans weren't white, but almost all the leading roles went to white people. That seems actually kinda messed up. Also, at the time, 75% of lead actors were men - do you remember when it used to be \\"common knowledge\\" in Hollywood that men wouldn't watch movies with female leads? And we know now about all the sexual assaults and stuff going on behind the scenes (Weinstein &amp; co)...Anyway, I guess I think this is one reason why you're running up against pushback. If you're talking about how everything's gotten so much worse with all the \\"wokism\\", then some folks will hear that as you saying, \\"wasn't it so much better when pretty much all the lead actors were white, and it was OK to harass girls while playing online games?\\". I realize that's not what you're saying, but they'll *hear* it that way, because to them, \\"wokism\\" is just people trying to make games and movies more equal.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"thank god, some small victories","title":"BREAKING: The recount is done in North Carolina's supreme court race: Democratic Justice Allison Riggs won the race by 734 votes over GOP challenger Jefferson Griffin."},{"text":"Say what you want about the tenants of SERIAL CHEATING AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE, dude, at least its an ethos.","title":"Trump's Defense Secretary Pick Pete Hegseth Had Five Affairs During First Marriage, Report Claims"},{"text":"Did anybody ever find out if Gaetz injected Botox directly into his eyeballs before the 2024 RNC, or was that look on purpose?","title":"House Democrat to force floor vote this week to release Matt Gaetz ethics report"},{"text":"Isn't Elon already doing that ?","title":"Zuckerberg wants active role in crafting Trump administrations tech policy"},{"text":"Not if they just shuffle it into a private investment cash cow.

Not even in her 30 seconds of telling us what shed do in between the these are the reasons Trump bad statements could she come up with something independent of talking points that Trump controlled. Her giving us more tangible solutions to Trump talking points such as immigration and cost of living is just how she, *again*, insists on chasing moderate republicans. She was just being Donald Trump with extra steps. Again: Universal healthcare. Arms embargo on Israel. Radical action on climate change. Free college. These are things that progressives care about. If you cant tell me policies of your own accord without spending time kowtowing to Trumps garbage, then Im not interested. Shifting the Democratic Party even further right by appealing to people concerned about fake conservative problems is not a convincing strategy. And you say that she was let down by her ties to the current administration as if that wasnt her fucking fault. *DOZENS* of times, she was asked how she would do things differently than Biden. Every single motherfucking time she said that she wouldnt have done a thing different. She seriously fucking thought that the only reason we were fed up with Biden was his physical age. The frustration will continue until democrats look inward and blame themselves for their incompetence. Or until they are replaced by a progressive party. No longer are voters satisfied with voting between mean conservatives and kind conservatives. Its a fucking joke. Kamala Harris was just the temporary face of it the democrats issues. I personally do not care if the democrats end up turning into a progressive party, or if they keep clawing into the long-dead horse of neoliberalism as they predictably lose more elections, after which they pretend to be so confused about all of the factors of their loss. America will shift left and finally catch up with the rest of the developed world.

But doing it like this makes it look like the FBI agents who raided Mar a Lago and the people who cooperated with the J6 Committee (or who were on it) are all being hung out to dry, and that the country may descend into madness, but at least Hunter will be OK, even though he in fact did break the laws he's been convicted of breaking.

(This is not supposed to be a \\"but both sides are bad\\" equivalence fallacy, but if you take it that way, I can't stop you.) The left-leaning media likes to take sound bites of what Trump (and liberal US leaders for that matter) says out of context too and play them to their base to scare and enrage them (the conservatives are doing this too and it isn't really anything new for either group, it's just how they work). One of the biggest issues over the past 15 years has been the unintentional creation of safe spaces for liberals and conservatives where you don't have to hear the other side's opinion because you don't like it.

Also, states made it easier to vote by mail, vote early, drive through voting, etc, that likely led to additional participation that might not come out now that many of those programs are no longer available.Then you have Biden 2020 voters who werent motivated to vote for either candidate. Biden was not popular in 2024, and Harris was (for better or worse) seen as a continuation of Bidens policies. But they also dont like Trump. Some of this group likely ended up holding their nose and voting for Harris, some likely held their nose and voted for Trump, and some percentage likely voted for neither. This idea that losing around 6 million voters between 2020 and 2024 - looking at the actual context of both elections - proves that dems cheated in 2020 is silly. It was predictable. In 2020 the democratic base was highly motivated to come out and vote, and that also brought out some number of undecideds voting for Biden.

He also was very lenient with protesting during the height of BLM believing it a constitutional right, while noting that anyone who takes it too far and begins causing destruction/violence would face punishment.Seemed to me like he had reasonable approaches to law enforcement and takes his job seriously.

Will the MAGAts lose seats immediately? No. But over time as representation is more accurate they will lose their seats as historically they have not been the popular party. Republicans have been at this for decades. We don't start now we'll never catch up.You gave an example of where New York **lost** its battle for anti gerrymandering, but what do you expect?

Manufacturing is not that important anymore and is not as valuable as most other things the workers could be doing. Just like farming is not that valuable anymore as an economic pursuit when compared to the economy as a whole. Countries should do what their best at and let other countries do what they are best at to make everyone as rich as possible. Just think about how many manufacturing jobs have been lost. How manufacturing is now a relatively small part of the US economy.  It has not mattered at all. The US was 25% of the world's GDP in 1980 and after the manufacturing jobs left the US still is 25% of the world's GPD. We are as rich as we have ever been. The US is by far the wealthiest country on earth. It turns out designing the i phone or NVDA chips but not manufacturing them is much more valuable. The US still manufacture things though. We are 2nd in the world by manufacturing by value at 16% of the worlds goods. The US over time has consumed less and less manufactured goods compared to the economy in total. It will only continue till it's like farmimg. Basically, it is econically irrelevant. The only reason to keep some sort of manufacturing base is for national security purposes not for economic reasons. Basically the more manufacturing jobs the US has in general the US economy will be worse off and smaller than it would of otherwise been. The craziest thing is the handful of manufacturing plants that I am aware of in my local area are all staffed with immigrants. The more manufacturing plants that are opened the more it attracts immigrants not native born Americans. I don't really have a problem with that. Though why don't the immigrants just stay in their country manufacture the goods there and ship the goods here. Rather than importing workers to make the stuff here. I would assume most poeple would rather just stay where they are if they had good jobs back home. Here is the economic explanation why it makes sense not to bring manufacturing back to the US and why it will make us poorer.\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage","title":"Trump's tariffs would 'spell disaster' for GM, Ford  and the rest of the auto industry"},{"text":"Considering how trump picks the worst possible person for each position, his DEA picks likely have ties to the cartels.","title":"Trumps pick for DEA administrator withdraws from consideration"},{"text":"This is not true.

Its a simple and clear vision that he kept repeating. Harris talked about several specific plans to help lower costs and cut price gouging. Data analysis of her campaign shows she actually backed off economic messages as time went on, to the point of almost never bringing up taxes on the wealthy or her child tax credit and small business tax deductions. Trump was discussing the high cost of living more than twice as often, and Harris discussed the economy less than Biden in 2020.Her price gouging was evaluated as probably having little to no effect by economists, which is in line with her rhetoric that most companies are trying to do good and shed just go after a few bad actors, as well as in line with her refusing to comment on whether shed continue to pursue ongoing antitrust cases after privately meeting with CEOs of involved companies.She moved to the right of Biden.

However, the intention was not to give one side or the other the ability to stop meaningful legislation beneficial to the American people, but rather to promote the ability for both sides to work together for the benefit of the American people. An example of a bipartisan effort was when the ACA was saved. The ACA remains overwhelmingly popular across both sides of the electorate &amp; if it is gutted, there better be something better to take its place or the party responsible for its termination will without a doubt pay in future elections. During this election cycle I only heard one side expressing an interest at working with the other offering a seat at the table for those willing to make a bipartisan effort to find solutions that might improve the lives of Americans.? The key factor in this last election was the economy, particularly when it comes to inflation, which is logically the biggest concern for Americans before anything else. Whether the actual numbers reflected overall sentiment when it came to this issue is another debate.

Firstly, I definitely appreciate that it gives the voters a chance to vote for someone who is unlikely to win while also making sure their vote counts by voting for a stronger candidate.However, there's one thing that kinda bothers me, say if Candidate A gets 60% votes and 80% of the Candidate A voters also vote for Candidate B, whereas Candidate B gets 40% votes and only 20% of the Candidate B voters vote for Candidate A, then although Candidate B has 40% + 80%  60% = 88% voter support, Candidate A wins the race with only 60% + 20%  40% = 68% of the voter support. For the system named Rank Choice Voting, only the Candidate C voters actually get to vote for multiple candidates while the Candidate A and B voters get to vote for only one.I feel like Instant Runoff Voting (an alternate term from Wikipedia) is a more accurate term for RCV? Because essentially RCV assumes the Candidate A and B voters would vote for the same candidate again, and it is, say the Candidate C voters, whose distribution decide which candidate reaches the 50% mark, and RCV saves that extra runoff election.What do you guys think?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 3, 2024"},{"text":"I want Biden to do more actions like this on his way out.

People want to blame Democrats or Republicans, the left or the right, or presidents over inflation, but the fact of the matter is that your money is being printed into Oblivion, and there's nothing to stop it.\\nThree, value means different things to different people.

Is it fair to them to have access to cryptocurrency removed??\\nThe fact of the matter is that ignorance continues to drive the use of fiat currencies. The currencies that you call real are controlled by a mafia of banks. Your money loses value everyday and you see it in the grocery store, you see it at the gas station, you see it in your rent, you see it in your education, you see it in the cost to heat your home, you see it in your automobiles, you see it in the service industry, and on and on and on.

Dems seem to have an inclination towards infighting and mudslinging when in power in a way that Republicans generally don't (on a governmental scale - largely omitting the antics from this most recent House session).For one example look at Biden's student loan relief plan, you had centrist dems blasting him for 'giving handouts' or 'solving this the wrong way' when it was announced, and progressives shitting all over him and calling him a liar when it got blocked by SCOTUS.There was obviously a similar dynamic with the Israel/Palestine conflict over the past year - regardless of what he did, he would have taken (very public, vocal) flak from half the party; either moderates shame him for abandoning an ally and 'allowing terrorism' (or worse - lobbing antisemitism allegations), or progressives loudly denigrate him as 'Genocide Joe' for not making Israel stop bombing Gaza. I think it just boils down to a much higher willingness to publicly and loudly critique your own party on the side of the Democrats than the Republicans. I'm sure the age-old 'big tent problem' plays into it as well.But bottom line is you just don't see Republican elected officials catching heat from their voters like that. When Trump did something Republicans typically don't like ('grab em by the pussy', comments about vets, 'take the guns first, due process later', etc), both voters and elected officials had this uncanny ability to look you in your eyes and just say \\"well **I don't agree with him** on that\\", before pivoting the conversation to the points they *do* agree on.Democrats just can't do that. They can't just let there be a disagreement between themselves and the other member of the party they disagree with. They have to go out of their way to *convince you* that *their* view of the situation is correct, and [insert Democrat]'s views/actions are incorrect and even actively harmful. Which, on the one hand - can be seen as a positive; holding our elected officials accountable and trying to build support for change. But on the other, it leads to every major figure in the Democratic party having like a 30% approval rating, because every Republican dislikes them *as well as* a huge chunk of Democrats.

If another candidate won, Musk's wealth and status would likely collapse. Over the last 15 years he has lived in the US, his actions and manipulative tactics reveal him as a sociopath operating on a different level. The facts speak for themselves.1. Since 2010, Elon Musk has built his reputation as a Tesla's genius innovator, but the truth is much less flattering. **Tesla wasnt his creation**it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who developed the company before Musk staged a hostile takeover and branded himself as its mastermind. 2. Similarly, **SpaceXs achievements rest on the expertise of brilliant engineers, many from NASA,** while Musks actual technical contributions are negligible. His real talent lies in hijacking and marketing other peoples work to inflate his own image.3. Most recently, Musks **chaotic purchase and handling of Twitter** has revealed his reckless, self-serving nature. Rather than improving the platform, hes created dysfunction and controversy, driven by an obsession with control and attention.  **Even threatening other countries around the globe he would meddle in their elections.  What a pathetic unAmerican piece of shit.** Far from a visionary, Musk is an opportunist who thrives on taking credit for the brilliance of others while leaving chaos in his wake.  X and Tesla have been in serious decline since 2022. Musk will bribe him at any cost and ferociously glue himself and sellout God till the end.  There is no way Musk will allow himself to be kicked to the curb.

Edit:? I'll give you a little context since the propaganda machine that's feeding your information clearly hasn't given you any of this. The electrical grid, across the entirety of the planet, produces more energy than it needs to prevent brown and blackouts. The electrical grid itself wastes energy. Bitcoin, which I assume you're talking about when you mention the word Crypto, uses that excess energy to help stabilize the grid, and cuts back operations when energy is necessary, to again, stabilize the grid.? Additionally, Bitcoin incentivizes green energy due to mining facilities not surviving unless they're using very efficient energy sources, so mining technology is consistently pushing for more efficient energy, typically at the fringes of power supply chains. This is why you see Bitcoin mining facilities in the desert using solar, in third world Nations using hydroelectric. You also see Bitcoin mining facilities in places like Finland, where the heat generated by the mining facilities is used to heat entire towns.?

While it's not true that they're \\"unabashed racists, misogynist and homophobes\\", if you listen to what voters are saying, they have an aggressive revulsion to having to engage with the existence of LGBT people. It's not \\"I hate you for being LGBT\\", it's \\"I don't care what about you, but I don't want to ever have to see, hear or think about you or your issues\\".Its so easy to say, Poor folks have it rough. I know that, and I hate that, and were going to do something about it.

If they try to appeal more to centrists, they lose the left to apathy, if they try to appeal to the left, they lose the centrists to the republicans. The democrats don't have a united base that is capable of challenging republicans, and that's only going to get worse, as the global wave of right wing populism is only showings signs of acceleration.The democrats have two choices1. If they want to win elections in the short term, they need to win back the working class \\"centre\\" by going populist right wing. Completely abandon all progressive values except abortion and workers rights, because those are only two stances they have that are more popular than what the republicans are offering. People won't just trust them on this, so they will need to make a show of severing themselves from progressive advocacy by aggressively throwing LGBT people, under the bus. This will win them back the working class vote, and a portion of progressives will still vote for them just on abortion and workers rights.2. If they don't want to wholesale abandon progressive values, they need to start planning for 2036.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Gun ownership is legal in Canada.You just need to be licensed, and there are strict controls on what guns you're allowed to own and where you're allowed to use them.You know, \\"basic precautions so you don't have jackholes whipping out AR-15s during road rage episodes\\".","title":"Trump suggested Canada could become 51st state to Justin Trudeau: report"},{"text":"I'm not demotivated because he won by a landslide.

It really does boil down to \\"they're one of the *good ones*\\". (And I might also argue there's also a large dollop of \\"See? Even the blacks hate the blacks\\" and \\"It's not racist if *he's* saying it too, so stop calling me racist\\" in there too.)[Racially resentful white voters prefer staunchly conservative black candidates over similar white candidates.](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/708952)\\"The racially resentful see such black candidates so differently as to utterly shift their reactions from opposition to support.\\"Edit: The ironic part of this is that their dislike of black culture and support of black people that act like they do is only even a thing because initial segregation forced black people into the far edges of American culture which resulted in the creation/magnification of their own culture by necessity/incidence. If former slaves were accepted with open arms, brought into the fold as equals from the get-go, the vast majority of black people would be viewed as something like \\"the good ones\\" to (many) of those ding-dongs.If you went into a parallel reality where the confederate south did a full 180 instead of spitefulness at the now-freed slaves, pulled out a random handful of well-adjusted/culturally-included included black people to show to the former conservatives from our reality, they'd probably be astounded by \\"how lucky ya'll are yours ain't criminals n' shit\\".Even more ironically, the racists that made their local areas so shitty for non-whites are often astounded to run into a college educated black person in a way that many more liberal citizens don't even find remarkable. I've heard them say shit like, \\"Damn, if all the blacks in my neck of the woods was like you, I'd be able to leave my car unlocked haha\\". ...Like, bro. They *could* all be like that if you weren't so busy treating keeping other people down as some sort of sociocultural personal passion project. I digress.

It should be the norm, because it actually leads to better debates once some people get past \\"haha youre a nerd\\". This strategy loses to inauthentic simplicity. But if everyone adopts that because it wins, you just managed to normalize half-truths.The fact is voting is a responsibility. When things are bad, opportunities to be free are once in a lifetime and people agonize over what to do, taking it extremely seriously. But in modern free democracies, some people treat voting like a game. They vote to \\"try something new for a change\\" or to protest another person, oblivious to the blood shed to obtain their rights, the consequences, the potential for tragedy. And coddling them even more will just make this worse.\\"Winning\\" shouldnt come at the cost of people feeling responsible. People should spend long hours researching every election, want every syllable possible in a word if it makes it more precise, or follow the advice of experts when this is unpractical. This is what voting is. Voting because you resonate with a punchline is the epitome of entitlement and irresponsibility. We should never normalize this.

They also definitely notice because its everywhere, its in the rainbow arm bands in what ever sports team they are watching, its in the race swaps in tv shows, its their favourite artists statements on contentious political issues.Moreover the orgs and people who want to push this stuff are some of the best marketers in the world and spend hundreds of millions a year to do so, its preposterous to think that they despite being able to get attention for all kinds of other shit that they wouldn't get attention for this.For example ask anyone who says people are cutting off little kids genitals what the steps are for a child to transition.

Take the classic example of racism, the woke belive racism only exist as an expression of white social power through racial discrimination, whereas most people just believe its only racial discrimination. Moreover they define it as such because the woke believe that how words are defined can be used to change implicit bias, therefore they do this to achieve the aim of toppling the white supremacist western order. Yet when a woke person calls something racist however they leave all of this out, which if you scale this up to the whole ideology leaves the avg person who doesn't have time to investigate this nonsense unable to completely articulate the ideology because the woke intentionally never plainly describe it.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Touche, he is the logical choice","title":"Who will perform at Donald Trumps inauguration?"},{"text":"I'm hope there are cameras on every sign and they prosecute any vandalism to the fullest extent of the law...

It's an interesting thing because the kind of patriotism you find **within** the military is a very different thing you find outside of it. Same for the type of conservativism that exists within the military.  \\n  \\nCulturally, the people most likely to join are either the very poor (myself when I joined) or the very 'patriotic' in the civilian sense. So, there is a large mixture of nationalistic-type conservatives and non-conservatives who are just there for the 'king's gold', so to speak.    \\nBecause of this - bootcamp, SOI, and the various schoolhouse phases that non-infantry go through all spend **enormous effort** to supplant the culture and identity you had before; replacing it with the culture of the service you're going into.   \\n  \\nThis degradation of personal identity has all of its own problems, of course, but the outcome is largely the same. The person who comes out of that training identifies strongly with the service and sees themselves as part of a greater whole. So while the culture of the military is conservative in a literal sense (it progresses very slowly), and often in the political sense too (since the military is a tool used by the political and capital elite of our nation to inflict its will on other nations) - that culture is **strongly** based in the idea of sovereignty for the American nation and freedom for the American citizen.Those who's foundations would be most susceptible to interference, in my eyes, are the people who have been in long enough for the stars and stripes to wear off, but not long enough for the deeper sense of military pride and service to set in yet. The more senior e3 and more junior e4 layers who are nearing the end of their first enlistment or have only just reenlisted.While this is a huge amount of the population in the military, these levels make tactical decisions, not strategic. They do not decide what needs to get done, when, or by whom. They only decide how a given thing will be done on the ground level once given the context and goal state by their superiors. So even if there was a state of unrest, these elements lack the experience and would have a difficult time coordinating or executing any meaningful dissent. Especially with the risks as high as they are in a structure that tolerates **no** dissent.   \\n  \\nThis is also additionally unlikely since America hasn't been doing active combat deployments for quite some time. I got out after two tours in Iraq, but even then I knew my junior marines would never see combat. Now we're 2 or 3 generations past that. Many of the people who enlisted in the last four years won't get more than 1 or 2 ribbons and none will see combat experience. Every one of their Staff NCOs and above has likely fired a gun in anger before - and there is a massive gulf between the enlisted who have and the enlisted who haven't when it comes to command presence and confrontation. These salty lance corporals don't actually want smoke ??All that to say, I think American Military culture does an intentionally good job of insulating itself from the type of personality-cult that is becoming more problematic on a global stage right now. Love of democracy and freedom is endemic to its nature. The heads in charge won't allow it. It would be an incredibly embarrassing failure for the people who style themselves as sheepdogs and not wolves.","title":"Blue States Will Not Be Safe in Our Corrupt, Clownish, Authoritarian Future: The Trump administration will seek vengeance against any state that tries to resist the spread of crony capitalism."},{"text":"We were told there would be no math","title":"Trump Has Lost His Popular-Vote Majority"},{"text":"Odds are, if they're so disengaged they don't already know that's false, they're not going to a protest.","title":"Hey MAGA boomers Trump lied to you, are you surprised ?

You're right, the country is full of irrational people. Yes, a rational person would vote for Harris over Trump. However, most people voting do not closely follow politics, or understand globalization, trade, defense, etc. They're people who are voting for whoever delivers the clearest message.Take my parents, as an example. My dad is an Italian immigrant - he moved to NYC when he was 13. He's as MAGA as they come (though he'll tell you he's not, he just thinks Trump is more honest). My dad follows the stock market, he thinks it's the key indicator for the US economy. In his mind, we should return to a more mercantilist economy because it will create more jobs and make us less reliant on other countries. He doesn't understand tariffs at all. Trump's message of tariffs was that other countries would pay for them. When I explained how tariffs worked, he got really confused. 'If US companies pay the tariff, then how do costs go down for Americans?' I then told him (and showed him evidence) that those around Trump admitted that costs will go up until they go down. I then explained the goals of tariffs and when they make sense. Finally, he said that tariffs, in this instance, sound like a bad idea with so many people suffering. He wished he understood how they worked before the election. I reminded him that I tried to explain it and he told me I was wrong.What's the point of this story? It's about messaging. Even though Trump told lie after lie, he boiled down complex topics into understandable bites. 'The US pays too much, I'm going to enact tariffs so other countries will pay higher taxes to export goods to the US until they lower the costs.' That's total bullshit, but it's easily understandable and digestible. Dems, by contrast, always seem to be talking down to people and/or overexplaining - hell, I do this sometimes without thinking. The Democratic party seems to have a huge problem explaining complex problems simply to the general public. Like, every dem ad following tariffs should have said something like:\\"DJT has promised to enact 25-60% tariffs on goods from all countries. Tariffs are paid by American companies and will effectively raise the costs of goods by 25-60%. Vote with your wallet, say not to tariffs and no to DJT.\\"","title":"Trump falls just below 50% in popular vote, but gets more than in past elections"},{"text":"I feel like a more appropriate last quote would have been: \\"And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!\\"","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 3, 2024"},{"text":"I know.

The reason the plea deal has been discussed ad nauseam at this point, and you ding dongs still just keep spouting bullshit lies. It's like the idiot Trump supporters that believed immigrants were eating people's pets. Here is a recently published NYTimes article that discusses it - ([free version](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/biden-pardon-political-pressure.html)), ([paid version](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/us/politics/inside-hunter-biden-plea-deal.html)). Also, the judge didn't deliver a guilty verdict for this trial either. It was a jury trial. Republicans have shown they're willing to ignore norms to go after himBased on what evidence? The lie you're claiming as fact stated above? What norms are being ignored to go after him? so it's not exactly a stretch to think that they'd weaponise it against someone they're already targeting.Do you not know what double jeopardy is? Its a clause in the 5th amendment that prevents a person from being tried for the same crime twice. It also prevents further punishments to be levied once sentencing has been passed.

Take a look: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-democratic-party-platform. The official party platform spent 6 paragraphs discussing trans people out of a 92 page document. And those paragraphs only discuss what Biden did already to reverse harmful policies enacted by Trump.It's not something they advertised extensively on either. The people who won't stop talking about trans people are on the Republicans who blasted the air waves with anti-trans propaganda non-stop for months on end. The narrative that Democrats have gone off the deep end with trans advocacy is rightwing propaganda.So this notion of throwing us under the bus to win more votes is a) not feasible, because there's nothing they had planned beyond protecting rights we already had, b) antithetical to Democratic values, and c) ineffective, because there's no way removing those six paragraphs would have changed the outcome of the election.I'm curious to know what _you_ think the Democrats should have done differently regarding trans people.","title":"What it means to prepare for the future of trans health care under Trump"},{"text":"Take it from an American.

Already a big contradiction there. As to whether voters wanted her to attack Trump, the polling evidence throughout the election suggests exactly the opposite. Here's a link that is reflective of almost all the polling produced saying that people actually wanted Harris to talk about her policies, rather than attacking Trump. She called him a fascist, she called him a rapist, a fraudster, all of the things, and that moved the needle not at all. Why you think doing it on stage would be any different, when he could just call her a nasty woman spewing lies and accusations, is beyond mehttps://www.vox.com/politics/365833/trump-harris-walz-weird-2024-election-voters-biden-poll-attack-messagingAs to Trump being at ease among uneducated voters, he literally never saw them. He never did events where he was meeting people, or speaking to them. All he did were rambling rallies and right-wing manosphere podcasts. He was one of the most sheltered candidates in history, because any time he talked to anyone who wasn't a total sycophant, he was laughably out of touch. The only risks he took were spewing his steam of consciousness out at rallies and lying over and over and over again.As I've said in another comment: Personally, I think the Democratic party has long-suffered from their corporate bootlicking and unwillingness to embrace true labor-forward, social-democratic policies that will benefit the American people at large. But to do that would be to be a different party. That's not a messaging problem, it's an identity problem. Not to mention that this approach is basically that of Bernie Sanders, who has been the constant victim for right-wing lies and fear mongering around socialism.The story of this election is not one of messaging. It's that the Democrats abandoned their working class roots during the Clinton administration, and therefore cannot inspire the loyalty of those groups automatically. So when a once in a lifetime pandemic comes around that increases prices, they cannot win those groups back, because they are unwilling to 1) support policies that involve dramatic government spending and intervention in the economy and 2) lie blatantly, shamelessly, and repeatedly, like the Republicans.If this boils down to messaging, then the only lesson that the Democrats can learn from this election is that the American people prefer to be manipulated by promises of impossible things, demonization of outsider groups, and manufactured outrage, rather than being given the honest truth or good faith (if imperfect) solutions.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Its only a minority of incels GenZers!","title":"Trump threatens a 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they abandon U.S. dollar"},{"text":"No they won't.

If the American people re-elected Trump like Jackson got re-elected - then we as a people must believe that's who and what America is as our political identity right now.  Jackson was a fascist before the word came into existence in the 20th century.  Forced relocation of Native Americans, federal vs. state disputes resolved by force, executive defiance of the Supreme Court, threats of state secession, Tariff wars, loyalty tests, forced resignations, talks of 'mandate' and strong-arming Congress, and even dismantling institutions like the 2nd Bank of America (which would have been pretty synonymous to our 'Federal Reserve' now).  Trump's playbook reads like he's literally emulating Jackson's entire administration.  We've been here before.  And to that end I'd say we'll probably survive, blue states will get held to Trump's law, by force if necessary.  Resistance is likely to have the entire power of the federal government rain down upon them and have no chance.  Also, much like Jackson - we'll probably end up when Trump leaves office with a national identity crisis on our hands and enough unresolved conflicts that got kicked down the road that we'll have our next civil war 23 years after he's gone, just like Jackson.  I just don't think we're really headed into unknown territory, so much as dark territory that we just don't want to accept yet as far as that's where we are, or that we've also already been here before.","title":"Blue States Will Not Be Safe in Our Corrupt, Clownish, Authoritarian Future: The Trump administration will seek vengeance against any state that tries to resist the spread of crony capitalism."},{"text":"Nope, Congress still receives a paycheck during a shutdown, so they are still in session (unless they close session for other reasons)","title":"Congress faces shutdown dilemma that could mess with Trump's first 100 days"},{"text":"You are using an old version of ChatGPT that wasn't trained on 2024 data I think","title":"Very odd: ChatGPT is intentionally obfuscating the actual date of Trump's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience.

That kind of treason is pedagogically and culturally intolerable to the service.\\nIm sure more than a small amount of junior marines and low level ncos would have no problem abandoning their responsibility to the American people - but without the majority of the nco corps and above, they wouldnt get too far anyway (and probably wouldnt even try).?\\nGiven how Mattis, Kelly, et al. have treated even the preludes to this type of issue in the past, Im confident my active duty brothers and sisters would be on the right side of history here.?Additionally, the reason I'm not worried about the military being purged into compliance is briefly mentioned by the poster above. The officer corps is staunchly patriotic, and while it leans more conservative as a population than most college graduates - they are still highly educated and genuinely concerned with the wellbeing of the US. They won't abide treason - and to try to replace them with others who do abide it would require Trump to absolutely crater the officer corps as a whole. To dig deep enough to find enough officers that would accept and promote blind fascist obedience to Commander and Chief would require the removal of basically every competent officer at every level of the services. The US would lose the decades of leadership, experience, tactical, and technical expertise that make our military as competent as it is. I don't think even today's GOP would be so willing to cripple our nations military strength, because that's the very strength they rely on to project global power and enforce the 'diplomatic' side of our relationships.

Because they are cruel, and sadistic, and petty in ways that normal people cannot understand.The reality is that Joe was their punching bag for four years. He watched them mercilessly dismantle his only living child's life for years, with trumped up charges that wouldn't have been brought against anyone else, and brought only to make Joe suffer. He was willing to let his son plead guilty, pay back millions in fines, go to jail, all for the good of the country and confidence in the rule of law. When Republicans scuttled the plea deal out of spite, then threatened to put demagogues and lackeys in charge of DOJ and FBI, he said, \\"no more\\", because they would have simply prolonged his suffering indefinitely by retrying Hunter again and again.

Blocking the G20 summit goals in 2022 in Indonesia did not go down well. Marcos took Philippines towards US but the defence partnership he was looking for did not materialise (for one US has been reluctant to help Philippines beyond a certain point). Increasingly that meant PH buying missile systems from India.

Restaurant workers are \\"working class.\\"   \\nHotel maids are \\"working class\\"   \\nUber drivers are \\"working class\\" Working class doesn't really, shouldn't really, mean \\"older tradesmen with low 6 figure jobs and/or their own business\\" anymore. Those people have a lot of contempt, a lot of FUGM, ladder pulling *contempt*, for the *broader* working class that needs addressed. The clean truck driver with opinions about zoomer spending, truck vlogging about how they too could buy 3 starter homes to flip or use as rentals if they'd just stop buying little treats and trinkets, it as least as real and at least as divisive and dissonant as any other sort of \\"chattering class\\" I think that the idea of certain words/terms/concepts constantly being ceded as shibboleths to the right needs to addressed. Because constantly moving away from terms once the right toxifies them is a losing strategy. The right doesn't stop and give you credit for compromising if you stop teaching CRT, they just roll the snowball and keep using the exact same tactics to attack \\"DEI\\" the following news cycle. constantly participating in this makes the left look like a jobber in a pro wrestling match after enough cycles.   \\n  \\nOne thing I think the dems need to sort out is that they don't need to be 1/16th everything to speak to people. They just need to be sincere, be present, listen, and do the work, and to stop calibrating their claims so heavily. Bill Clinton (at the time) was electable not because he WAS an x,y,z, 1,2,3 group member but *because those groups found him sincere.* When I say \\"calibrating their claims\\" I mean the shit they do that is like: \\"As a working class BIPOC woman, I know that health care is a major concern, so if I am elected I will undertake a project to add a home health care credit for ...\\" \\"I am sympathetic to systematic racism, so I am looking at programs that will empower black men...\\" \\"We will pardon \\\\[federal\\\\] marijuana crimes \\\\[under such and such amount\\\\] \\\\[under certain terms and conditions\\\\] \\\\[with certain caveats\\\\] \\\\[oh and the next admin can just keep locking people up for it\\\\]\\" this is cringeworthy shit the democrats have started doing because they are SO WHIPPED by the constant pearl-clutching and foul selling and empty hypocrisy claims coming from the right. It's nonsense. it ends with you getting no new traction with the people that say, abstractly support but aren't directly affected by, the issue, then alienating half of the people that ARE with the pandering and the half-assedness of it. Oh, you're going to reform student debt for 10k one time for current debt holders in repayment? Well, I'm a parent going back to school on a loan - does it affect my loan? will it affect my kid's in 4 years? No answer? no clarity? nothing I can use for decision making except \\"too bad you're not in the exact pocket of people this particular thing helps?\\" OK. that's *nothing*. that's expecting me to care a LOT, not just nod my head and approve, but *approve to the point of activism*, of something you did for someone else. No one is going to give you full credit for doing 100 percent of a promise of 20 percent of what needs done. You'll get more credit for promising 100 percent, delivering 20, and calling out the people who cost you the 80. Talk like this:I will promote healthcare for all. I will make it easier for ANYONE to start a business. I will legalize marijuana federally.

The trade surplus Canada has is mostly energy (electricity, oil, gas) and other raw resources, that lower costs for US consumers and manufacturers. Basically, Canada sells raw materials to the US, and in return Canada buys manufactured goods and services from the US. Trade with Canada both significantly lowers prices for US consumers, and creates jobs. The same of course applies to Canadians.The issue for Canada and the leverage Trump is using is that while the absolute levels of trade are comparable between countries, the relative amount is less. If, say tomorrow, trade went to zero, the effect on the Canadian economy would be 10x the effect on the US economy. The US economy would experience something similar to the 'great recession' in 2008 (albeit with explosive inflation instead of deflation), while the Canadian economy would experience something more like the 'great Depression' of the 1930s.","title":"Trump trolled Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, saying if Canada can't survive American tariffs then they should become the 51st state | Ouch, That's Not Gonna Buff Out ??"},{"text":"This literally feels like a plot from a 1980s movie with Matthew Broderick, including the company names.","title":"Trump offers Pentagons No. 2 job to billionaire Stephen Feinberg"},{"text":"We had a soft landing and decided to give the monkeys another chance.

But the same is not true when a Republican candidate engaged in name-calling.
