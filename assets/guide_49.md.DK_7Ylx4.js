The propaganda of safe and effective and purported herd immunity should be better clarified when discussing each of the now dozens of childhood vaccines.  DTAP/TDAP exemplifies this.The older version of this vaccine for Pertussis was sterilizing, the newer is not.  The older was found to have an unacceptable number of problems in children, detected shortly after it was administered, the newer helped solve that risk.  However, the newer does not prevent transmission or infection, only sharply reduces the sickness, sound familiar?What does this mean?  Vaccinated kids at school can become infected and bring it home, exposing a newborn who is not yet old enough to be vaccinated.  Yet the propaganda blames the small number of unvaccinated children for this when it is the non-sterilizing vaccine itself that is the root cause.","title":"Trump announces that Robert F.

The result has been the decay of our infrastructure, the reduction in protections for our banking system, for workers and for consumers and a general hollowing-out of the middle class and a shifting of economic returns from working people into the pockets of billionaires. I disagree with this premise. One of the major factors in the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis was the fact Congress, led by the DNC, incentivized giving our more mortgages based on the idea of social good. This is merely one example. The problem with assuming the 'liberal' policies were all good is that you are using hindsight and survivorship bias. Generally, nobody rememebers the proposals that never were implemented nor do they remember the policies that were tried and failed. It is just looking back at the successes and assuming everything was a success.Moving toward the center, which is actually pretty far-right, will not be a winning strategy for the Democratic party, and it will certainly be a disaster for the American people.This is actually a far more complicated problem than you present. If the Democrats want to win, they need to look to what it takes to win that 50%+1 in the places they need to win. If you look at the presidency, that means creating a roadmap to get there and tailoring your capaign/platform to those critical states to get there.There is not a magical combination here and simplistic answers really don't capture this need.  I will also state external factors play a huge role - either helping or hurting the incumbent. That has to be factored into the roadmap as well.be a disaster for the American peopleThis is political opinion, not a fact. There are quite a lot of people who believe the opposite.

Nobody just gave us rank to put on because they wanted us to be pals. I assume there are dishonest people in every vector of life, but I can honestly say, the military certainly has a minimum in regards to the rest of the free world. In the military, decisions are NOT just simply made by a single person. There are many groups of qualified people making those decisions. The amount of people (national guardsmen) needed for TRAFFIC CONTROL was at a standard level for that type of event. BTW, everything down to where the porta potties and toilet paper are going to be at, is well established and the soldiers know how to get there and when their relief is due to replace them. Everyone has multiple table top rehearsal as well as troop briefings. Everything from food to coms to water, etc, gets covered in depth all the way down to BOG. Many meetings for something as big as that. BTW, military is used for some other things, out of sight, but absolutely nothing in regards to physical security of someone besides their selves, and as all of the rest of the Guardsman, who none of these are armed with any ammo whatsoever. Just making sure you understand what the role of those extra guardsmen would be if they were called from home to come in.\\nThey don't have radios, batons, weapons, face shields, body shields, vehicles and any of that at home. It is a laborious task to issue all of that to each person, get a signature for that piece of equipment, that also has each one of serial numbers logged. Takes a week or more to get everything ready for that.\\n The guardsmen are expertly trained in riot control. Had they been used against an unruly crowd as that, law enforcement is still responsible for the lead. I have zero doubt about the injuries that possibly and probably would have occurred if they had been called in. I won't comment on what I think the death toll would have been. In Congress, decisions ARE made by one person during hearings.  I still encourage you to go back and listen to those hearings and maybe you will understand how a congressional inquiry was made to look like something totally different. I want to ask you, what do you think the role of Reserve Components are used for in that event? If trump thought there might be trouble, he should have been looking for law enforcement back up. Our military is not allowed to use deadly force against their own citizens, UNLESS they were sworn as LEO for some particular agency. The local law enforcement did not ask for extra reserves components. Local law, the people in charge of safety, went to the same briefings as did trumps staff. If what trump says is true, something should have been said then. Trump hates going to meetings where he doesn't get to make the decisions. I am willing to bet that has changed. He is all ears instead of mouth when he receives information from a security detail assigned to him now.","title":"'They had no choice': Trump vows to act very quickly to pardon Jan. 6 rioters on 'first day' in office as he lays out White House agenda in first TV interview since election"},{"text":"Joe really dropped the ball on this one.

The caller was a woman who had previously suffered from domestic violence, who worked in a domestic violence support center. She was voting for Trump because she liked that Trump didn't hide what his opinions were, whereas she felt Kamala wasn't forthright enough with her positions. Was she worried that Trump had bragged about sexually assaulting women and found guilty of the same? Yes, she didn't like that aspect about him. Was she concerned over the fact Trump had encouraged the events of Jan 6 and claimed for 4 years that the election was stolen from him without any evidence? Yes she strongly condemned what happened on Jan 6th and felt it was a horrible moment in our history. Was she concerned that women would lose the right to abortion, including when they needed one to save their own lives, and that women had already died due to Trump's supreme court overturning RvW? She was conflicted, she didn't like the idea of abortion but thought it should be between a woman and her doctor, with maybe requiring counseling to make sure the woman was really sure she wanted an abortion, but she certainly didn't think women should have to die to protect a fetus.For all of this and more, the caller didn't really like Trump's position and had reservations about him. But she was heading to the ballot box to vote for Trump anyway because there was just something about Kamala she didn't trust and didn't like. I think she mentioned specifically not liking the way she was appointed late to the nomination. She even said a couple of times \\"Maybe I'm making a mistake and I'll regret it, but I'm just doing what I think is best right now.\\"IMO Kamala was just deeply unpopular with too much of the country, which shouldn't have come as surprising after her terrible VP approval ratings and poor performance in the '20 primaries. My mother, who absolutely loathes Trump, stayed home because she just thought Kamala was \\"too liberal\\", despite not being able to explain what exactly was so distastefully-liberal about her - it was just a bad gut feeling. The anti-Kamala sentiment got masked after what seemed to be positive reaction from the Democrat Convention and positive press coverage, but turns out that was all coming from the 25% of the country that was voting for Biden or Kamala or whoever the Democrats put up (myself included), who were feeling relief after finding an alternative after the dreadful Biden debate.I do think a better, less-unlikeable candidate could have beat Trump. So, I have some hope that we could see a swing back in '28. However, I'm damn-near terrified that Trump's targeted hunt-down and firing/replacement of anyone who isn't a MAGA loyalist throughout the government, him getting another SC justice or two, and other Project 2025 initiatives may indeed cement GOP into power with no real way out. It makes my stomach turn when I stop to think about it.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Well they gladly allow you because youre indoctrinated, so you answered your own question on why they would allow you near patients as well ??","title":"Trump will get RFK Jr to finally look at the link between vaccines and autism - Another conspiracy theory about to come true?"},{"text":"Perhaps democrats shouldnt have been enabling the republicans for the last few decades.

Many cult members may be saying what they think they are supposed to say.There is the core group. Those are the ones who will die on command for their leader.In order to communicate with cult members, we must be respectful and ask curious questions that do not elicit cult responses.Otherwise, they elicit a cultic framework, and that is not happening consciously.We are looking at a dissociative disorder. A disruption of identity is at play here. The old self got replaced but not erased.We can view it like a malware program. The old self is still there, but it has been overwritten.At its core, this malware uses a potent form of information control. Attacking the leader, the doctrine, or the policy head-on triggers a strong automatic defense system. To get through to these people requires to ask questions with warmth. To get to the real identity of the cultists, we must be warm and open them doors. Calling them names will lead nowhere.The other citizens must offer them an off ramp in order to de-polarize them. We are looking at psychological warfare conducted by brainwashing millions. The goal is to dismisss their agency. They must be de programmed. That is the only way back to reality.As general rule, do not speak down to anybody and never use people as objects or talk them down.For example, tell those Christians that support him that Trump cannot speak for God, as God is within the truth.The cult works with behavior control, thought and emotional control, misdirection, and pathological lying. China is one of the largest political cults on the planet.The cult members are programmed to self monitor their own behavior.These tools include: phobia control, make them believe that only negative things happen to them, and they often refuse to look at bad information about their cult, or to search for information outside of the cult framework.Cult members are not friends with other cult members. Once one cult member questions the cult leader or the doctrine, the cult will, without a doubt, turn on you. The true believer, that is what the cult leader wants. The cult does not just need heretics it requires heretics. A strong cult requires the vividness and coherence of its devils. This is a necessary core feature to keep the cult together. (Dr. Stephen Hassan, renowned expert on cults, author of the book: The Cult of Trump)\\nThe characteristics of the Trump Cult were, and remain unmistakable. Create an alternative reality for the group and repeat it ceaselessly. Create an in-group of followers, a tribe of the pure and concoct existential threats supposedly posed by out-groups, whose members represent evil and danger. Follow a leader who is narcissistic and sociopathic-but who promises that he alone knows all the answers and that he alone will deliver his followers from the imagined danger afoot.Meanwhile, the Republican Party bats no eye at their candidate's continued gaffes, daftness, and madness. He is their leader, no matter what he says or does, lies he tells, or crimes he commits.

My stance is that the chance that they might not get inaugurated should also not be considered here -- once they've won election, I believe we should move forward with the assumption that the inauguration will take place, rather than having some places where we assume they will and other places where we limit things because they might not.","title":"Did Justin Trudeau's meeting with Donald Trump break a 225-year-old U.S law?"},{"text":"Harris moved to the right of Biden and herself in 2017-2020 to be more business-friendly while trying to blame corporate greed for the cost of living and appointing a VP who was becoming more progressive.

Speculation is marked with \\"likely\\". I would encourage you to watch the trial, it is a matter of public record and was actually fairly entertaining.Rittenhouse shot an arsonist that was at that moment trying to set fire to a gas station with people in/near it. IIRC, had he succeeded he would likely have killed/injured dozens of people given how many people were nearby. Rittenhouse didn't start by shooting him, he started by taking a fire extinguisher and extinguishing the fire. The arsonist then tried to kill Rittenhouse and Rittenhouse only fired after he fell to the ground and the arsonist was reaching for Rittenhouse's gun.Rittenhouse then ran in the direction of a police baricade yelling for police. Several people saw someone running with a gun calling for police and began shouting that he was a shooter. If you watch the trial, the prosecution was unable to find anyone that would testify under oath that Rittenhouse was aiming or shooting at anyone that was not actively attacking him. Additionally, the videos recorded that night also support this claim.A few people then attacked Rittenhouse thinking he was a shooter based on the shouts given from the mob. Again, Rittenhouse attempted to flee his attackers and then used/attempted to use lethal force at two individuals who were attempting to take his gun. One of them survived and testified under oath that his intention was to take Rittenhouse's gun and kill Rittenhouse with it.  \\nEverything above this line are facts taken from the court case. The rest of this post is speculation and conclusions of the facts presented in the court.Had the arsonist not attempted to set fire to a gas station or attacked Rittenhouse after he extinguished the arsonist's fire source it is likely no one would have died that night. Had the mob not falsly shouted that Rittenhouse was a mass shooter then it is likely only the arsonist would have died. Had the men that attacked Rittenhouse not attacked a kid that was running for police calling for help and not pointing the gun at anyone (something that is perfectly legal to do) then it is likely no one other then the arsonist would have died that night. Had the state of Wisconsin allowed Rittenhouse to have a pistol instead of a rifle it is likely the only person that would have been shot was again the arsonist. Had the state of Wisconson not allowed Rittenhouse to have any firearms it is likely that Rittenhouse would be dead and the arsonist would have set fire to the building and killed/injured dozens of people.Had Rittenhouse not stopped the arsonist it is likely that a few dozen people killed/injured that night.Rittenhouse is a POS and an idiot. However the courts did not set precident saying you can kill protesters. The courts upheld the state's self defense and gun possession laws.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Do you like have an opinion?

But we have seen time and time again, how authoritarian regimes *do* double down on authoritarianism to exploit their populaces as much as possible in the face of economic sanctions.There is a place for certain controls. There's nothing wrong with banning products made from slavery, blood diamonds, or, say, having biosecurity controls in place. But this stance of supporting broad based tariffs and closing trade and then just hoping for the best is absurd.Investment through free trade is development, it is a reduction in poverty.

This is a state of affairs that was formed out of necessity after WW2 when most of Europe was flattened and the US had a nuclear monopoly and half the worlds GDP. And it wasnt entirely one-sided: in Europe and East Asia as well (in fact even more so there), the US pressured the other countries to reduce their military reach and agree to US-dominated command structure. There was a logic to it (not least that a united front was more of a deterrent, the US was of course way ahead, and the UK and France used a lot of that military reach to restore or maintain colonial empires), and it worked at the time, but not now.

Likewise, I think this is extremely unlikely to happen, and certainly can't be the conclusion of a single 50%-48% election result against the Dems.\\nNever in the history of a democratic country has a two-party or multi-party system transitioned to a stable one-party system due to voter behaviour. Politicians being in power generate backlash to themselves and their ideas (see Obama, Trump, Biden). If the Republicans win in 2028 it will consequently be harder for them to hang on in 2032 and so on, as problems will always develop and voters will eventually turf them out.\\nThe truth is Harris had a pretty *difficult* set of circumstances; the 2020 result was super close in the EC, and so even a small (and expected) backlash against the Dems would be enough to risk a loss. Add to that the unfortunate set of events that lead to her candidacy, and it's not that shocking she lost. Indeed, it's almost shocking she did so well if you think about where things were when Biden stepped back.\\nFinally, on the issue of voter suppression, studies have shown in the past that increased voting restrictions have a negligible or positive impact (due to the backlash) on democratic-leaning demographics voting. Indeed, voter turnout has trended up this century, and the Democratic vote share has not trended down, but remained around 50%.

I dont want to say anything about that, because I dont want to do anything that could impede the negotiation, Trump said.Yah, because the only \\"negotiation\\" you're engaging in is caving into Putin's demands.This is as good a time as any to remind people of just how great an asset Trump has been for Putin.While Trump was president, he frequently repeated Kremlin propaganda about things like the annexation of Crimea, about NATO in particular, and about the threat of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.Trump has repeated Putin's false claims about Ukraine that served as a pretext for his invasion.Trump said that Putin did *\\"an amazing job of taking the mantle\\"* when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\\"*Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\\"Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\\"Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\\"*In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \\"watered down.\\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot the sanctions down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.In response to Putin being labeled a \\"killer\\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \\"diplomats.\\"Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goalsthe weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \\"obsolete,\\" and has reportedly, on several occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO.Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\\"*Trump doesn't even know how NATO works...in 2014, NATO members agreed to move \\"toward\\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024. The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \\"delinquency\\" involved.Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \\"fund\\", but towards their own defense.Trump has called the U.S., *\\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\\"* Still not understanding that the funding benchmark has to do with each individual country's own defense spending. We're not \\"paying for NATO.\\"NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.Trump campaigned on the idea of capitulating to Putin. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, just like that. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.That's because Putin is also looking to consolidate power. His goal is to annex as much of Ukraine as possible, rob its people of their independence, then continue with his \\"special military occupation,\\" err, I mean *operation* into other regions of Eastern Europe, where he will expand his oil empire and create soviet-like \\"spheres of influence\\" in territories that his military seizes.Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war would have never happened. Not only is this delusional, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place, and as president, he will continue to help advance Putin's autocratic, warmongering, land grabbing, and international oil baron agenda.","title":"Trump calls for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and says a US withdrawal from NATO is possible"},{"text":"Appetite suppressant?

So by having a majority, there is a high likelihood that if anything goes wrong in the coming years, the Republican party is liable to take the massive brunt of the blame. Sure, hopefully, nothing devastating is going to happen in the near future, but people aren't expecting the status quo. A lot of people want prices to go back to prepandemic levels, and that just isn't likely to happen without a recession.

[...] In a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and?pulling the United States out of NATO. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine,?NATO allies?and many in the U.S. national security community.Asked on NBCs Meet the Press if he were actively working to end the nearly 3-year-old Ukraine war, Trump said, I am.He refused to say if he had spoken to Putin since winning election in November. I dont want to say anything about that, because I dont want to do anything that could impede the negotiation, Trump said.Trumps call for an immediate ceasefire went beyond the public policy stands taken by the Biden administration and Ukraine and drew a cautious response from Zelenskyy. It also marks Trump wading unusually deeply into efforts before his Jan. 20 inauguration to resolve one of the major global crises facing the lame-duck Biden administration.Trump made his proposal after a?weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders?in Paris, where?many world leaders gathered?to celebrate the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral after a devastating fire. None of the advisers traveling with him appeared to have expertise on Ukraine.Kyiv would like to close a deal, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin.I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting! Trump added. He was referring to mediation efforts by China that many in the West have seen as favoring Russia.Zelenskyy described his discussions Saturday with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as constructive but has given no further details.Zelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.[...]Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Trumps post by repeating Moscows long-standing message that it is open to talks with Ukraine. Peskov referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that declared the prospect of any talks impossible as long as Putin was Russias leader.That decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.Trumps former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, warned there was no such thing as a quick fix to ending Russias war with Ukraine.[...]While Trump has said before that he would like to see a quick ceasefire in Ukraine, his proposal Sunday was framed as a direct appeal to Russia. The quick responses from Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the seriousness with which they regarded the idea from the incoming American president.Both Trump and President Joe Biden pointed this weekend to Russias disengagement in Syria, where the Russian military largely moved out of the way while Syrian rebels overthrew the countrys Russian-allied president, as evidence of the extent to which the Ukraine war has sapped Russias resources.[...]The Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have made a point of not being seen to press Ukraine for an immediate truce. Ukraines allies fear a quick deal would be largely on the terms of its more powerful neighbor, potentially forcing damaging concessions on Ukraine and allowing Russia to resume the war again once it has built back up its military strength.Trump portrays himself as up to making fast deals to resolve conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that have frustrated many of the Biden administrations own mediation efforts.There is no prohibition on incoming officials or nominees meeting with foreign officials, and it is common and fine for them to do so  unless those meetings are designed to subvert or otherwise affect current U.S. policy.The Logan Act bars private citizens from trying to intervene in disputes or controversies between the United States and foreign powers without government approval. But the 1799 statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction.In the NBC interview taped Friday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies that he did not see continued U.S. participation in the Western military alliance as a given during his second term.Trump has long complained that European and the Canadian governments in the mutual-defense bloc are freeloading on military spending by the U.S., by far the most powerful partner in NATO. NATO and its member governments say a majority of countries in the bloc are now hitting voluntary targets for military spending, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term.Asked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of NATO, Trump indicated that was an open question.If theyre paying their bills, and if I think theyre treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely Id stay with NATO, he said.But if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the alliance. Trump responded, Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.Trump expressed the same openness when asked if Ukraine should brace for possible cuts in U.S. aid.

(The Democrat version was this country is becoming less and less White and since Non-Whites generally vote Democratic, Republicans will never win. Your version is, The rural population is forever cut off from the Left and their position in smaller states effectively makes them a politically untouchable lynchpin.) In either case, it makes a fatally untrue statement about the future being pre-determined by the past. Roughly 10% of voters genuinely will vote for whatever party sways them, which means that vote pre-determination is going to be incorrect for the last 10% that flips elections.?What most people inside of a Left-wing or Right-wing bubble fail to understand is that this election was NOT a vote of confidence in Trumps policies. This vote was a moratorium on Biden. Kamala positioned herself as a status quo candidate saying that she would maintain Bidens policies. Trump made clear that he would abandon Bidens policies. These swing voters were disillusioned with Bidens policies (based on inflation) and chose the change candidate. I expect that if Trump does even 20% of his stated plans that these swing voters will flip back to the Democrats like whiplash because they will want a new change candidate.I expect that you have two main questions: (1) Didnt these 10% voters understand that Biden handled the inflation better than in other countries?  No. They dont understand this; they do not know anybody living abroad who can relate this to them and are not so attuned to political news that they would have heard about it. (2) Didnt these 10% voters understand that Trumps policies would be bad for achieving the goal that they aspire to, cheaper costs for goods?  No. People who are suffering are less likely to scrutinize changes and just accept them because when you are suffering, you find it difficult to believe that a change could be anything other than an improvement.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Louder: **ANDREW WAKEFIELD WAS SELLING A RIVAL VACCINE TO MMR**","title":"Trump says RFK Jr. will investigate the discredited link between vaccines and autism: Somebody has to find out"},{"text":"So the U.S. government will be declaring war on illegal immigrants in the same way Sparta declared war on the Helots every year to give them legal justification to abuse them.Very smart and makes a lot of sense in the 21st century.","title":"Trump says he will end birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Trump talks too much.

I know this isn't anything new for Trump, lying out of his ass, but over the years, the media and the general public have practically sane washed and normalized his pathological behavior. Before I get into it:Trump is not, and never has been the economic genius he's advertised as by both him and his supporters, and it must be emphasized that he, in fact, wasn't \\"better for the economy\\"- Trump inherited a growing economy and he rode thoae coattails until a real crisis emergedthe covid pandemic. He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans took advantage of both opportunities to blame their opponents for the economic consequences.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump admin hamstringed the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize everything pandemic related, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*To elaborate more on Trump's tariffs:Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations, things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved, and risks that Trump failed to take into account. Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources to manage the fallout. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesTrump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the outcomes are estimated to be costly for most Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump is not an \\"economic genius,\\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. Trump has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.He has profited off of screwing over people who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties for decades, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.Trump is not a financial guru, his admin's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.The next Trump admin, which is already the richest in U.S. history, will destroy what's left of a labor movement that's been in steady decline ever since Reagan's presidency. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of union workers, when he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.And over the next four years, Trump's MAGA coalition will continue their efforts to redistribute wealth to the top.Even Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"Trump: 'I Have Stopped Wars With Tariffs'"},{"text":"And that man came here to avoid military service.","title":"Trumps Day One Plans: Pardon Jan. 6 Rioters, Try to End Birthright Citizenship"},{"text":"Holy fuck, you're right.

There were so many legal fires that were started that it became impossible for justice to keep up. They knew these laws were unconstitutional. The laws go in place and cause the harm they do, and the challenge to undo them faces three points of attack:1) Judges (conservative judges) fast tracked cases to the Supreme Court for rulings in a national level, out of the hands of the people being affected.\\n2) judges (conservative judges, again) sit on the cases until they become moot, such as a woman filing against the state because they denied her right to reproductive healthcare, and the judge waits on the case for 10 months.\\n3) legislators honeypot state constitutional amendments, burying restrictions or reversing things the people vote for, by placing a thing at the front of the measure that is either already illegal or a thing that is difficult to say no to (people who arent registered to vote cant vote leading on a measure to undo de-gerrymandering legislation that people in a previous election voted and passed).All this is to say that the only way to make protesting work is on a massive scale that takes place in so many areas that it becomes impossible to police (meaning, it overwhelmed the system). ?For now, the law is more or less on our side.

He WAS a surgeon, though he was not allowed to continue practicing medicine after it was uncovered that A) his research was fraudulent and B) he had positioned himself to profit from fraudulent research by selling test kits. I'm not clear what the kits were claiming to test and, to be totally honest, I don't care to know because this guy is just a quack, hack dipshit who only has his own interest at heart.What I do know is that several dozen studies replicating his claims have showed there is ZERO link between MMR vaccines and ASD. It's just not true.It's also worth noting that medical doctors are trained to be medical doctors. Wakefield focused on surgery, not research. MDs can absolutely take more training in research and be fantastic scientists. There are plenty of dual MD/PhDs who push forward amazing advances in medical care. However, it's also true that a lot of MDs think they're hot shit and try to do research with cursory knowledge of how to properly construct, analyze, and interpret findings. Being an MD does not inherently prepare you to do research anymore than being a PhD researcher prepares you to do surgery. I'm a researcher, I've published on Alzheimer's disease and other medical topics. I cannot remove a gall bladder. It's a completely different skillset.A person who isn't trained in how to properly conduct research may see children being diagnosed with ASD about the time they're finished with their first round of shots and wonder if there's a connection. That's fine. Having a hypothesis is the first part of doing good research. What you would quickly find out, however, is that children who are unvaccinated for religious or other reasons are diagnosed around the same age with ASD. And the rate of ASD diagnosis is the for vaccinated and unvaccinated children. It's a function of ASD becoming more noticeable when the pragmatics of behavior start emerging in interpersonal relationships. That age just happens to be close to the end of the first round of shots.Well-constructed research with good control conditions tell you this. And that's exactly what everyone who is trying to undo Andrew Wakefield's harmful lies has found.","title":"Trump says RFK Jr. will investigate the discredited link between vaccines and autism: Somebody has to find out"},{"text":"He's ultra corrupt and fishing for a pardon.\\nIt's really that simple.?\\nHe gets a pardon, they get to scream about how a black man was so abused he left the dems.","title":"NYCs mayor warms to Trump and doesnt rule out becoming a Republican"},{"text":"Which is weird because I never heard anything about Obama deporting people.","title":"Mass Deportation Discussion"},{"text":"He did but things have changed.

You can take this all the way back to Reagan, but it probably goes even further than that. Lets walk through it.Reagan beats Carter due to gas prices and a stagnant economy. Its a complete sweep, and the US has great short term growth in those 4 years. He wins again, and everyone thought that Dems were doomed. They got one term of Big Bush beforeAnother economic downturn. The party in charge always gets the blame, warranted or not. So Clinton gets elected. He gets to govern over a booming economy due to a variety of factors, including Global dominance (USSR just collapsed, less money for defense needed) more women entering the workforce creating a larger tax base, and most importantly, the burgeoning dot com boom. Basically lots of work became more efficient.These good times almost got Gore elected, but the 2000 election was razor thin, with fuckery in Florida, so it almost doesnt count. He was also very boring, and Bush had charisma and Karl Rove. If you go back and see what the biggest issues in 2000 were, it was stupid stuff like stem cell research. 9/11 happens and Bush wins reelection handily because we were at war.The democrats were thought to never be able to win another election again. They were soft on crime and terrorism. Conservative economic policies seemed to be working. Regulation was cut, the economy was growing, people got tax cuts. UntilThe Great Recession. Under republicans, with banking regulations cut, the global economy collapsed. Obama was a generational politician, sure, but any Democrats would have won that election because the recession was blamed on the republicans.He won re-election handily, with Romney only really being able to say that Sure, the economy is better, but it was too slow which didnt cut the mustard with the electorate. Republicans were projected to never win another election, especially with the demographics is destiny idea of Latinos voting blue.Then 2016. A population that was doing well decided not to bother voting. Voter turnout was low, and both sides ran unpopular candidates. Many leftists protested the election due to the treatment of Bernie. The polls showed a Clinton landslide. We know what happened. Trump won, and was gifted a great economy. He probably would have won reelectionExcept for the pandemic and brief recession. Its always the economy. Biden was saddled with the blame for post Covid inflation. Incumbents lost elections across the globe.This is a long read, but the point is that good times happen, and the incumbent party wins reelection. Bad times happen and the other side wins. Its a 2 party system the electorate wont just vote one way in perpetuity. Bad times will happen again, and the democrats will win.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Sadly, others are right when they tell you it doesn't matter what you tell him.

I'd also point out that these astoundingly successful liberal policies, both foreign and domestic, were opposed by conservatives at the time, just as they'd fought the New Deal and tried to keep the US from supporting our allies, while they themselves supported fascism and imperialism, before December 7th. I'd also point out that since 1968 when conservatives  came back into power in the US and conservatism infested the Democratic party, there has been a wholesale dismantling of those liberal policies.

Every year from ages 11 to 17 we are made familiar with the 3rd Reich and ?what happened and how it happened. And -kinda- how to prevent it. One story always stuck with me. First thing that Adolf did. The first thing. He got rid of his enablers. His friends. R?hm-Putsch. So, Ernst R?hm, head of the SA was taken to Stadelheim. The prison in Munich. Later that day the SS arrived. Sepp Dietrich himself. And requested from the head of prison that R?hm is handed over to them for execution. The head of prison was shocked. ?I cant do that. ?I dont have a court order. ?I cant just and you over a prisoner. Well, you can guess how that conversation went on. I dont know if Dietrich himself demanded but the SS made it clear: ?it a Fhrerbefehl (order by the fhrer). Hand him over or we shoot you right here right now!. Now the head of prison MOST LIKELY had voted for Adolph Hitler. I dont actually now that for sure. But for the sake of this  parable.. we assume it. Put yourself in his shoes. He heard: lets make Germany great again. The lgenpresse (fake media) is controlled by Only one man can save us. Du befiehlst - wir folgen (you give the order, we will follow). But at that moment, with 5 SS-Guys in the room, the head of prison realized that everything has changed. With his vote an the enabling of Hitlers rise to power not only was democracy no more. The branches of the government were no more. Trust in ANY institution, organization etc was no more. Be part of it, surrender yourself to it - or die. Be removed from your position, let them arrest you because the brother of your wife (who you dont even like) was member in a socialist soccer club 15 years ago. You get the point. Interestingly the head of prison head a choice to make. For Ernst R?hm the line was drawn, the curse was cast. (He was a full blown nazi - so no sympathy. But he who worked hard to get them to power was first thrown under the.. SS-Bus). \\nLast statement: for all my life since I was 17 years old I was afraid to be in the position the head of prison was in. He should have faked it and get himself a gun and try to take as many with him as possible. But with children now: that choice is not so easy. I wish you the best of luck.

Just saying they are isnt much of an argument.Also thered still be a massive incentive to outsource other than different labor standards. For one thing, in a highly developed and educated country like America, the median persons labor is significantly more valuable than in less developed countries. Mainly being that for many of the costs of, say, building coffee pots, such as land for a factory, machinery, and labor, itd be more expensive in the US because the US is a highly developed and educated country with highly productive industries, meaning that to acquire a plot of land, youd be bidding against people who can use that plot of land very productively and so can bid higher prices for it. Same applies for many capital and labor resources, theyll be more expensive to acquire in developed countries because theres better things those resources could be used for.Less developed countries with lower productivity will be comparatively cheaper because their industries are less developed, and so theres less competition for those resources. This is usually framed by leftists and rightists as a bad, exploitative thing, but in reality its the market working efficiently to allocate resources and work. Itd make no sense for a country full of Christopher Nolans to waste time mining minerals and manufacturing them into microwaves, when they could instead be spending their time making highly valuable movies, and it doesnt make sense for a country full of Bobs to waste time making crappy movies. The world is more efficient and everyone is better off when the Nolans make movies and the Bobs make microwaves and then they trade with each other, as that way everyone gets more movies and more microwaves.","title":"And no, I am not a Trump supporter just because I call out free trade"},{"text":"Oh God, this is so stupid.

So you have created new demand. Some of that demand will be absorbed by global chains like McDonalds.

Most of the jobs are just line cooks - not necessarily better than the factory, but they will need logistics personnel, managers, marketing people, HR, etc etc. that group has opportunities those before them didnt.And as the next generation raises up with education they start demanding electronics and video games.

But thats not true - he's a unique and talented politician who easily fended off challenges from legtimate politicians in his own party.Your second problem is that you seem to think that for some reason a year in which the Democratic incumbent president had sub-40% approvals was somehow a layup for Democrats. But in fact, in general incumbent approval is a very good predictor of the outcome of the election. If anything Harris overperformed a bit, certainly versus what Biden would have done. Any other Dem likely would have done just as bad because ultiately its hard to seperate yourself from your parties incumbent without admitting that your party has done trash.Sure - Democrats seem demoralized - thats what happens when your incumbent is wildly unpopular.Democrats will likely bounce back easily in 2026, taking back the House, and if Trump's previous term is any indication of where his approval ratings will end up, likely the White House and Senate in 2028 (Collins isnt unbeatable, might not even run anyway, and NC is mostly elusive in the Senate because of timing).Sure, Dems need to work on appealing to working class people. Specifically, the party needs to figure out how to reach people that don't get their news from traditional sources. Thats a group Trump did really well with.  \\n  \\nThe good news on that front is - Donald Trump is unique in GOP politics. There's no one else in the party that has his kind of personal magnetism and appeal to outsiders. JD Vance will, when he wins the nomination in 2028, come across as a crasser Mitt Romney type rather than a new Trump. But even then, Dems need to craft a message that appeals to people who see themselves as outside of the mainstream. The good news is that its easier to do that when the other guy is in charge. Probably in 2028 it would help to run someone who isnt seen as being part of the party mainstream, but we are a long way from all that anyway.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Should have followed up with \\"how about Obamacare?\\" and see what his answer is.","title":"It's been a little while, but... lowlights of Trump's interview with Meet The Press!"},{"text":"They don't have *unrestricted* birthright citizenship.If someone is born in France (or a territory) to foreign parents and resides in France for at least 5 years between 11 and 18, they become citizens at 18 (there is also an option to naturalize as a citizen starting at age 13 with other residency requirements).Most of Europe has a residency requirement on either the parents or the child (and none still have unrestricted birthright citizenship).

The fraud involved data selection, data manipulation, and two undisclosed conflicts of interest. It was exposed in a lengthy Sunday Times investigation[2][3][4][5] by reporter Brian Deer,[6][7][8] resulting in the papers retraction in February 2010[9] and Wakefield being struck off the UK medical register three months later.

(This is why some signatories are increasingly supportive of letting China in, even though the original point of the TPP was to reduce Chinese dominance in East Asian trade.) If they were, companies would stop supporting free trade because off-shore labor would lose its cheap allure.Comparative advantage exists. Furthermore, the main reason why companies support free trade is because it expands their supply chain and significantly expands their customer base, _not_ primarily because of labour costs. Obviously those factor in, but even companies with labour that can't significantly be outsourced support free trade  look at Canadian lumber, one of the biggest benefactors of CUSMA, for example.

One way to do this is simply to show up, and it does help your vote total in a statewide race if you can increase your margins in every county. The case study Id use here is John Fettermans campaign in 2022. He showed up to every county in Pennsylvania multiple times and spent more time in rural areas than in Philadelphia (where he spent almost no time campaigning). This helped him to have a better margin in every rural county in PA than Joe Biden did 2 years earlier. He still lost most of these counties, but he lost them by smaller margins than Biden did, and ultimately won the statewide race. So did Biden, but Fettermans victory was a larger margin. Democrats have failed largely in rural areas because the DNC gave up on them and have been giving rural areas the finger rhetorically for decades. Just showing up and actually campaigning and trying to earn peoples votes again is the first step in this process. It will still take many years to rebuild what theyve given up, but its possible, and the best example we have is how the Republican Party basically started from scratch in many areas and just kept building support gradually until they were able to win. The GOP doesnt look at any county in the US as a lost cause, and it would benefit democrats to start doing the same, even if they have to start from scratch in thousands of counties.

Take this excerpt for example: \\n The last 24 hours saw, roughly, a piddling 660,000 transactions in Bitcoin, and something like 70 percent of Bitcoins have not moved in at least a year. That is made worse by how expensive and slow Bitcoin transactions are. By way of comparison, Amazon, which has a similar market capitalization, has seen about 40 million daily trades of its stock over the last few days.\\nThere's a few things wrong with this. First of all, 40 million is about AMZN's average daily trading volume, meaning the number of shares that have traded, not number of individual trades. I assume he's also referring to the number of bitcoins traded in the 660k figure, because the 24hr volume of Bitcoin is about $40B. But you can't really compare average daily volume considering there are about 19 million bitcoins in circulation and 10.5 billion AMZN shares outstanding. Plus, given one bitcoin is worth about $100k and one AMZN share is worth about $227, obviously more shares of AMZN will trade than individual bitcoins. \\nThe whole premise of the article seems off too. Like I mentioned the trailing 24 hour volume of Bitcoin is $40 billion. The article is claiming bitcoin whales need more volume to dump their coins all at once because otherwise it would crash the market, but that makes no sense. Because of the nature of the blockchain, you can see how long someone has held a bitcoin when it gets sold. If whales who have held for years started dumping all at once, it would cause a panic no matter how much demand there is. That goes for regular stocks as well. No holder of bitcoin is going to sell of their investment all at once if they are at all sane, and I think the article is pearl clutching over this possibility. \\nLoomis did introduce a bill to build a Bitcoin reserve by selling some of the government's gold reserve. Even if this bill were to pass as-is, we wouldn't come close to depleting the gold reserve to build this bitcoin reserve. Plus, the bill has no co-sponsors, and while some crypto-friendly Senators got elected, I don't see this bill getting enough support among the Republican old guard (especially those who love gold) still in Congress.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 8, 2024"},{"text":"I'm sorry but some of Biden's actions, especially regarding Ukraine and the southern border are about as close to gross influence peddling if not outright treason as I've ever been aware of a president committing.There should be an investigation, the facts of that investigation need to be released and if those facts show a likelihood that he committed those crimes then he should be charged.

They can be very specific about the changes they desire while also giving the broad overview of what they hope to accomplish by doing so. Not every voter can understand the specifics but there are lots of people who can.Saying nothing leaves it a mystery, and more likely signals that they *don't know how* to achieve their broad stated goals.  Like how the fuck are we supposed to know the macro effects of changing section 31 d of the tax code slightly? Its highly doubtful even the experts know what the effects will be ffs.Experts can make predictions. Other people can know and understand things you don't, likely *a lot* of things outside of your narrow specialty. This is a reason why the most highly educated and knowledgeable people are very cautious about assuming their understanding of something is complete.If it were true that even experts couldn't predict what would result from changes then whichever candidate actually starts making changes would be flying blind anyway so who cares what their goals are? At least the candidate with a specific plan *thinks* they know how to achieve it. 2) It eliminates the ability for the candidate to fulfill the technical promise but break the spirit of the promise.No, because again you can do both things. If a candidate promises to make a specific change to achieve a broad goal, and makes the change but fails to achieve the broad goal, the electorate doesn't need to let it go based on them technically doing what they promised. Voters aren't malicious genies, they can distinguish between the spirit of a promise and technicality. They can also recognize if the overall goal wasn't achieved despite their specific promises being fulfilled.Plus what more can we really expect from a candidate? If they tell us their plan, we approve of it and vote for them, and they execute the plan but it doesn't work it is unfortunate but they held up their end of the deal 100%! Not every plan will succeed, that is life. 3) It creates both incentive and mandate for politicians once in power to pivot when things go wrong or if their policies are underperforming their expectations.Again, candidates can do both. If their specific plan isn't working out they can pivot to a modified or entirely different plan aiming for the overall goal. That is what people expect, they would *want* a failed plan to be abandoned for a better one in service to the overall goal they approved. So yeah not really seeing why Trumps platform being more vague than Harrises is a bad thing,It is because only having a concept of a plan gives no confidence that once given control they will have any idea what to do to achieve their stated goal. when even the experts cant predict the outcome of a policyThat isnt true. If it were then not only would the policy changes not be important but also their stated goals would be irrelevant. They would both just be aimlessly pulling random levers and hoping.The truth of course is that experts *can* make educated predictions beyond the capacity of the typical smooth-brained voter.","title":"CMV: It's better for voters if a candidate promises semi-vague aims then hyper specific policies"},{"text":"I guess Barton is heading out","title":"Trump aims to end birthright citizenship, says American citizens with family here illegally may be deported"},{"text":"Biden has already been stabbed in the back by his own party.

He realized there was actually no system in place to hold someone like him accountable and that partisan politics had become so divisive that Republicans would have no real choice but to fall in line. Add in a heavy douse of populist rhetoric (scapegoating foreigners _always_ works despite its history of never actually being the problem: a sad reflection on human nature) and you will have used one of the best tactics you can use in a modern democracy.","title":"Trump's Biggest Lies from His 'Meet the Press' Interview"},{"text":"Legally you wont!","title":"The Media Is Ready to Hold Trump to a Lower Standard.

They're vague to the point of being un-serious, inconsistent, and seemingly just lip-service.

The flip side of that is that the the politician doesn't have to attempt to push through with the things people voted for. It's a loss of accountability. I think a great example of this was Obama. Obama and his campaign were extremely well skilled at being vague then didn't do the things people assumed they were going to do. He was strongly against the war in Iraq, then he didn't end the war in Iraq and didn't hold anybody accountable for starting a war based on lies and misinformation. There is no question that a lot of the success of Trump in 2016 and 2024 was a response to these vaguaries. The main stream of both parties consistently refuses to acknowledge the failures of their parties policy platforms. Trump is able to be successful precisely because he has been able to point out where these policies are failing the American people. I think he is still riding the wave of success of him dismantling Hillary Clinton and the two faced nature of democrats corrupted by money in politics in that debate. To his supporters, it doesn't matter that neither he nor the Republicans have any integrity at all. they are not that informed. They are for ending the corruption and that's what they know.'**In this way, my main response to you is that being vague works for an outsider and not for the party in power.** It used to be the case that the incumbent had a major advantage in elections. This is still true in state and local elections to a larger extant but as a larger and larger number of Americans see their quality of life falling, it is becoming untrue in national elections. People more and more want change and being vague is going to benefit the outsider party because neither party actually wants change at this point.","title":"CMV: It's better for voters if a candidate promises semi-vague aims then hyper specific policies"},{"text":"Imaginary job, just to keep him bussy.","title":"Trump says RFK Jr. will investigate the discredited link between vaccines and autism: Somebody has to find out"},{"text":"We do not want Ted Cruz back.

Saying \\"we're gonna do tariffs on all imports\\" and \\"we're going to deport millions of people\\" is a level of vagueness that borders on dishonesty. The manner in which those things might be carried out vary so wildly that one is obscuring information by explaining them that way.But that vagueness is explicitly what allows things to pivot if people become unhappy about the results or how it's being done. Like if Trump goes too far on Tariffs and it increases prices to an absurd degree without giving the market time to adjust and move manufacturing he can backpedal on it quickly instead of sticking to his guns because that's what he promised. People know what they are voting for when he says he's going to deport millions of people and put tariffs on imports. Not specifically but the general direction. Even if he only gets 1,999,999 immigrants deported instead of 2 million+ people will still be relatively satisfied. People are capable of understanding: 'I'm planning to imprison millions of people at camps near the border and/or airports then fly them to various places and leave them.' He didn't say that because that doesn't sound very nice. And if he has a plan that's nicer than that, it sure would be nice to hear about it so people like me don't speculate awful scenarios, right?I mean if there isn't a nicer way to do it that's on the Dems for creating a framework that makes it incredibly difficult to legally deport illegals.

All they know is a lot of things are continuing to get shittier and more expensive: healthcare, housing, childcare, etc.And besides economics, the mood in the US has gotten WAY worse in the US over the past several years. People are angry and polarized, rich people are continuing to get richer, to me it feels like the last 7-10 years have seen a massively accelerated breakdown of the post-WWII social contract and a return to the  gilded age, only it's techbro assholes instead of robber barons this time. Neither political party has shown any interest in changing this, because God forbid they offend their rich fundraisers.In summary, people are unhappy.
