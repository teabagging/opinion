There are two comments I'd make on that topic.1) Elon has not provided his finances for public view. And he's not obligated to by any means. He's a private citizen. But as a result, we don't actually know what he paid or didn't pay. And he says a lot of things that aren't objectively true in general. Hell, his \\"puffery\\" was central to his defense in the lawsuit he just won regarding his claims about Tesla self-driving capabilities 2) If he did end up paying that much on taxes in that instance, it's because he didn't exercise his stock options as they were available. Because options are taxed as compensation based on the delta between the option price and the actual stock price, the higher the stock goes, the higher the tax bill.

Those things tend to come out and people either deal with it or end the relationship. I don't think most stable relationships have a conceal enormous betrayal.

Biden was pretty much acknowledged to be the leading advocate in rallying support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to coerce the president to announce a phony investigation into his political opponent. I think it's fair to say that, when comparing the two, the president that provided aid and worked with allies to provide aid is \\"stronger\\" than the president who withheld aid when considering the situation.Bidens son, Hunter sits the boards and is a key investor of TWO state run Ukrainian energy companies. Shortly after if father wins the presidency Russia starts bombing Ukraine and his daddy sends billions of tax dollars to... Ukrainian government and infrastructure!There's a lot of just blatantly wrong information here. Hunter does not serve for any Ukranian companies in any role. He hasn't since 2018. The funding for Ukraine was written by Congress, not by Joe Biden. The aid is a combination of military equipment, loans to purchase military equipment, and humanitarian aid given to the government, not to private companies. This aid was passed with Republican support as well. There is literally no \\"collusion\\". This has been repeatedly proven false. When a Trump appointed DA targeted the family of Trump's political opponents, Biden refused to dismiss the prosecutor and allowed the prosecution to continue unimpeded and he did not pardon his son.

Maybe their parents immigrated, but they grew up in America, and consider themselves full Americans (which of course they are). A result of that, if they grow up with the same messaging and propaganda about other groups of people, whether it be anti-black messaging or anti-immigrant messaging, and they don't see that as applied to them because they are \\"white\\" and part of the in-group. What this means in practice, especially when you tie it to the fact that not everyone with heritage from Latin America is a monolith, is that when Trump says \\"Haitians are eating dogs!\\" a random Mexican-American isn't going to get personally offended by that, because Haitians and Mexicans are two different groups of people entirely. It's possible that some will see that as the type of xenophobia that hurts all immigrants in the longrun, but it's also possible they see a distinct \\"us\\" vs \\"them,\\" where \\"us\\" is general America and \\"them\\" is whatever immigrant group Trump is ranting about at the time. It's a double edged sword in that it is objectively great that some Hispanic voters feel so integrated and confident in their place in America, but the downside that comes with it is there is a chance they adopt the same sorts of racist attitudes that large swathes of America has. Like, there's nothing more American than hearing about universal healthcare and thinking \\"communism!!!\\" so this article just points to another expression of this.

Like, what accomplishments are you talking about?Because if you're a millennial, Obama sold you out, friend. Obamacare was a way to balance the books for a few years off the backs of the \\"young invincibles\\", remember?Also, Obama amped up the war on terror and ordered the drone strike assassination of US citizens (including a 14 year old son of a guy who became a terrorist leader...and when asked about it, the Obama admin responded that he should have had a better father).Also, he largely betrayed labor and civil rights movements during his Presidency.Obama was a very inspiring candidate, but in practice he was just another boring establishment Democrat politicians.So what actually is the difference between him and Harris in that respect that you are objecting to now?Honestly, I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding how electoral politics works. If you are holding for a national politician who makes you feel warm and fuzzy, you either aren't ever going to vote because nobody will ever meet your standard, or you're going to get fooled by someone who knows how to market to you (which is what happened with Obama for you, it sounds like).Because there are very powerful, material interests in place right now that will prevent any elected politician from actually doing most of the stuff you likely want them to do. The things you want simply aren't on the ballot, friend. You are never going to be given the option to simply check a box to get the things you *really* want.At least not until we actually challenge and tear down those material interests and actually change the playing field.But if the only thing you're willing to do, politically speaking, is check a box once every few years, you're going to constantly be disappointed with politics if you are also expecting what sounds like a pretty high level of service from the candidates. You seem to want good service without making any real effort to get it...and that simply isn't a reasonable expectation, friend.If you want to change the influence of money in politics and actually challenge the various material interests that are crapping up all the candidates, you're going to have to do things outside of electoral politics. You're going to have to do more than just vote on election day. And *that* is the main reason to vote for Harris or whoever the Democrats put forth -- they will make it easier to do things between election days that *actually* move the needle, like union organizing, direct action, local organizing, etc.There are absolutely things you can do to bring about the changes you likely seek, if you have the drive but are frustrated with the ballot -- there are groups you can get involved with and direct action you can participate in. Hell, if you live in a state where it is possible, get involved in petition drives and other such work to bring about ranked choice voting (which will make third party voting viable and really open up the possibilities on the ballot).But if you don't care enough to do any of these things, then the best thing you can do is just vote for Harris to make it easier for the people who *are* working.","title":"CMV: You're not voting for Kamala, you're voting against Donald."},{"text":"Then they bring out Jack Smith and Liz, same merry-go-round and media orders to deflect from current problems.

If you were in favor of that act, you are in favor of her policy decisions. While I may have some qualms about the DNC not having her run from the start, it is precedent to have the sitting president run for reelection when applicable. However I think everyone was timid about his reelection given his age. They would almost NEED to put an emphasis on Harris based on the mere probability of her needing to take up the one other constitutional power of the VP; taking over as president when the sitting president can no longer serve. If Biden had dropped dead during his campaign, Harris would be the presumptive nominee. Handing the reigns to the stronger and presumptive runner-up was a logical and strategic move. As for voting FOR her instead of AGAINST Trump. I've personally seen the success of social programs that help working class people have more spending power and simulate the economy. For instance, assistance to start a small business or make a down payment on a house (both are policies she'd like to implement if elected.) Even if the legislation doesn't make it to her desk as president, I have a good idea of what types of bills she'll sign and which she'll veto, and it matches what I'm looking for in a president.","title":"CMV: You're not voting for Kamala, you're voting against Donald."},{"text":"Republicans were gearing up to make it a liability for Harris, and it ended before they could.","title":"How Biden helped end a port strike that threatened Democrats in November"},{"text":"They've also Frankenstein'd the shadow docket into a tool for abuse.","title":"Democrats demand answers on Alitos removal from Supreme Court Jan. 6 opinion"},{"text":"Kamala is pretty clear in saying people who make over 400k a year will see tax increases under her, and I assure you there are people making that income here - including myself.?The people voting for Trump *want* those programs cut.?","title":"CMV: You're not voting for Kamala, you're voting against Donald."},{"text":"Can you clarify something? ?Are you saying that you dont believe the Democratic Party is looking to make the changes myself and many of my peers feel is needed. ?Im confused why you would feel that way about the Republican Party but not feel a vote for the Democratic candidate would then be a vote for what you want?","title":"CMV: You're not voting for Kamala, you're voting against Donald."},{"text":"I dont understand the point of this view.

The President does have *some* sway over the agenda - as the leader of the party they decide what to prioritize. But really anything in the grab bag of priorities that a Democratic President might pick are fine with me. But even if the GOP was running a perfectly sane, not-narcissist, not-nakedly-corrupt, milquetoast candidate a la Mitt Romney, I'd *still* be voting *for* Kamala.

I understand that you want something to vote for. I do too! And in fact, Im voting in favor of bringing back the child tax credits, hopefully getting a more equitable tax code that has the wealthy pay more, subsidizing loans for first time home buyers, providing free school lunch for kids, etc. Theres a lot of great things to support there.Moreover, the Democratic caucus very nearly did have an open primary after it looked like Biden was gonna drop out. Pelosi wanted that, and she was gearing up to have people ready to support that. She didnt want Kamala to be the nominee either. But then Biden dropped out and endorsed Kamala, so that nipped that in the bud. So, there was a fair bit moving behind the scenes that youre seemingly not aware of, but thats alright, youll only know that if youre an absolute political junky. Im not going to pretend that any of this is ideal how it played out, but we are where we are. So, I think its easy to substantiate why one would vote *for* Harris.But lets address Trump and voting against him. I think your notion of what voting is is frankly kind of naive. We live in a country with a two party system, it sucks, but thats the reality. Voting is not meant to be the purest expression of your individual moral principles, where you pick a candidate that matches all your values perfectly. Voting is about assessing the two choices in front of us (and its just math, its literally going to be Kamala or Trump), and casting your vote based on which would be the better, or at least the least bad option.Theres plenty I dont like about Harris. She needs to break with Biden on Israel support, and she has not done enough to differentiate herself there. But Donald Trump wants to give Israel the weapons to finish the job. Behind the scenes, Harris has indicated she wants to break with Biden on Israel, but unfortunately the pressures are such that her campaign feels she cant do that. Again, I dont agree with this, but thats the calculation her campaign is making.So, look, I get that the idea of voting for a lesser evil isnt sexy or necessarily inspiring the way wed want it to be, but voting against a fascist ideology that is explicitly talking about dismantling the democratic process is more than reason enough to vote for Kamala Harris, *against* Donald Trump.And if at the end of the day you cant see the stark contrast there, or its not enough for you, in the most respectful way possible, youre not a serious person whos engaging with politics in a way that actually assesses the reality of the situation were in. Voting to keep fascists out is literally the bare minimum of good political action.","title":"CMV: You're not voting for Kamala, you're voting against Donald."},{"text":"Some people in relationships actually like each other","title":"CMV: 99+% of Human Relationships Are Sustained by Lies (Explicitly Stated OR by Omission)/Dishonesty in General"},{"text":"Holy crap that's a lot of crazy people.","title":"\\"I CAN'T DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate how no one wants to acknowledge this fucking pandemic!!!!! oh my god!!!!!! i leave the internet and everyone is saying it's \\" over \\" while cases are SKY FUCKING HIGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am losing my tether to reality and i don't know what to do to get it back.\\""},{"text":"Comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

Do people not understand that taxes are how the government pays for things? They dont just *have* billions of dollars, they collect it from citizens. Republicans have pledged to lower taxes, and therefore lower the income of the federal government, and therefore not be able to sustain social programs and public works projects without ballooning the deficit (ignoring the fact that they wish to cut those things entirely). Democrats, on the other hand, have proposed a tax increase on income of one hundred million and higher.

The best candidate is the best candidate, saying there is nobody better to win the election sounds like an endorsement of Kamala to me. I suppose it leaves open the idea that *nobody* is a very good candidate, but elections are not about picking a theoretical paragon of everything. We vote for the best available candidate. This view is substantiated by the fact that there was essentially zero push back from the Democratic caucus as a whole after she was handed the party nomination.Again, not really a criticism. Especially on short notice the ability to command the support of the vast majority of the party leadership indicates a strong candidate. Unless you think the Democratic caucus as a whole doesn't care about the ability of their candidates to be President, just to win the election? Also by the catastrophes that are ongoing in Palestine, Ukraine, our own southern border and our economy (all of which are worse after the last 3.8 years.)That is an absurd complaint. What was Kamala, or even Biden supposed to do about those things? Palestine and Ukraine are the fault of foreign organizations, the Vice President of the US doesn't sign off on Hamas terror attacks, or decide if Putin invades or not. Kamala doesn't choose the schedule of migrants.And finally the economy is doing *better* over the last few years. The US navigated a period of global inflation in surprisingly good form.You need to understand that bad stuff just happens in the world outside the control of the US President and Vice President.

But you forget that war in the 21st century is a completely unprofitable enterprise in economic terms. The Russian budget spends money on war and on the construction and operation of defence plants, without receiving anything in return. I personally believe that the easiest path for the Russian government would be to restart the war after a few years or to start a new one somewhere in the Central Asia/Caucasus/Baltics. This will again create demand for more and more weapons and the Russian state can continue without making significant changes. But how will it be profitable? This will create a demand, for sure, but Russian state budget again will have to invest money with no return. Russian state doesn't profit of war--tanks and shells bring no economic value. Currently Russian budget spends it's reserves to keep the war going. You do not sell a tank on the market and return spent money back. You send it to burn on the battlefield for far-fetched ideological constructs. It would be far easier to go via a painful process of demilitarisation of economic than continue or start a new war.It would be more profitable for the Russian economy to just pay people previously employed in the growing war sphere monthly salary for doing nothing than invade another country just to justify keeping the factories running.","title":"CMV: If peace is achieved in Ukraine now, it can be expected that Russia starts another war within a few years"},{"text":"Biden hates Kamala.

The people that vote for him vote in the same way they choose a TV show, a well done cooking show is going to be better for you than watching reality tv of a house full of drunk guys all trying to marry the same girl, but its clear by the choices TV executives make which garners more interest. But if you think like a MAGA supporter, its about the drama. Like someone else recently mentioned Trump is a mascot for the people he gets to vote for him. He will win the party line vote obviously, republicans by the nature of being on the Republican ticket, a very small number of republicans openly reject him. So it is a question of which other demographic can be swayed to either come out and vote, or be convinced to vote for him. These undecided or apathetic voters dont care or pay attention to politics, they arent going to be driven to the polls by a good argument or the betterment of society, they are the voters that believe the more dramatic story because its exciting or scary. No amount of facts or logic will ever make them care that the reality show is scripted to get them worked up. They want their dopamine hit.So to answer your question, was it good for the democrats?

Social media is a physical addiction. There are brain chemistry changed caused by overusing social media, which makes kicking the habit harder for someone to do on their own. Social media addiction (or, more accurately, dopamine addiction) has withdrawal symptoms, if less severe than something like coke.Anyhow, I don't really understand why it is unfair for social media companies, in particular, to be held at least partially responsible for any damage they cause, when we do, or at least attempt to do, otherwise to just about every other industry. Like, to take alcohol as an example. Did you know that, in some locations like New York, a vendor can be held liable for selling alcohol to someone who's visibly drunk? And that if the bar does sell alcohol to said person, and that person drives a car and kills someone, that bar can get into serious trouble and possibly lose their license?We aren't banning alcohol entirely (The USA tried that, and it *really* didn't work), but we do have an expectation that the industry does at least take some steps to moderate the damage it causes.This is true to some degree for other industries, too, tho implementation is less standardized. In some countries, beverage companies have to pay more taxes if the drinks they produce exceed a certain level. Audio devices must have warnings if the user tries to switch their volume up too high.Most of us aren't saying the social media company should do something crazy like fork out billions in fines, but is it really so much to expect them to do something to moderate the harm they cost, even if it is something like having a popup telling you to consider taking a break, after you've been using the platform for say more than an hour, and reappearing every 15 minutes after?

It assumes Jewish people, whom happen to live all over the planet and hold beliefs across the political spectrum, and the government of Israel are the same and are all of the same mind. Likewise you assume Israeli's in Israel and the right wing government and Israeli military industrial complex and military doctrine are of the same mind, which to be honest is a bit ignorant. There exist plenty of Jewish critics of Israeli policy and military doctrine.\\nSimilarly why would or should the standard for a regime be conduct of terrorists or authoritarian regimes. The context of this post is military aid going to Israel. Even without conditions we should hope Israel would conduct itself in a manner that adheres to western standards and respects human-rights when engaging in conflict. If it doesn't that we certainly should demand that it does. \\nThirdly, conflict provides plenty of off-roads. If presented with opportunities for compromise or cease-fire and instead escalation and conflict is what is chosen, then it can be objectively stated that conflict is being pursued. Also \\"pursuing conflict\\" isn't a moral judgement, it's a factual one. Israeli military doctrine is inherently escalatory and preemptive in nature you can make your own judgement as to what it states. If you want to make an opposing argument feel free to link to material that demonstrates the opposite, I can link to plenty of material in both English and Hebrew written by current/former IDF, that argues that pursuing conflict and being pre-emptive and strategic is in fact necessary to combating terrorism. Netanyahu makes this argument himself in his book [\\"Fighting Terrorism\\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247885702_Fighting_Terrorism_How_Democracies_Can_Defeat_the_International_Terrorism_Network), which I have to say, for as much as I disagree with Netanyahu, he does make a good, fact-based argument as to why being hard-lined and intolerant is necessary.\\nLastly the crux of my statement was that Israel isn't pursuing this doctrine in a vacuum anyway, and that is the problem, you read my post as critique against Israel - in reality it's critique of the United States. What I imply is that Israel's military doctrine, which I linked, and it's pursuit of conflict, is in reality the desire of the United States hence why little to no controls are placed upon it.","title":"Mark Kelly wont back conditions on aid to Israel amid Lebanon escalation"},{"text":"Fixed!

On the contrary his foreign policy vision is made crystal clear here. The root 2 causes driving the survival of any nation he says are availability of natural resources and consequently population growth (or lack of it thereof). Germany lacked natural resources and land to grow food for a large population. Adam Tooze in Wages of Destruction examines how land sizes were far too small in pre WW2 Germany and this prevented industrialised farming like what was prevalent in the USA then. This in turn affected fertility levels in rural Germany which Hitler saw as the \\"real Germany\\". In addition to this Germany lacked oil, rubber and a whole host of minerals. His plan (he doesn't lay it out sequentially but Andreas Hilgruber breaks it down for us) was to first ally with England and Italy  rearm defeat the immediate neighbours in the East  defeat Soviet Russia. \\nAll this though was a sideshow to the main conflict. According to Hitler the Soviet Union was the short term rival but the real long term enemy was the USA. Once the SU was secured he will then use the resources from it to rearm Germany to meet US levels of defense expenditure (that it was capable of eventually). He saw Roosevelt as the #1 Jew standing in his way preventing the peaceful (lol, I know) rise of Germany.

The focus was never on defining the difference between soundness and validityit was about the ethical responsibility lying with the human user, not the tool. AI doesnt need to care about premises for ethical reasoning because its a tool, not an agent of morality. The user decides what is ethically sound by verifying the information. If you dont grasp this fundamental separation, no wonder you found the original argument weak.Counter-Rebuttal to Source and Intent:Your attempt to argue that considering the source is self-defeating is laughable. The point wasnt about dismissing AI as a tool but about highlighting that humans bring more than mechanical logic to the tablethey bring context, intent, and accountability. To ignore this is intellectually shallow. If the source truly didnt matter, we wouldnt bother educating debaters on logical fallacies, historical biases, or ethical dilemmas. Its exactly because intent and ethical weight matter that AI arguments are often less nuanced than human ones.Counter-Rebuttal to Overgeneralization Claim:Calling it an overgeneralization that AI makes errors doesnt save your argument. You fail to grasp the fact that while AI may craft logical arguments based on available data, it lacks the critical understanding of the meaning or implications behind them. This is not just an overgeneralizationits a structural flaw. Yes, humans make errors, but at least they understand the consequences of those errors. AI is a mindless machine spitting out text without understanding. Equating it with human fallibility just shows your lack of depth in the discussion.Final Note:Next time, try to actually read and understand the points made instead of resorting to knee-jerk criticisms.

The responsibility still falls on the human to interpret and assess the quality.AI confused an argument being sound with an argument being valid. It did not respond to the criticism (that disregarding the correctness of premises to win an argument is unethical).You argue that the source of an argument is irrelevant, but this overlooks the fact that the context and intention behind an argument can influence its validity and ethical standing. An AI can generate endless arguments without accountability or intent, whereas human thought is shaped by experience and understanding. The process of formulating an argument matters because human reasoning involves ethical considerations that AI lacks. Ignoring the source reduces argumentation to mere wordplay.Your argument suggests that the source is irrelevant, but its a false equivalence. AI lacks understanding and contextfundamentals of argumentation. A human source brings the ability to reflect on the implications of their arguments.

Evaluating an argument without considering its source ignores these critical factors.Self-defeating.You argue that AI generates incoherent or incorrect statements, but this is an overgeneralization.

These Comprehensive grants and loans will increase energy and water efficiency, reduce climate pollution, generate renewable energy, reduce housing operating costs, promote the use of green building materials, and improve the quality of life for residents by making their homes more resilient to climate hazards. As of today, over $1.12 billion from President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act has now been awarded to 225 properties and nearly 26,000 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. With these awards, 97 percent of funds dedicated to GRRP have now been awarded. Todays awards not only represent the largest dollar amount of grants and loans made under the program at one time to date but include 11 properties participating in HUDs Section 202 project-based rental assistance program for low-income seniors and six Section 811 program for low-income persons with disabilities.HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced these grants today in Boston, MA, where HUD today awarded over $7 million for two properties to make crucial upgrades for residents.  \\n...  \\nPresident Bidens Inflation Reduction Act-the largest climate investment in history-established the GRRP in 2022 to fund energy efficiency and climate resilience improvements for multifamily properties participating in HUDs project-based rental assistance programs This effort advances environmental justice through President Bidens Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  \\n...  \\nThe grants and loans announced today represent the first GRRP awards in Hawaii, South Dakota, and Nebraska, and bring the total amount of funding under this program to more than $1.12 billion in 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This is the fourth and final set of awards made under the GRRPs Comprehensive category, which provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades. One remaining award announcement for the GRRP Elements category is expected in the coming months.  \\n...  \\nTodays awardees include 26 properties that participate in the HUD Section 8 project-based rental assistance program for low-income individuals and families, 11 properties in HUDs Section 202 project-based rental assistance program for low-income seniors, and six properties that receive support through HUDs Section 811 supportive housing for people with disabilities. Three properties have more than 200 units, 21 properties have between 51-200 units, and 19 properties have fewer than 50 units.*FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date** GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. The Justice40 Initiative sets a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\\n* As of October 3, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 225 properties and more than 25,940 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\\n* GRRP funding is being used for insulation, energy efficient windows and doors, heat-resistant roofs, energy efficient heating and cooling, resilience measures and other improvements.\\n* Approximately 900 properties have also signed up for HUDs free energy and water benchmarking service, funded with more than $40 million from the Presidents Inflation Reduction Act, so that HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties in relation to other similar properties. This benchmarking information can in turn be used to assess energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades that can be funded under the GRRP....\\nList of recipients for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman:HUD has awarded over $1.1 billion through the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program to modernize housing for families across the country as the climate crisis continues to affect our most vulnerable communities, said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. The awards announced today advance the Biden-Harris Administrations housing and clean energy goals to ensure families we serve live in resilient, energy efficient, and comfortable homes where they can thrive.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces More Than $279 Million in New Housing Investments | New awards will support climate resilience and energy efficiency renovations."},{"text":"I have knocked on hundreds of doors, some in pretty sketch neighborhoods, and surprisingly have only been yelled at once, and that was an elderly woman with dementia.

Do you have any idea how much of NATO's prized weaponry and equipment Russia has already turned to scrap? The world has never seen such graveyards of NATOs untouchable gear. When Middle Eastern sheep herders see NATOs equipment in flames, the illusion of invincibility goes up in smoke. They start thinking, \\"Hey, maybe we *can* beat these guysall we need are Russias weapons that have been tearing through NATO hardware like tissue paper.\\" And thats where Russia steps in, with battlefield-tested arms that have proven their worth against NATOs finest toys.I personally believe that the easiest path for the Russian government would be to restart the war after a few years or to start a new one somewhere in the Central Asia/Caucasus/Baltics. This will again create demand for more and more weapons and the Russian state can continue without making significant changes.I can somewhat agree with this point. Russia seems to be trying to restore its borders to their 1991 state, and Russian politicians have been pretty clear about that being their goal. The reasoning is straightforwardthey want to reestablish a buffer zone because NATO has been inching closer and closer to their doorstep. Russia does have a point here: weve been poking the bear for years, and now its angry, determined to push NATO far from its borders. To do that, though, they'd need to reclaim not only Ukraine but also the Baltic states, Georgia, and other former republics. If NATO loses in Ukraine, it could pave the way for Russias ambitions, and from the looks of things in Ukraine, NATO might soon be forced to back down.","title":"CMV: If peace is achieved in Ukraine now, it can be expected that Russia starts another war within a few years"},{"text":"Arguments arent dismantled like you have said and  its very rare for there to be a clear cut right answer in a debate and much more rare for a debater to acknowledge the larger issues is seeing an AI make an optimal argument (even if it is wrong) and possibly disproportionately convincing people as a result.","title":"CMV: Using AI to formulate arguments is unethical and inevitable."},{"text":"\\"They wouldn't let us vote, if it could actually changed anything.\\"","title":"What if the Election is a PSYOP to Make Us *Think* Were in Control?"},{"text":"Yeah she needs to sit down and ramble on about nothing more often!

I'm arguing that there are at least some ways in which people can use ai to help them come up with better beliefs and opinions and one of those ways is getting it to point out actual errors in your own arguments.. So it isn't about getting the ai to be critical of its own ideas its about getting the ai to be critical of YOUR ideas. Because again, if something is wrong, then its wrong regardless of where it comes from. Which for most people I think this can be an enormously powerful tool to quickly and effectively expose problems with their ideas. In regards to doing this to the point of running into the limits of the ai its probably because its also near the limits of our understanding of the subject as humans in general. Which when it comes to that level of knowledge the idea of wrong and right beliefs gets thrown out the window and is usually replaced by systems of theories that different experts hold and that can be classified as having a certain amount of support. That doesn't neccessarily mean its more likely to be right or wrong just that a certain percentage of the qualified experts in the field beleive in different potential solutions and what those rates are.  This is where all knowledge eventualy leads. Which I am making the argument that if you want to get \\"caught up\\" to where we currently are with any given topic or field a really good way to do this is to have an ai point out whats wrong with your ideas and then keep doing that until you either find yourself in the same system of many potential ways forward or you yourself come up with something that pushes that field forward.

First, DOE announced an investment of $1.5 billion in four transmission projects that will improve grid reliability and resilience, relieve costly transmission congestion, and open access to affordable energy to millions of Americans across the country. Supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and administered through DOEs Grid Deployment Office (GDO), the projects selected today for the Transmission Facilitation Program will enable nearly 1,000 miles of new transmission development and 7,100 MW of new capacity throughout Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, while creating nearly 9,000 good-paying jobs. DOE also released the final National Transmission Planning (NTP) Study, a set of long-term planning tools and analyses that examine a wide range of potential future scenarios through 2050 to identify pathways to maintain grid reliability, increase resilience, and reduce costs, while meeting local, regional, interregional, and national interests and supporting the changing energy landscape. The study finds that the United States will need to approximately double to triple the 2020 transmission capacity by 2050 in order to meet demand growth and reliability needs, and hundreds of billions of dollars of cost savings can be achieved through substantial transmission expansion and interregional planning. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken aggressive action to support these needed grid expansions, including streamlining the federal permitting process for new transmission projects, supporting upgrades of existing lines, advancing long-term transmission planning, and delivering the largest investment in grid infrastructure in the nations history through the Administrations Investing in America agenda.*Accelerating Near-Term Transmission Development through Federal Financing Support*To catalyze near-term transmission deployment, today DOE announced an investment of $1.5 billion in four transmission projects through the Transmission Facilitation Program, an innovative revolving fund program that helps overcome the financial hurdles facing transmission development.  Todays [October 2nd] investments will improve critical interregional grid connections, bring diverse clean energy resources to more customers, bolster resilience to extreme weather, and deliver hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect community benefits. These investments advance the Biden-Harris Administrations Justice40 Initiative\\n, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  \\n...  \\nWith todays announcement following prior selections of Southline Phase 1, the Southwest Intertie Project-North, and the Cross-Tie 500kV Transmission Line Project, nearly all of the legislated $2.5 billion of TFP funding is now committed. GDO will continue to evaluate the TFP revolving fund balance as projects advance in construction and relieve DOE of its current obligations. The program intends to open future funding opportunities when there are sufficient uncommitted funds available.*Long-term Interregional Planning Benefits*While transmission planning usually happens at the local or regional level, the National Transmission Planning Study shows that grid reliability can be maintained at the lowest cost with the highest level of reliability by coordinating interregional transmission. The NTP Study was developed in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to be used as a long-term planning tool. Key takeaways include: * A substantial expansion of the transmission system throughout the entire contiguous United States will deliver the largest benefits and could lead to national electric system cost savings of $270 billionC$490 billion through 2050.  \\n* Significant return on investment, with every dollar spent on transmission meaning approximately $1.60 to $1.80 in system costs is saved. \\n* When transmission regions coordinate to achieve resource adequacy, system costs through 2050 are lowered by $170 billionC$380 billion.  The NTP Study is designed to enhance and encourage interregional planning efforts. It does not replace industry planning or identify a specific set of transmission lines that should be built. Rather, the NTP Study identifies potential opportunities for industry planners to consider projects that would benefit customers under a wide range of future scenarios. The NTP Study development included the expansion and creation of transmission planning toolsincluding open-source software, new modeling capabilities, and free research licensesthat DOE now is making available to planning entities, regional transmission operators/independent system operators, utilities, and states to help advance planning of interregional transmission across the nation.List of recipients is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk:The U.S. transmission network is the backbone of our nations electricity system. Though our grid has served U.S. energy needs for more than a century, our countrys needs are changing, said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk. DOEs approach to deploying near-term solutions and developing long-term planning tools will ensure our electric grid is more interconnected and resilient than ever before, while also supporting greater electricity demand. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to bolstering our power grid to improve the everyday life of Americans through affordable power, fewer blackouts, more reliable power, and additional jobs across our country.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests $1.5 Billion to Bolster the Nation's Electricity Grid and Deliver Affordable Electricity to Meet New Demands"},{"text":"\\"If\\" lol","title":"What if the Election is a PSYOP to Make Us *Think* Were in Control?"},{"text":"Lol no one is leaving the left to join the right.

The opinion also is, to a degree, self-contradictory in that it suggests that a limited $10,000 waiver is not authorized yet a full waiver could be.This most recent attempt by Biden is under an entirely different statue unrelated to the HEROS act that you are referencing.

I'm not sure he hates any particular group, though I don't think he is fond of Muslims.That said, I also think he is facing the most polarized future of anyone who has ever run for office before.  Because it looks like he is either going to the White House or the Big House (prison).I DO think that if he's elected, he might try to stir the rabble to get them to back some sort of mass deportation plan.  Mainly so he can claim he's saving the country.  He doesn't really know how to govern.  Note: He had no legislative agenda when he was prez.I also agree with Dale\\\\_Glass that a mass deportation of 10++ million people would result in a lot of deaths.  He's also not big on the rule of law, and I could see that deportation turning into \\"illegals are fair game\\".Back in 2021 JD Vance went on a right wing talk show - Jack Murphy.  I think what he said was a way of applying for the job of Veep.  In summary Vance said:  Don't shut down the administrative state, co-opt it.  Fire every single mid level bureaucrat in it and replace them with our people.  And when you get taken to court, and you will get taken to court, and when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say, \\"The Chief Justice has made his ruling, now let him enforce it.\\"  Start the video at the 26 minute mark and you can hear it straight from the horses mouth.....[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMq1ZEcyztY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMq1ZEcyztY)That is a historically accurate quote.  And indeed the Supreme court had told Jackson he could not proceed with his plan to \\"ethnically cleanse\\" the eastern part of the US of Native Americans by forcing them to march west of the Mississippi.  Jackson did proceed, it was called \\"The trail of tears\\" and it will forever be a dark stain on our history.So - trump plus Vance is a frightening combo.  I could easily see vance setting up \\"concentration\\" camps of undesirables.  I could see him finding a way for trump to declare marshal law.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"Wow, I cant believe her handlers actually posted that.","title":"Kamala Harris Did Not Just Post This About Lebanon"},{"text":"During the first 8 months of Dubya's time in the White House? his approval ratings were in the crapper.\\nThen 9/11 happened.?\\nAll of a sudden, the American people gathered around their \\"leader\\" to support him.

In that sense there are more winning arguments for one idea over another. At least to me it sounds like you are saying this process will just be taken over by ai, where instead of pundits and internet debaters it will be driven by different ai models who are trying to best all the others.  Although perhaps this isn't the worst way to form your own opinions it certainly isn't the way science and technology progresses. Instead it relies on one very powerful tool which is falsification. In fact this is what sets science apart from pseudoscience or just theorizing, is the ability for some idea to be falsified. This is what the peer review process is for. It isn't to comment on what you like about a certain paper or if you think its rhetorically powerful or not, instead the entire purpose is to figure out what is wrong with it. What are the mistakes. Because although arguments and ideas can sound convincing none of that matters if a part of it is wrong. Its just wrong and has to be fixed and if it can't be fixed then we consider it a failed theory. All of that to say that although we can turn to ai to give us good reasons for the beliefs that we have or good arguments against the beliefs that we don't have we can also just ask it to tell us why we are wrong. Ask it to falsify all of your ideas and beliefs. This way it isn't convincing you of anything, it isn't taking a stance or bias or position on any given topic, its just finding the things that are wrong or mistaken with your views and would still be wrong no matter who holds those ideas or what qualifications they have. In the same way that the peer review process  tries to make everything annoymous, that as long as a researcher gets back a review that highlights a bunch of errors and mistakes it just wouldn't matter where that review came from. if it was a fellow expert, a child, a dog, an alien or an ai model.","title":"CMV: Using AI to formulate arguments is unethical and inevitable."},{"text":"Trump and his ilk are very, very vocal about what they would like to do if they have the power to do it.People just pretend they're kidding or don't listen to what they're actually saying.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"The Michigan Militia is.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"Saluted a north Korean general.

'The bottom line is it looks a lot more like a loser than it does like a winner when it comes to the country being on the right track.'Enten also shared the historical data from specific years, pointing out that the lowest this figure has been in a year that the incumbent party won was 39 percent, when President Bill Clinton won a second term over Republican Bob Dole and Independent Ross Perot in 1996. When Ronald Reagan won a blowout in 1984, 47 percent of Americans thought the country was on the right track.'So there is no historical precedent for the White House party winning another term in the White House when just 28 percent of the country thinks that were on the right track,' Enten said. 'Simply put, it would be historically unprecedented.'I agree with Enten going against the sheeple in the MSM, because Harris has not got this locked up to me either: it's going to be a nail-biter for her if she wins, and Trump won't get a mandate if he does, definitely get the vibe 2024 is going to be more Rep leaning than 2020.","title":"CNN Reporter Warns Kamala Harris Campaign Looks Like a Loser"},{"text":"Youre correct.

Using AI to do our thinking can be seen as a violation of our nature as thinking beings. It may lead to a dependency on AI, reducing our ability to think critically and independently.While AI has the potential to enhance our understanding and communication, it is essential to recognize its limitations and ethical implications.

I think JD is trying to set the stage to be culture issue agnostic or even agreeing with the left on some issues (abortion, basic gun control, staying out of peoples personal lives, etc.) but still will economically be Peter Theils lapdog. Why do I care? Theres probably about ten percent of voters in this country who culturally dont really care (let people do what they want, leave me and mine the option if were decent people, and stay out of my shit) but are economically a bit more trickle down minded. They tend to swing between parties between who can come across better in that limited political space to them. JD seems like he understands that (which, being an Ohioan I get- Brown will win in Nov even while Trump wins Ohio, and the difference will be the north shore where I bet theres a non-insignificant amount of Trump-Brown voters). And that makes him dangerous Tl;dr- Vance appears to be playing the long game in a way that COULD be viable to be a serious contender in 2028+ if he can shake Trump after this November. And hes planting those seeds NOW.","title":"JD Vance claimed Democrats are censoring the internet.

Second, its understandable to be nervous, Im nervous every time I do it. The good thing is that you are sent to houses that are either Democratic voters, independents, or young first time voters. The amount of doors that open for you depends entirely on where you go. Ive had both a 25% rate and a 60% rate. My recommendations are to just try to be yourself. Dont follow the script they give you, ignore that. Introduce yourself, confirm their name, say youre with the X State Democratic Party, and then ask them how theyre feeling about the election. Use that to gauge your next move. You can ask them what issues they care about the most. You can explain why youre voting Democrat, or talk about the importance of that issue. We always made sure to mention the Senator running as well as the State Supreme Court justices who show up non-partisan on the ballot (our House seat wasnt competitive sadly). You can offer literature. If no one answers, just leave literature but never in a mailbox. If you see a no soliciting or no trespassing sign, no matter how small, always skip. Ive skipped even if it was like on a Ring doorbell small. You wont be at the doors long. Mostly its just about showing people someone from the campaign cares about them. You just ask them questions and listen to them. You can try to persuade if you feel comfortable but just your presence and your ear are enough to remind people to vote or help people who are on the fence to move to our side. Its actually kind of fun and its really good for the soul. You meet lots of different people and most people are receptive. Some arent, and you just say thank you and have a good day. Some people are curt, some want to chat, and every now and again someone will be excited and happy to see you and glad youre out doing what youre doing and will thank you. Its not easy asking strangers about something as charged as politics, but always remember that you represent the State Party, youll never see these people again in all likelihood, and just being there makes a difference. My last tip is to complement them. Complement their house, their flowers, a baby if theyre holding one. Or if theyre a busy mom, commiserate with them. These small things help lower peoples defenses and put a smile on their face.","title":"Its not won: Democrats jittery over razor-thin race in Michigan"},{"text":"And its possible that Trump is only a trojan horse to get Vance into office, who is the one who really endorses project 2025 despite the fact that he's 'denounced' it","title":"House Democrats new bogeyman: Project 2025"},{"text":"Annnnd??","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Stuck on Repeat in Teleprompter Glitch"},{"text":"Yes","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":" those people dont know what theyre talking aboutAnd the Nazis did?","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"Imagine if this happened to Trump, this post would get 30 thousand likes, and people would be celebrating ??ahh predictable Marxist Reddit, you never disappoint. ?","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Stuck on Repeat in Teleprompter Glitch"},{"text":"Hes lying!?!

Further, I don't see it's widespread use at all (e.g. I see men explain things dozens of times every day, i hear the word mansplaining less than once a month).  Secondly, we have to have the ability to talk about dynamics that exist broadly across the sexes.  These are things that everyone is subject to, but the thought is that women experience this eager-to-explain or assumption-of-needing-the-explanation more often than men experience it.  And...that the balance of this difference in experience is weight toward men explaining to women than men to men and women to women.  Thirdly, if someone is actually doing this thoughtlessly - they are a solid example that in aggregate leads to this idea, then...it's supposed to not be a nice thing.  It's deragatory like saying \\"bigot\\" is deragatory - it's intended to tell someone they are doing something wrong.  Why should we NOT say it when it's accurate?

However, there are a couple of things that have been said in the comments that I think are extremely worthy of a huge asterisk that it doesnt seem like youve changed your mind on. Im not sure if theyve influenced your opinion more than Ive understood in reading your comments or if you dont find them as compelling as I do, but Id like to list them and see what your thoughts are.The first, and biggest thing I see is that he released thousands of documents that he didnt know the contents of. He didnt care who the documents gave sensitive information about, who got their hands on the documents, or who got hurt as a result of his whistleblowing. In addition to that, he did so without trying official channels. Would those official channels have been effective? Maybe not, but they might have. They at least should have been tried first. Assuming they didnt work, should he have gone public? Sure. However, he absolutely should have very carefully gone through all of the data and only released what was necessary to his purpose and to have avoided releasing as much sensitive information as possible. Do you agree on that?My second issue is with your stance on him residing in Russia. You claim he didnt flee to Russia. How do you defend that? He fled the U.S. and ended up in Russia. Maybe Russia wasnt his original intention, but he certainly ended up there. Also, I saw the discussion you had comparing his whistleblowing to exposing animal rights violations, and you compared it to him leaving a factory, that factory chasing him, and him going to a similar factory for protection. Id argue that its more akin to him exposing an animal shelter as a kill shelter, then running to Michael Vick (Ive heard hes changed his life, so assume this is 2006) for protection. Yes, the NSA was violating the 4th Amendment and should absolutely have been held accountable. However, Russia has far more human rights violations.Lastly, and this is my own point, I think we need to define the term hero. Merriam Webster gives a few definitions.?\\t?a mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability (definitely doesnt fit)\\n?\\t?an illustrious warrior (doesnt fit)\\n?\\t?a person admired for achievements and noble qualities (arguable, but seems like there should be an asterisk regarding the release of thousands of unnecessary documents that he didnt know the contents of)\\n?\\t?one who shows great courage (arguable, but fleeing and staying in Russia should place an asterisk)\\n?\\t?the principal character in a literary or dramatic work (obviously doesnt fit)\\n?\\t?the central figure in an event, period, or movement (maybe, but what event, period, or movement?)\\n?\\t?an object of extreme admiration and devotion : IDOL (I would hope not, I dont think any human should be)So, what exactly do you mean by hero?

The United States hasnt lost huge swaths of territory like Germany did at the end of WW2, so there is obviously no revanchism. There are undeniable The need for Lebensraum was a justification for Germanys desire to regain lost territory, territory which already had German minorities and majorities, and had been ruled by Germans for centuries before that. If a nation hasnt had a major loss of territory, they can be fascistic without the revanchism, as was Nationalist Spain. Though Franco wanted Gibraltar, Spain wasnt in any position to contest the UK. Germany was more successful at this because it was more industrialized and efficient. Russia today, however, is revanchist in the same way as Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and even post Franco-Prussian War France if were being fair. Hitler, by his own admission, was influenced by Mussolini, so they are very much alike and in reality different regional flavors of the same thing. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy both were trying to reclaim former glory. They wanted to recreated a period in the past where heir people were more powerful and controlled more of the world. That along with anticommunism are more relevant to their philosophies than just pure jingoist expansion. The United States also has much more territory and way less density than Germany. Theres more land for the people already there, so it makes more sense to deny that land to others rather than the huge cost than to advocate for expansion out of no where. A movement trying to return to the good old days will always be tainted by comparisons to the Nazis, and I think if that movement cant survive that scrutiny, theres probably something there.

Esper, wrote in his memoir that Mr. Trump had raised it with him and asked if the United States could make it look as if some other country was responsible. Mr. Esper portrayed the idea as ludicrous.Yet instead of condemning the idea, some Republicans publicly welcomed word that Mr. Trump had wanted to use military force against the drug cartels on Mexican soil  and without the consent of Mexicos government. Mr. Trumps notion of a military intervention south of the border has swiftly evolved from an Oval Office fantasy to something approaching Republican Party doctrine.On the presidential campaign trail and on the G.O.P. debate stage in California last week, nearly every Republican candidate has been advocating versions of a plan to send U.S. Special Operations troops into Mexican territory to kill or capture drug cartel members and destroy their labs and distribution centers.On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers have drafted a broad authorization for the use of military force against cartels  echoing the war powers Congress gave former President George W. Bush before the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. They have also pushed for designating Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations  a related idea Mr. Trump flirted with as president but backed off after Mexico hotly objected. Now, if Mr. Trump returns to the White House in 2025, he has vowed to push for the designations and to deploy Special Operations troops and naval forces to, as he put it, declare war on the cartels.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"wouldnt the survivability be tested just the same if it were done with dogs or monkeys, like it was done with space rockets?","title":"Pay close attention to what happens to her next.."},{"text":"Yeah I wonder why he doesnt want to be associated with project 2025","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 5, 2024 - 31 days until election day!"},{"text":"Sweet shirt.

His followers are nicknamed the Hakenkreuzler.?**So violent are Hitlers fulminations against the Jews that a number of prominent Jewish citizens are reported to have sought safe asylums in the Bavarian highlands**, easily reached by fast motor cars, whence they could hurry their women and children when forewarned of an anti-Semitic St. Bartholomews night.But?**several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitlers anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers**?and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes.**A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism**, saying: You cant expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims.?**You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism.**?It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them. \\"Turns out, he was in fact just as antisemitic and just as violent as he sounded, but we only know that after millions are dead, people just naturally don't want to accept the fact things might actually turn horrifying, 'really eerie thing to read now.Israel is a Jewish state. How could it be Nazi?I don't think anyone's arguing Israel is literally copying the exact detailed ideology of the NSDAP, it's that Israel parallels much of what the Nazis did.No. Because clearly, they are not fighting and killing at full force. If Israel were run by a Hitler, the area around Israel would be a howling wasteland and the Palestinians would have ceased to exist around 1948.The Israeli government in 1948 is not the Israeli government in 2024, both are horrible anti-Palestinian settler colonizers in my view but they aren't the same.Antisemitism in Germany didn't begin with the Nazis, it had already existed for a long long long time before. Anti-Palestinianism in Israel also didn't begin with Likud and Netanyahu, it had already existed since Israel's creation. Even when the Nazis took power, they didn't become as openly and publicly horrifyingly violent instantly. Their antisemitic policies got gradually worse and worse over time. It was first boycotts of Jewish-owned businesses, then it was prohibition from areas of employment, then it was strippings of citizenship and deportations, then it was massacres and the buildings of concentration camps, and then we had the Holocaust, one of the worst if not the worst atrocity in human history.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"[https://gizmodo.com/truth-social-users-are-losing-ridiculous-sums-of-money-to-scams-2000506604](https://gizmodo.com/truth-social-users-are-losing-ridiculous-sums-of-money-to-scams-2000506604)","title":"Biden destroyed little Marco and MAGA ??"},{"text":"You should not be certain.

Nazism Was About Aggression Against Other CountriesThis seems to be central to your view, and I think it's a pretty strong misunderstanding. The Nazis were definitely aggressive to their neighbors but I don't think that was the core of their ideology, that was an extension of it. The core of Nazi ideology was racial supremacy and the pursuit of a perfect Aryan race to dominate the world. The aggression extended from this in that it:1. rationalized that all other races were inferior and therefore and therefore justified conquering their land.2. positioned the Nazis as those who were the rightful rulers of any land they saw fit.I think this is an important distinction because racial supremacy does not necessarily lead to the invasion of other nations. This was the route followed by German Nazis specifically because of the strong German culture of militarism. It manifests in other ways in other cultures based on their cultural legacy, attitudes and history. The root of Nazism is very much alive today, the difference is how it manifests which is where the modern comparisons start to make more sense. The telltale signs are extreme racism and xenophobia, not military invasion.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"i've lost respect for all the intelligent, professionals who decided to wait till now to \\"notice\\" how awful trump is.\\nEsp when it comes to the military.

Specifically, every one of us who worked in an emergency, intensive care, or surgical setting treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head or chest on a regular or even a daily basis.

While i don't think it's appropriate to diagnose someones behavior without proper context or credentials, I've read that chronic disrespect or hostility towards others can sometimes stem from deeper emotional or psychological issues. Factors like unresolved trauma, insecurity, or even certain personality disorders (narcissistic or antisocial personality disorders) can lead people to act disrespectfully toward others. Have you shared your edgy Reddit comments with your therapist? It may be relevant. Another article I've read mentioned people who have a difficult time managing their emotions or who feel threatened by differing viewpoints may lash out in this way.That being said though, disrespectful behavior can also simply be a reflection of your upbringing, values, or lack of emotional maturity rather than your mental health issues.

It sounds like you are just mansplaining and dont like being called out on it. Because mansplaining is now used whenever a man is explaining anything, ever - or at least in my experience. Even if a woman has asked directly for an explanation, surrounding people without that context will still automatically assume mansplaining.You can be directly asked a question and still mansplain it. \\nSimilarly, Ive had experiences where I was explaining my own mistake and surrounding people said its mansplaining. That doesnt even make sense. So, no one else noticed or understood the mistake you made and without your explanation, the error would not only have gone unnoticed but would likely have been repeated by others? Or, I was trying to ask a complex question and I explained the background of it so that it made sense but people still call it mansplaining.This was actually the part that motivated me to comment. You were mansplaining something you didnt know and had a question about. You either were asking people (likely) incapable of answering regardless of background provided -OR- they never needed it in the first place. If its the former, why were you asking people who didnt know but if its the latter, they didnt need your context and you providing it *was* condescending. I wasnt there and I dont know you. Nor do you know me. But, you brought this up and it appears to bother you. The issue will include other people, but you are an integral part of this issue. By not looking inward and blaming others, youll just keep this up. You likely are above average intelligence and good at the things that drive your questions. However, youll do yourself more favors by simplifying your questions or researching them more if they are as complex as you are perceiving them as or trust the people you are asking to be able to ask you the additional information they need to answer your question. Ask your question and see if they know. If they dont know -and- they could answer it, theyll (likely) be able to ask for what more they need. Otherwise, if you ask and they have no idea, more information wont help because they wont be able to take their ignorance and be taught more than you know and more than you understand on a complex topic.

That last part is largely implied but it's really important. A man explaining something to another man in a condescending manner is not mansplaining. A woman explaining something to a man in a condescending manner is not mansplaining. A woman explaining something to another woman in a condescending manner is not mansplaining. A man explaining something to a woman in a condescending manner because he honestly misjudged her level of knowledge on a subject is also not mansplaining.All of the above scenarios happen every day. The difference is when it's done because the man assumes the woman doesn't know about this topic by virtue of being a woman. Which is sexist.So therefore the term mansplaining is not sexist but rather it is an _accusation of sexism_. A bit like how calling someone a racist is not being derogatory if they are indeed being racist in your opinion. Does the word get over used and abused? Sure. But then so does the word \\"racist\\". But that doesn't make it a derogatory word.","title":"cmv: Mansplaining is a sexist, derogatory word and should be treated as such"},{"text":"Source on the 5.4%?

Theyre killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union because we dont have borders anymore.\\" Ignoring the fact that you are vastly more likely to be the victim of a U.S. citizen by birth than an immigrant, the choice of words there is very specific and dehumanizing.Trump himself has a long history of such comments, and they have gotten more direct recently.  Militia organizations like Patriot Front, who are explicitly self described as a neo-nazi organization and adopted the literal faces as their symbol, are emboldened by sich rhetoric.  They have started noticeably posting signs near where I live. They may not represent the average GOP voter, but they are the type of people who showed up at Charlottesville and on January 6th 2021.  Trump is clearly fine with them. Most of the rest of the GOP tries to pretend that many of the things that happened that day didn't occur. None of this has prevented them from continuing to use dehumanizing and libelous rhetoric against immigrants; Trump and Vance more recently claimed that Haitian immigrants are eating household pets, completely without evidence.Members of the so-called \\"Freedom Caucus,\\" notably Ron de Santos, Mike Waltz, and MTG, have also openly supported war with Mexico as a means to get the drug and immigration  issues under control.While not necessarily the thinly-veiled annexation people associate with the Nazis today, remember that the Nazis started small. The annexation of the Sudetenland was under the pretense of protecting the German speaking minority there.  Germany justified invading Poland by trying to paint Poland as the aggressor. Similarly, the rhetoric the Freedom Caucus uses towards Mexico suggests that the movement of people and drugs is a deliberate \\"invasion,\\" which warrants a response in kind.I should not need to explicitly say this, but this rhetoric is intentionally deceitful.  The flux of refugees from Central America and the influence of the cartels is just as much a problem for Mexico as it is for us.  The biggest factor that contributes to both of these problems in the corruption and political instability of the region, and anybody who suggests that a military invasion is the best tools those issues is a fool. In short, both of the Nazi characteristics you mentioned have become part of the platform of Trump and the Freedom Caucus.  They have become the windsock for primary performance and indicate the direction the party is heading.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"I'm not trying to discredit your experiences but just because you've experienced one thing doesn't mean that the opposite doesnt also happen.

But then I observed what most women considered Mansplaining and realized that for many women it really was just a misandrist attempt to shut men up. As about 99% of Mansplaining cases I have seen/had pointed out to me by women are legitimate cases where a man should be explaining to someone who should probably understand whatever is being discussed. But after this term blew up many women seemingly started to get offended whenever any man explained anything to them regardless of context. So while I disagree the the term Mansplaining is inherently sexist.

I tend to think of militia as heavily armed, often also having trained together.  My definition of militia might be too narrow.

I think instead people should just criticize the ideology in more detail without the comparison.  You shouldn't need nazis as an example to explain how bigotry is wrong.I think if someone says a militia surrounding the legislature as an intimidation tactic was how the enabling act was passed, that's a fair comparison to make to other violent militias that try to intimidate a legislature.

To Hitler, the conflict between races was the driving engine of history, like class conflict was to Marx. All human systems, relationships, and institutions only mattered or had value based on their impact on the racial body. Races were engaged in a constant struggle for domination  stronger races expanded, while weaker ones declined. (In this, you can also see how decades of social darwinist ideas also penetrated his thinking.)In order for a race to survive, then, it had to expand. Hitlers focus on conquering Eastern Europe stemmed from his underlying race-based worldview. If you read Mein Kampf or especially his second, unpublished book, which is entirely about foreign policy, this is very clear. Lebensraum didnt inherently refer to a particular territory; it quite literally meant space for the propagation of the Aryan race. The fact that such space existed in Eastern Europe was entirely due to the geopolitical situation of Europe at the time. All of this is to say, you can have Nazism without wanting to conquer Eastern Europe. Heck, you can have Nazism without wanting to conquer any additional territory. Whats fundamental is an ideology that equates the national political community with a single racial community and uses membership in that community as the sole qualification for membership. It also must believe in a perpetual state of racial *conflict*, and argue that any actions taken to advance the races interest are justified.As to whether any current political movements or governments qualify under that definition, your mileage may vary.

This is not at all an endorsement for the evil fuckers on the other side but there is a demographic that hears \\"The economy is doing great\\" and cannot reconcile that with increasing debt and stacked up bills and skimping on dinner to pay rent. And a tax credit for home buyers, while a fantastic idea, is also not appealing to these same voters for which the prospect of home ownership is so distant that a tax credit means nothing to them. They have struggled to make a connection with a lot of these voters and it's sad because the other side is straight up lying but appeals to them. [It is true that overall employment numbers and average pay went up under President Joe Biden. But for some Trump supporters, that economic boost pales in comparison to the massive surge in inflation during Bidens term, with prices rising almost 20%.

It makes you question whether people know about history about something not WW2.However, **comparing** fascist or fascist-adjacent regimes like Russia seems fine to me. They can share characteristics that are important to highlight, but still not be equivalent. I agree that Nazi comparisons are overused, but I don't think we should always avoid them.For example, comparing Russia to Nazi Germany is effective. The comparison has moral weight beyond the fact that both Russia and Nazi Germany are doing/did bad things. We are reminded of the West's appeasement of Hitler, of the need for the West to unite and fight back, and of the irony that it is now Russia of all countries doing what the Nazis did. In this European context, the Nazi comparison seems pretty apt.Neither Israel nor Hamas map on that well to Nazism. Devoid of the European context, it makes any comparison seem completely superficial and bad faith. The less said about Ukrainian Nazis, the better.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"No, I just really don't like apartheid and genocide.","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"I see where youre going with this and Im with you.But if youre saying that Trump is planning a genocide, please tell me more.

What he wants is for Ukraine to bend the knee and become loyal subjects once again. And thats not OK! But its also not Nazism.   I think this is the biggest issue with your argument: the notion that \\"Nazis\\" only existed from 1941 to 1945.   Believe it or not, it wasn't the intention of the Nazis for most of their reign to genocide Jewish people. For years their goal was to make life so bad in Germany that Jews would leave freely. For a while they looked into forced deportation.   It's not until the final years of the Nazi regime that they turned to genocide.    So essentially, when you say \\"I don't think Putin wants to genocide Ukranians so any comparisons to the Nazis should not be made\\", you're saying that we should erase the 1920 to 1940 history of the Nazis and we can only ever think about Nazis in the context of 1941-1945 Nazis.    First off, this is an extremely reductive way of viewing history. You're saying that we can't ever take a nuanced look at history.  Secondly, it's also dangerous: what if, just hypothetically, an *actual literal Nazi* tries to get into power in some country somewhere in the world. They act *exactly* like the Nazis did in the 1920s, exactly like the Nazis did in the 1930s, ...According to you, despite this hypothetical literal Nazi saying the exact same things as the Nazis for 2 straight decades, imposing the exact same racial purity laws as the Nazis once in power, we still can't compare him to the Nazis because \\"well he hasn't genocided Jews yet\\".   Don't you see how stupid this is? If we extend this argument further then we can never warn people before a genocide happens. After all, if they haven't genocided anyone, how can we accuse them of wanting genocide?   Usually we should strive to learn from history. What you're saying is that we can't ever compare anything to history unless it's **literally exactly the same**. That's dumb","title":"CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest"},{"text":"In the recent VP debate Vance described not invading neighbors but deporting people (immigrant or not but political opponents) and rehoming people in those houses.

This very similar to the Kristallnacht or the Night of Broken Glass in 1938. These were a precursor / prewar actions that set the stage for their future atrocities.

He believes Ukraine to be essentially an illegitimate nation that should rightfully be part of Russia, thereby extinguishing its unique culture. Heres a [link](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-kremlins-occupation-playbook-coerced-russification-and-ethnic-cleansing) that describes it a little bit better and (in my opinion) fairly objectively. Also, regarding ability, Russia has captured Ukrainian cities in the Donetsk Oblast region over the course of the recent war, but more importantly they have reduced many dozens more to rubble. Plus, again, Putin doesnt actually care about capturing the land of Ukraine itself, but rather reducing its population and crippling the nation until it is forced to rejoin the Russian empire. I dont know if you care to hear it from the Ukrainians, but 89% of them believe they are being genocided and about half would describe Russia as either fascist or Nazi-like.

What we shouldn't have done with hitler is have a lot of conversations - like we actually did - that led to equivocation on the need for intervention into that evil.

In 2022 the youth turnout nationwide was about 23%, not great not terrible, but Michigan was at 37%. That is great for a midterm election. And during that election Whitmer won by over 10 points, the Democrats retook both Chambers of the legislature and the abortion amendment passed. If Harris can get about 50% young voter turnout nationwide, and win it with 63% vote as polls done among young voters suggest, she'll win pretty easily (easily being relative here).","title":"Its not won: Democrats jittery over razor-thin race in Michigan"},{"text":"I think he's on his 76th album!","title":"Country-western icon Willie Nelson, 91 years old, endorsed Kamala Harris for President."},{"text":"Amen. mn. mn.

I'm still not psyched about it.For one, the EC margin is still way too tight. I think with this map the final count for Harris would be 275-263. Which sends a signal to the GOP that they just need to put a bit more juice into another weak blue wall state like MN, ME, or NH. Also, while AZ and NC are somewhat stable due to having Dem SOSs. GA is currently having a real one with open election deniers on it's county certification boards, which makes things significantly more tenuous.Basically, I would be somewhat more in favor of a sunbelt strategy if TX was thrown into the mix as well. As TX, along with GA, NC, and AZ would be more than enough to make up for a red Rust Belt.","title":"And the Dems will stop promoting protectionism inshallah"},{"text":"Yeah, but how can you clickbait with a headline like that?","title":"Its not won: Democrats jittery over razor-thin race in Michigan"},{"text":"This is such a retrograde take.
