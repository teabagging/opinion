This fact is not dependent on whether anyone is able to determine it. As mammals, we were all either male or female before we evolved the ability to communicate via spoken language. Asking who or what determines our sex is irrelevant to our having a sex. And sex is binary, male/female. There is no third sex. Sex determination, in rare cases, is indeed complicated. But once again, this is separate from the reality of our sex. We are all male or female, and as mammals our sex is immutable. Embryos are also not all female till the seventh week either. Im afraid that is a fairly popular bit of pseudoscience, based on early research that (in a rather sexist manner) concluded that absence of male features equals female. Genetic sex is determined at fertilisation. Embryos are undifferentiated until around the seventh week, at which point differentiation will occur, triggered by the SRY gene which is usually found on the short arm of the Y chromosome. But this gene is sometimes missing, and occasionally found on the X chromosome, which is a key factor in some DSDs. DSDs can be complicated (though even with most DSDs sex determination is fairly straightforward) but they are not mystical or a magical third sex. We can look at the developmental pathway from an embryo and understand what has happened. Each will be either a case of atypical male or atypical female development. This does not change their sex. A man with Klinefelters is every bit as much a man as one without. Indeed, suggesting they are not a real man, or are a third sex, can be quite offensive. Which DSD in particular are you thinking of when you say sex isnt binary? Its better to look at actual specific conditions, rather than an umbrella term covering a range of conditions in which for most sex determination is still straightforward.","title":"Trump administration to acknowledge only a persons gender assigned at birth, officials say"},{"text":"Republicans need to pick themselves up by the bootstraps and start paying thousands for their insulin","title":"Any republicans on insulin?"},{"text":"When the fentanyl scrambles your already miniscule fucking brain matter: \\"yeah, nah.

Smart Elections and other groups eventually figured out that someone installed code on a certain brand of tabulators to start shifting votes once a given tabulator has counted 400 or more votes. This behavior is crucial to avoid being caught by small recounts. Notice that all of the swing states were won with just enough votes to avoid full hand recounts... and Kamala didn't request any for some fucking reason.Notably, these patterns in the voting data were also present in 2020 data, but less stark, and starting at 600 votes minimum.That is why Trump is so angry about 2020, and why he is convinced the dems cheated. He is angry because the country hated him so fucking much that they actually out voted a literal vote shifting algorithm.Smart Elections put this analysis out there last week, and then this week Trump says Elon knows those vote counting computers. Aka... the tabulators.Trump just happened to brag about the exact thing they landed on as the method of hacking. That's why we know he admitted it. He's a moron, and would not even have that phrase or concept in his head if it wasn't the plan someone enacted for him.This is why he was saying he doesn't need your votes.

Asked at a Univision town hall about the riot by his supporters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, he said, There were no guns down there. We didnt have guns.For starters, the statement was false; according to the Justice Department, at least 180 people have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon, including guns, knives, batons, baseball bats and chemical sprays. But its the pronoun  we  that gives Mr. Trumps game away. By pardoning the rioters, he was, in every real sense, pardoning himself.The president repeatedly promised during the campaign that he would pardon what he called the J6 hostages, but he was vague about the details. It has become clear that Mr. Trump decided to go big. He pardoned a vast majority of the 1,600 who were arrested, including those who assaulted police officers. (About 140 police officers were injured during the riot.) Further, Mr. Trump ordered all pending cases, including those for defendants charged with violent crimes, to be dismissed.In simple terms, this means that in a few days, there will be no one in prison or facing any sort of criminal penalty for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Some, including Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys who was pardoned after being sentenced to 22 years for seditious conspiracy, have already been released from their sentences.The cases against them now disappear, as if they had never been brought, and the consequences of those convictions vanish as well. Former convicts, including those who assaulted police officers, will now have no restrictions on their right to purchase firearms; they will be free to bring guns to their next confrontation with authorities.The pardon recipients now join Mr. Trump himself as former Jan. 6 defendants who are in the clear for their actions on that day.

Support good journalists like ProPublica. Pick a group that is defending journalists like ALCU and support them. * Send letters to our members of Congress to encourage them to stand up. Write letters and postcards to members of Congress. Don't be hateful. Tell them that you want to defend democracy, insist on checks &amp; balances, and protect an independent judiciary. Recognize them when they do well. Focus on writing to members of the Senate, especially the Republicans in the Senate, to say that we care about the power of the Senate, we care about the Constitution, we care that you don't hand over our democracy to authoritarianism. We want a gov. that follows the laws &amp; rules &amp; ethical standards, not just blindly loyal to Trump. We want good governance to benefit the country. Stand up for democracy. Pressure Congress to do what is right. The way to stop Trump is to stand up to him. * Build coalitions. It is easy to feel isolated and demoralized. Join something. Anything: a book club, a knitting group, a hiking group. Build your tribe. We need to join local groups to build community and organize at the local and state level. We will rebuild democracy from the ground up, not from the top down.* Pick your issue. Pick one or two issues that you feel strongly about and find a national organization working on that issue. Join in their letter writing campaigns or donating or making phone calls. These groups have experienced lawyers and understand the issue in depth. It might be the ACLU or the Human Rights Campaign Foundation working on LGBTQ issues or climate change issues with the Union of Concerned Scientists or Democracy Docket fighting to protect voting rights. Lean into their expertise and know there is strength in numbers. * These moments of crisis are often our biggest moments of opportunity as more people wake up and push back and demand better. We have a lot of work to do. It's our job to draw a clear contrast between Trump's vision of America and our vision of America. However, we cannot just talk about what we are against. We must point out what we are fighting for, and explain how it will affect them in their everyday lives. We can build a huge movement that believes in democracy and believes in a fair economy and create something better for the for the long term.* Historian Timothy Snyder warns of the danger of giving over power in advance, out of fear. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NkBvMo9S4BE?feature=share Don't obey in advance. \\n* Authoritarians cannot take over when people are happy and connected to their community. Have a life. Be surrounded by people that you love. Plan your garden for next year. Bake cookies. Read a book. *Be happy.** Be involved at the local and state level. Show up at school board and city councils. Work on issues people care about like roads and schools regardless of partisan background. Protest at the state. Meet your state legislators. This is where we will rebuild democracy. * Every day do one thing that is outward facing: write postcards to your members of Congress. Check in and say you care about these issues. Make your voices known. Flood social media with good information to break into information bubbles feeding people lies. Check in with your friend who is feeling low and needs support. Go to a school board meeting. Follow good journalists who haven't bent to Trump's pressure. Do one thing every day. * If you read something outrageous, look it up on Politifact before you share it.  * Fear is contagious, but courage is also contagious: stand up, speak your mind, refuse to be cowed. Speak up at every level. That is what will turn the tide of our government.We can create a society based in reality. We can come up with answers. We just have to figure out how to get on the same page. We can rebuild American democracy and create an economy that works for everyone, not just the billionaires.","title":"How do we fight this?"},{"text":"Oil companies will not eat into their own margins for your fantasies.","title":"Canada will respond robustly if Trump imposes unfair tariffs, says PM Trudeau | CNN"},{"text":"Sorry we tried.

Serious criminal illegals should be deported without question, and even low level illegal criminals could be deported if involving physical harm to others or property damage. Also, unless we have cheap labor from somewhere , I expect food prices to increase , construction prices to increase, resteraunt prices to increase, among some cost of living price increases for us ctitzens.","title":"Bishop rebukes Trump at service, asks him to have mercy on LGBT people, illegal immigrants"},{"text":" The vibe was very much librarian mixed with FDR.ah.so naturally, the right hated it.","title":"Trump administration directs all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on leave by 5.p.m tomorrow"},{"text":"Yes!

(And also Jim Mattis, John Kelly, and Rex Tillerson.)Over the course of his administration, Trump discovered that this faction might superficially support him, but was fundamentally opposed to him. So he engaged in a power struggle with them for control of the party.Trump ultimately triumphed, but the energy required for this fight precluded him from doing much governing. There simply wasnt time to both purge the GOP and pass legislation.Also, Trump discovered that there were two other spheres in which structures prevented a president from acting as emperor.The first was the federal government, in which conscientious political appointees could thwart his will and civil service bureaucrats held their own power. The second was the broader culture, in which business leaders, internet platforms, and media organizations held some sway over public opinion.But he didnt have time to wage war on these fronts, either. I dont think theres any way to read yesterday except as President Trump deciding that with the Republican party fully subservient to him, he can subjugate the other remaining power centers in American life.He can finally be a wartime president. Its just that hes going to war against America.?

We have planes now, it is too easy to get to the US. Therefore too many people can become citizens in this way and that was not what was intended.Also, Im guessing immigration was historically more likely to be seen as a net positive in a society mostly driven by expanding land ownership and taxes, agricultural work, and physical labor. The new world, almost the entire Western hemisphere that is, has birth by soil. The rest of the globe is mostly birth by blood, and my guess is that it is that way because they had already been around for hundreds or thousands of years. So the originalists may argue that birthright citizenship wasnt meant to persist into our current reality where the needs that concerned us historically no longer exist today.Just some of my guesses for what excuses the courts come up with when the Republicans eventually try to retroactively rescind citizenship from those born to immigrant parents and they will try to do so with their stacked Supreme Court and extremist agenda if they start seeing some success with their other easier objectives.Oh, and Trump will target non-whites only, because itll be the federal government taking action.

For example, the SEC has determined [Elon Musk ripped off Twitter investors for $150 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/technology/sec-elon-musk-securities-violations.html).SEC Chair Gary Gensler has revealed Musk's wrongdoing and securities violations in conjunction with the Twitter acquisition. The SEC case is strong and has well-documented Musk's failure to make legally required disclosures.The SEC filing states that in buying Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk violated securities laws by amassing a large stock position in the social media company without filing the proper notification. The complaint said Musk waited 11 days before filing the required disclosure with the S.E.C.The regulatory filings are required so investors in the marketplace can monitor the moves of large investors and potential takeover bids. Because Mr. Musk did not disclose his position, he was able to continue buying Twitter stock at an artificially low price, the SEC said in its lawsuit.The move allowed him \\\\[Elon Musk\\\\] to underpay by at least $150 million for the additional shares before he belatedly disclosed his stake, the lawsuit continued.Musk's failure to comply with SEC disclosure law also harmed investors who would have been able to sell their shares at higher prices had Musks involvement been publicly known, the agency said. Former Twitter shareholders have also sued Mr. Musk, accusing him of fraud in a case related to his belated disclosure of his stake in Twitter.Martha Stewart was put in prison on obstruction of justice charges in conjunction with alleged securities violations.

(One advantage of the Borda count is that unlike IRV, you don't have to iterate through remaining candidates multiple times to find a winner, assuming no ties.) More accurately, ranked choice voting refers to only the input of an electorate's ballots. It refers to how voters mark their preferred candidates on their ballot, by marking them numerically with equal gap between rankings (as opposed to marking exactly one to count as a valid non-abstention ballot as in FPTP, or numerically marking candidates with free gap between rankings as in cardinal voting). It does not refer to the output of the electorate's ballots, i.e. how to arrive at the optimal candidate(s) based on a given set of ballots.","title":"Cmv: that USA should adopt preferential voting"},{"text":"No one sold child porn on Silk Road.Jesus I didn't think reddit was this out of touch with its roots.","title":"Trump Pardons Ross Ulbricht, Creator of Silk Road Drug Marketplace"},{"text":"Those people are very terminally online and have political brain rot","title":"CMV: Apolitical does not mean conservative"},{"text":"Well-stated.

It grants the President the authority to detain, relocate, or deport non-citizens (aliens) from a country that is considered an enemy during times of war or conflict. Here are the key points:Key Provisions:\\n\\t1.\\tScope:\\n\\t?\\tThe act applies to non-citizens who are nationals of a country with which the U.S. is at war or engaged in armed conflict.\\n\\t?\\tIt allows for the regulation, restraint, and removal of these individuals if they are deemed a threat to national security.\\n\\t2.\\tPresidential Authority:\\n\\t?\\tThe President can issue orders regarding the treatment of such aliens without needing prior approval from Congress.\\n\\t?\\tThis includes arresting, detaining, or deporting aliens from enemy countries.\\n\\t3.\\tDue Process:\\n\\t?\\tWhile the act grants significant power, individuals affected by it are often entitled to some form of due process, although the exact nature of these rights can vary depending on the circumstances and legal interpretations.\\n\\t4.\\tHistorical Use:\\n\\t?\\tThe Alien Enemies Act has been invoked during several conflicts, including World War I and World War II, where individuals from enemy nations were subject to detention and deportation.\\n\\t?\\tIt is still part of U.S. law today and could theoretically be used in future conflicts.Significance:\\n\\t?\\tThe act is controversial due to its broad grant of power to the executive branch, particularly in terms of civil liberties and the potential for abuse.\\n\\t?\\tIt highlights the tension between national security and individual rights, especially during times of war.In summary, the Alien Enemies Act gives the U.S. President the power to take action against nationals of enemy countries during wartime (Determined Mexico)","title":"Welcome Back to Trumps America: A Nation Restored"},{"text":"Im willing to bet Silk Road reduced violent crime in the drug trade by a lot","title":"Trump Pardons Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht"},{"text":" The US isn't some sort of special pillar that is a condition sine qua non for the existence of the liberal democratic world orderConsidering the failures of the League of Nations/interwar period and [the Jungle [that] Grows Back](https://www.brookings.edu/books/the-jungle-grows-back-america-and-our-imperiled-world/) every time America shirks its duties, no - America is essential to the liberal democratic project until proven otherwise.

Specifically it is about half-brothers, Ishmael and Isaac, sons of Abraham but two different mothers.   The first-born, Ishmael was via a slave woman, Hagar, and the second, Isaac's mother was Sarah, Abraham's wife.   Muslims align with Ishmael's right to the Holy Land because he was first-born, and Christians/Jews align with Isaac's right to inherit the Holy Land because he was born in wedlock.    In the end, Ishmael had a step mother problem.    \\nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/Ishmael-in-the-Bible.html\\nIn Genesis 21, Sarahs son, Isaac, is born, and once again problems arise. Sarah sees Ishmael mocking the young Isaac, and she demands action from Abraham: Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that womans son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac (verse 10).Well, after World War II, the U.S. (Truman) and Christian Europe decided Issac inherits the Holy Land, dispossessing the Muslims of their property (stealing their property).  The U.S. has been flushing billions of dollars down the toilet on the Middle East ever since on this crusade to cleanse the Holy Land of the non-believers (Muslims).","title":"Trumps UN ambassador pick says Israel has biblical right to West Bank"},{"text":"Is it you can commit crimes for me to keep me in power?","title":"Trumps Pardons Are Sending a Crystal-Clear Message"},{"text":"Unless the war is _with_ Mexico","title":"Trumps Military Is a Disaster Waiting to Happen"},{"text":"Debbie Wassermann Schwartz and the Clinton with the dnc made sure he wasnt nominated.","title":"I attended Trumps inauguration yesterday.

Over half of our imported oil currently comes from Canada. Most of our available oil isn't in areas where there is already wells so its not a matter of \\"pump more\\" its more of a matter of drilling and setting up wells which takes years. Trump is far more likely himself to ignore the energy price concerns related to tariffs on Canada (this is the same guy who corrected NOAA hurricane paths with a sharpie with info directly from his asshole). But I do agree his plan is probably to *try* and ramp the economy up but given his previous term (same goal as well then) more likely than not he will actually do the opposite and then shift to random culture war issues for the rest of his term and blame biden for the economy. He's addicted to griffting because its the only form of business he understands (he really doesn't seem to understand how basic things like tariffs actually work and he surrounds himself with yes men that tell him he's a genius), he will enable corruption like never before and just shrug his shoulders when it doesn't make everyone wealthy because it worked for him, golden bootstraps for a snakeoil salesman and when that doesn't work he will just blame democrats and his base will love it. In terms of hydrocarbon production I think most people in that industry are looking at Guyana as the newer kid on the block as its oil fields are only recently discovered. For reference Canada is ranked number 3 for oil between saudi arabia and Iran with Venezuela as #1 so ignoring Canadian oil when we are already setup to run their oil sands delivered via a pipeline is hard to ignore.","title":"Canada will respond robustly if Trump imposes unfair tariffs, says PM Trudeau | CNN"},{"text":"He owes me 2.25 btc.

It was created to be a decentralized digital cash system to be used as an alternative to fiat currencies. Its truly genius. Whether you agree or not, I think the *potential* power BTC could have is significant enough to be an existential threat to the USD as global reserve currency. \\n- On bitcointalk forums, it was stated by a member (Gavin Andresen) that they would present BTC to a USA 3-letter agency. Found source: https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=6652.0\\n- In that presentation, that agency must have learned of the potential power BTC could have and how disruptive it could be to the USD.\\n- They needed a way to stop it. Maybe they tried to overtake the network, But it was too late. BTC was most likely decentralized enough to withstand any potential 51% attacks that could compromise the network. So then what does the agency do? Well, if you cant beat it, you join it. \\n- This is where the Silk Road theory begins: \\n- Silk Road was created by a USA 3-letter agency to\\nto amass BTC covertly by the USA. There are many layers to this and you may disagree; but I would simply say that they know how valuable BTC truly can be versus a fiat currency like the USD. They cant let the public believe that BTC is a good thing for the world, because it would undermine the dollar. \\n- As a bonus, the agency also used Silk Road as a tool to track down certain criminals via dark web and tracking BTC transactions. \\n- Ross was hired to act as the face of silk road.\\n- Once enough BTC had been acquired by Ross, and once they were able to track down certain criminals on the dark web, they had to end the operation publicly to set the narrative. They had to imprison Ross, seize the BTC and then create a narrative of how BTC is bad and is mostly only used for illegal operations. Make everyone stay away from BTC for as long as possible. \\n- with silk road. The USA successfully acquired its BTC reserve without alerting the masses, and was most likely able to imprison some dark web criminals along the way. \\n- Over the last 10+ years, as the narrative of BTC slowly develops into something that the majority of folks begin to accept and understand; they now needed a polarizing/controversial president in position to start making controversial actions, like pardoning their undercover Ross and pushing for a BTC reserve. \\n- This sets up the USA to maintain global economic power if the world slowly transitions away from USD as world reserve currency. \\n- With the growing debt crisis, its inevitable for fiat currencies to eventually fail due to debasement caused by money-printing. The mass majority sees it and feels it in the inflation of all assets, goods, and services. \\n- BTC isnt meant to *replace* the USD, but it was acquired by the USA because if all other countries acquired it first and begin to transact with it instead of the USD, the global economic power that the USA once had shifts away from the USA, and into the hands of those with BTC.","title":"Trump Pardons Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht"},{"text":"Who said anything about hanging a gun in my truck?Thats for TV.

Getting to the final form of AI is still by all accounts a long long way off.2. This one probably completely negates point 1, and is why I'm worried. Last year, there was a sudden comotion surrounding openai and people were theorizing that they'd cracked the next level of AI. Stepping from current available tech which is termed Narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would be the modern equivalent of going from the recording info with a chisel to the processing power of a super computer. The thing is that this big comotion happens, like a month or two of people speculating and going wild, and then instant, deafening radio silence. Which makes me think that they were told to stay mum about it. Towards the end of the while big scene open ai did an announcement but researching it a bit that announcement was clearly planned long in advance and was nothing groundbreaking, meanwhile there were multiple high level management shakeups within the company that further lead to speculation that agi had been cracked and that there was an internal power struggle as to what to do now that they had it. Idk but I suspect that the head of open ai wanted to sell it to the government or military, and that his subordinates were not happy about it. But who knows.","title":"Project Stargate - The AI Final Evolution?"},{"text":"From Hollywood Reporter:Early figures from Nielsen show Trumps swearing in as the 47th president of the United States averaged 26.05 million viewers from 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m. ET Monday on broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC and the three largest cable news channels (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC). That looks to be down a good amount from each of the previous two inauguration ceremonies, though the comparisons arent exact.So the Second Inauguration of Donald Trump drew:- about 12.29 million less pairs of eyeballs than his first (38.35 million)\\n- *way* less than Joe's (39.87 million)\\n- we have to wait for the numbers for the CFP title game, but it will beat the inauguration rally, I guarantee itDonnie ain't too happy about that.

Basically these types of therapies are ridiculously expensive and have varying result so they would track everyone and manufacturers would either rebate back costs / provide free treatments if outcomes werent improving as expected.

Some drugs are FDA approved through an accelerated approval process. The manufacturers will advertise as quickly as possible and often times confirmatory trials are delayed (the trial that proves if it actually works well or not).

This was the last big thing they didn't have aside from Reddit, and they're trying here, too. It's just like price fixing, isn't it? Like Kroger buying up all the grocery stores so they set the prices? Except with speech and personal data instead of groceries. They have control over our speech and over what we hear. They can make it so that no one social media is any more private than another and they all have the same data permissions and there is no opting out.

The problem is that they aren't perfect and there are factors beyond just intelligence which can influence a student's SAT score.Nobody anywhere is saying \\"if you grew up black that can matter more than your SAT score\\" so you can just take that strawman right back. However, there are schools which have recognized that students from a lower income will have slightly lower SAT scores regardless of their intelligence. Something as simple as having the time (not needing an after school job) and money (for a tutor) to do SAT prep can result in higher scores. The fact that some students can prepare for the test itself makes it an imperfect measure of intelligence.Is someone who gets a 1350 after spending months learning how exactly to outsmart SAT questions more intelligent than someone who gets a 1270 based solely on their innate ability?You also have to consider more broadly what factors go into making the best college student. When you have schools looking for \\"well rounded\\" students and factoring in after school clubs and high school sports into their applicant score, that's disadvantaging those high school students who didn't have the opportunity to join after school activities because they were working to help provide for their family.

(Not minimizing any other DEIA initiatives, but people just don't seem to realize that these practices make things better for all of us.)Ive spent years of my career focusing on creating accessible training content, and its incredibly disheartening to see a lack of understanding about why accessibility is so vital. Accessibility isnt just about accommodating permanent disabilitiesit benefits everyone.Imagine your company assigns you a new online training module to complete. Now consider these scenarios:Youve broken your arm and temporarily cant use a mouse to click and drag during an interactive exercise. Accessibility standards ensure there are alternative ways to navigate, like keyboard controls or voice commands.You suffer from migraines that make you sensitive to light. Accessibility guidelines promote proper color contrast and avoid fast-moving, repetitive visuals to minimize triggers.Youre a traveling salesperson trying to complete the training at an airport with poor WiFi. Accessibility standards, like using alternative text for images, ensure you still get the necessary information even if the visuals dont load.\\nAccessibility isnt a niche concernits about inclusivity and practicality. By designing for a wide range of needs, we create better experiences for everyone, not just those with permanent disabilities.PS: Also, in large companies it's just so much more efficient to organize similar efforts in a coherent group with guidelines and standards and best practices.\\nI.e. a goddamn DEIA department.\\nIt's like the accounting department, Jan, but cooler.

Nazi Germany 1933 and America 2025 are sort of very different animals. In the American form of this, the most important of Trumps acts to watch is the birthright citizenship issue. It matters above all else because it's enshrined in the constitution. If a constitutional amendment can be cast aside with an executive order (the only legal way to repeal one is a tough hurdle), then every president to include him can throw away what truly makes us \\"free.' Right to free speech, religion, self incrimination, speedy trial, jury trials, slavery can become legal... the list goes on. But in the case of the Germany, it looked something like this. 1.) Jan 1933 - Hitler is appointed as Chancellor by then German President Paul Von Hindenburg. \\n2.) Reichstag (their congress so to speak) fire destroys the building and Hitler receives dictatorial powers (sort of) through The Enabling Act.\\n3.) The 1934 death of Paul Von Hindenburg allows Hiltler to combine the legal powers of Chancellor and President and he legally becomes in title The Fuhrer (The Leader). The German military agreed to support this amalgamation. \\n4.) The events between 1934 and 1939 are a consolidation of power at the state and local levels  through cooption and violence. The Germans vote in essence in 1935 to legally cement Hitlers ascension as I stated in 3.There are some key points which must be included in understanding Nazi Germany and why things sort of unfolded the way they did. \\n1.) Hitler couldn't have held power (not so much so gotten it, but held it) without the German Army's backing. The army in turn backed him for 3 reasons, a. expansion (they had been limited to 100K men by the treaty of Versailles) b. they were under threat of being replaced by the Nazi party militia which outnumbered them by 40 to 1. c. they wanted vengeance for their defeat in WWI. \\n2.) The German conservatives who traditionally held power in the country subscribed to much of what the army above did AND saw in him the protector of their traditional economic rights.","title":"Donald Trump will need a police state to implement his agenda.

Populism my ass.These billionaires, corporate cronies, ultra wealthy advocates, big tech and finance \\"bros,\\" and rich media moguls who have the backing of special interests, right wing \\"think tanks\\" and dark money groups, have been meeting with Trump in private to bend the knee, assuring him that they will be in lockstep with his next administration.This kind of favoritism, rampant cronyism, legacy based staffing, nepotism,  \\"jobs for the boys\\" mindset, and power to appoint based on anything but actual merit and genuine qualifications for the position at hand, all of these things are precisely why Americans have questioned inequitable hiring practices in the first place. It's almost cruelly ironic.While none of this takes into account the Trump/MAGA agenda that's already underway, and as outlined by Project 2025, to enact a \\"federal hiring plan\\" through executive orders, unitary executive privileges, broad immunities for the president, and efforts from Republicans to consolidate power...An agenda that we know is setting out to erode the independence of most government agencies, strip civil servants of their protections, and then install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for nonpartisan, knowledgeable staff whose job security didn't previously depend on their level of allegiance to the president and the party agenda.\\"DEI\\" is just another Boogeyman, another scapegoat that Republicans have been using to distract their mindless voters from the actual inequities they're perpetuating. Instead, they're effectively keeping these fanatics fixated on their culture wars and all of this DEI bullshit, effortlessly convincing them that it's some widespread \\"problem\\" because the whole thing appeals to their base prejudices. It's textbook. It's actually gotten to the point where these fools believe that every liberal person of color in a position of power, especially a position that has the authority to hold Trump accountable, is some unqualified, \\"DEI\\" hire.

It can even lead to a situation where someone who would have been the first choice of a voter ends up getting bumped down because they started slinging mud and there's less fear of tactical voting forcing people into one camp or another.There are definitely risks, make no mistake.  But I genuinely feel that the change in incentive structure would change both the rhetoric and policies of the candidates in a way which would lead to more willingness to actually try to win people over to their ideals instead of leaning hard on the \\"The other guy will piss on the moon and fuck your wife,\\" which is just current politics.","title":"Cmv: that USA should adopt preferential voting"},{"text":"Senator Warren is one off the top of my head.","title":"Trump Signs Executive Order to Withdraw from World Health Organization"},{"text":"As a woman, whenever I see their weird images of him as a tough guy with muscles etc. I just fucking laugh so hard.

Names can be a strong signal ofracial minority status and a basis for discrimination (Bertrand and Mullainathan,2004; Oreopoulos, 2011).

Like how you threw grad school in there and used the word creed, etc. Very common terms from people in here acting and arguing so confidently about something they don't actually know. Intellectual curiosity should push a person out of their comfort zone to broaden their understanding of any subject, especially one they feel they 'get.' And you say you're willing to change your mind, but then dismiss that any other complicated interpretative framework on this matter exists, and attribute my explanation to flippant sources and unsubstantiated, unaccepted sources. Or something like the most obvious example of a failed and biased piece of scholarship published in a prominent journal in the '80s that anyone in the wider public has a vague idea exists, because of how often it is mentioned in popular media.You should understand that 'science,' like most things, involves the interpretations by humans, including faulty ones, and bias also permeates it because all humans have bias. Most topics are open to reinterpretation if more or new evidence is found, which includes the observations by people not part of a field's hegemony. Only math is as close to providing the black and white certainty you are implying here with science, even with the scientific method around. But no decent scientist is gonna promise something with absolute certainty involving anything beyond the most basic conclusions, like that 2 + 2 = 4, and even then a mathematician might ask for more clarification on what type of numbers are being used in the question.You're not the first guy telling me you'd be swayed by other academic proof on the subject, which, btw, has been discussed in Western scholarship for the past 100 years at least, but put the onus on someone else to change your mind. I guess I'm going to have to make a list of prominent sources on it for the next guy who doesn't do their homework and argues that this 'the world is as I see it,' I believe in SCIENCE, colonial-type bounded categorization on a complex topic is correct.But I resent this laziness and anyone who thinks that what they learned in high school and popular media are 'proven facts' that remain stagnant. The media and basic education system boil down complex ideas to something that barely resembles what the scholarship discusses because that is easier for most people to understand. And especially in the media, whatever it becomes is just fodder for partisan interests.In conclusion: you're wrong. Go look up the course outlines at good uni programs of some introductory courses in various social science and humanities fields at least, that discuss gender and sex. Look at their sources and get a few of them from different, prominent scholars that you can and read up.","title":"TRUMP: It will be the officially policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."},{"text":"More context:?\\n* [The order, titled \\"RESTORING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ENDING FEDERAL CENSORSHIP\\".](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/)\\n* [AP article, \\"Trump orders government not to infringe on Americans speech, calls for censorship investigation\\".](https://apnews.com/article/trump-executive-order-censorship-misinformation-social-media-b344d8c75463990ff6e782bc836bb337)* [NPR article on government media influence / censorship and the Supreme Court case](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/18/1238122337/supreme-court-social-media-disinformation-first-amendment) In 2024, its clear that the disinformation networks established or expanded during the pandemic are deeply connected to far-right, neo-Nazi, and accelerationist networks and actors C both domestic and foreign.

I have a totally unsubstantiated theory that some parents are quite jealous of their children and do not want them to have better lives, so they unconsciously self-sabotage their children. They are likely not even aware they are doing it. For these folks, it gets scary when their kids starts using vocabulary words they dont understand. They make it seem like education is useless because they are afraid their child will think they are dumb (when they are just uneducated and cannot accept it and try to be better). This is the larger issue thats happening. I see so many kids with potential who become so lost because of the adults in their life. I feel\\nLike 6th/7th grade is a huge turning point for this, which is extremely upsetting. Most of us have enormous potential but are told its worthless to be smart or want to simply be smarter. I always tell kids its more important to be better than the day before than be the best. Thats really all that matters; be better today than yesterday. That doesnt always happen. And thats okay, too.

I dont think we have ever achieved perfection.  We were certainly headed in the right direction before DEI though.I am trying to have a merit based system.   People of color for example are less likely to be considered even if their merit is exactly equal to that of a white man.Source?The problem is that the source is often disparity in outcome.  But when you have a disparity in qualified candidates if a society is perfectly color blind that means you SHOULD have a disparate oucome.A disproportionate amount of blacks for instance grow up in cities with shitty school.  Also a disproportionate amount grow up in single parent households which has long been one of the most reliable predictors of success.  Thus, if we lived in a colorblind, or racism free society we should expect less blacks to be admitted to universities of high quality.  Less blacks in high paying and jobs of power.The way to fix it is to create more qualified blacks.  Look at the average SAT scores of admittance into Ivy League schools by race.  Blacks are the lowest, once again.  They need to lower the bar significantly just to get a meaningful amount into schools for the sake of diversity.  Then many struggle because they are now competing against kids who score much higher and are much more prepared going into school than they were.They keep trying to band aid fix the problem by letting them into schools despite being less qualified under the justification of DEI.  But it doesnt fix the problem.  Its just pointless racism, which in the end causes people to not even try to fix the real problem which is making blacks actually qualified to enter these universities on merit in the first place.","title":"DEI: Donald Trump administration directs all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on leave"},{"text":"The Red Hats","title":"The Trump Pardons That Will Haunt America"},{"text":"Yeah that's the intelligent part of that artificial.

Bottom Line Up Front - The Executive Order doesn't explicitly fire anyone. But the positions the employees are in are being cut.In 2021, Biden ordered the federal agencies to to revise agency policies to account for racial inequities in their implementation. (EO 13985). In response, federal agencies created specific positions dedicated to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (\\"DEI\\"), but the scope varies. Some roles focus on HR and EEO compliance (like ensuring fair hiring practices or handling discrimination complaints), while others work on broader initiatives (workforce diversity, accessibility programs, or employee resource groups). These DEI-related positions are being cut; but Trump's EO does not directly terminate the employees from the federal government. Career federal employees in DEI roles will likely be reassigned to other positions within their agencies rather than immediately fired. Political appointees could be removed more easily, but that's unclear right now. Contractors in DEI positions will probably lose their contract outright or will not have them renewed.Edit: This blew up overnight!

The idea is not that being apolitical somehow makes you a conservative. The idea is that by remaining silent, you tacitly endorse the most outrageous policies. Pretend there is a group of 10 people, 3 of whom argue for a racist policy, while 2 argue against it. The other 5 stay silent because they dont want to argue. After all is said and done the 3 racists win the argument and a new policy is implemented that discriminates against some particular group. The 5 people that decided to remain quiet may claim they didnt advocate for the racist policy, but the fact remains that policy was implemented in part because of their silence. In the current political climate conservatives are more often arguing on behalf of discriminatory policies, but the underlying belief you are discussing is not really silence=pro conservative. The idea is quite simply that your silence/ apolitical beliefs essentially equate to saying I think both sides are the same. There are areas where thats a reasonable stance. But if one side is advocating for the return of Jim Crow and the other side is saying that is a bad idea, then saying you dont want to take a side is pretty understandably going to get you accused being a fan of the Klan. In short, pick a side or dont, but if you dont, you had better be informed and truly okay with either outcome, because whichever side loses is correctly going to place atleast part of the blame on those that remained silent because they didnt think the issue was important.","title":"CMV: Apolitical does not mean conservative"},{"text":"I think the ones who haven't fully filed for citizenship or left the country who would be considered undocumented are here because conditions where they're at are much worse.

The fact that Miley contacted a potential US enemy (China) and told them if Trump ordered an attack he would give them warning completely destroys the idea of civilian control of the military and IMO is treason!  If Trump had issued such an order Miley could refuse to carry it out and claim it was unlawful.  Let the courts decide if it was or not.   Of course the reason Trump ordered such an attack is unknown since it was never given. The military is the only organization that can successfully carry out a coup and why they must always remain under civilian control.

It would be hard to trust a new voting system with all the current distrust of the government and political parties. Especially since most Ranked Choice voting systems have more complicated behind the scenes math that people won't understand. I suppose we could all warm up to them by starting small with local ranked choice elections, using those representatives to push that legislation up the chain. The more smaller reps we vote in with ranked choice, theoretically the more reps we will have that ACTUALLY represent us and can help push it up to bigger elections.I think we are actually capable of this change, but we have to accept that it would be slow and we have to abandon the team mentality we have.","title":"Cmv: that USA should adopt preferential voting"},{"text":"Perhaps he could be baseless at knee level...","title":"Fauci Speaks Out After Biden Issues Preemptive Pardon Over COVID-19 Misconduct Allegations  'Trump's Baseless Accusations'"},{"text":"Remember, they did said they wouldnt separate families by having them deported together, this was the first step by deporting U.S citizens, this might be the next (lol)","title":"GOP member wants bishop added to deportation list after Trump prayer service"},{"text":"It helps with drug overdose because the products are much more pure","title":"Trump pardons Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road drug marketplace"},{"text":"I am a centrist who is economically a syndicalist or socialist but when it comes to social politics I'm more like a libertarian Christian.

It's a type of manufactured consent that conservatism feeds on.That all might sound like a moral judgement, but it's not. It's just the logical outcome of trying to function \\"independently\\" from politics. You're whole life is governed by politics in one way or another, and you'll have an opinion on politics at some point, even if you don't realize it. It's important to pay attention to where those opinions might lead you.People think of politics as pure team sports, but it goes much deeper than that. It's an application of your own ethics/values to the policies that govern your life. It's something people ought to put more consideration into.","title":"CMV: Apolitical does not mean conservative"},{"text":"\\"We want cheaper prices!\\"....\\"We want more American manufacturing!\\"Do you want cheaper prices or domestic production?You need to pick one because you can't have both.A shirt produced in Indonesia (where labor costs are 10 times lower) will always be cheaper than a shirt produced in the US.It's literally econ 101 guys.","title":"Discussion Thread: Cabinet Confirmation Hearings and Other Events on January 21st, 2025"},{"text":"Good, im done pretending to care about them.","title":"In Trumps America, the Oligarchy Is Done Pretending to Care About You"},{"text":"Pretty ballsy remaining quiet for 2 years and then attacking the man that would seek litigation after hes been pardoned.

In each cycle this exacerbates the extremes. This is why is most other modern democracies have things like ranked choice, or multi-party. To avoid the exact environment we are currently in, because of the added complexity of modern societies issues bring.So in this 2 party winner take all system, think about the stakes both sides of messaging received non-stop for the last 4 years.For the right wing, you got Democrats and Liberals are sex crazed lunatics attacking children, and letting immigrants destroy our country.For the Left wing you got, MAGA are cult-like followers of a rapist, conman, traitor. RHINO are Military-Industrial-Complex Oligarch lackeys, and the remaining republicans are spineless yes-men to their anointed Trump.Internally on the Republican side, they are worried about big money in their party, because Republicans picked up a large vote of the working class, but policy wise they've always been about the top 1% the capital class. So do they need to change policy to working class.(This wasn't me saying this by the way this was Mitt Romney on a televised interview)Meanwhile on the Democrat side, we are concerned about big money in our party too, because lately our politicians have stopped reflecting the base. They are voting like early 90's republicans did. But we have to win this election, otherwise can our democracy stand if we can't fix this, and it's truly a uni-party?(Again not me, this is para-phrashing Bernie Sanders)So in this winner take all system if you were left or right this time around, everyone was your enemy. On the right, that meant someone who was apolitical or centrist, was okay with letting sex crazed maniacs run free, and letting a soft invasion happen from our southern border. Whereas on the left it would mean you are basically okay with a dictator.So all Trump had to do was convince the centrists and apolitical to not vote, or that the smug college educated liberal, and their different friends were really perverts and that \\"You are special, they are really the one with the problem, and why things aren't going your way.\\" Or just to say so many insane boasts or promises the apolitical or centrist would say there's no way people believe that, I don't need to vote, the Dems got this.The current political system we are in is broken to it's core. We need to adjust it now. Like today.

We're trying to tear down a system that already gives certain groups special advantages, and move toward a real meritocracy where a person's resume isn't going to be thrown out just because the name on it sounds black.

The inquiry started in 2013 after the Finance Ministry's financial crimes unit noticed several transfers of more than 1 million reais ($308,500) from accounts in Panama to his accounts in Brazil.In a November interview with Reuters, Nogueira denied any wrongdoing in Brazil.He said that he only learned after the Trump Ocean Club project was almost complete that some of his partners and investors in the project were criminals, including some with what he described as connections to the \\"Russian mafia.\\"Nogueira, whose whereabouts are unknown, said he had not knowingly laundered any illicit money through the Trump project, although he said he had laundered cash later in other schemes for corrupt Panamanian officials.Garten said in November: \\"No one at the Trump Organization, including the Trump family, has any recollection of ever meeting or speaking with this individual.\\"Torres and Engel wrote in their letter that obtaining answers from the Trump Organization on the Panama project was \\"essential as we carry out oversight of U.S. policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean.\\"They said they wanted to ensure that Trump was \\"fully committed to the goal of dismantling the transnational criminal organizations that are responsible for smuggling drugs into the United States.\\"\\"If the President, in a previous role, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the laundering of drug money, it would be of grave concern to us,\\" the letter read.","title":"Lawmakers question Trump ties to Panama project linked to laundering, trafficking | U.S. Congresswoman Norma Torres of California's 35th District"},{"text":"GOP the party of law and order with Convicted Felon Donald J.

A third of Americans did not vote in 2024, and these are the people Im thinking of here.2).

That is a whopping 51-point divide along gender lines, larger than in any other generation.Given that women are more likely to say that they wouldnt marry someone who didnt share their values, this means that there are going to be men who are conservative and not able to get dates/find a spouse.

Rather than utilizing the energy of progressives, the party declared that their strategy was to 'gain two conservatives for every progressive we lose.'

And again, I could have better stated my point as lack of a \\"Majority of *first choice* votes\\" though that certainly doesn't invalidate yours. I'm just not convinced that Americans in general understand enough about the mathematical and political nuances of them to see enough value in them to offset feeling hoodwinked or \\"cheated\\"  by them. Many are already distrustful of the much simpler current FPTP system, the government establishment in general, and the often seemingly unfair gamesmanship exhibited by party leadership at the national level. I think it works better in other places that have had more time to understand and integrate all the nuance of it into their views of \\"fairness\\".
