When no one self-identifies with a label, it often turns into a pejorative or purely derogatory swear word, losing its value in constructive discourse. In the absence of a clear, widely agreed-upon definition, misapplication can run rampant. Even if you can't articulate a definition, self-identification provides at least a concrete group to point to and say it refers to those guys. If no one adopts the label, it becomes dubious whether the term really exists in a meaningful way or describes anything useful.Self-identification also promotes accountability and intellectual honesty. If individuals or institutions openly align with a particular ideology, they take responsibility for the full spectrum of that ideology's consequences, both positive and negative. When labels are imposed externally without self-identification, definitions can distort or exaggerate ideas to serve the arguments of critics.","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"The Conservatives governed Canada federally from 2006 to 2015.

I believe he got railroaded by Fauci and his covid relief spending was a disaster.Things would've been so much worse if he didn't lock those states down and pass a stimulus bill. Is there any substance to this other than \\"government intervention/spending = bad\\"?Lockdowns were [effective and necessary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8) at preventing the spread of covid. In the US alone, all the lockdown and other covid procedures prevented 4.8 million additional infections in the early pandemic, and that for the overall pandemic there would've been 14x the amount of cases in total if no lockdowns were ever put in place, which is insane.As for the stimulus, yes it contributed to inflation, but the pros outweighed the cons. High inflation is better than a bad recession and massive unemployment. Keep in mind that so many people became unemployed, and without the expanded unemployment benefits and stimulus checks so many of these people would've been screwed financially. The PPP also likely saved a lot of businesses from completely shutting down due to not being able to operate.[Here's](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/beyond-bls/the-us-cares-act-and-household-resilience.htm) an article going over how the cares act helped mainly lower income Americans. I can't believe that politics has gotten so skewed that people are against stimulus spending in economic downturns, that's literally one of the main functions of a government. And then passed the near trillion dollar 'Inflation Reduction Act' which is the most ironic bill imaginable. Somehow to fix out of control spending we need to do more out of control spending.You are incorrect, please do some basic research on bills before you spread misinformation about them. The IRA raised enough revenue to be completely paid for, plus extra which means it REDUCED the deficit. And none of this was based on tax increases for anyone even remotely middle class.[Here's](https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IRA2022-summary.png) a picture going over the revenues and expenses.So overall, that bill reduced the deficit, and made necessary spending that has improved our GDP, combatted climate change and added jobs. There's literally nothing to complain about. Dem policy exacerbated the issue when they took control. Both sides did a poor job on this.Trump's covid response was infamously awful. I can list so many things and articles, but I'll simply remind you that he suggested on live television to basically drink bleach.The dems have had an adequate covid response and at the very least haven't made incredibly embarrassing and incompetent decisions on a daily basis like the trump admin did.

The idea that free markets with less regulations are preferable to (democratic) command economies with heavily regulated economies. While this involves Thatcher/Reaganite privisatiosons and even the austerity seen by the likes of the British Consersatives, it also involves objectively not that be it the Third Way of Clinton and Blair, or however you wish to categorise the Biden Administration.For that reason, of course it's to blame for current societal woes! It's been the broadly dominant system for half a century, if it wasn't to blame for modern issues that would only mean it would have failed to solved the woes left by the previous dominant system.But just because it is to blame for current woes does not mean it can also be used to solved the same woes, and neither does it mean it is the foundational cause of those woe. It's more than likely isues like, or otherwie equivalent to, modern mental health crisises, spiraling rent, or the rise of authoritarian-populism would have occured in any dominant system.As I led with, neoliberalism has become one of those \\"meaningles phrases\\" Orwell so heavily criticised 'experts' for relying upon. The vast majority of times I read it, nothing in the work would substaintially change if it was replaced by \\"something not desirable\\". Given Orwell speaks of the issue prior to WWII, I don't think this hints at any new issue in academia, but a rather old one where an overuse of jargonised terms and echochambers form to noones benefit.","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"Theres always reasons.

In that cultural context, a non-virgin woman is less likely to get married. And to be an unmarried woman in that society is risky. But also in that society there are expectations for how a husband treats their wife/wives. If he doesn't follow through then he will experience social shame, which in that society is everything. The reality is he is now forced to provide security to the woman he used, with security being the main reason women would get married then in the first placeThe religious objections to porn consumption rely on the concept of moral absolutism.  Everything you are arguing here argues against the idea of moral absolutism, and supports the idea of moral relativism.  Morality is relative.  Relative to what?  To the cultural identity of a society.  This basically negates any religious or biblical objection to porn.  Nothing is ever good or bad on its own: it just depends on the society.  Thus whatever biblical objection you may muster up against porn is invalid, because we live in a different time and a different culture today.  Also, this isn't hypocrisy at all, since we are not living by these laws now. It would be hypocrisy if we said, for instance, sex should be reserved for those that are married, but then everyone just freely has sex before marriage anywayI used these scriptural examples to make the case that porn is no more obscene than the Bible.

New congress is sworn in  on January 3th. With the current gop margins in the house, they don't have the votes to do anything before, plus senate is still Democrat. Even if they wanted to, it appears the previous congress plays no role in certifying house results, it falls squarely on the States. So then comes January 6th. Unfortunately for trump the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 closed most of the loopholes. It now requires 1/5th the senate (20 people) and 1/5th the house (87 people) to object to each slate of electors. And they can only object to them not being legally certified, not for vague \\"voter fraud\\" reasons. Keep in mind this is a new house. It's incredibly unlikely trump looses the election but wins the house. So any objection would go nowhere The real strategy for trump is to gum it up at the local level so no winner can be declared. He needs tight margins for that, and it's a long shot he can do it for the near two months in-between election, and electoral vote certification. Plus every swing state is either controlled by Democrat's or are Georgia who has a governor ho already stood up to trumps election denial. And remember during all this time Biden is still president with full command control of the miltary and executive branch. He doesn't lose that power until noon January 20th. And there is precisely zero the Supreme Court can do about that thanks to checks and balances. So they can't just declare the speaker the real president.

That it's somehow man-made and part of some deep state operation to interfere in the election.It's mind boggling. Climate change isn't man made according to these people, but *natural* disasters are being weaponized by the globalist, deep state liberal cabal.Musk's algorithms are elevating the loudest lunatics on the platform. These are right wing voices that pay for the privilege to promote the most outlandish, irrational, clickbait content. And what's worse, they earn an income while doing it. It's the monetization of misinformation, Muskbucks...These are people whose sole job is to be terminally online, while they accuse \\"the left\\" of being lazy socialists. Proudly proclaiming themselves \\"critical thinkers\\" and \\"independent journalists\\" in their Twitter biosThere's a concerted effort on these platforms to exploit almost any incident, event or tragedy and spin it into a narrative that blames Democrats/Kamala Harris for every  conceivable crime or disaster.\\"Where is Kamala?\\" Is trending, and the top paid conservative personalities are claiming that she hasn't even made a statement, and that she's sending billions to Ukraine while poor Americans receive nothing.These are flagrant lies, but they stick. What's more, they get pushed to the top of your feed.Harris has made multiple statements, she's been helping to coordinate the response, FEMA efforts are underway, these states are receiving the disaster funding they desperately need.Keep in mind that some of the prominent Republicans pushing these messages have voted down or discouraged this funding in the past.And you know what's particularly ironic? That these are people calling for the stripping down of all government agencies, including the ones responsible for responding to these disasters. People who call all forms of government support \\"communism,\\" but when that support is desperately needed in their communities, it becomes not only mandatory, but not enough...And make no mistake, most of these people couldn't care less about the victims of Hurricane Helene, they're more interested in using them as props to increase engagement and promote a dangerously misinformed and partisan message. I mean, it's practically dystopian.This kind of stuff has become normalized, people are so caught up in their social media routines and devoted to their online presence, that they've become desensitized and borderline sociopathic, senselessly dedicated to their online personas and political crusades. The other irony is that *this* is the actual man made operation. These people are participating in the actual scheme, in the real election interference, mindlessly toeing the line, contributing to the dumbing down of the general public. They are the \\"irrational force\\" that Walter Lippman was warning us about back in the 1920s. And Elon Musk is proudly enabling it.The other consequence of this will be JD Vance, Donald Trump, and/or their spokespeople showing up to the next debate, press conference or televised interview with a handful of talking points that are just reiterations of this propagandistic content. It's a damn circus. These are deep seated societal issues, and I'm afraid they're just going to get worse. I can't think of any immediate solution to these problems.

The categorical pardon builds on a similar round issued just before the 2022 midterm elections that pardoned thousands convicted of simple possession on federal lands eligible. Fridays action broadens the criminal offenses covered by the pardon. Biden is also granting clemency to 11 people serving what the White House called disproportionately long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.https://apnews.com/article/biden-marijuana-pardons-clemency-02abde991a05ff7dfa29bfc3c74e9d64","title":"Harris says she backs legalizing marijuana, going further than Biden"},{"text":"She can stand on the picket line like Biden did and lock up the union vote or shoot herself in the foot by playing soft.","title":"Port strike could be October surprise Kamala Harris dreaded"},{"text":"With windmills and electric planes.

Youre right. No partial birth abortion. I misspoke. No partial birth abortion. Only 9-month abortion. Because, you know, right, that 9-month abortion IS legal. So the loophole when delivering a child and performing a partial-birth abortion is to say that the child is not partially born but taken out as part of the abortion procedure. If you google search Walz 9 month abortion you can see he voted to protect abortion up to 9 months and he was on the winning side of this vote.  Google search Kamala Harris 9 month abortion and you will see that she voted to protect abortion any time after 5 months with zero restrictions. It is similar to how Mark Zuckerberg wrote The House of Representatives that he was pressured by the Biden Administration to censor studies on Covid and to censor the news of what information was on Bidens sons laptop but that Mark Zuckerberg made the choice himself to censor the information on all of Meta (the umbrella company for Facebook and Instagram).  See: it is illegal for the government to censor anyone. However, a business or platform has the right to censor what it wants to do within the platform. So while the Biden administration pressured Zuckerberg to censor information, it is not illegal because he chose to censor his platform. Semantics can change something from illegal to legal. Anyway, it is happening, but what you said just goes to show further why information about it happening is hard to find.Edit/add: I thought of another example of legally getting away with illegal activity: Bill Cosby asked for full immunity if he confessed, and he was granted full immunity, Cosby proceeded to confess to raping many, many women over many decades. Then he went to jail for 3 years, unfairly, because he had full immunity, for the rapes of these women, and he was set free and did not serve the full prison sentence for raping many women over multiple decades because legally he should not have been in prison in the first place: ironically, his rights were violated, because the words prefacing his confession were full immunity. Nearly any illegal thing can be made legal with the right verbiage or the right loophole.","title":"Democrats are the true liars and threats to our country."},{"text":"Its literally Democracy vs Monarchy.

The Audible plot synopsis made it appear that way. But the author is just Trump bashing. Sure he gives plenty of material and is a liar, but all politicians use social media to influence voters and this book is in no way balanced. It isnt until Chapter 4 where she addresses technology and how the media has changed. That chapter was decent. All those before and after are just going on and on about Trump. I got very tired of it and didnt buy the book to hear that. Trump wasnt mentioned once in the synopsis but is 90% of this book.This 2-star review:Nothing wrong with the information here.But the bias and tone of it make it borderline useless.Even when information is true it does not serve the author well to have such a flagrant bias.Another 2-star review, sounding like someone who'd feel at home here and have something to contribute:Did not finish. Two stars is generous. It was incredibly biased toward one side of what should have been a neutral approach to expounding on the epidemic of misinformation through American media. Only one side is to blame: Trump and the GOP. It was an endless wrap sheet of all he has ever done wrong, all of the things hes said that are bad or untrue, and all of the ways the GOP has harmed the nation. Its not that everything was factually untrue, much of it is true and perhaps deserved, but the book neglected a balance elaborating on both sides of the political spectrum and the responsibility all politicians, news outlets, and American citizens have to report the truth. There were hypocritical statements one after the other. The author would criticize Trump for something awful that he had said, and in the next paragraph, shed quote something Clinton had said, without condemning her obtuse comment. Keep in mind, this is all coming from someone who doesnt love Trump, and I believe that Trumps insensitivity is second to none when it comes to Americans presidential candidates. But what I dislike even more, is a book that has a promise of education and intrigue, but instead, is saturated with unapologetic bias, immature hypocritical statements, historical anecdotes that are not properly vetted or nuanced, and organization as sound as a toddlers toy chest. Whats more, the only person who would perhaps find this book enlightening would be someone who had never heard of the United States or was at least unfamiliar with its history for the past 10 years. As a US citizen who has lived through it all, the new pieces of information were few and far between.The reviews that give a low rating are those able to recognize bias in any direction, not only the one the author decries.","title":"\\"The 1st Amendment stands as a major roadblock for us right now\\""},{"text":"**outright lying** is watered to down to *criticizing*.","title":"Kemp praises Bidens Hurricane Helene response amid Trump criticism"},{"text":"[The weird story he shared](https://archive.ph/uAN4A) about his infant daughter (Rudy's granddaughter) sure didn't help.","title":"Rudy Giuliani's daughter Caroline endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Make sense given the circumstances.

Americans want easy, quick fixes for the economy, but realistically it's tough to pin down what's price gouging and what's a genuine increase in cost. There have been legitimate issues, such as droughts and disasters, affecting supplies of various foods or ingredients. Plus, whether we like it or not, labor shortages and the need to pay workers more for labor will cause price increases eventually.Businesses certainly like to increase profits, because that's why they exist, but we should also recognize that stuff is going to get more expensive due to other factors like, you know, climate change. I feel like we've been just ignoring the fact climate change is going to make food scarcer or more expensive, as it's already doing for some commodities. But I know it'll be tough for people to accept more expensive, say, chocolate or Coke even if it's necessary, and populist rhetoric feels better.I do think the article is right to point out that increased profit margins isn't necessarily correlated with price hikes. There could be other reasons some companies are making more money, and many retailers are already curtailing prices because of good old supply and demand as consumers shop elsewhere.","title":"Kamala Harris wants to take on price gouging.

He was recently asked about keeping manufacturing jobs in the US and his answer was some of the most dementia riddled nonsense he has ever spoken.  AUDIENCE QUESTION: Thank you so much for coming to Michigan. My name is Ashley and I work at the Chrysler plant. Like many auto workers, I am deeply concerned about the future of our industry. With many jobs being outsourced as we speak, what action will you take to ensure that our jobs stay in America so we can continue to build the best cars in the world here in Michigan?DONALD TRUMP: So, pretty much as weve been saying, and what I want to do is I want to be able to  Look, your business  Years ago in this area, I was honored as the man of the year. It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didnt know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said  They said, oh  And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.It did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? Theyre taking your business away. And I didnt know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.And lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We cant let them take your car business away. Its such an important business.And you know its an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I dont know, its like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.You cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We dont have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They dont take our farm products for the most part. They dont take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesnt do anything, I keep saying, why dont you do?I saw Marsha the other day. Why doesnt she, why didnt she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, shes on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.But I just say, lets go back. So we cant let them take our businesses. And were not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.So were not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of thats determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.And it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So well do the same thing.And you dont worry about it. Heres what you have to do. I only ask you to do one thing, and then you can sleep beautifully all night long, go to a job you love, and get a lot of money at the end of the week. You know what the thing is? Vote for Trump. If you vote for Trump, everythings gonna be perfect.Source: https://youtu.be/a1ZsgB1p50E?t=129","title":"Fact Check: Has Kamala Harris 'Stolen' Donald Trump Jobs Policy?"},{"text":"In the same vein, if East Palestine got rid of East, theyd be swimming in aid under this administration.","title":"Joe Biden Tells Americans Suffering in Flood Disaster Zone No. There Wont be More Resources Coming Weve Given Them All We Have"},{"text":"\\"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket.

How do we manage that? Was Germany's free trade with Russia wise, or did it lead to or deepen dependency on a dangerous rival? How does that inform discussions of free trade and its relation to multilateral alliances and international institutions going forward? Was Clinton right that free trade leads to free society? Or do China and Russia show that this is untrue? Or does the success of globalisation elsewhere and pressures in those societies show that its partially true, but within limits and with conditions? Neoliberalism isn't the answer to these questions. Its the attempt to find and apply useful answers within the context of some core ideas: the importance of free trade (external and internal), the importance of liberal and competent governing institutions to allow free and competitive trade to work, the importance of personal, civil, and economic liberty, opposition to entrenched privilege in restraint of economic, civil and personal liberty and the primacy of the dignity and rights of individual humans in politics.","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"Weird how these sorts of laws only get passed in swing states","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"Mine just came back it only affected iPhones 13/14 generations.

That's an enormous hurdle.So it's unlimited power when it's something the executive doesn't share and almost unlimited power if he does.","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"Resource scarcity caused by rapid overpopulation and dirty supply lines requiring a lot of resources to maintain.

The public is sick of hearing about Trump and just want him to go away. People are sick of being called by pollsters. Sick of getting 30 emails a day begging for money or for your vote. Sick of nonstop YouTube attack ads with just obvious bullshit and slander. I also think the media is making it seem like a much closer race than it will be because they don't want to lull people into a false sense of security as happened in 2016 where everyone just assumed Clinton II would win and so it was safe to stay home or give a protest vote.I think Biden would have lost 100%, but replacing him with anyone young and competent was a guaranteed victory. I think the people who are willing to answer polls are the ones who are highly invested in their candidate, which is pretty much all of Trump's base and a comparitively much smaller percentage of Harris' base.

Neoliberalism shares many attributes with essentially contested concepts such as democracy, whose multidimensional nature, strong normative connotations, and openness to modification over time tend to generate substantial debate over their meaning and proper application (Gallie?[1956](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5#ref-CR29)). In stark contrast to such concepts, the meaning of neoliberalism has attracted little scholarly attention. In a review of 148 articles on neoliberalism published in the top comparative politics, development, and Latin American studies journals between 1990 and 2004, we did not find a?*single*?article focused on the definition and usage of neoliberalism, nor are we aware of one published elsewhere.In this article, we analyze contemporary scholars unusual use of neoliberalism in the study of political economy and offer an explanation for why this situation has come about. Based on a content analysis of journal articles, the first section of the article documents three key characteristics of this use. First, neoliberalism is employed asymmetrically across ideological divides: it is used frequently by those who are critical of free markets, but rarely by those who view marketization more positively. In part, proponents avoid the term because neoliberalism has come to signify a radical form of market fundamentalism with which no one wants to be associated. Second, neoliberalism is often left undefined in empirical research, even by those who employ it as a key independent or dependent variable. Third, the term is effectively used in many different ways, such that its appearance in any given article offers little clue as to what it actually means.The contemporary use of neoliberalism is even more striking because scholars once employed the term nearly the opposite of how it is commonly used today. As we demonstrate in the second section, the term neoliberalism was first coined by the Freiberg School of German economists to denote a philosophy that was explicitly?*moderate*?in comparison to classical liberalism, both in its rejection of laissez-faire policies and its emphasis on humanistic values. These characteristics imbued neoliberalism with a common substantive meaning and a positive normative valence: it denoted a new liberalism that would improve upon its classical predecessor in specific ways. Only once the term had migrated to Latin America, and Chilean intellectuals starting using it to refer to radical economic reforms under the Pinochet dictatorship, did neoliberalism acquire negative normative connotations and cease to be used by market proponents.We argue that the patterns of asymmetric use emerging out of this historical transformation contribute to current scholars tendency to apply the term neoliberalism broadly, yet offer few precise definitions.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5)","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"!deltaPropoganda susceptibikity is definitely a logistical issue i overlooked, but yeah it would tend to make propoganda more effective propbably.","title":"CMV: Highschools should teach the concept and details of the political compass."},{"text":"As an older guy it's the opposite.\\nThe togetherness was forced upon us.

Our current inflation rate is the same as under Trump in 2018(2.5%). GDP is up, median income adjusted for inflation is up. Stock market is up. Interest rates just went down.?? The argument against the economy doing well is that prices for everyday goods is high. Unfortunately that is how it works. For prices to go down would be deflation which doesn't happen as we have some level of inflation every single year. The problem is that not all jobs are seeing an increase in wages needed to offset the increase in cost of goods.? People are using that against the Biden administration but that's a correlation causation fallacy. Just because two things are associated with each other doesn't mean one caused the other.? The global pandemic and it's effect on demand and supply lines cause increaes in inflation and cost of goods across the entire world.?

There are rumors of an upcoming Israeli offensive in Lebanon in the coming weeks, and if that happens, it could cause American public opinion to swing strongly against the Biden administration, and by extension Harris.Iran has barely responded to Israel's attacks over the past year. It's clear that Biden is negotiating with them behind the scenes. I'm guessing he's promised them that Harris will drop sanctions and reinstate the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal if they don't retaliate.Meanwhile, Netanyahu and Trump favor escalation in order to embarrass Biden and Harris. Israel's escalation is an extremely well telegraphed October surprise. There's no way Biden and Harris aren't planning for this upcoming escalation. The polls matter a ton here because though Netanyahu favors Trump, there's still a coin-flip chance that Harris is going to win. That means Netanyahu still has to avoid irritating Biden/Harris too much in case they win. That gives Biden leverage over Netanyahu. Netanyahu was on trial for corruption in Israel and now he's facing war crimes and crimes against humanity charges outside of Israel. He realistically faces prison if he loses. So he's desperate, but Biden/Harris can still offer him an out. The leader of a dock-worker's union in New York has announced his intention to go on strike in October, potentially sending the American economy into a tailspin and once again damaging the Biden administration's image at a crucial time.It takes a while for this kind of supply side inflation to affect the economy. I don't think even a major dockworker strike would noticeably affect the average American consumer until after the election. Beyond that, Biden has a ton of incentive to just give them what they want. He can just give some sort of taxpayer subsidy to the companies so the cost of the higher wages are borne by the taxpayer.Biden is very good at waiting until the last possible second to make his voters happy (enough to vote for him.) He was behind in the 2020 primary, 2020 general election, and 2022 midterm elections until the last second and then he vaulted ahead. Polls routinely underestimated his support.

I can tell you with 100% confidence that Harris DOES NOT have a 100% chance of losing.  Right now, any reasonable pollster/modeler/etc. is calling the election a tossup, which is about right.There is a false narrative that \\"the polls underestimate Trump\\", which is nonsense.  In 2016, he slightly overperformed compared to the polls and eeked out a win with less than 100k votes in just the right states.  In 2020, he slightly underperformed in the polls, with a lot of prognosticators believing it's because he spent so much time telling people mail-in voter was a scam.So let's check off your points for a good ole CMV :)1. You say \\"Harris is within the margin of error\\" and then say \\"there will surely be an error\\" (and there will be), but you discount that \\"what if the error is in Harris's favor?\\"  Harris right now is a very slight favorite everywhere that matters.  She also has more paths to victory than Trump.  Because of that, she is a slight favorite.\\n2. AZ and GA were a bit of a surprise for Biden (again, proving that Trump can/does underperform).  Harris does NOT HAVE TO win these.  Trump MUST win these or upset \\"the blue wall\\" again.  At the same time, Harris is threatening NC, which again is a state that Trump must win.\\n3. The impact of this is unclear along with the likelihood of it happening.\\n4. Same with 3.The bottom line is we have a deeply polarized electorate and this election is going to come down to 1 thing: turn out of the party faithful.  To say \\"Harris is going to lose\\" is just as incorrect as saying \\"Trump is going to lose\\".It's a coin toss that right now slightly favors Harris.  The most likely outcome is Harris inches in with a few key swing state votes while Democrats lose the senate, creating a gridlocked government.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is going to lose the 2024 election"},{"text":"is it?

They will do absolutely anything to win this election. They are trying to win with legitimate campaigning, getting more voters to vote for Harris in enough states to win the EC. But they are also pulling every trick they can think of to tip the scales.Every year in the US approximately 900,000 permanent residents are granted citizenship. [This year the Biden administration is granting 10x the normal amount in hopes that they will vote Dem.](https://www.boundless.com/blog/new-report-9-million-immigrants-eligible-to-become-citizens-in-2024/) If even 1/3 of the new immigrants vote for Harris, that's likely to be about a 2% swing in the popular vote. Nate Silver estimates she needs to win the popular vote by 2.5-3% to have a high likelihood to win the EC.Then we have the general morass of voter registrations having poor oversight, which is an invitation for chaos to create opportunities.If all else fails and Trump wins more votes in enough states to win the EC, he still will never, ever be allowed to take office again. People with the ability to burn the world to the ground will stop at utterly nothing to prevent it. They will assassinate him if they have to.It might not be Kamala, but it is for absolute certain that under no circumstance, not even if he legitimately wins, will Trump ever be allowed to be President again.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is going to lose the 2024 election"},{"text":"Nebraska as well, but maybe not the the extent you mentioned","title":"Kamala Harris says 'we need to legalize' marijuana for first time as democratic presidential nominee"},{"text":"She's been part of the administration that's been improving the economy since 2020.

We should leave room to read other critiques and self-critique. The fact of the matter is that there are negative consequences to many neoliberal successes, and honestly, you have to be a bit willfully blind to not see that much of global finance flows through some of the same hands as in colonial days.?I have read legitimate critiques of neoliberalism as a paradigm, from a leftist academic point of view. They define it correctly, name appropriate figures within the genre, and point to disparities where neoliberal thought is clearly at fault. You dont have to fully agree with an argument to gain value from the discourse, if theyre not being hacks in their approach.An example: you could make a case that neoliberalism has a strong hand in encouraging the proliferation of plastic waste and therefore microplastics. Despite well-intentioned outcomes in raising living standards, increasing food safety, fostering global distribution, and making consumer goods affordable, letting the market encourage something thats clearly polluting our environments may be something that could have been avoided with an alternative political economic structure. Yes there are probably neoliberal policy interventions to be had, but obviously neoliberals didnt intervene in the 60s-90s and the market didnt recognize it as an issue either until recently.Critiques are always useful for questioning and building knowledge, which is the goal of academics. We should take the ubiquitous critiques as a badge of honor, since neoliberalism represents to many the predominant thinking in our political systems. We shouldnt be tribal in our defense of NL as a political approach.","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"This gratuitous use of soft quotation marks would make MSNBC blush in shame.","title":"John Kerry: If Democrats Win, We Can Change First Amendment To Fight Disinformation"},{"text":"As someone with multiple orthopedic problems, I look forward to this.","title":"Harris says she backs legalizing marijuana, going further than Biden"},{"text":"My Gen Z daughter believes that running on legalisation alone would be enough to secure the youth vote.","title":"Harris says she backs legalizing marijuana, going further than Biden"},{"text":"1.

Both are very rural, but Teton had a median household income of 100.000 while Johnson has 60.000.The problem is, that any invigorating industry would seldom help regions who are already on the lower end, since they wont settle there to begin with. So both can be true: the economy is doing great, the problem is that the industry isnt settled where people are already bad situated to begin with. Those regions however have to deal with the sudden increase in cost. The thing is, however, that Biden really tried (and still is) to help these regions. Obama did too. Trump did not and according to P2025 they wont in the future. Presidents dont have a magic switch that they can flip and everything is amazing. The economy has to come from somewhere - for Teton it is a booming healthcare and recreation industry, for Johnson it was mining and that wont come back and due to political mismanagement no precaution measure were taken to settle other industries there.

Even a small polling error, which there is almost certain to be, would put Trump over the edge enough to win.Polling errors can go both ways. We have to work on the indicators that we have. Polling was off in 2016, 2020, and 2022. Are we going to see a hidden blue wave like two years ago? Are we going to see a Trump surge like 2016? Who knows. As I see it right now, Harris looks poised to win WI, MI, with tossups for GA, NC, and PA. Any one of those toss-up states and that's ballgame. Harris is losing support compared to Biden in \\"sun belt\\" states such as Arizona and Georgia, meaning that any victory she does achieve would be much narrower than Biden's, with fewer backup options.True but she's polling far better in North Carolina which I think could be the key. Right now, for obvious reasons [Mark Robinson is polling ABYSMALLY in the governor's race in NC](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/mark-robinson-north-carolina-governor-poll/index.html), and trying to use Trump as his life raft. With the environmental turmoil happening in that state right now, what happens next is anyone's guess, but a flipped NC gives Kamala a path while still losing Arizona and Pennsylvania. There are rumors of an upcoming Israeli offensive in Lebanon in the coming weeks, and if that happens, it could cause American public opinion to swing strongly against the Biden administration, and by extension Harris.I'm not sure about this. I don't know how many people would be swayed by this who haven't already been swayed by a full year of carnage in Palestine. The leader of a dock-worker's union in New York has announced his intention to go on strike in October, potentially sending the American economy into a tailspin and once again damaging the Biden administration's image at a crucial time.Yeah this could fucking suck, and is the most compelling point on this list. Biden needs to get his ass on this. I think it would behoove Harris to subtly distance herself from Biden as much as possible without ruffling feathers on some of these things.

I agree that a lot of the negatives discussed in the study I linked are not due to the existence of pornography, but to a lack of comprehensive education. But I also think that we should be concerned with the fact that the internet has ushered in an age wherein people of any age can access endless hours of hardcore pornography at the click of a button - it's a *very very new phenomenon* and there's a lot of factors at work here. I'd put it in the same vein as social media - it's not an inherently bad technology that's causing harm, but there's no denying that there's been a massive cultural shift around how people interact with one another and how our collective attention spans have been fried by constant overstimulation and dopamine rushes, even though most people are aware that the internet isn't real life.And, you might think it's marginalizing, but I think it's just the truth that young people are impressionable and inexperienced. They haven't developed a framework for what a \\"real\\" sexual relationship is like, and, I wholly agree with you, probably the *best* way we as a society can tackle this is by incorporating discussing pornography in sex education classes and emphasizing that it's theatrical. However, there's a lot of evidence that young people's self esteem and perception are heavily influenced by media and pop culture, *even though* many of them are aware that it's just a movie, just a videogame, etc.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

They would be better off using more precise words like liberal capitalism, free trade, market fundamentalism, the Washington consensus, deregulation, or any number of words that have a more precise meaning. Ofc if they start criticizing something like free trade Id heavily disagree with them, but at least wed be talking about something concrete and meaningful. \\nIf they used the word to describe the set of policies and attitudes favored by the psychos that browse this subreddit it would actually be useful and specific.

It was theorized most deeply by its detractors (largely from the left) as most orthodoxies do not trouble its supporters to the extent of wanting to examine its entrails. Just like Karl Marx was obsessed with understanding and defining capitalism, those who felt disturbed or victimized by neoliberalism would be most highly motivated to examine and define it. Note also, that as a consensus, neoliberalism was implemented by parties of the right where they happened to be in power and by parties of the left where they happened to be in power in the 1980s and 1990s. So those parties would look to other features of their political ideologies to differentiate themselves from their main rival parties. The far right was not so obsessed with neoliberalism at that time, because leading practitioners such as Reagan and Thatcher were socially conservative nationalist figures with relatively little sympathy for social minorities. It was only in the latter period of its dominance that leading neoliberal politicians co-opted leftwing social issues and that the far right started to connect neoliberal with the loss of sovereignty entailed by the neoliberal model of globalization (again previously critiqued most heavily by leftwing and Indigenous peoples movements). So how neoliberalism might appear to people brought up after 2000 would be very different from people who studied it since its inception. You might compare it favorably against the new more nativist consensus forming around the world. However, would it compare favorably to the New Deal type consensus which preceded it? That consensus may look left wing to people now, but in its time it was also a capitalist consensus forged in order to fight off the left.","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"Cue the MAGA crowd screaming about how she prosecuted people for it in the past.Yes, morons, that was her job, to apply the law as written at the time.","title":"Harris says she backs legalizing marijuana, going further than Biden"},{"text":"This sounds like a line from stans boss on American dad","title":"FBI to pay $22M to settle claims of sexual discrimination at training academy"},{"text":"Finally!

Because neoliberalism was the dominant political status quo of the Cold War academics  like to attribute every issue associated with the postwar US with it. Its essentially able to be critiqued objectively because it was the dominant philosophy. Political movements that never gain power are unable to be critiqued in the same manner because A. They never have to deal with the real world but arguably more importantly B. They remain pure and unassociated with other ideas. No ideology is actually implemented in a purist manner. Whenever someone implements an ideology things will be added to it that most academics would not find congruent with that ideology. This is simply the nature of people and ideas. Communism has this problem in spades. This is why real communism has never been tried because people keep adding stuff to it and it keeps being unable to survive the real world realities upon implementation. But just like with monarchism, neoliberalism, fascism, or communism, any other political ideology untried you implement will not be pure when it is implemented and this is something I feel that academics love to overlook when assigning blame or coming up with potential alternatives.","title":"How does R/Neoliberal view the academic discourse on neoliberalism?"},{"text":"Really hoping the answer isn't \\"it's illegal but too late to change it back\\"","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"Border security isnt a GOP policy, its a policy everyone understands and supports, but only one side actually wants to do anything about it","title":"Kamala Harris turns tables on Trump with immigration policy reset"},{"text":"The DEA has a public hearing scheduled for December 2nd about moving it from schedule 1 to 3.

The Tories won 23.7% of the vote in 2024, compared to 43.6% in 2019. Labour, on the other hand, won the 2024 election without dramatically increasing it's share of the overall vote--they won 33.7% of the vote in 2024, compared to 32.1% in 2019. Instead, the Conservative voting block was riven in two, with Reform UK claiming a huge number of formerly Tory voters. In addition, many center-right to right wing voters chose other alternatives, largely the Lib Dems.I'll skip over discussion of differences in the electoral systems except to say that a parliamentary system, where you get to be PM if you win the majority of seats in Parliament, is very different from a system in which you have to win a majority of electoral votes by winning the popular vote in some combination of states.

The whole reason the modern democratic party looks like it does, was the \\"third way\\" shift away from the democratic policies of the 1970's.  The necessity for Clinton to change policies was the failure of those policies to gain traction across the 1980's and the need for democrats to find a new coalition. JFC won a squeaker against Nixon in 1960 (49.7% vs 49.5% - although JFK carried 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219). In 1964, Lyndon Johnson, running in the Wake of the JFK assassination in 63, won the election over Barry Goldwater handily, winning 61.1% of the vote and 486 electoral votes.   Johnson passed the civil rights act.  In 1968 Nixon beat Hubert Humphrey 43.4% to 42.7%, , because George Wallace and Curtis LeMay runas the \\"American independent Party\\" (read - segregationist) and won Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia for 46 electoral votes. In 1972, Nixon *Handily* won against George McGovern, winning 60.7% of the popular vote and 520 votes in the electoral college.  McGovern carried a single state.  In 1976, Carter narrowly won over Gerald Ford, once again winning the deep south, but only Carrying 51% of the vote and 297 electorial votes to Ford's 240. in 1980,  Reagan won 50.7% of the popular vote but carried 489 electoral votes from 44 state. Carter only carried 41% from 6 states. in 1984, Reagan Won 58.8% of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes, to Mondale's 40% and one state.   in 1988 George H.W. Bush won 53.4% of the vote to Dukakis 45.6% and carried 426 electoral votes. Now, imagine you're Bill Clinton sitting in 1992 to challenge George H.W. Bush.     Republicans had won 5 of the last 7 presidential elections since the civil rights act, and the only victory in 20 years was a squeaker that is no longer possible due to the loss of the deep south. On the other hand, Republicans had put together several victories with 10+ point margins.   Clinton's only shot was to build a new coalition and reshape the electoral map.  He moved to the right economically, pursuing the urban professional class. Favoring NAFTA and friendly regulation for businesses as well as business friendly monetary policy.   The \\"third way\\" Clinton Coalition of urban professionals + progressives largely carried competitively through the Obama years,  but the ground started to shift from 2010-2016 with different demographics changing the scope of elections.","title":"The Democrats Shameful, Foolish Surrender on Immigration | Kamala Harris apparently believeswronglythat she has no influence on anti-immigrant sentiment in America, because she has effectively capitulated to MAGA messaging."},{"text":"Yeah, Georgia would be a nice cherry on top but I really don't expect us to turn blue with all the bs that's been happening after 2020.","title":"Democrats sue to block Georgia ballot hand count rule"},{"text":"They should offer The Sinclair Method for alcohol issues if people want to try that since abstinence doesn't have a great success rate.

The lawsuit, filed by the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia with support from Vice President Kamala Harris&amp;#039;s campaign, argues that the state election board went far beyond its authority in passing the rule, and notes that the board is not a lawmaking body and that the rule conflicts with the process established by the Georgia General Assembly.

And we've also got a very strong majority of voters that feel there is too much illegal immigration. Is this because Fox News and Republicans in general have largely won the messaging war on this?  Yes, unfortunately.  You don't have to like that to recognize it as a reality.   And that's what the Harris campaign is doing.  Recognizing that reality and reassuring people that she'll be strong on the border. I don't personally believe illegal immigration is anything like the kind of problem that the right wing media portrays it as.  It's a complicated and deeply nuanced issue, and there are positives and negatives that come along with illegal immigration.

Now a Texas county Republican party says they found errors.https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/19/texas-republican-hand-count-election/After declaring a successful hand count of ballots, Gillespie County Republicans had to fix a series of errors in the results reported from almost every precinct. FREDERICKSBURG  An hour after Gillespie County Republican Party Chairman Bruce Campbell declared the hand-counted primary election results completely accurate and certified them as final, he found another discrepancy. Its my mistake for not catching that, he said, sitting in front of his laptop inside the Gillespie County election administration office Thursday. I cant believe I did that. The late catch meant that Campbell had to ask the early voting ballot board chair, who had already left and lives 30 minutes away, to return to the elections offices, figure out how the error happened, and fix it. The election was a low-profile party primary, but stakes are high. Gillespie County Republicans, led by Campbell, decided months ago to hand-count more than 8,000 ballots. Experts agree and studies show the method is time-consuming, costly, less accurate, and less secure than using machines, but local Republicans, citing unsupported concerns about the accuracy of voting machines, were determined to try and show otherwise. Workers recruited and trained by the party counted until the early hours of the next morning, and declared the effort a success. Proponents of hand-counting are now touting GIllespie as a model.** Netherland said he still isnt confident the election results are accurate, based on the errors that he and others have found. On Thursday, Netherland said the Republican Party in Gillespie has introduced human error into the election process with the hand count. We took something that worked and now broke it, Netherland said. We failed to guard the purity of the election with this hand count. What we just did is evidence that this hand count was not accurate.","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"Judging by how things are going in Britain and how soon Starmer may be deposed, I would not do or say anything that ties your campaign to Starmer.

You seem focused only on the effect of porn as a product of consumption and not the negative externalities created by the manufacturing of porn.[Sites like Pornhub, the worlds leading free porn website, have been known to profit from filming rape, sexual abuse, and child sex trafficking. ](https://unboundnow.org/pornography-amp-sex-trafficking/)A significant amount of porn (especially \\"amateur\\" porn), which you described as a \\"superlatively beautiful and majestic thing,\\" may be videos of rape and sexual coercion. Someone films a sex act, uploads it, and receives the ad money. There is no oversight or regulation to ensure that all parties were treated well and compensated fairly. It could be a nice studio with medical plans for the sex workers, or it could be a tourist's video of a prostitute who was illegally trafficked from a neighboring country. On a free porn site, you don't know what the algorithm is recommending you, and most users probably don't care. Even sites like OnlyFans host a large number of Andrew Tate-like digital pimps who exploit sex workers via physical abuse, dubious contracts, and poor conditions.I don't think the solution is to stop pornography. However, you need to consider the human angle and be mindful of exploitation in the industry. If possible, ensure you only consuming \\"ethical\\" porn -- whatever that means to you.I think it would be wise to discard lofty ideas about beauty and intimacy in porn and instead choose to understand porn as a business.  Like any business, it is produced with absolute cutthroat margins that encourage corner-cutting and skirting ethical standards. Like any business, capitalist forces encourage conditions that are ripe for abuse.

Yes, it can be big chunks of money out of your wallet at once, but when it keeps more catastrophic things from happening like if your car breaks down on the side of the highway or if your furnace stops working in the dead of winter, most people would agree that it is well cheaper in the long run.But extend that rationale to how to keep the country running, and suddenly this all goes out the window. Republicans will fight tooth and nail to prevent any sort of pre-emptive or routine spending, and then when disasters inevitably happen, without any pre-planning in place they end up being far costlier and extensive than if we had just invested some basic formal pre-emptive programs. And they do apply this concept in a lot of other areas as well, but with natural disasters it's just so galling how they want their emergency spending handouts, with actual zero remorse in making things so much worse in the first place.","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Remarks on Federal Response to Hurricane Helene Before a White House Press Briefing"},{"text":"No, what happened was Hillary used an unclassified server to send emails in her official capacity as Secretary of State and then the FBI Director reopened the investigation days before the 2016 election.

He was first elected as county judge in 2018.Mr Patal, who is running for a county commissioner position in the Nov 5 election, was indicted earlier this month on four charges of online impersonation and four charges of misinterpretation of identity.Authorities allege Mr Patal also used the Antonio Scalywag alias to make racist posts to help him in his own run for county commissioner.A spokesman for Mr George said in an email on Thursday that the county judge would not immediately comment on the indictment.The Fort Bend County District Attorneys Office, which led the investigation, declined to comment. Frank Yeverino, an attorney for Mr Patel, did not immediately reply to a call seeking comment.In a statement last week, Mr George said he believed he was a witness and not a target of the investigation.I have not been charged with any crime, nor do I expect to be, he said in last weeks statement.At least one Fort Bend County commissioner, Vincent Morales, called for Mr George to resign following his indictment.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/09/27/democrat-texan-judge-trolled-himself-racist-abuse-kp-george/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/09/27/democrat-texan-judge-trolled-himself-racist-abuse-kp-george/)","title":"Democrat Texan judge KP George 'trolled himself with racist abuse to help get re-elected'"},{"text":"In working to flip seats currently held by Democrats, the Senate Leadership Fund plans to spend $67.5 million on TV, radio and digital ad reservations in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

If he tried this again, without the law backing him up, it becomes voter intimidation, and would allow for the plaintiff to request emergency relief.If they really wanted to, the feds could even got after him for election interference.I don't think this is really his MO - he likes to get the legislature to pass bad laws, and enact them while they go to course, or likes to find legally grey areas that aren't specifically laid out in laws, and go to court.Unfortunately, a lot of Texas judges, including the Federal ones, will let him play this game.  Part of the problem is that a lot of the red states are disproportionally represented by extremely conservative justices even at the Federal Level because the Democratic Chair of the Senate Judicial panel respected an old tradition called the \\"Blue Slip.\\"  If a Senator in the region a judge was being nominated for didn't like the judge, usually the Committee wouldn't vote on the candidate, effectively killing a lot of judge nominations.This would have been fine it Republicans had kept the same tradition, but at some point when they were in power they broke it, and started pushing through nominations despite blue slip objections.  If this happened in one term, that would have been understandable, but when Dems regained power, the Committee Chair went back to respecting Blue Slips - and then (big surprise) when Republicans regained power, they ignored them again.Fortunately the Democratic Senate Chair in question is no longer in that position (though how they let him stay for a second round boggles my mind), but a lot of damage was done.  This is mostly seen in the Red States though, because that's where there were Republicans to submit the Blue Slips, which left a lot of vacancies for a Republican President and Republican Senate to fill.This is why the Federal courts in Red areas seem so Conservative, and why people like Paxton seems to get away with so much.However, back to my point, Paxton likes to play these games, and the courts let him get away with it, but he rarely (as far as I can tell), outright breaks federal laws when it comes to these things.  Corruption, threats, and intimidation of his own workers is a whole different ball game though . . .

It is not a good look for Harris, 9-month abortions are hidden on mass media and hidden on Google, but more easily found on X. An easier search is to google moms that murder children, the first thing AI, on Google, suggests is altruism  which I searched for the first time ever to get the names of the moms who famously killed their kids because I forgot them but know they are out there knowing about the murder of children doesn't mean someone isnt a parent, what a stupid conclusion. It is common logic: both Harris and Wslz voted for and protected abortions to 9 months with NO RESTRICTIONS. If something is legal then people are doing it. It is the very simplest logic.  Kamala, literally, does stand for 9-month abortions no matter what, no matter the circumstances, and the proof is how she voted.   That doesn't mean I think it is fun, I think it is horrific. I think Kamala is horrific for so many reasons, but this is the cherry on top.  But sure, make ad verecundiam fallacies as if being a parent qualifies you to be the expert on how child murder never happens.   Seriously, the lefts arguments are always fallacious.

This is simply not true.?\\nPorn can be consumed compulsively, but it's not because the porn itself is so compelling that it outcompetes the healthy life that's otherwise available; it's that the porn is a form of self medication for other stressors or discomforts, and if you made porn inaccessible some other behavior would fill that need.?\\nI have at times been a compulsive porn consumer and masturbator. When I was able to change my life situation for the better the compulsion simply evaporated. I didn't have to \\"quit\\", I just didn't do it (compulsively) anymore because I was doing other, healthier things.\\nThis is a major flaw in a lot of addiction models, where we act like the substance is the problem, but at least with physically addictive substances (i.e. drugs) there is a legitimate biochemical connection between consumption and addiction.?\\nTreating porn as an addictive substance isn't substantially different from treating doorknobs as one simply before because an OCD person feels compelled to touch them. The doorknobs are a symptom of an underlying mental health issue, and so is the porn.\\n It ruins relationships and addicts will often choose porn over their partner which is something Ive actually experienced myself despite my high sex drive and literally never turning sex down/trying to initiate.\\nI can only imagine how painful this was, my only note would be that you're assuming that the prob consumption was about meeting a sex drive issue. It wasn't. It was about avoiding some kind of anxiety or pain or other mental discomfort. It's not that you weren't good enough or willing enough, it's that your partner was going through something that wasn't going to be solved through sex (or porn, obviously).","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

Right now it sounds like Harris is advertising keeping our current tax system, which voters absolutely hate, and adding a handful of young voter oriented tax credits.Heres a few other critically important issues she is not talking about that she could easily incorporate. She isnt talking about Medicare, Medicaid, disability, unemployment insurance, and Social Security reform. If more voters are not made aware of their funding problems and critically needed solutions, they will vote for the first Republican next time who does speak about fixing them. Unlike a Democrat, Republicans will focus on privatization. Because Democrats dont put time focusing on the problems with them, they give the other side the opportunity of capturing the message of grim reality of a fiscal cliff.The national debt is another one that I only hear Republicans speak on. Harris needs to be talking about the patriotism of paying taxes to better Americas people. I dont believe for a second that FDR, Johnson, Kennedy, and Nixon are the only people in American history that can make higher taxes on the wealthy sound necessary. What happened to the Democrat party? Why is it that independent socialist democrats like Bernie can resonate a message of liberalism, but people like Harris, Biden, and Clinton cannot?

And I do actually think that Israel is largely to blame for much of what transpired over the last centuries. Isarel is a country that was founded by settlers using violence against the native population. I don't disagree. But killing like 1,000 civilians, including children is just wrong. Plain and simple. There's no the means justify the ends. And the same goes for Israel as well. I am equally condeming Israel's actions, and Israel has without a doubt killed much more people than Hamas has. But killing innocent people to set an example is just wrong and evil. And it's also incredibly stupid. I mean what did Hamas leaders expect was gonna happen? Israel is a very wealthy country with the largest millitary budget per capita in the entire world, their millitary budget per capita is higher than even that of the US. And they are financially supported by the US and many other wealthy countries. How exactly did they think this was gonna go? Did they think they'll kill a bunch of people, kidnap a few and Israel was gonna give up? No reasonable person would think that. Of course Israel was gonna react, though again, I condemn how they've reacted after October 7. But the whole thing was just incredibly predictable.

White tailed eagles, great egrets, ospreys and kingfishers can be spotted among the vast network of rivers and creeks that comprise the 9,000 hectare site in the Netherlands. Hundreds of beavers live in burrows across the park, ready to come out at night. This landscape was created as part of the Dutch Governments Room for the Rivers project, the purpose of which was to create spaces for waterways to flood to avoid ruining communities. In the process, it created areas for nature to flourish. Nothing quite like this exists in the UK, according to Rob Stoneman, director of landscape recovery for Wildlife Trusts. Conservationists like Mr Stoneman believe such spaces could be the solution to Britains growing flood risk problem, alongside the sewage and biodiversity crises. Our national parks in the UK are not really national parks, he says, adding that Britains agriculture-dominated landscapes prevent nature from thriving. The story was once the same for De Biesbosch, which was farmed for hundreds of years until it became part of the pioneering Dutch scheme. Adopted by the national government following devastating floods in 1993 and 1995, the 2.3bn (1.9bn) project aimed to redesign the countrys rivers to protect towns from flooding and create spaces for nature. Its an approach that has garnered increasing interest in the UK as we face a crisis in our own rivers. In addition to the growing threat of floods, Britains waterways are suffering from devastating pollution C primarily from sewage works and agriculture C and a huge decline in biodiversity. Ecologist Wouter Helmer is one of the architects of the Netherlands new approach to water. He coordinated work on several pilot projects along the Rhine and Meuse before the government adopted the concept as a national policy. We were used to the traditional solution; if theres more flood risk, raise the dykes, Mr Helmer says. This was done for 800 years, but people were more or less fed up with that. Raising dykes also involves widening them, which took up more space, Mr Helmer adds. With the growing threat of extreme rainfall due to climate change, this option no longer seemed sustainable. Pollution was also a hot topic in the region at the time following the 1986 Sandoz disaster, a chemical spill in Switzerland that had a devastating impact on aquatic life in the Rhine. The Room for the River programme encompassed four rivers C the Rhine, the Meuse, the Waal, and the IJssel C and saw work carried out at over 30 sites before the programme ended in 2022. Farmers were bought out and moved away from the floodplains. Dykes were moved and water was allowed to flood into the spaces, which are now home to rewilding projects. Free-roaming herds of Galloway cattle and Konik horses now graze the landscape, in place of the livestock of the past, allowing biodiversity to thrive. This new way of thinking was tested in the summer of 2021 when large areas of the Meuse were hit with extreme rainfall. Belgium and Germany experienced extreme flooding, but water levels were lower in the Netherlands, in large part due to the Rooms for the Rivers programme. Its not only a nice idea, but it really works. It saves us hundreds of millions of euros, Mr Helmer says. So called nature-based solutions, like those that have found success in the Netherlands, have the potential to transform the UKs landscape, according to Mr Stoneman. Not only can these solutions reduce flood risk, but they can also help tackle our pollution problems by moving agriculture away from our rivers and reducing the amount of rain that makes its way into our creaking sewerage infrastructure. The UK Government currently provides some funding for these types of projects, but is yet to support nature-based solutions at the level of scale as its Dutch counterparts. Between 2021-27 the Environment Agency plans to spend 5.2bn on 1,500 flood defence projects across the UK, but only 260 (17 per cent) of these are expected to include nature based solutions. To date just 25m in ring-fenced funding has been set aside for these types of schemes. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson says a Flood Resilience Taskforce, introduced by the Government earlier this month, will turbocharge the building and rollout of natural flood defences and bolster the nations resilience to extreme weather. Meanwhile, water companies are expected to invest 35bn over the next five years, largely to reduce pollution and improve resilience to climate change, but a recent analysis of company business plans by a coalition of nature groups found just two per cent of this will be spent on nature-based solutions. **How nature-based solutions can work in the UK** While the UK is yet to see a nationally-coordinated scheme to restore rivers on the same scale as the Netherlands, projects are taking place across the country to test out a nature-based approach. At a 170 hectare former agricultural site in Bere Regis, Dorset, the River Sherford has been reconnected to the floodplain by the filling up of ditches. As a result water quality has been improved at the site, thus reducing the amount of nitrates flowing into Poole Harbour.  Led by Dorset Wildlife Trust, a community rewilding project has recently introduced free roaming livestock to the site and initial testing has suggested the soil in the fields is storing more carbon as compared to when it was intensively farmed.  In the Midlands, Staffordshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts are working together to re-wiggle the River Trent, reconnecting the post-industrial waterway to its floodplains. By creating new river channels, the project is also providing spaces for wildlife, for example by creating areas for trout to spawn and kingfishers to hunt.  Its just not radical enough, Mr Stoneman says, arguing that we should be looking for solutions like this for all the low lying cities, such as London, Bristol, Hull and Cambridge. Its very expensive to flood these cities so lets not flood these cities. Lets create fantastic nature reserves that in themselves then generate a nature tourism economy thats worth tens of millions a year. The UK has similarities with the Netherlands C including population density, climate and land values C that suggest a scheme like Room for the Rivers could be workable here. But there are also some key differences, not least the long ties between British farmers and the land that would make any attempts at land redistribution politically controversial. Mr Helmer encourages policymakers not to be hemmed in by the old way of doing things, and to find a way to make such a scheme work in a British context. I think you think too easily that its not possible in the UK, he says. Its always easy to continue the work you are doing and say new things are impossible.\\"!ping ECO&amp;UK&amp;BENE","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The one dude in the comments getting super mad about this is also burning his clothes in a garbage can right now.","title":"Can someone explain me the \\"Michelle Obama is a man\\" theory?"},{"text":"Or post a valid link with the info.

Most often, opinion and consensus is established by what the majority of scholars have ruled.Most of the scholars right now are disagreeing with some interpretations made by the Taliban, most notably those related to the permissibility of women speaking in public. Scholars of Islam, like those of other disciplines, do disagree on things, but theyre usually close enough that some opinions can be classified as being on the fringe. This is one of them.If even the conservative, traditional scholars are decrying this ruling, why cant liberal Muslims agree with that opinion of experts, in the same way you and I might agree about vaccines? If you can have correct and incorrect science, why cant you have correct and incorrect Islamic rulings?Edit: Ill include the most-often cited evidence from the classical texts. The plurality of Hadith (authenticated sayings from the life of the prophet Muhammad) were narrated by one of his wives. The argument, therefore, is that women speaking cannot be impermissible if she was able to do so. This has been accepted by a great deal of the scholars.","title":"CMV: - Modern/Liberal/Westernised Muslims have no right to criticise the implementation of Sharia law by the Taliban as morally or ethically 'wrong'"}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:K,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],j={key:0},M={key:1};function N(t,a,e,u,r,s){const m=w("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),n("div",P,[(i(!0),o(b,null,v(s.visiblePoems,(l,g)=>(i(),k(m,{key:g,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",M,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,R)):T("",!0)])}const O=d(W,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-0a3f8040"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/19.md","filePath":"drive/19.md"}'),G={name:"drive/19.md"},E=Object.assign(G,{setup(t){return(a,e)=>(i(),o("div",null,[c(O)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
