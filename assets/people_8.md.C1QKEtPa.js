In other words, I'm just musing.It's not necessarily the most apt(maybe....but it's possible because there's little else to cover things like this occurring over a massive populace), but the use of 'hysteria' is endlessly amusing to me, given some of the main demographics objection to the term.What they have isn't quite so much a delusion per se, delusion is a side effect but carries an association to or implication of innate mental problems.I mean, the ideology has built up this fiction of rationalizations over time, it's not something internally derived the way we think of \\"hearing voices\\" or manifestation of problems like delusion or hallucination, a biological or chemically induced defect or misfire.  I suppose one could say indoctrination, but that's so common a lot of people don't really stop to contemplate what it really means, and it's often more formal or organized (eg a cult or church)  While it is close to being a pseudo-religion, complete with zealots, prophets, sinners, etc etc....it's not quite as defined or refined.It is based in extreme misinformation, an artificially constructed world view that yields predictable results in people emotionally committed to the belief system.  The world view is built up over time with each new iteration of dysfunctional contributors which is why it gets worse and worse.It's the [allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) writ large across modern society.They are maladjusted to reality as it exists outside, being only familiar with the shadows on the cave and what they've been programed to think and say.Yes, they are delusional because they see the red book lying on the table and call it , \\"blue\\"....but it's an *acquired dysfunction*, from one mind to another with only the trading of ideas, a sort of psychologically viral, memetics.It's also the outward hysteria, the manic state that these people have in spades wwhich makes them behave and say bizarre and outlandish things.The freaking out because of an extreme emotional disturbance.So many ways it comes back around to \\"mass hysteria\\".../shrug","title":"\\"So when the leopards come, dont ask for help.

Now, I'm done. People I supported, all creeds, colors, whatever , poor whites I voted to raise my taxes for so they'd have better lives. The money given to organizations... And these same people still voted for trump - fking themselves, and me - come on down Christian Nationalism! When it happened again, and it was a majority vote, I snapped.  I  tried to explain an economic system that showed trump can't wave a magic wand and lower prices. That Biden was using the anti trust act to go after monopolies that were price gouging - not only the end user, but small businesses as well. And it angered them even more, I'm apparently an elitist. Too many words. Trump listened to us they said - yes, and he lied. Each of them have a different magical trump living in their heads who gave opposing promises. And scapegoats , innocent people scapegoated.

Which is it, are they failures responsible for their own screw ups, or is the blame laid at the feet of immigrants and trans people? And they said trump wasn't so bad - Was it just the price of eggs ( anyone remember the late 70s? It was so much worse!)  or did they take evangelical joy in a fire and brimstone preacher at a tent revival filling their hearts with delicious hate and fear and retribution? Hallelujah.

Because if not, there's no evidence that taxes will be lower for you. I don't think Trump has any plans to raise taxes specifically, but he's said repeatedly that he plans to implement across the board tariffs. He's also said he's going to deport roughly 20 million people from this country and has said he wants to take control of the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to zero. These three things are going to cause prices to skyrocket across the board. So taxes may not increase, but you'll be spending more on goods and services.You'll also be spending more on healthcare as Trump and the GOP are finally going to repeal Obamacare and make health insurance fully privatized again. Just look at what's happened in Britain for what that's going to be like here (much higher costs for people everywhere). Also we should expect with Elon promising to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget that most social safety nets like SS and Medicare will be gutted or eliminated. This will probably force retired people back into the workforce, which along with child labor will attempt to make up for the drastic worker shortage with tens of millions of workers being deported.Trump hasn't really detailed any plans to make the border stronger, other than simply deporting millions of people and making the punishments for coming here illegally extremely punitive, so I'll be curious if he actually tries to pass any legislation to \\"secure the border\\". Are you aware of any kind of legislation the GOP is planning to do that? Hard to speculate on what that will be like for ordinary Americans when there's no specific plan there.On top of that, expect man made climate change-fueled disasters to continue to destroy the lives of Americans everywhere, now that the person in charge thinks its a \\"hoax\\". Expect to be hassled needlessly by the police as Trump has demanded that \\"stop and frisk\\" be instituted across the country, with punishments for the cities and states who refuse. Expect emergency relief to be slow in coming if at all for disasters. Expect the war in Europe to escalate now that the US will not support NATO or oppose Putin's desire to try to recapture the rest of the former Soviet bloc. Expect roving violent right wing militias and gangs to emerge across the country, acting with impunity as Trump encourages them. Expect shootings to continue to go up everywhere. Expect people speaking out against Trump or protesting to be thrown into camps or deported if it's at all possible. Expect the Department of Education to be eliminated. Expect vaccines to become unavailable to anyone. Expect us to be extra vulnerable to another pandemic.It's going to be bad for everyone.

The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!","title":"What Donald Trumps Concealed Carry Reciprocity Means for Gun Rights"},{"text":"The military is already making sure every soldier is reminded (1) their oaths are to the Constitution and not the President and (2) they are prohibited from following illegal orders and, if nothing else, their superiors will make their service time a living hell if they do otherwise.","title":"Arizona AG says she won't drop state's fake electors case against Trump allies"},{"text":"So when IDF levels Gaza will Michigan Muslims blame Trump or Biden?","title":"Trump pulls off rare Republican win in Dearborn, the nations largest Arab-majority city"},{"text":"In 2013, Homan was promoted to executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations by President Barack Obama, who later awarded him a Presidential Rank Award for extraordinary accomplishment.https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/11/11/what-to-know-about-trumps-new-border-czar-tom-homan/A hard ass for sure but clearly Obama liked him.","title":"Trump expected to announce hes hiring Tom Homan, his former acting ICE director"},{"text":"We will discover in the near future that massive fraud occurred but it will be too late.","title":"Republicans Win Majority of US House Seats in Government Sweep"},{"text":"A win is a win.

The existence of a standing army is an even greater justification of an armed citizenry.\\"[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\\"\\n- Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28, January 10, 1788\\"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.\\"\\n- Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, October 10, 1787\\"This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty.... The right of self defense is the first law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\\"\\n- St. George Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, 1803\\"The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.\\"\\n- Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833\\"What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty .... Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.\\"\\n- Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, I Annals of Congress 750, August 17, 1789\\"If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.\\"\\n- Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28\\"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.\\"\\n- Tench Coxe, Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789The idea that the second amendment guarantees anyone the right to own firearms is a complete piece of fiction.

And blue-collar workers have been the biggest beneficiaries.An analysis published in July by economists at the Treasury Department found that the median worker can afford the same representative basket of goods and services as they did in 2019  plus have an additional $1,400 a year.The Consumer Price Index climbed about 21.7% between the four quarters of 2019 and the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2024. But over that same period, median weekly earnings, which include before-tax wages plus any commissions or tips, climbed 24%, for a gain of 2.3% beyond the inflation rate, the Treasury analysis found.At any rate, even as prices have climbed, the typical American household has weathered the storm: Foreclosures and bankruptcies, though theyve begun creeping upward, are beneath pre-pandemic levels.And once again, let us not forget how we got here: Trump's tax breaks for the rich that added trillions to the debt and had zero positive effect on the average worker, and his criminally negligent COVID response that started from his dismantling of our pandemic prevention unit several months before the virus hit China.","title":"How Kamala Harris Plowed Through $1 Billion and Still Lost to Donald Trump"},{"text":"It doesnt really work like that but whatever you want to think","title":"What Donald Trumps Concealed Carry Reciprocity Means for Gun Rights"},{"text":"Cops wont do it, national guard works for the governor.

The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!","title":"What Donald Trumps Concealed Carry Reciprocity Means for Gun Rights"},{"text":"The point is not for Ukraine to win it.

The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2C53.(a) The Amendments prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clauses text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2C22.(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Courts interpretation of the operative clause. The militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens militia would be preserved. Pp. 22C28.(c) The Courts interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28C30.(d) The Second Amendments drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30C32.(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Courts conclusion.

Finally!! oOMG!!! Thank you !!In the last 50 years a series of murders in Northern California where, what people thought was a lone killer, has been presented to the public as an unsolvable mystery..Teenagers on lovers lines were executed with gun fire from a silencer, some where murders with lives by a man in a costume calling himself the Zodiac.He literally, after one murder, walked to the victims car in a parking lot after the murders and took a felt pen  to carefully write the times, dates, and places of his other murders and then drove to a pay phone, called the cops and said , I just killed two people and told them were to find them, as if the murders were just a bitcoin payment for advertising..Subsequently, over the next 5 to 20 years and especially during the 3 year run of murder, this supposed lone killer wrote ciphers and cryptograms - and letters up to about 14 to 20 communications..50 years have gone by and local law enforcement is baffled and the FBI says they cant decode the stuff and the ones the press tells us the FBI has confirmed as cracked have no information..How in the F_CK, can you confirm a decryption of a cipher that you say has no information?No places, no names, no things, just a vague statement that I like killing and I have enough slaves ..All you could say is: it sounds like something a killer would say, right?They are lying to you and we have proof ..In one of the ciphers called the z408.. which they also said had no information, is a paragraph where several people are declaring themselves as members of the Zodiac..Not a single killer, but a group of people .. and in this paragraph they use code to identify themselves..One person got lazy and used a truncated version  of their very unique phone listing in the 1968 Vallejo telephone book .. It is exactly the same in the code as in the telephone book, he just removed a couple of letters ..The killer and the person who wrote the letters are two different people, and we know who he is..We can see his signature in all the letters. He is the person who has written the self published biography, in code of this murder clan, in writing and in pictures..The strange thing is, he was supposed to have died in 1971, in Las Vegas.. but we were able to get a hold of his official burial card..His sister was the respondent witness.. It says he has no middle initial when he does.. It says his place of birth is unknown, when its says his sister, who is about 3 years younger is suppose to be reporting this..It list his birth and death as the same day ..And it list the mortuary that got the burial permit in Los Angeles , when his grave is in Vallejo..He faked his death and may still be alive!We have everything about this guy but a photo. Its like hes a ghost !!We have looked everywhere!! And then we find this image ..So we posted to see if someone recognized him and the fight of the century has broken out over this sketch ..If its him, its the only known picture, with the signature of a member actually in a Zodiac communication, tied to a murder.This Pines Card actually contains the keys to all the Zodiac coding methods.. It also contains drawn images, that were hidden like this one of all the members ..You can crack every message they ever sent in code if you use and recognize the keys ?? in this communication..This dude outed everyone and the entire operation on this postcard and he signed it in about March of 1971.He faked his death in December of 1971. He gave them up!!But they never got arrested! He tried to turn states evidence and get a deal in Vallejo - but the cop that took his statement was told to never talk about him and his statement again ..The cop was an old school and took it to his grave..Once this dude realized that his partners were protected by God himself, he feared they are going to kill him .. and he was right..He has been dying to tell the truth but nobody would listen, because he wants revenge for the murder of Darlene Ferrin, who was his friend, and he contends he had no knowledge they, the others were going to kill her These are their wordsBut we dont have his picture..His name is Albert Lee Terry, Jr. supposed deceased December 1971..","title":"We are now approaching 48 hours of trolls fighting this image from Zodiac vs. one person asking why it may be so important.. that tells you all you need to know .. who is this man?"},{"text":"Not enough more likeImagine losing even after cheatingHuge skill issue there","title":"Lmao, they tried this shit again"},{"text":"I can see that pragmatically.

This is not a very realistic scenario for the most part.But if deception is proved on the accuser's part, they'd definitely pay damages and maybe do some time, how much of either depends whether they catch it before he goes to jail or not and how much time he spent there, other impacts it had etc. It should be proportional.Also, we can hope the men that raped him or murdered him in jail would get held accountable for that part of it, since that part was their doing not the accuser's.In cases where it's like a random man who got picked out of a line up after a woman's stranger rape (which yes, HAS happened), usually the state pays damages because it was not intentional deception on the woman's part, she was traumatized and remembered incorrectly when pushed into naming someone via pretty outdated investigation methods. This makes up most of the proven false rape convictions where the person was in prison for a long time that we hear about IIRC. The victims weren't lying, the rape happened but it was someone they didn't know and the wrong person got identified.And if burden of proof is substantially lowered such that it can be reasonably determined that a woman is bullshitting during the court proceedings (vs just not having \\"enough\\" evidence in a scenario where burden of proof is insanely high), she would have to pay him court costs and damages as appropriate and again maybe do SOME time or get probation although probably not much considering he didn't go to jail to get raped and murdered.Saying slander etc isn't AS bad as rape and almost never has consequences for the victim as bad as rape does in real-world scenarios doesn't mean no legal consequences for the perp if you can really prove it and doesn't mean they wouldn't be proportional to the impact on the accused's life, obviously.Please don't allow your panicky imagination to stand in the way of real victims getting justice for things done to them.Even your idea about what rape penalties should be is not very thought through in terms of possible real-world consequences for victims and subsequent justice for perps. It's not realistic.The post is literally about a man whose many sexual assault accusations haven't harmed his standing with 50% of the American public at all, never went to jail only had to pay some money from his massive wallet, proving my point and the article's point completely, and you're pearl clutching over hypotheticals.","title":"No one cares: Trump accusers feel his election win will prevent assault victims from coming forward"},{"text":"Whats a tariff?","title":"Republicans Win Majority of US House Seats in Government Sweep"},{"text":"McCathy was ousted by another Republican, hence the infighting.If a Democrat tried to oust Johnson, they'd vote down the motion in 30 seconds and absolutely nothing would have changed.","title":"Republicans win majority of US House seats in government sweep"},{"text":"On YouTube?","title":"Donald Trump Picks Tom Homan to Oversee Border Security, Deportations"},{"text":"Are Trumpers just willfully stupid?Did they forget what he did during his last term?Prices started skyrocketing in 2019.

We have laws, and when someone breaks the law (even if assisted by the US govt), then I would expect that person to reap the consequences of breaking the law.  Of course we treat people like human beings.  But we also have to enforce the law, or else we don't have a country.  We can deport people while also treating them like human beings.

He's definitely out and should be clearing his desk along with multiple directors and secretaries from several government agencies.

What these policies will do is give The Trump administration the authority to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field.Political junkies have known about this agenda for some time, and they've labeled it a potential \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Yes, part of the goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, but the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power and installs king Trump at its head.The unnerving part is that we don't just have Trump to worry about, we have his MAGA coalition to worry about, as they will certainly use this convenient opportunity to exploit Trump, the useful idiot he is, to build what can only be conceived of as a one-party state.The Trump administration also seems to be preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a role in these agencies.From there, they will have the best opportunity they've had in decades to implement an extreme, far right platform backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists.","title":"FBI Director Christopher Wray is preparing for a possible forced exit under Trump"},{"text":"Youre idiots who dont understand what hes saying.

But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most mischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those who had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were without influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.\\"- Machiavelli, Niccol.

If the dems wanted those peoples votes, then they knew exactly how to earn them and they chose not to. So they have only themselves to blame for not doing so. Either that or they genuinely couldnt earn those peoples votes because they genuinely couldnt stop Israel. And again if you believe nobody can stop Israel from carrying out its genocidal campaign, then you must necessarily also believe the election couldnt possibly make a difference for the Gaza voter.

Then there's the whole convicted felon, rapist, pedophile et al. And as we all know the vast majority of religious people haven't actually read their little book and don't really care about the morality it preaches, just how they can recontextualise it to exert control. So that's why. Simple most people don't care.

The German economy is currently in a deep crisis. Recently, the European Parliament voted in favor of a law that would allow refugees to be relocated evenly to all European countries because Germany couldn't handle it. It turns out that immigrants don't want to work. They only want to benefit from financial support. This has been their plan from the very beginning, which is clearly visible from the fact that after crossing the border, everyone heads straight to Germany, where social welfare is the highest in Europe. The current waves of immigrants are not beneficial to Europe in any way. It only burdens the budget and increases the number of crimes. If you saw what content is presented on Islamic TV channels in Europe... No one there even hides their hatred of European culture and Europeans. In youth tvshows, young people are suggested to fight the native population at every turn. In a few years, these young people will be irreversibly extremist, but no... it's the right wing that is radical.  you show a lack of deeper reflection, although I honestly admit that it is rather suspicious and I wonder if this is not intentional.

In the current legal system I think people should be cautious about false (or \\"false\\"/unprovable) accusations holding ANY penalty. Like I think if someone wants to bring a charge of false accusations against someone accusing them of rape, simply not having enough evidence to prosecute the rape should not be seen as evidence of lying. You should have to prove the deceitfulness and intent of the accusation separately. Otherwise the risk of being falsely accused of falsely accusing because you tried to get your rape prosecuted but couldn't clear the burden of proof hurdle, just prevents women coming forward.And even just conceptually, slander/filing false report/perjury etc is definitely bad, but violating someone's body sexually is like orders of magnitude worse and the impacts it has psychologically and sometimes physically are usually so much worse. So idk what penalty is most common for slander and similar crimes, but it should probably be something like that, and burden of proof for false accusations should also depend on burden of proof for rape.I don't really care what happens to rapists as far as extremity of the punishment, like I don't care if they do die or whatever, but I am skeptical of like automatic death penalty sentences etc. ONLY because I think it might incentivize rapists to get rid of the evidence after.  Like I think it might be unintentionally counterproductive and result in victims being killed.Also, the more severe the penalty the more reluctant I suspect people will be to acknowledge that what the accused did legally WAS rape, which still = no justice for victims at best and at worst, false accusations of false accusation that could lead to them incurring a disproportionately harsh punishment for a crime they did not even commit.At this point even consistent legal acknowledgement that that's what happened would be a step forward for victims.","title":"No one cares: Trump accusers feel his election win will prevent assault victims from coming forward"},{"text":"I think that's what Trump wants.

There is no greater stain on the soul of a person, no greater indication of a lack of basic humanity or morality, than the defense of genocide.

She realized at 21, after her husband finally became physically abusive, after years of emotional abuse and her parents supported her abuser that she was in a terrible situation and one night while he was out packed up her car with everything she could fit and drove 2000 miles away. It was a couple of years after her divorce that I rented a room off her. I lived with her for a year and during this year I went through the worst breakup of my life. One night while I was sitting in the living room talking to her and some friends of ours about it and I was just absolutely beside myself about it all, and she said you sound like you need breakup plates  Me break up plates? One of the things she packed when she left was the dinnerware she got for her wedding but she hated eating off it so much after she left, she got a new set. I guess dinner was one of the times her ex-husband would be the biggest asshole. She told me she kept the old set to smash whenever she got angry. But not just smash randomly  but kind of more like as a ritual. And I have to tell you this was one of the most calm put together young women Id ever seen. She was only 26 but she seemed much older than that. Not because of how she looked but because of how composed she was. She let me scream and cry and smash plates in her living room and I swear that did me more good in terms of my breakup and getting over my ex than anything else. I hope shes living her best life.  ?? \\nSmashing things in frustration (and not in a way to frighten people) is very underrated.","title":"I want to break stuff: Rage room bookings increase after Trump wins election"},{"text":"I hope america gets exactly what it asked for, unwittingly or not.","title":"Lets ask all the people Trump hasnt paid how fair he is"},{"text":"Leopards will feast!","title":"Lets ask all the people Trump hasnt paid how fair he is"},{"text":"People are worried about tariffs on slave labor produced (or byproduct of) Chinese goods that they cant seem to get enough of.

It's honestly pretty insane.Whereas if you judge based on overwhelming likelihood, it can be really obvious that the rape happened.Like just because it's theoretically possible that a 16 year old girl would choose to lose her virginity insanely drunk in a muddy ditch with a stranger in such a rough manner her vag got torn up doesn't mean it's in any way LIKELY. Be ACTUALLY reasonable.But you'll have this man's lawyers digging through her [fanfic.com](http://fanfic.com) account for smut she read when she was 14 that \\"proves\\" to half-male jurors or some conservative judge that she had always wanted dirty nasty kinky sex with a 30 year old man or something. And it will fly. And not only will she not get justice, her entire sexual history will have been dredged up while she was made fun of and retraumatized.Atm of course women are usually extremely hesitant to come forward in any significant way. Because they know, and if they try are repeatedly told very dismissively by police and lawyers and everyone else, that it probably will not go to court and if it does nothing will happen.Also even people she trusts will question her and make her feel like shit, and his buddies and family will tar her and support him unquestioningly, it won't hurt him at all.And then if she does come out with it publicly and they are unable to provide proof of something that happened with no witnesses (because of course that's how rape usually occurs), she might catch a false accusation charge herself on top of everything. Even though TRUE accusations don't usually seem to harm men at all and we now have plenty of examples of women getting hit with false accusation accusations only for it to be proven TRUE that they were raped much later. Like make it make senseBut people will balk at legalities somehow being revised in this way, because oh no, lower burden of proof, what if some man gets falsely held liable or convicted?Well that's unfortunately a possibility with all crimes and no one wants that to happen. But doing the utmost to avoid it with sexual assault DOES hamper almost all rape cases to the point of making prosecution like climbing Mt. Everest and does NOT prevent collateral damage to innocent people from how rape is handled by the system.  There is already a LOT of collateral damage being done by the way our legal system handles rape.It's just that right now that damage is carried pretty much entirely by victims and potential victims, who are later targeted by rapists that have gotten away with rape time and time and time again when they should have been held accountable.  And I at least am tired enough of this arrangement that I am fine with potential-accused (lbr most often men) sharing some of this burden of potential collateral.I had a man attempt to rape me once and after (yes, I was still in contact with him, it took me a while to process what he had done as it often does for women) he told me that he once raped another woman before me and when she tried to tell on him so many people supported him it made his business grow.And now a man that is a KNOWN rapist, who bragged about sexual assault and IIRC has the most assault accusations of any president before him (so he has probably done it plenty of times let's be real) is President of the US.It really fucking empowers them.  One way or another we NEED to find ways to hold these men accountable in some way even if it requires seriously rethinking how we handle sexual assault by law. In this case the law found him liable and even still it doesn't seem to fucking matter.

I think she would do great as a president, even if she personally hesitates or disagrees. I think she'd excel in a primary. But there's no getting away from the fact that the glass ceiling exists and the electorate at large, where their votes matter most for deciding who seats at the White House, are going to be less enthused purely on sexism alone.Idealistically we'd like to imagine it won't be a big deal, but this is the insidious thing about many, many ~isms: these implicit biases are often silent, pervasive, and natural. Someone who opens doors for women but not men may be seen as chivalrous, but it can equally be borne from a perspective of inequity. Countering these biases require active, persistent, intervention. There are a lot of people who proclaim they are above these implicit biases, but in reality they aren't. Self-proclamations of position are easy; actual behavior and speech require everyday, consistent effort.On the other hand, all this attention on the presidential seat misses out on all of the good people from all walks of life do across all arms of government, federal and state. If the Democrats had a Congressional majority for example, the looming despair of a Trump presidency may be weakened. Even having the House would be a remarkable aid (something that seems highly unlikely to happen given how the votes are tallying up). Our ideal caricature of a presidential candidate may have qualities that would disadvantage them electorally on the national stage, but this same caricature would be great for Congress, for state governorship, for city councils, for education boards.

State and Local Funding Models: Each state has its own funding formula for special education, which can include federal, state, and local sources. Some states provide additional funding specifically for students with disabilities.\\n2. Federal Funding: The federal government provides funding through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which covers a portion of the costs associated with special education. However, this funding typically covers only about 15% of the excess costs of educating students with disabilities.\\n3. Specific Needs of the Student: The amount can also depend on the specific needs outlined in the IEP. More intensive services (like one-on-one support or specialized programs) may require more funding.\\n4. School District Budget: Each school district has its own budget and resources, which can influence how much they can allocate for special education services.","title":"What to Expect From Trumps Next Term: More E.

In fact the most infuriating thing about the most recent SCOTUS decision is that it did nothing _except_ allow him to break the law. He is considerably more able to go out and shoot someone in the street, if he justifies it right, but has zero additional policy-making authority.Notably, while it protects him from prosecution, ever, for official acts, it does not make those acts lawful and doesn't change the fact that other members of the executive branch can and should refuse unlawful orders. Yes, the R-majority is razorthin but that's all they need to do whatever they wantThat \\"they' is hiding the issue here. Yes, if the entire Republican party unanimously wants to do something then they can do it, but that was also true in 2016. In fact it was more true in 2016. Right now they would have to be basically unanimous to do things because the most moderate 3-4 Republicans can block anything.Again, to repeat myself: there were 10 out of about 200 Republicans that voted to impeach Trump last time. Out of those, 2 are still in Congress. They _need_ those two guys to pass stuff now. Just like Anthony Kennedy we'll see them all inexplicabley retire or change opinionThe article you linked is very negative on your allegations, and in fact calls them a conspiracy theory. The actual situation here is that Kennedy was always a Republican even if that was easy to forget while he was the moderate Republican swing vote on the court. Of course he wanted a Republican to replace him. Mark my words, there will be numerous suspicious defenestrations, poisonings, convenient suicides and disappearances of Trumps enemies!I would no joke bet you $10,000 that this doesn't happen. Trump isn't Putin and can't be Putin for a variety of reasons, including that mysterious disappearances would be investigated by state governments who are often not friendly to Trump, that the American government unlike the Russian government relies a lot more on clear positions of true authority like governors and senators that would look mega-suspicious to eliminate, and that often eliminating people in those positions allows their party to decide how to replace them so it doesn't even do the thing you'd want it to do. Plus the fact that US government officials, again, can refuse illegal orders, so he'd have to do this himself.TL;DR the President is not a king no matter how much Trump would like to be, and the many other sources of power in the US system would not like him trying to kill them.The reason I'm very frustrated by this sort of conspiracizing and catastrophizing is that there's all sorts of bad things in the policy arena that Trump can definitely, legally, do, and talking about dictatorial shit he can't actually do distracts from our ability to do anything about that stuff. This is the sort of stuff that he actually did last time and is the actual concrete reason why he was a bad president.If he wants to impose a 100% tariff on anything from China the day he enters office, he is absolutely allowed to do that, and it would definitely crash the economy if he did. It's unlikely he jumps to there immediately but it is very likely he imposes a significantly higher tariff than is already the case. And he already raised tariffs last time.If he wants to make it the FBI's number one priority to deport undocumented immigrants, again, he is definitely legally allowed to do that.If he wants to pardon all his cronies for all the various crimes they did during his past administration, black-and-white in the Constitution he can do that. It's also possible that he could pardon himself for his own past crimes, and it's with this sort of thing that the Republican SCOTUS actually does matter.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"I just hope the late nite TV gets reformed.

I believed our democratic institutions would make it difficult for fascism or socialism to take root. I understood the appeal of Trumps ideas about the economy; it was, indeed, riggedrigged for those in the top 1 percent. The primary was brutal. Hillarys campaign accused us of being sexist and racist for disagreeing with Hillarys pro-corporate and pro-war positions, and the media labeled us Bernie Bros. We were silenced. But we had a coalition of working-class peopleBlack, Latino, and whitewho were energized. Yet pompous Democratic consultants believed the only way to win was to capture elusive suburban Republican men and women repulsed by Trumps rhetoric, assuming working class Black and Latino men would vote Democratic regardless of Hillarys platform. We believed the DNC suppressed our votes (and voice), handing the nomination to Wall Street Hillary, who then ran on an identity politics platform and unsurprisingly lost. Im still bitter about it to this day. And after Trump captured the coalition we had in our grasp in 2016, Im even more bitter. The Democrats ran another identity-politics-driven campaign, led by out of touch consultants beholden to giant corporations and Wall Street, now chasing the elusive Liz Cheney vote. Routed. Now, members of the press who once dismissed us as Bernie Bros are saying he was right all along. Its maddening. This was the closest Ive ever come to voting Republican. Ethically, I couldnt bring myself to do it, but I could sense which way the tide was turning.","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

Heck, if they want, just start in the red states sending state, local, and federal level agents door to door, business to business, and grab anyone even remotely Latino.

Sure, there will be a million lawsuits, but if they can get just a one seat majority of SCOTUS to be down with it, at a minimum they can drag those cases on for well over a year. This is his core campaign promise, and the core focus of numerous advisors. They have had years to plan this, and this may be their one chance. They are going to do everything possible to pull it off.Civil rights will be violated. State and local laws will be violated. The POTUS is not immune for official acts, and he has already discussed using the Alien and Sedition Act to pursue this.My stance is to believe them when they say they will do this. This is a White House with an extremely hardcore white Christian nationalist contingent. Id be willing to bet that if you went down the line of the people there, and asked what their top priority is it would be this. It wouldnt be inflation.

This put unnecessary regulations and hindered farmers and agriculture.\\nHis rollback really gave more of a say to the individual states. He didnt just remove regulations for no reason.

Majority were pro-monarchy and even saw King George  III favorably, at least, prior to Revolutionary War starting.If you pay attention to the pre-war slogans, you'll realize that in the first place, the colonies didn't want to be free from Britain, they wanted a place at the table, namely, parliament. In effect, the core demand was that the new world colonies be given parliamentary seats and be brought more formally into the empire as proper states of it rather than simply \\"colonies\\". By a certain perspective, the war against Britain was over the actions of *parliament* not necessarily King George III, who (British parliament) were the ones that levied the majority of the unpopular taxes.By the time that the Revolutionary War ended, the majority of the founding fathers were still pro-monarchy but not pro-British monarchy; and indeed, they tried to seat George Washington as a true king, and if you examine the day one constitution(s, actually, can't forget the Articles of Confederation), without the bill of rights or any amendment that have come after, effectively an elective aristocracy backing it. It was *Washington* who pressured the rest of the congress, to establish a presidential system instead; and it was many many centuries of work until we fully dismantled the elective aristocracy, work that didn't finish until the early 20th century.By all accounts: the founding fathers wanted a constitutional monarchy, with an elective aristocracy under a Republic framework (read: the classical kind of Republic, like the Roman Republic). In effect, arguably, day one America was not by any means, a democracy, even with the presidential system that Washington forced the congress to accept.We arguably didn't become a Democracy in real terms until the 14th amendment basically formally codified and expanded the right to vote to all men of at least 21 years of age. While it was chiefly concerned with safe guarding the rights of former slaves, its secondary benefit was breaking the power of the landed elite (American aristocracy) by basically ensuring non-land owning males also could vote as well more generally (so in effect, a lot of poor white men were also enfranchised by this as well).","title":"Warren: Trump transition already breaking the law"},{"text":"True.","title":"Trump picks Lee Zeldin to run EPA"},{"text":"No, Dems should mean it","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

Since there was no federal army, the militia was the defense of the colonies. Later a federal army was added and so there was no need for the citizen militia. And state national guards have armories for a reason, no need to store your musket at home. So the second amendment, like the third amendment, no longer had any relevance once there was a federal army. It's a leftover bit of trivia from long-outdated circumstances. And you don't hear people screaming about the third amendment.The idea that the second amendment guarantees anyone the right to own firearms is a complete piece of fiction. Or at least it was until 2007, when the corrupt supreme court turned that fiction into reality, despite the constitution obviously (for several reasons) not supporting it.But all kinds of people buy deeply into the fiction across the political spectrum. People buy into it not just because it's been drummed into them their whole lives, but because they want to buy into it. Like Trumpers buying into Fox News telling them that Antifa has burned entire cities to the ground. They want to believe. From the angriest redneck Republican to even Bernie Sanders.Turns out nobody ever needed the constitution to own firearms the whole time. Not that the constitution matters anymore, it has been completely shredded by the corrupt illegitimate supreme court.

It does, insofar as showing support, but it isn't really going to matter.Sadly, what this means is what matters is courting the voters in the battleground states. And as much as we'd hope voters at large are above making decisions on something as basal as race and ethnicity and gender, the objective reality is this is not true.And therefore, Newsom is never going to successfully shed his California background. He'll have to win in spite of it if he ultimately becomes the presidential candidate, and that already puts him at a disadvantage.It _sucks_, don't get me wrong, that we have to filter out competent people because their background and history paints a large target on their back, but this is unfortunately reality: when the electorate cannot be trusted to think past their basal human instincts, success does not involve banking on them to think past their basal human instincts. It must be appealed to, because unfortunately we've now gotten to a point where one political party has to win because the other has completely abandoned all responsibility and diligence to the ethos of the country at large.And this is why the Democrats as a political group is ever so threadbare and on the precipice of everything. There is a consistent struggle between doing what is right: meritocracy, opportunity, representation, equity, and what is needed. Sadly doing what is needed will turn some subset of voters away, who will abdicate their participation in these critical civic moments, and the Democrats will continue to chase after what is needed, taking gambles and risks along the way because at this point every decision is a calculated gamble.","title":"Trump can keep campaign promises or be popular.

And in fact we need to turn to non-electronic, non-computer methods to do that.**  At the same time, that is about possibility, about vulnerability that may exist in future elections...\\"So, the first point is exactly what I'm saying, for the long term security of all future elections - make sure that they're verifiable by the public and move to non-electronic, non-computer methods.  To Professor Halderman's second point, that video was of course made before this particular election.  I think the hand recounts in the precincts with bomb threats as Spoonamore suggested would be wise, in addition to other risk-limiting audits.I don't think you fully appreciate the geopolitical reality, the stakes, the incentives, and the scale of resources available to Trump (a convicted felon trying to stay out of prison), Musk (the richest man in the world probably, potentially compromised), Putin (another contender for the richest man in the world that we know of), Thiel (another obscenely wealth oligarch who founded Palantir), and the GOP.  They would certainly have been able to learn from the Dominion voting machines they acquired through discovery after 2020, and were telegraphing their intentions to implement Russian-style oligarchy/kleptocracy with \\"elections\\" instead of elections.   While it doesn't make sense to believe anything without evidence, it would be insane to just assume that the election was totally secure based on blind trust, given all the **known vulnerabilities** of electronic/computerized voting and tabulation machines even prior to the election.  The pager attack earlier this year came as a surprise to a lot of people, too, but that's how security breaches work, and how war works.

But what trump has proposed is a blanket tariff on all countries of like 20% and like 60% on China specifically. They should be used surgically. Not as a wrecking ball. Furthermore he wants to just straight up remove income tax and rely on tariffs to generate revenue which is insane. Well lose the like $3 trillion of revenue income taxes bring in. Simultaneously he plans on deporting a large portion of the work force. Say what you want about illegal immigrants but they prop up entire economic sectors. This will cause those sectors immense losses of not collapse. Meanwhile the tariffs will cause a loss of international trade as our former trade partners seek other countries as a solution. For those arguing it will bring back domestic manufacturing how exactly? It takes years if not decades to set up supply chains, build new factories, and hire skilled workers, and thats not even considering we cant compete with the labor pool of other countries like China since they have such a population advantage and low wages. Also as a consumer based economy we dont produce all that much and we dont necessarily have the resources to produce things even if we did have factories to do so. Where are we getting rare earth metals for computer chips? Most American lumber is too soft for building lots of things. So now we have to rapidly advance these industries while facing an economic crisis on at least two front with prices of goods going through the roof.Oh and btw the deportation is going to cost us an arm and a leg to implement too. Spending federal funds on expanding ice and doing things like conducting workplace and housing raids. Not only does that mean increasing the amount of agents and paying them salary health care pensions etc but also training and recruitment, then facing the endless onslaught of lawsuits from states, individuals and workplaces for conducting immigration raids. Even after that? You have to detain these people while figuring out where to repatriate them as guess what? Lots of countries wont accept them. So we have semi permanent housing camps. You gotta feed and clothe them while they wait. Then when you finally get a country to accept them, you have to charter flights to get them out. Now repeat this process every single day for at least one presidential term. And you still wont have deported everyone. This is OBSCENELY expensive. This is economic suicide were heading for and extreme hardship if they even implement part of their plans. And thats not even considering the darkest implications of what happens if the administration decides theres just no money to keep these people alive.","title":"What Trumps mass deportation plan would mean for immigrant workers and the economy"},{"text":"FDR put a bunch of Americans into camps.
