Trump didn't expect to win in 2016 and was completely unprepared for the transition. Reportedly on the first visit of the team to the White House, Jared Kushner asked how many of the West Wing staff would stay with the new administration. The answer was a blank stare and \\"none\\". Trump's campaign staff literally had no clue what a presidential transition was. In the end, the GOP machinery did its part, and RNC chair Reince Priebus became chief of staff. Trump was apparently fond of appointing generals to his cabinet. These people were not MAGA wingnuts, and Trump ended up tweeting his frustrations with them before firing them. And before trying to have his vice president, also an establishment Republican, killed. Anyway, the point is that there were some sort of adults in the room, along with the wingnuts, at least in the beginning of the administration.This time around, the adults need not apply, and the ones who got burned by the experience the last time around, wouldn't anyway. On top of that, Trump's dementia has advanced eight years since 2016. He's incoherent, and even less able (if that's possible) to keep up with briefings etc. He's absolutely not interested in world matters, unless they're about him and his money. He's both more unpredictable and more easily manipulated than he was in 2016. Elon Musk seems to be taking full advantage of that, and the Heritage Foundation people before him. You can see it from the appointments that have been announced so far. It'll be all MAGA wingnuttery and Elon's favorite talents like J.D. Vance.","title":"As Donald Trump staffs up for second term, only MAGA loyalists need apply"},{"text":"A spokesperson for DeSantis told NPR that businesses are still free to hire immigrants, as long as its done legally.I agree with this and all Americans should.","title":"He Went To A White Supremacist Event.

This is a desire you're not going to be able to remove so easily.The problem with just pointing out that they can't do it is that you've offered no alternative as to how you can carry out mass deportations better.The desire is still there. And they'd rather vote for even the hope that it happens, rather than it not happening at all.You have to couple that with a counterpoint about why mass deportations are a good thing and try to shift their beliefs. But that's where things get more difficult because your counterpoint has to align with their worldview for them to accept it.Take the average European on the right for example. They do not care if deportations damages the economy (albeit maybe it does, temporarily). They care about their own national identity being eroded. As someone on the left, you'd have to connect mass immigration to national identity in a way that supports their current view of national identity.It's why left wing parties are already trying to do this by reframing the country's values as a tolerant, accepting country. They actually are already employing the best strategy that would counter the pro-remigration parties.But it's unlikely to work anyway because the whole right-wing wave isn't manufactured. It's a direct consequence of mass migration and its failure to work. It won't suddenly continue to work so as it accelerates and more tensions build up, more people come to this view as a natural consequence of the migration in the first place.You solve the \\"far right\\" problem by solving the migration problem. It's only a reaction to the current situation. It's why I don't think the left can ever win on this issue as migration continues to accelerate.","title":"CMV: Left-wing parties should challenge right-wing parties on mass deportation (because right-wing parties can't actually do it)"},{"text":"It was real smart voting for the man that wanted a Muslim ban first time in office.","title":"Fiercely pro-Israel former Trump critic Elise Stefanik is new UN ambassador"},{"text":"Republicans initially demanded that foreign aid be tied to domestic border security measures, and the Senate responded with a bipartisan bill that included funding for border patrol and additional immigration judges.

In addition to their main academic studies, students attend lectures, seminars, and debates at MCC facilities; during holidays, they travel together for recreational trips, during which they learn about Hungarian history. Finally, as students approach graduation, MCC administrators connect them with internships and jobs at think tanks, academic institutions, private companies, government agencies, and foreign-exchange programs.The intention of MCC is to create a new national elite. During my time in Hungary, I spoke at the MCC campuses in Budapest and Debrecen. As one MCC administrator explained, the government was making a massive, multibillion-dollar bet that it could train thousands of students to develop deep civic loyalties to the country and eventually take over its political, economic, and social institutions. The students I met at MCC were impressive: fluent in multiple foreign languages, studying a wide variety of liberal and technical fields, and optimistic about Hungarys future. Most, but not all, were conservative; every one of them described the MCC program as open to spirited political and philosophical debate. And, they told me, the MCC centers also served as an informal marriage market.https://christopherrufo.com/p/viktor-orbans-culture-warYou may remember Chris Rufo as one of the people DeSantis tapped to manage the transformation of New College.After they have created a national university, perhaps the government will create a company offering Americans cruises and resort vacations.","title":"Dismantling the Department of Education?

Think they managed to thread that needle, but it might have been a bit awkward.  The theme of the season seemed to be a lot about that balance between an overly protective/oppressive mothering instinct trying to keep things sane/grounded (or \\"white\\"), vs a more mystical/dangerous/primal/spiritual way of thinking that was clearly coded in the natives.  That played out in the main character in a microcosm with her adoptive mother relationship, but in True Detective fashion it was also kinda just the world events at large.I really wanted to like the true detective season 4, and I wouldn't even say it was bad, like I don't regret watching it, but I do think they missed opportunities including with the native shit.I guess the way season 2 got convoluted with too many characters, season 4 took on too much esoteric stuff.","title":"Trump overwhelmingly won native American votes, 64%"},{"text":"I dont think any party is anti legal immigration or legal immigrants last I checked.","title":"Opinion | Why Trumps Deportations Will Drive Up Your Grocery Bill (Gift Article)"},{"text":"They deep sixed Forrest Mimms as a contributor back in the day because he has a faith.

Also, those migrant workers spend money locally for food and supplies, and often rent, so removing them from the local economy only serves to blow a large hole in that local economy. The three states that already tried this experiment suffered devastating consequences to their agricultural sector because local workers wanted to keep their regular jobs, often easier and better paying jobs. Untold millions of dollars in crops rotted in the fields and in the orchards.If you were an enemy of the USA and wanted to wreck our country, the easiest way to do it would be to eliminate foreign labor, documented or otherwise.

I encountered a woman during a spring retreat this yearan influencer, which I think is relevantwho insisted on making a mountain out of a molehill, apparently whenever she got bored. She reduced two separate people to tears after berating them about whatever insensitive thing they said about her cause of the week (it happened to be transphobia at the time). How do I know? Because then she went to the cohorts group chat and scolded everyone at the retreat for not doing anything about these offensive comments, which were made in front of us (and werent actually offensive).The kicker? This was a DEI retreat. Everyone gave her the benefit of the doubt from the beginning, but by the second incident we walked away hating her guts.And this isnt anything new. Its basically just bullying. But if you see someone get viciously bullied for mouthing off to the wrong person, or owning cheap clothes, or having a crappy haircut, or whatever, youre going to make sure you keep your head down, buy nice clothes, and get stylish haircutseven if most of the people you encounter ARENT bullies. But this a space where its really easy for bullies to hide, because when the majority of society wants, for example, trans people gone or dead, trans activists HAVE to be aggressive. Theres a fine line between standing up for yourself and bullying in actual practiceat what point is it justified sensitivity versus clear intention/power-tripping?Anyway, thanks for being a reasonable person in your interactions with people. In general, I think people should assume that most others are like youespecially if they have only read internet stories like minebut I see why people get hesitant if theyve even experienced something similar.","title":"AOC Directly Addresses People Who Voted For Both Her And Trump"},{"text":"Its quite impressive how quick they come up with their new excuse.","title":"Trump flips border county that hasn't voted for Republican in over 100 years with massive 76-point swing"},{"text":"And skirts the actual process of having any real checks and balances.","title":"Warren: Trump transition already breaking the law"},{"text":"Those people might not matter anymore.

Elon Musk isn't JUST a celebrity anymore. He's not even a tech CEO or business entrepreneur.He's a billionaire, mining and tech magnate has positioned himself dangerously close to the incoming President of the United states. He has a track record of volatile and unpredictable behaviour, he's got confirmed ties to Vladimir Putin and seems to have an unprecedented level of access to political Intel for a civilian in the private sector. And this is a man who's had a string of failed relationships, familial dramas and fall outs with his children. While not all of the above may be his fault per se, it does speak volumes to his ability to tackle complex issues, resolve interpersonal problems and handle relationships with others. All key skills in the political arena.His erratic notions and behaviours are of public concern because he's put himself in a position to influence the public. Despite never being elected by said public to do so. So now that he's put himself on that stage of politics, his personal life, his business decisions, his family dramas *are* a matter of public interest.The man could very well have access and authority to shape the financial futures of the nation, you should pay attention to someone with that power over you. Because the time may come where people need to make an informed decision about whether or not they consent to be ruled over by a man that doesn't have the temperament and interpersonal skills to handle leadership.","title":"Elon Musk's Transgender Daughter Says She Will Leave the U.S. After Donald Trump's WinAmid Dad's Plans for $35 Million Family 'Compound'"},{"text":"\\"Law\\"Stop saying this word.

More than 5,500 children of immigrants were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018 under the administration's short-lived \\"Zero Tolerance\\" policy. According to the Department of Homeland Security, as of April, there were still 1,401 children without confirmed reunification.Trump signed an executive order stopping family separations in June 2018 after much condemnation from lawmakers and the public, and the Biden administration officially rescinded it days after President Biden took office in 2021.Homan retired in frustration in 2018 when the White House failed to move his nomination toward Senate confirmation, according to the Washington Post. He became a Fox News contributor, joined the conservative Heritage Foundation as a visiting fellow and contributed to Project 2025, its controversial blueprint for reshaping the federal government. Trump had sought to distance himself from Project 2025 during his campaign, even though it overlaps with his own agenda. Trump made immigration a major part of his campaign and has vowed to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country without authorization.Homan spoke about how such deportations would work in an interview on Fox Sunday Morning Futures hours before his appointment was announced, saying it would be a \\"well-targeted, planned operation, conducted  by the men of ICE.\\"\\"When we go out there we're gonna know who we're looking for, we most likely know where they're going to be and it's gonna be done in a humane manner,\\" Homan said, adding that it will focus on the \\"public safety threats and the national security threats first.\\"But those groups won't be the only targets, Homan told CBS' 60 Minutes last month. He said he would restart workplace enforcement after the Biden administration moved away from the controversial practice of mass worksite immigration raids in favor of pursuing \\"exploitative employers.\\" He also said in that interview that \\"families can be deported together,\\" suggesting children who are U.S. citizens but with undocumented parents would have to go with them.","title":"What to know about Tom Homan, the former ICE head returning as Trump's 'border czar'"},{"text":"Anyone whos ever been to a grocery store knows already.","title":"Why Trumps Deportations Will Drive Up Your Grocery Bill"},{"text":"Kinda crazy that Biden didn't enact cannabis reform during his administration.

The Gulf states have no issues finding millions of desperate people to sign up. So really it's just a matter of how much consideration or stake host countries want to give immigrants out of principle. The answer for Trump and the GOP is very little to none.The right wing goal isn't to completely eliminate immigration, it is to get the benefits of workers while minimizing the costs and side effects. The solution to this is to keep immigrants from being treated as full fledged members of society or having a path to permanent residency. For instance, there is a lot of talk about filling demographic holes with immigration... But permanent immigration doesn't fix that, it makes the underlying issue worse and kicks the can down the road. What does solve the issue is foreign workers who leave when they get old themselves. This is the direction the right wants to move in: treating immigrants more as resources to be used up than as people to be integrated.From an amoral perspective allowing large scale illegal immigration while treating those immigrants as poorly as possible with no path to citizenship is the most practical approach. It's the best of both worlds for the country (at the expense of the immigrants). The left doesn't really have a counter to this beyond calling it cruel, they've backed themselves into a corner.","title":"CMV: Left-wing parties should challenge right-wing parties on mass deportation (because right-wing parties can't actually do it)"},{"text":"We would still have to import foreign oil. 60% from Canada.

Illegal immigration means that the US government has very little control and documentation on who's coming in, and life as an undocumented immigrant is absolutely less than ideal; however, it's notoriously hard to immigrate legally, so many feel they don't have much of a choice. If we could theoretically allow, for example, two million people a year to receive green cards (roughly twice the current rate) and have a slightly more restrictive asylum policy, I think illegal border crossings would drop massively, reducing the number of deportations in turn.  \\nI would agree that a lot of conservatives aren't actually capable of mass deportations, but I do think they're capable of regulating immigration, ideally by expanding access to green cards and citizenship.","title":"CMV: Left-wing parties should challenge right-wing parties on mass deportation (because right-wing parties can't actually do it)"},{"text":"Betting against America never works.

But it is (was) a democracy.AOC did something interesting. She asked people who voted for Trump at the top of the ticket and dems down ballot what their rationale was. The notion that \\"we haven't had a democracy for some time now\\" is exactly what jumped out in the answers I read. People feel powerless and felt like the system needed a disruption, and Trump had to be the answer. In this case, I fear that the fatalism was actually... fatal. Trump doesn't give the common person MORE power, he redistributes it to the already powerful.Personally, I feel like the most important issue this whole time was widely ignored: the Supreme Court. It will take a lifetime to undo the damage once Trump appoints Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's replacements. We saw them reverse protections for voter's rights, abortion, the ability of the Executive Branch to enact and oversee federal agencies, campaign finance reforms, and they made president's immune (but only for official acts, and they get to decide what's official on a case by case basis). Where do you think they are going to fall on worker's rights? Minimum wage? And other matters that should be a concern to the working and middle class?You have to vote like it matters.

Progressive liberal. Ive spent my life feeling so bad for the less fortunate, the weak, vulnerable and people living on the margins in our society and tried to do everything I can for the people in those situations, including using my vote and educating everyone in my circle about the importance of taking care of the less fortunate and how a rising tide lifts all boats.

I tried my best, my whole adult life, to fight for your demo, while being equally embarrassed,\\nthat my own had such privilege. I wanted a country where privilege was extended to us all (As Americans!) and I was dedicated to doing my small part and living my life with that intent. But you have spoken loudly with your votes. Trump was not an unknown. His positions are very clear and have been his whole life. The party he leads does not embrace any segment of the population that is not completely aligned with their values, views, religion, tax bracket and MOST importantly, race.

Im sure Im not alone. For me, the real irony of it all, is this. By siding with Trump and MAGA (by protest voting, not showing up or outright supporting the right for whatever reason you eventually chose), not only did you vote against your own interests, but maybe more importantly, you dealt a massive blow to the spirit of a significant portion of the people that actually have been going to bat for the ideals you believe in so deeply yourselves. \\nThe people standing behind your causes are diminishing by the day, at your own request","title":"Trump expected to announce Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy"},{"text":"Don't know if most people know this there's been plenty of immigrant workers before Trump and after Trump.

Trump already backed Herbster in the primary but went all-in after the women told their story, dramatically escalating his support for Herbster.This points to why misogynists and abusers seek each other out, beyond just having shared interests. They prop each other up in the gross belief that it's really cool to be a man who hurts women. In defending each other, they create a politically powerful solidarity. Untold numbers of men who have gone MAGA have done so mainly because they hate women. They love the validation of having leadership who agrees with their pro-violence-against-women stance. They also recognize that they have more power together than they would if they stood alone. https://archive.ph/J2USo","title":"No one cares: Trump accusers feel his election win will prevent assault victims from coming forward"},{"text":"They are talking about weed not tobacco.

While the US does let in huge numbers of asylum seekers, both parties have also been engaging in mass deportations as well. Immigration is actually more of a bi-partisan issue in the US than you think And even when it comes to asylum seekers, a lot of Democrat controlled states who have been hosting asylum seekers don't even want them in their state anymore. I am not even really sure what your view actually is here. The Democrats and left wing parties should argue they need immigration for the economy? Have they not already been saying this? Even if it's true, this argument doesn't land with people at all. Even a lot of the Democrats and Democrat voters are more \\"right wing\\" on immigration than you realize. Plus you factor in that Democrat administrations have already been doing mass deportations for decades I mean if anything Trump got criticized in his first term for not being hard enough on immigration.

The 1923 spinoff also shows some (brutal) depictions of the residential school system which have been covered very little by mainstream media.  So yeah - there's propaganda, cuz everything is propaganda, but like 80% of it can still be pretty well done and a positive influence.I watched that True Detective season too - quite liked it actually.  Though I admit the native stuff seemed to fall to the background a bit for me.   I think they walked a bit of a tightrope there because (spoilers ahead) they both needed to make the native tribe of the region the antagonist ultimate killers but also sympathetic enough to be understood and sided with.  Think they managed to thread that needle, but it might have been a bit awkward.  The theme of the season seemed to be a lot about that balance between an overly protective/oppressive mothering instinct trying to keep things sane/grounded (or \\"white\\"), vs a more mystical/dangerous/primal/spiritual way of thinking that was clearly coded in the natives.  That played out in the main character in a microcosm with her adoptive mother relationship, but in True Detective fashion it was also kinda just the world events at large.I think they were going for something profound there, and it kinda landed but clearly not perfectly.  Hard to do when you're layering that many themes on top of each other (there are obviously straight/gay and masculine/feminine layers on that too), and inevitably sorta cramming a culture into a metaphorical role.  Still - a lot of native stars and screentime, and shows a slice of a realistic town where everyone lives together, without particularly egregious depictions one way or another - probably still a positive.","title":"Trump overwhelmingly won native American votes, 64%"},{"text":"And he won all swing states with like 1% or so more than Kamala....Hmm....It's like their moto this time was  'cheat but don't overdo it'.","title":"Holy shit: Trump voter says, 'I consider him like Hitler, but I voted for the man.'"},{"text":"I'm assuming he chose the bad makeup.","title":"Pick-me Trumpers are a problem"},{"text":"When running against a Nazi who wants to be dictatorWhen you're doing that, you probably shouldn't run as a Nazi who wants to genocide Palestinians","title":"Its okay, Trump will stop the conflict now. /s"},{"text":"Sieg Hiel Chucko!

Id hardly express that as most Americans IRL even if technically true it makes it seem like it isnt even close.Theres also a massive difference between deporting illegal immigrants overall and mass deportation. In general almost everyone is against illegal immigration, but at the same time when people are brought here as babies and live here for 20 years, rounding them all up and mass deporting them to a country theyve never even lived in or been old enough to know does not benefit us, its just about cruelty and there should be a path to formally getting citizenship rather than just blindly deporting them because their parents brought them over as kids.In general the differences are republicans largely want to stop all immigrants except from a few good countries or unless you have enough money to buy your way in. Democrats want to expand and streamline the process for gaining legal citizenship so we can better organize and regulate our legal immigration rather than cracking down and deporting everyone everywhere that didnt go through the absurd hoops that are required today.Elon and Milania were both actually illegal immigrants at one point. Both had to lie on their visa applications that they werent, but both had enough influence/connections and money to skip ahead anyways. I personally dont really have a problem with trying to better include people in those situations to legally get residency and citizenship, but if youre going to crack down on it, it should apply to everyone including the rich.","title":"Trumps border tsar vows to override states who block mass deportation plans"},{"text":"I agree.

Mandatory expenditures made up about 60% of the 2023 fiscal year budget. Mandatory expenditures are things like paying interest on the national debt, social security, and medicare and because congress controls the purse strings, congress would need to make cuts to those expenses, it's not something the executive branch can just do unilaterally. Not saying it's impossible to do that, but I think most republicans know it's a bad idea to cut benefits of their older constituents.The remaining expenditures are discretionary, but are still decided on by congress via appropriations. Again, not something the executive branch can just do unilaterally. Cutting 2 trillion from the discretionary expenses would be things like NASA, subsidies, contracts with companies like Space X, Military spending (which companies like L3Harris and Lockheed might have a problem with having cut) including maintenance of bases around the world, keeping satellites from falling out of the sky, paying service members, Bureau of Land Management (which oversees things like leases of public land for cattle ranchers), etc.The executive branch comes up with a budget proposal which is then debated and negotiated in the legislature. The funding for mandatory expenses is largely laid out by law and while the executive branch can suggest changes, it is ultimately congress that would have to make that change. and that's 60% of the budget. So a 2 trillion dollar cut without congress ransacking SS and medicare would mean eliminating massive swathes of federal agencies and the military.It's a pipe dream. Pipe nightmare, maybe.

Btw I believe Hillary was a stronger candidate than Kamala and have my own criticisms of Kamala- very many and didn't think she made a solid argument for herself.

Their actions speak just as loud as the nonsense they spew justifying their actionor inaction for not showing up. Too many people pretending they were progressive are happy to see the Ds lose.

Wildly undereducated voters- most voters (despite what top democrat brass thinks) consume news *exclusevely* from social media. Trumps team was much more active in this space, and while what he was saying to them was largely complete lies, it unfortunately reached more people than Kamalas message.  2.) The benefit of a perceived bad economy- circling back to number 1, he convinced 74 million Americans that the president actually sets the prices of goods sold on the private market.  Total lie, but they were convinced nonetheless.  3.) Absolutely *massive* political interference by Elon Musk-    And to such a degree that it *should* be at least investigated by the FBI.  Not saying it was anything that would definitely be found inherently illegal but every single person that I know that still has Twitter, was shown almost exclusively right-wing white nationalist propaganda via the Twitter algorithm.  And these people had *never* interacted with that type of content ever.  All those combined and likely more, led to a lot of people believing that the fear behind Trumps terrible words was largely propagated by the left and that it was fake news.

If they say the wrong thing, they get torn to pieces. They have to be perfect.

Poverty is of course a major factor in gang activity and crime in general, because for many young men, they feel it's the only escape.

Youre implying that German Jews scheming or morally flexiblewilling to adopt any ideology for self-preservation or advantageand that only historical happenstance of the Nazis being anti Jewish prevented that here.Secondly, youre fundamentally misunderstanding the Nazis. It wasnt historical happenstance that the Nazis were antisemitic. There wasnt really a someone else. the Nazis could have gone after in the same way Antisemitism is a very particular form of hate because its a conspiracy theory about Jewish power and influence, not just hateit has a political dimension that the Nazis were a part of. Further, Jews had already been dehumanized and massacred and oppressed across Europe for 2,000 yearsthe Nazis could only have created Naziism on the back of this antisemitism. There were others the Nazis hated, like queer people and Slavs, but they hated them on the basis of being a Jewish invention in the case of homosexuality and Jewish puppets in the case of Slavs. The basis of their ideology was antisemitism.The Holocaust isnt like, a moral parable where you can slot where you can slot any given minority in the position of the Jews. It happened particularly and deliberately to Jews. The dehumanization and antisemitism went too deep into European institutions and European identity and self conceptions about nationalism and scientific racism. I dont like this the German Jews would have joined the Nazis if the Nazis werent antisemitic because A, the Nazis would never have been Nazis if they werent antisemitic, and B, the overwhelming majority of Jews, German or not, would never have joined a movement like that and it has uncomfortable implications to say they would have.","title":"Trump expected to announce Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy"},{"text":"I think I lost about 20 points of IQ by reading that.","title":"Confessions of a Reformed NeverTrumper | Or, how I stopped worrying and learned to live with the Donald"},{"text":"I got banned from a subreddit when someone said, \\"how much worse could it get?

I don't blame the Harris campaign much at all. They had 100 days to make up for that deficit. And they clearly did. If Biden was going to lose 400 electoral votes, Kamala clearly lost far less, so they did serious work in those 100 days but that's not a lot of time, and she was always handicapped by the administration.Democrats are and always have been cowards. Biden ran on status quo. And as it turns out, people aren't super happy with status quo. He should have fought far harder for people in those four years. They shoul dhave taken the threat that was coming seriously. They squandered those opportunities. And on January 20th, BIden will shake Trump's hand as he turns over the keys to the castle with fucking Musk doing an X jump in the background. And that photo will be Biden's legacy.

For a tariff to be successful, there needs to be a domestically produced alternative. If there isn't one, then the tariff essentially will just increase the price of the product for no good reason until domestic production can be started.If there is a domestically produced alternative, then the tariff can protect it from competition from foreign companies. A foreign company can drive prices down until a domestic company goes out of business. This is not inherently a bad thing because having production advantages are what drives our global market. But it becomes a problem if the foreign company (and foreign government) controls something important like micro chips for defense purposes. This essentially gives them leverage in a potential conflict. It's also a problem if the foreign company chooses to increase prices after driving domestic options out of business. I think of that as the bait and switch. You think you're getting a cheaper product at first, then they take your shirt.Tariffs can potentially lead to more domestic jobs being created over time. It can lead to domestic production being the same or cheaper than the foreign alternative. Elon musk built a Tesla factory in China to avoid import tariffs.

Late in the timeline of the race they also showed their unfavorable hand containing the polling data with the vile vitriol and pathetic lies with which they also came for Jill Stein. Fact is the bump to Trumps polling numbers after Kennedy joined his campaign was so big they couldnt entirely leave it unaccounted for in their reprehensible misrepresentations and that alone is enough of a tell to know that the herding of the Kennedy vote to him was crucial in his election win. Team Trump is definitely providing itself reliable internal polling data as well and these told them they needed the Kennedy vote to win. So they cut him a deal. The Dems for their part chose to rather lose to Trump than win with Kennedy. Because they cant fucking do anything against the wish list of their donors, least of all embrace any truth for once.

Trump has signaled his desire to once again withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and also to exit the UN convention that oversees the COPs, a move that would result in Washington not even participating at the negotiating tables as an observer, says Jacopo Bencini, a researcher at the Carbon Markets Hub at the European University Institute in Florence.Of the three big global climate players, only two might remain in playthe European Union and Chinawhose relations are shaken by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bencini says.

Of course, the US has never admitted historical responsibility for emissions, but having them onboard in negotiations encourages the search for alternative solutions.From COP29.Read more: [https://www.wired.com/story/cop29-begins-with-climate-finance-absent-leaders-and-trump-in-the-spotlight/](https://www.wired.com/story/cop29-begins-with-climate-finance-absent-leaders-and-trump-in-the-spotlight/)","title":"COP29 Begins With Climate Finance, Absent Leaders, and Trump Looming Large"},{"text":"Really!","title":"Attorney explains why hes advising some of Trumps targets to leave the country"},{"text":"I don't think he is.

I am appalled to see so-called libertarians oppose trading tariffs for eliminating the income tax. Tariffs are sales taxes on imports, and libertarians historically have almost universally agreed that sales taxes are preferable to income taxes. Not coincidentally, the founders of the USA made sales taxes the only tax allowable by the Constitution.  \\n  \\nIf tariffs were equivalently bad, they would still be preferable (for a state) because they force a greater variety of goods to be produced within the border, which can be a critical national defense imperative. Letting foreign, opposition powers be our sole source for many critical goods can easily be fatal to a nation (and, not just the nation, but also its people). Because goods that were being imported cheaper than they can be made domestically will now be purchased domestically, the prices of those goods will necessarily increase. However, this also means that those purchases circulate money within the economy instead of exporting it, and that results in an increase in the income of the producers of those goods, so it's not a total loss for the economy. Determining how much the tariffs affect the economy is an equation which subtracts the increased cost of import and adding the increased domestic productivity and income- this is not necessarily a negative equation across the board. Income taxes are unavoidably negative across the board, they only increase income for the least productive sector of the economy: government bureaucracy.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"Biden was dementia-ridden since day one of his presidency.

It was Biden who demanded their involvement in infrastructure negotiations. It was Biden who said Republicans are good, rational people, all while they were out attacking and demonizing everyone from the trans community to women and immigrants. It was Biden who refused to acknowledge just how far gone the republican party is and how much of a danger they pose not just to America, but to humanity overall.

It certainly doesn't seem to be historically abnormal though.orignally posted at [https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1goqpm5/comment/lwmhr2d/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\\\_term=1&amp;utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1goqpm5/comment/lwmhr2d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)","title":"Elon Musks Election Integrity Community Turns Its Attention to Arizona | \\nConspiracy theorists allege that theres only one way a Republican Senate candidate could possibly lose in a state Trump won: election fraud."},{"text":"And they already had a sweetheart EU deal: kept their currency, Schengen Agreement opt out, access to the common market.","title":"Why Trumps Deportations Will Drive Up Your Grocery Bill"},{"text":"In California theyll figure out some way its all the local Democratic partys fault.","title":"Why Trumps Deportations Will Drive Up Your Grocery Bill"},{"text":"Cant believe minorities essentially voted for the people who want them out of the country.","title":"Trump expected to announce Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy"},{"text":"Funny outside of Cali, most of the food production in America are from red states?

If someone doesnt accept you or you &amp; your partner, dont invite them. If youre unaware and accidentally invite them, they probably wont show up anyway. If someone approaches you, then you can tell them. Putting a blanket statement on an invitation could ruin your memories. Its easier to forget about your crazier relatives when you dont have to think about them than having your memory jogged every time you reminisce and pick up an invitation and have the warning in your face.People can be members of a party for a myriad of reasons. Parties can have over 100 planks. Its ridiculous. Talk to any elected partisan politician and they will tell you that the platform police are the most annoying and embarrassing of each party.Dont forget, DOMA was passed under a majority D Congress and signed by Bill Clinton. Bush could have reversed it when he had a majority in both chambers. So could have Obama. In my state, it was the courts that legalized it, then reaffirmed by the Supreme Court.There are elements of both parties that are embarrassed by their fringe elements. If you still want to discriminate based on party affiliation without a warning label soiling your invitation; go to your Secretary Of States website and check each anticipated guests voter registration. Youll save on meals and postage.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"And lets also appreciate that biggest Trump backers were not born in the US, they have no inherent allegiance to this country, for them its just a money pit and a place to let their inner sadist flourish: Musky, Murdoch and Putin.","title":"Trump border czar says administration will conduct workplace immigration raids"},{"text":"I agree on both points.Going across the aisle feels like someone venturing into the DMZ now.Also, getting both sides to agree on a bill seems like a small miracle which is why the border bill by Biden seemed like such a slap in the face when Trump killed it.","title":"AOC Directly Addresses People Who Voted For Both Her And Trump"},{"text":"Where were all these articles BEFORE the election?!
