Hollywood Celebrity Presidential Endorsements: Taylor Swift, George Clooney, Robert De Niro, Beyonce Fail to Secure Victory for Kamala"},{"text":"David A. Graham: Ironically, it may have been Donald Trumps discipline that won him a return trip to the White House.The former and future president is infamous for his erratic approach to politics, which was on flagrant display in the last couple weeks of the campaign. But Trump consistently offered a clear message that spoke to Americans frustration about the economy and the state of the country and promised to fix it.Throughout the campaign, Trump told voters that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and undocumented immigrants were responsible for inflation, and that he would fix the problem. His proposals were often incoherent and nonsensical. For example, Trump promised to both whip inflation and also institute enormous tariffs, a combination nearly all economists agree is impossible. The mass deportation that Trump has promised would also likely drive up prices, rather than soothing the economy. But in a country where roughly three-quarters of Americans feel things are on the wrong track, a pledge to fix things was potent.Trump may be the most negative mainstream candidate in American history  But in a strange way, Trump does offer a kind of hope. It is not a hope for women with complicated pregnancies or LGBT people or immigrants, even legal ones. But for those who fit under Stephen Millers rubric that America is for Americans and Americans only, Trump promised a way out You can contrast that with the message coming from Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, which was more outwardly hopeful but suffered from a serious, perhaps unfixable, flaw  Democrats may have been slow to take seriously the economic pain of inflation. In its first two years, the Biden administration was single-mindedly focused on revving and restructuring the economy after COVID, and treated inflation more as a transitory annoyance than a long-term danger. But also, it seems to have concluded that it lacked a good answer to inflation. The administration argued with frustration that inflation was a worldwide trend, caused by COVID, and pointed out that inflation in the U.S. had dropped faster than in peer countries, and that the American economy was running better than any other. All of this was true and also politically unhelpful. You cant argue people into feeling better with statistics In a bitter turn for Democrats, Trump will now benefit from their governing successes. If he truly attempts to, or succeeds at, swiftly deporting millions of people or instituting 60 percent tariffs, he will drive inflation higher and wreck the progress of Bidens term, but Trumps own political instincts and the influence of many very wealthy people around him may temper that. Having clearly promised to fix the problem and vanquished his enemies, hell now be able to declare a swift victory.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/ZqFOGMTX](https://theatln.tc/ZqFOGMTX)?","title":"What Trump Understood, and Harris Did Not"},{"text":"Imagine being shocked to find out that a given ethnicity doesn't act like the monolithic caricature you've built in your head\\nJfc ??","title":"What Democrats must learn from Trumps victory.

Were in unprecedented times, but if Trump pushes through his promised agenda, we could see something of a 2008 repeat. Strong Republican wins in 2004 lead to a later collapse.I have my strong doubts that Trump will be able to navigate his way out of rising prices without a recession (which brings its own issues). Theres a chance we see something like whats happening with Labour right now, where the party coming into power cant really roll the clock back to pre-2020 where people want it.Of course, the alternative is that people adjust to the current economy (which is very very good atm) and come to approve of it. This also has precedent- look at how much people hated the ACA until during the Trump presidency.That said, Im not going to hang my hat on anything. Its the day after the election, and its going to be a long four years. Making projections this far out is a bit useless. However, the best hope for a comeback is Trump actually doing what hes said hes going to do, so its a bit up in the air right now.Theres certainly hope here, I think a 2028 comeback is possible, but the most important thing for Democrats is recapturing the flow of information","title":"This election wasnt lost because of your least favorite interest group"},{"text":"well, americans chose a felon over a prosecutor. time for justice to fall","title":"Harris to concede defeat to Trump in evening speech, sources say"},{"text":"Lol nope.

Adjusting interest rates and maintaining the appropriate balance between employment and inflation is delicate as hell, and we really don't need politics fucking that up all the time. That's how you end up like Venezuela or Argentina.And what's doubly frustrating is that the Fed wouldn't have had to respond so dramatically (or rather, for as long as it did) if Trump hadn't completely fucked up the federal response to COVID as badly as he did, meaning that inflation might not have been as bad if the Fed didn't have to maintain low interest rates for as long as it did.

States have been doing what they wanted regardless of federal law for a while now. Cannabis is a perfect example. 100% illegal under federal law under the controlled substance act, and the federal government could, if they wanted to, raid every single dispensary in the US and arrest every dealer, business, and smoker. But they dont. A federal abortion ban isnt likely to happen, and will get struck down by the Supreme Court just as roe v wade did. Roe v wade wasnt repealed because of hate on abortion, the grounds for appeal was because the central government does not have authority to make such decisions. That applies to abortion bans too, and would require an amendment for that to be enacted which simply wont get approved.Now, they could get around it in theory by doing what they did with alcohol and the age of 21. They didnt have authority to require states to enact the 21 and over law, the Supreme Court would have shut it down. So what they did was say we are going to cut funding to highways if you (state) dont raise the minimum drinking age to 21Requiring states to do something *needs* a constitutional amendment. You cant pass a law and say all states must follow this law. Violating a federal law does not mean you will get arrested and charged by the state, it means you can get arrested and charged by the federal government. Which is why state police cant or wont arrest you for having cannabis, but the DEA can. So if an abortion law were passed, the federal government would need much more federal police, way more than logically possible, to enforce that ban. They cannot require states to pass an abortion ban themselves without an amendment. If theres an amendment, then the federal government can utilize state police and local police to enforce itThe supremacy clause of the constitution states that federal law overrides state law. This is why cannabis is still technically illegal to use. But the federal government still has to have resources to enforce it.","title":"Can Donald Trump Run for President Again in 2028?"},{"text":"Would love to see some of these ??\\nI love him but my brother has \\"passed\\" every grade but somehow couldn't read or understand written words with more than two syllables and had no comprehension of assignment instructions until after seventh grade.?","title":"America will regret its decision to reelect Donald Trump"},{"text":"Inbreds.","title":"Trump claims victory in the 2024 presidential election, NBC News hasnt called winner"},{"text":"How the fuck did she do worse than Hillary?","title":"America wants Trump  no ifs or buts"},{"text":"Hows that name calling working out for you guys?

It would've been an overpriced piece of shit instead of a cheap piece of shit.And along those lines, we're forced to import certain products rather than rely on American manufacturing because industries have been shifted to developing countries like China where they can pay shit wages and operate under lax environmental regulations and US manufacturing can't compete in many of those sectors.

You take money from corporations' bottom-line when they open their facilities in other countries - which they do for cheap labor and lax industrial regulations - and try to export their products to the US. That's the basic principle, steering production back to the US economy and the American worker by effectively penalizing manufacturers who do not play the game our way but incentivizing with lower corporate taxes those that do.This is also more environmentally friendly, btw, if that's something you care about, considering our industries are regulated to the point where they emit \\\\~7x less CO2e per $1T GDP than a developing country such as China, for instance.The argument against it is that the exporting countries will simply pass the buck onto the American consumer. They will take a massive hit to their own economy if they do, as this also gives American manufacturers a competitive platform. This is what it's about; competition.The 'trickle down' part is the wages. Corporations need to pay employees higher wages.

Just as we don't have a right to run an experiment in nuclear exchange on this planet, we have no right to run an experiment in warming it either. So if it turned out to be that there was no severe global warming threat or that it wasn't man-made, then all we would have done would be make a mistake in analysis - which we could correct from. But if it turned out that there was and we didn't do anything about it, then it would be too late to do anything at all.

White women are basically an entitled enemy overall.  This won't be forgotten for a long time.  They took the energy of the 2017 women's march and squandered it on petty infighting within two years.

Heres a breakdown of the process:Fluoride ions in saliva: Fluoride is present in saliva, which comes into contact with tooth enamel. The fluoride ions (F-) bind to the enamel surface.\\nFormation of fluorapatite: When fluoride ions combine with calcium and phosphate ions in the enamel, they form a more resistant mineral called fluorapatite (Ca10(PO4)6F2). This process is known as remineralization.\\nProtective plaque formation: The fluorapatite layer on the enamel surface acts as a protective barrier, making it more resistant to acid attacks from plaque bacteria and sugars. This reduces the risk of tooth decay and cavities.\\nThe waste forming plaque on your teeth is \\"crucial\\"!? Watering your lawn, garden, and pets with it is just a bonus, i guess.?

Now, to deal with this, the company can just raise their own prices to keep their profits equal. Or they go to a new source of steel, which will be either an inferior or more expensive product (the usual reasons why they were not using it before), which lowers their products quality or raises the price. Or the Chinese steel producer sells it to India, US company buys it there, but still ends up paying more because of the middle man.What does not happen is jobs being created here overnight. We don't just have the iron lying around to make into steel. We don't have the extra factories to produce more. We don't have people trained to do all these jobs just waiting in the wings. So a fuck load of extra money has to be poured into the industry just to get it back to 'normal'.The bulk of all these costs are going to be born by the consumer, because all cost increases eventually trickle down to the consumer (though decreases never seem to).We have all of the above.

If the integrity of our elections is great, lets highlight it &amp; celebrate that instead of attacking &amp; demonizing anyone who dares to wonder if its truly secure.","title":"Congratulations to Trump, first candidate to win the election 3 times"},{"text":"1 Year up  32.08%","title":"S&amp;P 500 hits all-time highs as Trump wins election"},{"text":"Actually, maybe I should have said Liberals because who am I kidding, there's going to be plenty of Democrats that will still be pro-genocide given how much money they receive from AIPAC","title":"I hope you folks have your neck braces ready...."},{"text":"People voted for Biden thought they would get a shadow Obama, and the last four years disappointed them.","title":"Biden in 2020 won with 82 million votes.

People don't like him (he's never had a positive favorability) and that was a very easy point to hit (that she didn't always execute perfectly on).From a policy perspective the Harris campaign did two major things wrong imo:1) leaned to the right on issues like the border meeting Trump where he's at. - For the border, she kept reminding Americans about it thinking it was an own on Trump, but really just pounding it into people's minds that immigrants are a problem when they could've had progressive messaging on the border like 2020.2) didn't present a real perspective to separate her from Biden, especially on the economy. Her economic plan wasn't really one that adequately excited normal people to vote for her. Tax cuts for startups and small stipends for first time home buyers are not real movers. Taking about stopping price gouging without details also hurt her. People are feeling economic hurt. Economic numbers could be corrected in the near future to say we are in a recession and the Democratic party likes to emphasize jobs numbers that normal people don't see.\\nThe Walz pick is another example. Not only was Walz the only national candidate that people liked (only one of the four with positive favorability), but they asked him to go from a very genuine guy with progressive policies (\\"weird\\" messaging, free school breakfast) to a guy that had to echo center right policies on Gaza, the economy etc.The dems also didn't try to court minorities assuming they'd just turn out for them.

Worse still is that buying gold or bitcoin won't preserve your wealth beyond the medium term because as the the trade war heats up bitcoin will ultimately collapse and as governments start spending money much of that is going to endup into space exploration and economic development which will ultimately crash the price of commodities across the board.It's the end of Pax-Americana and what comes next is likely cold war 2.0 and we can only pray that it goes no further then that.","title":"whats yalls opinions about that trump has won?"},{"text":"That sucks, you arent the economy.

Trump has Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Ok, first of all any talk about the Democratic Party having no future is absurd, as it is when its the other way round and people are casually predicting the destruction of the Republican Party. Nothing is static, many many voters are captured temporarily and not permanently, and any assumptions about why they voted a certain way and continue to vote that way are misguided and over-generalising.First, on the Republican Party. Donald Trump is unique and unconventional, which has been incredibly beneficial to him but carries a risk when it comes to finding his successor. Republicans right now will understandably be very optimistic about the future of their party, but no matter what they think there is no concrete way for them to retain the Trump formula in future elections. Its entirely possible that they find someone who can take over that mantle, its also entirely possible that that person pisses their voter coalition away because they dont have the very particular type of appeal that Trump has, and arent able to get away with the same unorthodoxies. I am not yet convinced that he has created a lasting movement.Second, on the Democratic Party. There are multiple problems here that people have already touched on: elitism, arrogance, populism, being tied to the far left, communication etc. I want to touch on authenticity.Trumps communication is authentic. Its dishonest, but its authentic. When you go to his rallies, watch his interviews, or read his tweets you are getting something that it is totally his own, and unique to that situation. Its messy and deranged, but its also unfiltered and improvised. He does not have a stump speech, he has talking points but thats the extent of\\nIt. Democrats are stuck in this old idea of message discipline that no longer applies, in part because Trump contrasts so heavily with that strategy that the constant repetitions and evasions become even more noticeable.Kamala Harris had a major authenticity problem because she:* Avoided difficult interviews* Evaded difficult questions* Wasnt able to seamlessly segue from an uncomfortable topic into one of her talking points (See Pete Buttigieg for examples of doing this effectively).* Failed to recognise the value of non-traditional media - podcasts are how increasing numbers of people and especially young people consume information. I dont think her going on Joe Rogan would have changed the result, but ffs its the most popular podcast in the country, with an audience that is there to be won. How can you not recognise the value in appearing on that sort of media? Additionally, you cannot leave social media to some marketing intern posting the same repetitive, boring stump speech clip from one of your rallies. No, the majority of people are not using Twitter or listening to Joe Rogan, but everyone knows people who do - you need to reach those people to control the entire online information highway (which includes work/friend/family group chats btw). Candidates need to be able to use Twitter authentically themselves, without focus grouping every bloody tweet.* Avoided the primary process (not her fault). Obama and Trump were able to come in and take control of their parties and the narrative. Harris was unable to do this, and so the election became Trump VS an avatar of the Democratic Party.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"Yes, Trump now has status as a God.

We will abandon our historic allies and watch other nations fall into tyranny and bloodshed and do nothing.  The holocaust that is Gaza will be completed. Ukraine will be totally swallowed up my Russia and Poland will be next.  We will do nothing.  Science organizations like the CDC and NASA will be stripped bare and our age of discovery and disease prevention will end and we will be able to do nothing.  Laws reducing or eliminating sources of womens health will pass and there is nothing for us to do.  Yes, this does include birth control, abortion, and IVF.  Laws protecting minorities, all minorities, will be stripped away and all progress from the last fifty will be gone. Yes, this does mean marriage equality will be gone.  Yes, this does mean protection for women in the workplace will be gone.  Yes, its even possible things like no fault divorce may be gone.  And we will be able to do nothing.  Workers rights will continue to be stripped away and theres nothing we can do about it.  The economy will continue to be shifted to favor the (already) rich and hurt the middle and lower class and there is nothing we can do about it.

( about 15 million less dem voters showed up than 2020 while Trump's vote count was about the same)In 2016 it was that \\"Hilary was too centrist\\" now it's \\"Harris was too progressive\\". If anything, I'd actually argue that Harris ran a far stronger campaign than Hilary did in 2016 and was more energic than Biden in 2020, but it largely didn't matter. All a lot of swing voters cared about was inflation and cost of living and those things were likely harming Trump in 2020 similarly to how they're harming the Democrats now etc.On top of that, over 40% of the electorate just doesn't engage in good faith and care more about obstructing the Democrats or empowering Republicans than they do about good governance or rule of law. A lot of these voters aren't even swayed as much by the details and impacts of policies as much as they are by very shallow vibes.

To quote page 5 of [project 2025](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/a-guide-to-project-2025/): **Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender\\nideology** and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot\\ninextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual\\nliberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its\\npurveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product\\nis as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.\\n**Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should\\nbe imprisoned.** So, according to them, just existing as a transgender person is basically the same as producing and distributing porn. And because they think that porn should be outlawed, all those who make and spread porn in any way should be imprisoned. \\nSo, if they get their way, trans people and \\"adult content creators\\" would go to prison, while the rest of the country mourns Pornhub :'(\\nOn page 484 we find this: **Withdraw Ryan White guidance allowing funds to pay for cross-sex\\ntransition support.** HRSA should withdraw all guidance encouraging\\nRyan White HIV/AIDS Program service providers to provide controversial\\ngender transition procedures or gender-affirming care, which cause\\nirreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them.Not only gender-affirming care would lose funding, but funding for HIV related care would also end. HIV is not restricted to the queer community, by the way. 22% of people who got infected by HIV in 2022 got it from straight sex, and 7% got it from unclean drug injections. \\nAnd I've yet to come across legitimate scientific studies that mention gender-affirming care causing \\"irreversible physical and mental harm\\", as mentioned in P25.Forcibly detransitioning doesn't mean someone's literally going to grab someone's testosterone or estrogen supply away from their home. But by making it extremely difficult, wildly expensive or even impossible to get those hormones, they'll force these people to detransition just the same.If you want to read more about how Trump and P25 are linked, it's explained objectively on [factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/a-guide-to-project-2025/)___**Update**From Trump himself: I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age. I will then ask congress to permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these procedures, and pass a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states. It will go very quickly.  I will declare that any hospital or healthcare provider that participates in the chemical or physical mutilation of minor youths will no longer meet federal health and safety standards for medicaid and medicare. And will be terminated from the program immediately. Furthermore I will support the creation of a private right of action for victims to sue doctors who have unforgivably performed these procedures on minor children.  The department of justice will investigate big pharma and the big hospital networks to determine whether they have deliberately covered up horrific long term side-effects of sex transitions in order to get rich at the expense of vulnerable patients. In this case, very vulnerable. We will also investigate whether big pharma or others have illegally marketed hormones and puberty blockers which are in no way licensed or approved for this use.  My department of education will inform states and school districts that if any teacher or school official suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body, they will be faced with severe consequences including potential civil rights violations for sex discrimination, and the elimination of federal funding. As part of a new credential body for teachers, we will promote positive education about the nuclear family, the roles of mothers and fathers, and celebrating rather than erasing the things that make men and women different and unique. [You can find his statement here.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/president-trumps-plan-to-protect-children-from-left-wing-gender-insanity)FYI: children do not get sex-affirming surgery or drugs, and hormones are only given to minors after puberty and in limited cases, according to the national guidelines.

I'll explain:A while back the government cracked down on insurance companies not paying out. They went a little too far, and made it to where you could file a claim years after a \\"named storm event\\". They also made it incredibly hard for insurance companies to challenge fraudulent claims legally in court because they were liable for the other parties legal expenses. This led to insurance companies losing billions.This happened mainly through \\"free roof fraud\\":Roofing companies literally went door to door offering homeowners free roofs. How did they do this? They teamed up with inspectors. They would find miniscule damage on people's roofs that were 10 years old and needed replaced anyways. They would then say it was due to \\"insert named storm here\\". Virtually every county in Florida gets impacted by at least one named storm with in a 2 year period, so you can essentially do this indefinitely. They would file claims on homeowners behalf. They became experts at this and knew the exact language to use to force insurance companies to pay for someone's roof that actually just needed regular replacement from age.

When high paying jobs come in, land values absorb some of that growth, pushing values up. This is important because land in cities is finite and it's non-fungible. You can't take a square foot from rural Texas and drop it in San Francisco. In addition, we've largely stopped building new housing and what is built has a limit on density. The net result is that we've said b each person should have X sqft of land area in a place with extremely expensive per-sqft land values.This plays into homelessness because there's much more demand for housing than supply and supply isn't increasing. There are just mathematically more people than houses. Some will have to go without. If you can't come up with the very expensive rents, you don't get to have a home. You live on someone's couch or in your car.There is a comic by Alfred Twu that I think aptly summarizes the situation:https://preview.redd.it/qgfyyh0alazd1.jpeg?width=3803&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d2e418e95a9dab8e2137c51f1347492900de24c","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"Well, this aged like hot milk","title":"\\"Bottom has started to fall out\\": Trump campaign aides fret as Election Day \\"confidence has shifted\\""},{"text":"What page is this?

Not only was it confirmed by hundreds of citizens that the Haitian immigrants were eating pets and other local animals, but it was widely reported before the debate occurred.  Even if it had turned out to be untrue (which it was not), Trump would still have been 100% correct that those were the reports.  So where is the lie exactly?Abortion is probably the single biggest media lie issue.  Do you think Trump or Kamala for that matter, has some sort of control over restoring Roe v Wade?  Do you think Joe Biden has that power now?  If yes, then why haven't they done anything about it?  Abortion isn't even a presidential issue.  It's a talking point they drilled into your head.  Abortion laws are constitutionally a state issue.  Or are you blaming Joe Biden for overturning it in the first place?  It happened on his watch you know.  Trumps has done nothing to take away abortion rights.  Just another thing the media has manipulated you into thinking.Over inflated assets?  You can't possibly be referring to the erroneous case brought by Letitia James?  Not only was the case found to be completely fraudulent, but also the courts are going after Letitia James and her attorney team, sanctioning them for bringing a clearly bogus and politically motivated case to the courts.  Again, the media only tells you the part that makes Trump look bad.  In fact, I just searched google's first page of results and not a single article mentions what happened with the case being dropped, only that he was charged in the first place.  They not only lie to you, they also hide the facts from you.  All to manipulate you into hating a guy based on nothing but lies.And smear campaign?  That one has to be a joke.  Harris has never uttered a sentence other than \\"I grew up in a middle class family..\\" that hasn't mentioned Trump.  I could tell you a ton of actual policies Trump talks about all the time..  I'd copy/paste them from informing someone else instead of typing them out again, but Trump spends maybe, MAYBE 10-20% of the time talking about his opposition.  The rest of the time, he's talking about his policies in depth, talking about the people working with him and what they are doing and going to as part of his administration, cracking jokes and being a genuinely charismatic and very real, normal person, and talking about the issues that face America and the rest of the world.  That you think he is the one running the smear campaign is telling about where you've gotten all your information about him.Anyway there you go.
