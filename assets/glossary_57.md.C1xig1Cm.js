That's the question you're asking.The global order, established post WWII, has been fantastically beneficial for the US. Allowing authoritarian regimes to destabilize that would risk our prosperity. Concretely this means free trade, shipping routes etc. It means iPhones and TVs and food and general material and non-material wealth that Americans enjoy.Russia is one of biggest adversaries on the world stage, and one of the biggest threats to American prosperity. The reason we spend untold billions on F35s and other military programs is because of Russia (and China). If we can send military equipment, and largely equipment we would have to write off and mothball or destroy anyway, to Ukraine and *directly* reduce Russia's ability to harm us, then that's far more efficient use of money than anything else we do with military spending. So if you want to argue that we should drop a few billions from tanks or figther jets or whatever in order to afford the aid we can send to Ukraine, fine, that's a reasonble argument. But in terms of value for money, sending aid to Ukraine basically a black Friday sale in terms of military spending. Nothing else we could spend money on gets us as much for the dollar.If the outcome of this is that Russia loses its ability or will to threaten the liberal world order for a few decades, then that's one of our two main adversaries taken off the board pennies on the dollar. Tens of billions on terms of real value, maybe a hundred long term. Compared to two trillion dollar spent on the F35 program which hasn't achieved anything remotely like that.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Treason doth never prosper; what's the reason? \\nFor if it prosper, none dare call it treason.\\n- John Harington","title":"Reminders of Jan. 6 attack fade in the Capitol as Trump retakes power | Democrat (who led the House Admin Cmte when a law was passed to install a plaque to honor officers who defended the Capitol) wrote to GOP Speaker Johnson in May to ask why the plaque hadn't been installed, but \\"never heard back\\""},{"text":"This is very bad.The only reason Trump wants him as his Secretary of Defense is because he has proven that he is willing to forgive war crimes.","title":"Thune has privately told Trump that Hegseth has the votes to be confirmed as Defense Secretary, sources say"},{"text":"Depending on the police to protect you when you think the police are all violent racists is the sort of smooth brain take I hoped they would finally reconcile.","title":"The queer people who are buying guns to prepare for Donald Trumps America"},{"text":"In 2016 when they started spewing for the BS, I checked nearly every one out and it turned out to be twists of the truth, something taken out of context, or just an outright lie.After checking most of these claims out and finding ALL of them to be false, I stop bothering to check.The Democrats, the leftists, the Trump haters spew forth lies like the Amazon.","title":"I Fully Support President Trump"},{"text":"The cult couldn't understand how gas prices were affected by people not driving in the pandemic.?\\nThey can't understand tariffs, or retaliatory tariffs.?","title":"Do Americans not realize we're about to get royally screwed next year by Trump?

And Trump is more desperate now than ever, with his numerous felony charges. Based on the?[Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-iii/clauses/39#:~:text=Treason%20against%20the%20United%20States,on%20Confession%20in%20open%20Court.)?and the interpretation of founding father and Chief Justice,?[John Marshall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall):The Constitution specifically identifies what constitutes treason against the United States and, importantly, limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct:?**(1) levying war against the United States**; or (2) adhering to \\\\[the\\\\] enemies \\\\[of the United States\\\\], giving them aid and comfort. Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American historyindeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954the Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.The offense of **levying war** against the United States was interpreted narrowly in Ex parte Bollman &amp; Swarthout (1807), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans.The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burrs associatesBollman and Swarthouton the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall opinion emphasized, merely to conspire to subvert by force the government of our country by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans.Conspiring **to levy war was distinct from** actually **levying war.**?Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an **actual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.** In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.By actually [amassing/inciting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/proud-boys-leader-sentenced-22-years-prison-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges-related) a group of supporters [to attack](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan-6-hearing-roger-stone-voting-violence-1234610680/) the Nations Capital (*actual assemblage of men*), to prevent the certification of the election he [knowingly lost](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-saying-he-lost-could-mean-legal-trouble/) (*for the purpose of executing*), combined with the multi-State [fake elector](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-cases-against-fake-electors-and-where-they-stand/) scheme that is now [in evidence](https://imghoster.co/en/nPG4vUcEkUP83KY?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=unitedagainsttheright) (*a treasonable design*), Trump, his Admin, several [Secret Service](https://www.newsweek.com/pence-refusing-get-secret-service-car-jan-6-chilling-raskin-1700341) members, and many high ranking officials in various positions of powerincluding: \\n- SC?Justice, [Samuel Alito](https://apnews.com/article/alito-supreme-court-flags-history-symbol-protest-a5415aeba90e21a86a50f8489fc54b7a)\\n- Speaker of the House,?[Mike Johnson](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/mike-johnson-christian-nationalist-appeal-to-heaven-flag-1234873851/)\\n- SC Justice, [Clarence Thomas](https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/4501934-clarence-thomass-conflict-is-clear-he-must-recuse-himself-from-the-trump-immunity-case/)\\n- his spouse, [Virginia Ginni Thomas](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ginni-thomas-tells-jan-6-committee-she-regrets-texting-with-meadows-about-2020-election/)\\n- and [many more..](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/gop-lawmakers-were-intimately-involved-in-jan-6-protest-planning-new-report-shows)levied war against the US on J6, committing treason as written in the Constitution and further defined by founding father and Chief Justice, John Marshall.. and conservatives are going to [deny it happened](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/01/jd-vance-trump-2020-election-loss-debate/), while helping them [try again..](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/12/trump-overturn-result-presidential-election-vote)*[Penalty:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States#:~:text=Penalty%3A%20Under%20U.S.%20Code%20Title,office%20in%20the%20United%20States.)?Under U.S. Code Title 18, the penalty is death, or not less than five years imprisonment (with a minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death).**Any person convicted of treason against the United States also forfeits the right to hold public office in the United States.*And now it seems Elon*who has numerous defense contracts*is giving [*aid and comfort*](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-in-secret-contact-vladimir-putin-since-2022-claims-wall-street-journal-report-us-ukraine-russia-war-starlink/) to Putin.Finally.. read this [letter sent to Harris](https://freespeechforpeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/letter-to-vp-harris-111324-1.pdf) from election security officials begging her to ask for a by-hand recount, siting numerous data breaches linked to Trumps team.","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"Well how can we have the largest tax cuts if we dont give it to the people who pay the most??!?

Many actually respected Constitutional scholars/lawyers have weighed in to say  that Trump is disqualified per the plain language of the Constitution, having been adjudicated an insurrectionist, so this is within the power of congress per the Constitution.Will any of the congress vote to do this? No - because even if it's totally true and legally sound: he was allowed to run thanks Garland sitting on his hands, then the SCOTUS essentially amending/overriding the Constitution re: disqualifying Trump from the ballot, and he won by a (very slim) majority of the popular vote in addition to the EC, so they don't want to look like they're pulling a coup, even if its constitutionally sound. So, we'll almost certainly be seeing a president take the oath of office to protect/abide by a constitution that by any definition, he didn't come close to the first time around, so why would he this time?

You made up a weak argument and applied it to me and then defeated it on your own, even if they are arguments you believe to be most commonly held. There are dozens of statements I made that could require further clarification/expansion of my opinion in that post. You just picked one. Trump should have been easy. 0) we beat him once already.1) the vast majority of the nation has no idea about all the actions Trump took to change the results of the election. Things like the false electors scheme, Trump pressuring his AGs to lie to states that they had found  significant fraud when they had not, and Trump pressuring state investigators themselves. This would have shifted votes.2) people barely know about the Dominion lawsuits against Fox where Fox brought on people to lie over and over to the public unchallenged with multiple stories that even the hosts knew were lies. Taking any steam out of the Fox machine pushing for Trump would have had an impact. 3) the Democratic leadership taking no clear stance on Israel/Palestine and just giving empty wishy-washy statements just pissed off everyone, and losing all sides of the conflict. This would have had at the least a positive impact by having any clarity of a plan here.4) dragging their feet on some of the most important issues. Whether it was Biden dropping out last minute or garland intentionally waiting to being an investigation into Trump. Trump should have been in a court room just like Clinton. This would have had an impact. 5) for the entirety of Bidens presidency the democrats couldn't/didn't celebrate wins. This is a failure of the entire party. And instead the party was lifting up leftist voices who in the end were Anti-democrat. 6) when Kamala finally came into fight, she still wouldn't give a clear stance on issues like Transgender issues so Republicans pulled out a singular out of context statement from years ago and just ran with that. 7) Trump needed to be bullied. He can't handle the push back. Calling his crowds small, made him lash out. Democrats needed to keep on the attack. 8) Trump had NO real agenda other than tarrifs and  He just made things up as he went. His whole campaign was vibes. What's he going to do \\"make everything the best thing ever\\" 9) the final debate between Trump and Biden was tactically a huge mistake. Biden trying to list off dozens of facts and numbers was not compelling and in his state, added significantly to his terrible performance. But if you read the transcript of the debate, Trump sounds like the incoherent rambler. The strategy was all wrong.In all we didn't attack - never held Trump to account, even in the public square. We didn't attack him like we needed to. We didn't support ourselves -We didn't reward ourselves for our wins so it looked like we did nothing. We dragged our feet on key issues and we waited way to long for to decide Biden to drop out or stay in.","title":"CMV: For those of you who are Democrats that voted for Harris, yet are blaming the Dems to why Trump won, you're basically saying that the Democrats are the ones responsible for the end of our democracy."},{"text":"So I'm not sure if you're aware, but fascism doesn't have a time limit.","title":"Far-left Antifa activists waiting to see Trump actions.

The AG can start with the both of them.Edit: this article explains the legal process:https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5055171-constitution-insurrection-trump-disqualification/amp/Disqualification is based on insurrection against the Constitution and not the government. The evidence of Donald Trumps engaging in such insurrection is overwhelming. The matter has been decided in three separate forums, two of which were fully contested with the active participation of Trumps counsel.  The first fully contested proceeding was Trumps second impeachment trial. On Jan. 13, 2021, then-President Trump was impeached for incitement of insurrection. At the trial in the Senate, seven Republicans joined all Democrats to provide a majority for conviction but failed to reach the two-thirds vote required for removal from office. Inciting insurrection encompasses engaging in insurrection against the Constitution or giving aid and comfort to the enemies thereof, the grounds for disqualification specified in Section 3.  The second contested proceeding was the Colorado five-day judicial due process hearing where the court found by clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used in Section Three. The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed. On further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the court held that states lack power to disqualify candidates for federal office and that federal legislation was required to enforce Section 3. The court did not address the finding that Trump had engaged in insurrection. Finally, there is the bipartisan inquiry of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. More than half of the witnesses whose testimony was displayed at its nine public hearings were Republicans, including members of the Trump administration. The inescapable conclusion of this evidence is that Trump engaged in insurrection against the Constitution. In particular, Trump unlawfully demanded that his vice president, Mike Pence, throw out votes in the Electoral College for political opponent Joe Biden, a power he did not have. While the riot was in progress, Trump used Pences rejection of his demand to further enflame the crowd and cause them to chant Hang Mike Pence! Some will argue that the Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case, Trump v. Anderson, precludes Congress from rejecting electoral votes when they convene on Jan. 6, on the basis of 14th Amendment disqualification. This view lacks merit for three reasons. First the majoritys suggestion that there must be new implementing federal legislation passed pursuant to the enforcement power specified in the 14th Amendment is what lawyers call dicta. Dicta are the musings of an opinion that are not required to decide the case. The holding that Section 3 is not self-executing may be an alternate holding, but thoughts about the kind of implementing statute required are plain dicta. Dicta are not precedential. The four dissenters strenuously objected to this part of the opinion as overreach to decide a question not presented. This overreach is a power grab which Congress is not required to credit. Second, counting the Electoral College votes is a matter uniquely assigned to Congress by the Constitution. Under well-settled law this fact deprives the Supreme Court of a voice in the matter, because the rejection of the vote on constitutionally specified grounds is a nonreviewable political question.  Third, specific legislation designed for this situation already exists. The Electoral Count Act was first enacted in 1887 and later amended and restated in 2022. That statute provides a detailed mechanism for resolving disputes as to the validity of Electoral College votes.   The act specifies two grounds for objection to an electoral vote: If the electors from a state were not lawfully certified or if the vote of one or more electors was not regularly given. A vote for a candidate disqualified by the Constitution is plainly in accordance with the normal use of words not regularly given. Disqualification for engaging in insurrection is no different from disqualification based on other constitutional requirements such as age, citizenship from birth and 14 years residency in the United States.  To make an objection under the Count Act requires a petition signed by 20 percent of the members of each House. If the objection is sustained by majority vote in each house, the vote is not counted and the number of votes required to be elected is reduced by the number of disqualified votes. If all votes for Trump were not counted, Kamala Harris would be elected president.","title":"Biden says it is awful that Trump is seeking to do away with US birthright citizenship"},{"text":"For all mankind's sake, I pray his life is a short one.

It does nothing but make the claim of nato expansion east but doesnt acknowledge this is caused by russian aggression and occupation. The premise is based on realism which might as well be called neo colonialism as it claims that there are \\"spheres of influence\\" where superpowers have the right to dictate what happens to smaller countries within these spheres. It completely disregards the democratic will of a nation or people. Whether in georgia, ukraine, moldova or belarus russia has no moral reasoning to engage in war because those countries or people seek protection within nato from their historical occupier or closer economic ties with the west through the EU. The ukraine war has seen two new members join nato because the ultimate driving force of countries democratically seeking to join nato is russian agression. It is the reason for all of these countries joining from the eastern block. The claim of the 2022 invasion being to stop joining nato is dishonest. Ukraine was never going to be a nato member because of its territorial dispute post 2014. It was not on the table. Russia even had its own agreement with ukraine on the table to not join nato as reported by reuters. This deal was ignored by putin who favored invasion because this is ultimately a war to regain previous russian/soviet land as well as valuable resources. Hes made it very clear he wants to depose the ukrainian government and occupy the country in order to \\"denazify\\" whoch is laughable considering zelensky's jewish. Russia also has its own military industrial complex that behaves on the same way as it does in the west.

You cannot claim that the invasion was to prevent NATO expansion because it had already been prevented. \\n You also forgot to mention in that deal was for nato to pull out of nato countries which they could and would never do as it is a massive security risk and defeats the principle of nato.

In addition to granting citizenship to all former slaves in the United States, the 14th Amendment officially established that any child born on U.S. soil (meaning any U.S. state or territory) was automatically a citizen of the United States.This provision was added to the post-slavery era 14th Amendment to make sure all former slaves (and there subsequent offspring) were citizens without question. I do not believe the drafters intended to create a worldwide dragnet clause.While some other nations have birthright citizenship, or a highly restricted version, many more nations do not have birthright citizenship.In any event, regardless of your position on this issue, I think it would require a subsequent Constitutional amendment to change in a significant way birthright citizenship in the United States, for obvious reasons.

Most companies do not allow racist or homophobic remarks and actions to tarnish their image and would quickly terminate someone if they did these things.The issue Im pointing out isnt with the companies, its with the **inconsistent public reaction.**Then your issue isn't with the companies, it's with society's perception of these two actions. You have one action of offending an entire group and causing backlash from the public, potentially causing them to lose profits. And the other is an employee willingly putting themselves in a compromising position to tarnish the company's image and public reputation.Now I could be wrong but one of these things seems worse than the other, no? I'll let you answer that to reveal any biases you have for this debate.And I really do agree that sex work shouldn't be punishable by termination.

There still is as voting for Democrats swung wildly right up to the current election. Democrats tend to come out at their highest levels after Republicans do great damage. But then they go home.Meanwhile, Republicans vote more steadily. That's why they tend to win more elections and hold more power over time in recent decades. Recently we have also seen a surprisingly steady increase in votes for Republicans. This suggests that Republican popularity is increasing and as of 2024 at its highest level ever.Mort's suggestion above that things have changed is not correct, or at best premature. In fact, there are still [many more Democrats](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-voters-have-a-party-affiliation/) than Republicans.Of registered voters, 47% have declared a party affiliation. As of September 2024, 36 million voters are registered Republicans and 45.1 million are registered Democrats.You ask a great question: Will voters for Republicans now \\"continue voting R without Trump or just go piss off to who knows where\\"?I think some new voters will stay with the Republican Party while some run away for good.

On Ukraine in NATO, you talk as if Ukrainian ascension to NATO was imminent, this was not the case. Ukrainian society itself was deeply split on NATO membership pre-2014, and both before and after 2014 there was next to no appetite in the west to add Ukraine to NATO. Russia created this hostility on their own because Putin is a Russian nationalist. He has wrote essays and given several speeches on his view of the illegitimacy of Ukrainian statehood. After Crimea, do you think there was any chance of Ukrainian accession to NATO ever, as long as they had disputed territory? He had won, Ukraine would be outside of NATO forever, but he had always wanted a bigger piece of the pie. The whole pie in fact. Because he is a rabid nationalist and revanchist. Also inherent in this line of argument is the assumption that NATO would ever launch an offensive, conventional attack into Russia, which sounds insane just typing it. Despite decades of very favourable treatment in business and diplomacy, Europe DESPERATE for partnership with Russia, Russia has acted with unthinkable hostility again and again. Theyve given the west every excuse, but this drip feed of old equipment to barely keep Ukraines frontline stable is apparently the grand culmination of the Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to topple Russia once and for all. Putin is obviously aware NATO is a defensive alliance. The people who spent decades sucking his gas up in exchange for billions were planning to attack him eventually? Give me a break. He opposes NATO expansion because his goal is to restore old Russian borders and spheres of influence. Thats why so much of Eastern Europe spent the 90s and 00s desperately seeking NATO membership as fast as they could. On point number 3 you are flagrantly lying. \\nThe Russian demands amounted to the virtual dismantling of the Ukrainian military in addition to rejecting NATO.

Asked ahead of the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol whether he still thought Trump was a threat to democracy, Biden said he thought what Trump did was a \\"genuine threat to democracy.\\" Trump falsely claimed he had won the 2020 election and urged his supporters to go to the Capitol that day.\\n\\"It should not be rewritten,\\" Biden said about Jan. 6. \\"I don't think it should be forgotten.\\" Biden said white supremacy was one of many threats to the United States. **\\"We are the most extensive multicultural nation in the world.

The 22nd Amendment is very clear, there's zero ambiguity.The only way he could run for a third term is if the SC overturned the 22nd. The SC has never overturned an Amendment. Because historically that has been viewed solely as Congress' jurisdiction, the SC is tasked with interpreting those Amendments. There's nothing to interpret with the 22nd. It's not even clear if the SC has the authority to repeal Amendments because only one Amendment has ever been repealed in the entire history of the United States and that was done by act of Congress in large part because the public felt that Congress had overstepped their bounds and it was wildly unpopular with constituents from both sides of the aisle.You really need to look into how Putin came to be. Trump is nothing like Putin. Setting aside the fact that Putin was one of the best KGB agents in the field, had the sense to spend decades making alliances and close friendships with leaders in both the actual Russian military and private militias, and ran as an independent so he wasn't associated with any of the Russia's leading political parties which gave him both distance from and the ability to allign himself with multiple parties, Putin spent years working his way into power. It was only fairly recently that he was officially declared (for all intents and purposes) president for life, before that he had to rely on loopholes that don't exist within the United States government.For Trump to pull off what Putin did, the closest thing he could do would elected Speaker of the House after his time second term. Because after his (then constitutionally allowed) two terms as the Russian President, he had a close ally Dmitry Medvedev run for office and appoint Putin as PM but everyone knew Putin was PM in name only and was acting as the de facto President. Keyword there is \\"appoint\\". Congressional leaders are not appointed by the POTUS in the US so that's already a roadblock in Trump pulling a Putin-style coup. Putin only ran for President a third time after calling a constitutional convention to change the Amendment that forbid anyone for serving two terms as the Russian President - Remember how I said Putin's status as an independent politician allowed him to become allies with members of multiple political parties? This is where that came in handy. Remind me, how many members of Congress are required to pass an Amendment? I believe it's 3/4s. Trump couldn't get the debt ceiling raised in December, and Republicans have a slimmer margin in the House than they did three weeks ago. But sure, he's going to manage to get enough Dems to join Republican lawmakers in getting 3/4 of Congress to strike down the 22nd Amendment...Finally, you know what Putin's real trick in staying in power is? It's not just putting in *a lot* of work and decades of planning to pull off taking complete control of the Russian government, that's secondary. Putin's real keys to autocracy was his popularity. Putin has an 80% approval rating from the Russian public. Now, you might think that's Dear Leader style propaganda, but it's probably not that much of an exaggeration. Even Putin's harshest critics, people who had to flee Russia or risk losing their lives, concede that Putin is adored by the public. That's the key to a real, long lasting autocracy,  especially in a larger country. It's easier to gain the people's love and trust and stay in power than it is to control them through fear and violence. Once he was elected, Putin didn't kotow to the oligarchs who helped put him in power, he made examples of them. Having them arrested and publicly put on trial for the entire country to see. Because he cultivated an image as a Russian everyman. (What he didn't let the public know is that \\"nationalizing\\" the oligarch's assets meant dividing up their fortunes and properties between him and the most loyal members of his inner circle.)But that's the secret to how Putin has managed to stay in power. As hard as it is for people outside of Russia to believe, the public at large adore him and don't see him as some Big Brother-style boogie-man. Quite the contrary in fact, the things he does we balk at internationally (i.e. his persecution of disinters and treating the LGBTQ+ community as, at best, second-class citizens) is overwhelmingly supported by the public. Even the Kim Family, for decades, we loved by the people of the DPRK.I know this is long winded but I'm just exhausted with claims that \\"Trump is going to do *x* like \\\\[Insert Dictator/Autocrat (90% of the time Putin)\\\\].\\" Because that helps to sane wash him. When he fails to do those things, that makes people say, \\"See, he's not that bad.\\" And then the actual horrible shit he does gets downplayed. We're seeing it with his first term right now. People are saying norms were upheld (they weren't).ETA: Also,  he says a lot of shit at rallies. His \\"speeches\\" are just stream of conscious ramblings. He claimed in 2020 that he wouldn't leave office, for example. However, even among his insane rants, it's clear that the \\"You'll never have to vote again,\\" was in reference to the fact that he won't be running in 2028 and all but admitting he doesn't give a fuck about the Republican party as a whole.","title":"Donald Trumps Lies Are Getting More Hurtful Every Day"},{"text":"I thought that when he bought twitter and he's the richest man again and by a lot.\\nI think he's going to do some slime shit while Trump is president to enshrine himself as the richest man ever and I think it's gonna be big but quiet.\\nYou have to remember that on that level one small favor or one insider tip can double your wealth.

Excerpt: Iran faces a tough year of confrontation with the incoming Trump administration while holding an exceptionally weak hand after 2024 left it with an acute economic crisis at home and setbacks in the Middle East. The new U.S. administration plans to increase sanctions on Iran as part of an aggressive effort to contain its support for militant groups in the Middle East. Tehrans strategy, less potent than it was, still threatens Washingtons allies and partners, especially Israel, and is also unpopular among many ordinary Iranians. President-elect Donald Trumps team is also weighing options, including airstrikes, to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Irans economy has already been crippled by a mix of bad management, corruption and existing sanctions. Power shortages have shut down government offices, schools and universities and disrupted production at dozens of manufacturing plants. At the same time, Irans military threat has been blunted by Israels battering of allies Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the now-collapsed Assad regime in Syria and much of Irans air defenses. The Islamic Republics difficulties represent the biggest challenge to its clerical leaders since 2022, when the country was rocked by widespread unrest sparked by the death of a young woman in police custody after allegedly wearing an improper veil. Authorities crushed the uprising with brute force that human-rights organizations said killed hundreds. While protests over the worsening economic picture remain limited, the regime appears more vulnerable to unrest now.","title":"A Weakened Iran Prepares to Face Trump 2.0"},{"text":"If anything, we are in for an escalation on the war on intelligence/science/education","title":"As Trump's election is certified, Americans should declare war on stupidity | Opinion"},{"text":"Glad to hear MAGA and the \\"far left\\" are on the same page that cuts to Medicare and social security would be bad","title":"'The GOP Promised to Make Life Easier for Working Families,' But Here's the Real Agenda |  \\"Mike Johnson is committing to slashing Social Security and Medicare to get the speaker's gavel,\\" said one progressive group."},{"text":"Holy shit, you people are fucking so impossible to help.

They claim Gov. Tim Walz called the special election before the seat was truly vacant, saying that the old officeholder from the last election, Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, still holds the seat.It looks like they're trying to keep their 67-66 minority control over the House for as long as possible. Meanwhile, as the article mentions, DFLers are claiming that 68 votes, a majority of the membership of the chamber, would actually be needed to organize the chamber, while Republicans claim that simply having a majority of present members, or 67 due to the vacancy, will be enough to elect a speaker.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 5, 2025"},{"text":"Unfortunately, this election wasnt a sham.

Npr started fact checking trump 3 days after  the election. The lies, disinfo/misinfo/propaganda from troll farms also did their bidding for trump. Trump and the gop take credit for the good the dems do and people are none the wiser. They turn on Fox news and fox news shelters them from the world. Only ever broadcasting bad news or negative things from the dems. \\"They wouldn't lie on  tv\\". Every far right news outlet coddled these people to the point where they simply don't report on critical events or situations if it doesn't make the dems look bad or if it will hurt their delicate feelings. Bidens economic policies were such a slam dunk that they lowered inflation by historic rates in record time. Yet the corporations kept raising food prices even when inflation had dropped to 2.8%. .8 percent higher than normal. Then the days after the trump victory in the election, magically food prices started falling by a little bit. The media reported it in mass. The corporations knew what they were doing. There qas no reason for groceries to be 20 to 38% higher in prices other than greed and to make the dems look bad.Jimmy Carter was voted out for Reagan who took credit for Carter's economic policies which solved inflation last time and led to the boom Reagan than took credit for in the 80s. The first signs  the economy was in a down turn was the recession of 2008 which was caused by deregulation by the Republicans. Obama got in and fixes it.

By using that exact argument, the US would also be justified in invading Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil and Venezuela. Besides, no one is forcing these countries to join NATO. They want to join NATO because they see what Russia is trying to do to other countries of the former Soviet Union. 2. I mean, I guess the US has an interest in keeping the war going but I'd say that the much larger benefit would be a decisive Russian military defeat. On top of that, the more prevalent interest of the US so far has been to balance escalation with support for Ukraine, which is basically the reason why the US and other NATO allies were always so reluctant to enlarge their support to more and other weapon systems like MBTs, ATACMS and other long-range missiles or planes. 3. RUSSIA FUCKING INVADED. They could have just not invaded Ukraine is they didn't want the war. Are you fucking insane? There was zero chance in hell Ukraine would have gotten Crimea or the LPR+DPR back if Russia didn't invade. Instead, Russia chose to start an illegal invasion to subjugate Ukraine at first and secure their land bridge to Crimea later. Like, even if Ukraine did join NATO (which, imo, was unlikely before the invasion due to their entanglements in Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea), it would not justify an invasion (see point 1.)4. Russia has been bombing civilian targets into the dust. POWs are treated horribly or just outright executed.

Big players like France are firing up factories. He gambled that this would scare NATO and it invigorated it.I wouldn't characterize Ukraine as losing. A massive army is hammering down on them for extremely marginal gains *and some losses,* primarily having added some scraps beyond provinces in the Donbas already *de facto* conquered. They've pushed Russia to the desperation of finding high tech allies in...North Korea.

Their *whole deal* is that: Big parades and lots of boasting so no one checks if they can back it up. Now they've admitted they cant. Russia is getting screwed selling on less-than-at-cost oil to China because they need shells that badly. And this is what Ukraine has done with slow, limited support.And they're *much* more likely to recover economically afterwards than Russia which is going to be sanctioned to hell and back until our grandkids are old.I think a fairly likely outcome is a negotiated peace with borders similiar to the current battle lines, easing of sanctions in exchange for reparations to rebuild, and Ukraine not able to join NATO for X years, which they promptly do at X+1.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Cause they were betrayed!","title":"As Trump rewrites history, victims of the Jan. 6 riot say they feel 'betrayed'"},{"text":"Does it really matter what the numbers say, trump will do whatever he wants too, it makes no difference.","title":"Trump Sees the U.S. as a Disaster.

If you look into the obvious very selective metrics they cite, even by their own data, there is no way to say that Florida is anywhere near close to #1 in education. They[ rank **higher education**](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/methodology) by the following which includes counting college educated residents that may have moved to Florida from other states* 2-Year-College Graduation Rate: The share of students attending public institutions who complete a two-year degree program within three years, or 150% of the normal time. (National Center for Education Statistics; 2019 cohort)* 4-Year-College Graduation Rate: The share of undergraduate students at public institutions who initially pursue a bachelor's or equivalent four-year degree and receive one within six years, or 150% of the normal time of study. (National Center for Education Statistics; 2016 cohort)* Population With Advanced Degree: The share of people 25 and older in a state who have an associate degree or higher. (U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates; 2022)* Debt at Graduation: The average amount of federal student loan debt held by those 24 years and younger. (U.S. Department of Education Federal Student Aid office; September 2023)* Tuition and Fees: The average college tuition and fees required of in-state students at public four-year institutions, not including room and board. (National Center for Education Statistics; 2021-2022)For K-12, they included the following and by these selective metrics were ranked College Readiness #19, High School Graduation Rate #32, NAEP Math Scores *at 8th grade level* #21, NAEP Reading Scores also *at 8th grade level* #12, Preschool Enrollment #12.* College Readiness: The *approximate percentage of 12th-graders who scored in the 75th percentile* on the SAT, the ACT or both, defined as 1200 or more on the SAT and 25 or more on the ACT. (College Board, ACT, U.S. Census Bureau; 2022)* High School Graduation Rate: The *four-year adjusted cohort high school graduation rate* for public schools. (National Center for Education Statistics; 2021-2022)* NAEP Math Scores: The *average composite-scale score on mathematics achievement tests taken by eighth-grade students*. (U.S. Department of Education National Assessment of Educational Progress; 2022)* NAEP Reading Scores: The *average composite-scale score on reading achievement tests taken by eighth-grade students*. (U.S. Department of Education National Assessment of Educational Progress; 2022)* Preschool Enrollment: The percentage of children ages 3 to 4 enrolled in a nursery or preschool program. (U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates; 2022)\\nMany of these categories really have nothing to do with the quality of education received in Florida even if you assumed they did there are many other states ranked higher in all areas so why was Florida chosen to be #1 in education? Massachusetts was ranked #1 in K-12 in this article and while Florida was ranked #1 for Tuition and Fees and #2 for  2 &amp; 4 year graduation, again, those metrics dont include anything measuring the quality of education received. Anyone can cherry pick and put some statistics together to make it say what they want.

Anyone saying \\"democracy is no more\\" is has just lost it. It's completely the wrong mentality. Trump won the election because of numerous failures within the Democratic party, not just during the election, but for the better part of a decade. If you compare the last few years of republican messaging vs Democrat messaging only one party is Hyper focused and entirely aligned in supporting Trump. One party has been spreading their influence through online channels far better and that's the Republicans. If you look at non-traditional media, Republicans have rooted themselves deep. And in online spaces we have far more anti-democrat messaging pro leftist messaging that further harms the democrats. Next, Let's completely drop any idea of \\"victim blaming\\" in a failed race. Not only is it a completely inappropriate use of the term and its simply hiding from reasons of why we lost. The party and the voters aren't \\"victims\\". Third, defeating Trump should have been easy. It's the failure of the Democrats to rally behind Party leadership and instead give far too much of a voice to groups who were leftists but anti-democrat. Fourth, Biden (and the Democratic party) choosing Garland who didn't pursue Trump aggressive enough to being a case is insane and a massive failure. As for SCOTUS I believe the entire immunity decision is insane and they have their own blame. But that is a lesser issue than the election. Democrats need to stop the degree of in fighting they currently have and start building a more clear message to stand behind. Trump can only have 1 term left and as we've seen, Republicans have had a hard time replacing him with anyone else. The next 4-6 years are key. The democrats must find a way to get better messaging across and support each other rather than support voices that are destructive to the party. They have a chance to run against a non-trump candidate and that might be a crumbling point of the whole Maga nonsense.And if Democrats Do get control again, they need to not revert back to infighting. They need to hold control and focus on the incremental changes to improve our nation.","title":"CMV: For those of you who are Democrats that voted for Harris, yet are blaming the Dems to why Trump won, you're basically saying that the Democrats are the ones responsible for the end of our democracy."},{"text":"I work in a customer facing IT role.

When voters instead don't or won't do that, then things break down very quickly. And that, essentially, is what we've been seeing. Voters haven't punished Republicans for the various power plays and grabs, and continue to treat the two as if they were equally good/bad players, when they very much are not.And because of that, the ability of voters to punish the OTHER party similarly breaks down, because with the Republicans no longer being a valid responsible governing party, you don't really have a viable alternative, and so the Democrats lose a lot of the potential incentive to offer anything more than a somewhat better option on many levels, not to mention how it breaks the vote-signaling mechanisms, e.g. \\"more voters chose the Republicans, therefore they must be doing something correct and Democrats should adjust to be like that.\\"","title":"As Trump's election is certified, Americans should declare war on stupidity | Opinion"},{"text":"Not removed from office, twice there was an opportunity, twice.","title":"Harris called Trump a danger to democracy.

Just by coincidence. But then Nashville and Chattanooga Dems might feel that their reps, even though they'd have representative as roughly 1 in 3 voters are Dems, aren't representing their regions which ultimately is what governance should be.So maybe there'd have to be some order in how the list is constructed, so that each party balances the locality, the ideology (not every NY Dem should be a upstate Blue Dog or a Queens-progressive), and the race/sex/background of the candidates. But ultimately that'd be decided by the party.And again, this is the Vote Dem sub but I truly believe that viable third parties (such as we saw in NE-Sen or UT-Sen in the past) are helping at breaking the GOP stranglehold on certain states.

But if you make your state strict on guns, the guns will just come from elsewhere anyway making the criminals even more disproportionately dangerous.In both cases, the actual solution would be to address the underlying causes.  You would get a greater reduction in violence from, for example, creating a robust enough job market that people no longer saw crime as worth it.  To a poor enough person, prison isn't a very scary threat. It's a much bigger threat to a person with a good job. So, we usually see less violence and less property crime in places with high employment rates and high wages.

But, in that scenario, the robust economy facilitates other solutions like \\"provide housing.\\" The thing is, these \\"solutions\\" are boring as well as slow and complicated, and do not make for good political bumper stickers like \\"tough on crime\\" or \\"build a wall.\\" So, retail politics goes the other direction, the direction that makes for better television and increases voter turnout.

I think the Stevens dissent in Citizens United gets into this a little, but initially my view as an attorney was that the majority view was consistent with the first amendment itself.  There isn't really anything in the plain language of the first amendment to suggest any kind of priority to \\"individuals.\\" Instead the whole thing is passive voice except \\"the right of the people peaceably to assemble\\".  I thnk the grammar is pretty weird, but the amendment only really specifically names \\"Congress\\" as an entity prohibited from doing things and \\"the people\\" as an entity with a specific right.  The freedom of speech and the press are dangling concepts without a subject entity named.  It's just a little odd.  The Constitution itself really never says much at all about individuals, apart from in their roles as officers of the state or census counting.  Amendments vary on it; some reference \\"the people\\" but most are essentially in passive voice.  The third amendment is unambiguous as to representing an \\"owner\\" of a \\"house\\" without specifying whether that needs to be an individual or corporation.  Fourth again uses the collective noun \\"the people\\" as possessing the right.  5th amendment is the first use of singular \\"person\\" apart from referencing government officers.When I tried to dig into the law on corporate personhood, I started with campaign finance laws, and in that context, the Citizens United principles seemed long established, in ancient cases like \\"Taxation Without Representation\\" which basically broadened the rights of corporations with regard to political speech.On a separate topic from the legal, I asked myself, \\"How and when did we get here?\\" Of course I had to define \\"here\\" and it was, the point in human history at which the significance of \\"individuals\\" was subordinated to that of \\"organizations.\\" So naturally I did a quick review of a bunch of things: democracy, government, labor/capital, businesses, language, religion.  Bunch of books involved, some that seem disconnected like \\"Sapiens\\" and \\"Demon Haunted World\\" and \\"God Delusion\\" and \\"Behave.\\" Here is a brief but weird summary.As far as I can tell, corporations are a very old kind of thing, that only seems new when we define it in a very narrow way. The modern business corporation, characterized by official \\"ownership\\" by \\"shareholders\\" who have a theoretical say in its direction, goes back around 1000 years to early factories, with most of the modern structure coming together in the age of sail for insurance companies. But, the oldest writing samples from human language are numerical, not stories, and appear to be warehouse inventories. The earliest \\"sentence\\" writing is about a business transaction, the infamous copper merchant.  We see slavery everywhere in history. We see kings and armies as far back as there is writing that could describe them. It appears that humans began forming organizations about the same time we started farming, probably around 20,000 years ago. It appears from brain structure studies in archaeology though that the main anatomic features enabling this may be 200,000 years old by that time, at least the skull shape. Yuval Hurari, Robert Sapolsky, and Jonathan Haidt approach from different angles how the social brain works but the three together seem to show that \\"group think\\" that enables things like religion and government, the entire universe of \\"social construction\\", all evolved together alongside domestication of wheat and other species. Ultimately, there has never been an era of history in which the species Homo Sapiens Sapiens existed apart from the near total domination of individuals by organizations.  And today, we are at this frightening precipice where the organizations seem to need us, or at least depend on our significant well being, less than ever before, and seem to have more control than ever before.  It is not an exaggeration that no individual has the knowledge that would be needed to meaningfully restart civilization; there isn't even a single human alive who knows how to source every component of a toaster or even a pencil. When did individuals lose control of the planet to organizations? Before evidence began being recorded.To me it seems incredibly obvious that a human being will always inherently be powerless against an organization. Here I deviate from popular orthodoxy because I deny that billionaires matter any more than any other individual. Elon Musk and Donald Trump are no more important to the flow of history than Hitler and Mussolini, neither of whom did anything particularly unique as individuals.  Instead, it is the behavior of organizations that becomes problematic as complex structures allow and encourage them to deviate from the intentions of the humans who created, and probably believe themselves to be in control of, them.  Instead, the only thing that can meaningfully fight back against an organization is another organization. Unfortunately, it seems almost inherent that the fundamental problems of organizations are almost universal. The Democratic Party, while nominally an effort by many liberal individuals to create a check to the power of business corporations, misbehaves in about the same ways as those business corporations, similarly being hijacked by small but powerful interest groups and the populist ideas usually being distorted enough by a game of telephone to emerge as bad ideas after starting as good ideas. I am not yet anywhere close to figuring out solutions to any of this.","title":"As Trump's election is certified, Americans should declare war on stupidity | Opinion"},{"text":"People keep saying it's an undereducated population.

We paid for this war 25 years ago when we authorized the production of this equipment.The reason we need to keep giving aid to Ukraine is because Russia is a geopolitical adversary. Weve spent 60 billion dollars and in return have functionally crippled the Russian economy and set back their military industrial complex several decades at least. The amount of attrition theyve suffered in this war has de-toothed their entire fighting force for the foreseeable future.

It's all subjective. Some maps are definitely fairer than others. Independent districting commissions help but in a world where they get adopted more, I could easily see their \\"independent members\\" going one way or another. So you say, make each party have a hand in the maps, but then what if that locks out other parties or ideological wings of parties.Some states used to do a proportional apportionment system by popular vote, where say a state votes 60%-40% for the Democrat \\"ticket\\" and then that state's 5 reps are split 3D-2R. I think that was made illegal at the federal level as a Civil Rights measure, since Jim Crow states were abusing At Large Reps in a state where their candidates would usually safely win the statewide sum.But in a system where we have a *lot* more reps per state, that could maybe work. So in a state like MD (population 6.2M, 8 Reps = 780k per Rep, 7D-1R for a [63%-35% popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Maryland), you'd go to 24 or 25 reps split 15D-8R or 15D-9R. Sucks for heavily Dem delegation states, but blue gerrymanders are far less common than red ones and not is this fairer but it helps us in red and swing states to boot.Look at a state like Texas (population 31.3M, 38 Reps = 820k per Rep, 13D-25R for a [58%-40% popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Texas), you'd go to 125 reps split 50D-73R. Note the totals mean that 3rd parties have a better chance here too.Now there are kinks to work out- it'd be harder for Congresspeople to get to know and to work with more colleagues. It'd be hard to know which candidate you're voting for exactly, so a scandal could hurt an entire party moreso than before.

IMO while you can make an argument that invading Iraq was the true horrible act of Bush Jr that can at least be kinda justified with a combination of bad intelligence (WMDs and connections to 9-11) and that Hussain was an objectively evil human (his son was even worse). The decisions made by subordinates in the occupation of Iraq also exasperated the problems. I know that this is a bit tin-foil-hat-y but I am 100% convinced that Saudi Arabia had a hand in creating intelligence that pushed the US towards invading Iraq. The Saudi connections to 9-11 are so clear and there is [evidence](https://www.propublica.org/article/saudi-officials-may-have-assisted-911-hijackers-new-evidence-suggests) that some in the SA government were involved. If you are the Saudis in the wake of 9-11 you know that the US is going to invade whom ever they feel is responsible (I basically knew this as a 6 through 8 year old at the time). Most of the attackers came from SA; Egypt, the UAE and Lebanon also had attackers. The US isn't going to invade Egypt: the US gives military aid to Egypt, Suez disruption, 70 million people at the time, center of Arab TV. The US isn't going to invade Lebanon as Israel will have issues because of that; Iran also doesn't want to see Hezbollah bombed. The UAE is a no-go as it is too close to SA and has fairly good US relations. Kuwait, Jordan, and Syria are either too friendly with the US or Iran (Assad was also not seen to be as bad at the time). So that leaves one good option that everyone in the area hates: Iraq. Hussain just 10 years ago invaded Kuwait and had to get beaten back by NATO and the US made SA [pay for that little war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War#Creating_a_coalition). I'll be entirely honest that I don't like the Saudis (though I went to university with some Arabian students, I don't like the demonym 'Saudi' as it attaches the House of Saud to the people of Arabia, and they were super nice and fun). It just seems like them to basically have had almost all the people used for 9-11 be Saudi and then they come up with someone else to blame.","title":"Trumps Propaganda Victory - The Rewriting Of Jan. 6: You can believe your own eyes or Donald Trump's words  and many Americans are choosing to believe him"},{"text":"I think it's safe to say they will make everything worse.","title":"Record-high count shows government failing on homelessness.

That said, you're right that a complete biological basis to morality is highly unlikely. Otherwise, it automatically would override any other factors and be the de facto source of our morality. Despite that, our biology can still influence our behaviour without being the sole reason for it, it can skew our morality in a way that humans don't have the ability to control directly. Our biology still largely influences our cognition and behaviour and, as a result, our morals. For example, the role oxytocin plays in parenting, it influences how we feel towards and then interact with our children, and that then influences how we expect our children to act towards both us and their children. This then expands to a soceital understanding of taking care of one's young that takes on a moral connotation. Therefore, while we can't be certain that biology is the complete basis for our morality, it's true that it does play a role or act as a component on some level.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"The most funny thing is wapo lost soooo many subscribers recently.

If someone has left the sex industry and hasnt engaged in it for years, thats just as much a past action as someone making a bigoted remarks years ago. Both can be seen as things someone has moved on from. Just like someone can prove theyve grown past racist beliefs (through public statements, charitable actions, or consistent behavior), someone can also demonstrate theyve left sex work behind and are now pursuing a different path.Public perception is the real determining factor in both scenarios. James Gunn is an example of someone who made offensive jokes but eventually kept his job because **public perception shifted in his favor.** Your point about intent and time applies equally to both situations. If you think its possible to prove someones offensive jokes were just jokes or that theyve grown out of racist views. Then totally possible to demonstrate that someone has moved on from sex work. If the argument is that people should be judged based on their current behavior and contributions, then how does that standard not apply to former sex workers?The big issue here is financial harm. The companys decision almost always comes down to financial impact and public backlash. If a company loses sponsorships, clients, or partnerships because of an employees behavior, theyre going to act, regardless of whether that behavior was words or actions. So if Gary Williams is making and post racist jokes (while donating to anti-racist organizations) and he is terminated because that behavior cause financial losses to his employer. I wouldnt feel any different if a sex work was fired for the same reason, engaging in a behavior that causes financial losses to your employer.","title":"CMV: if you think its okay for someone to be fired from their job for past/current sex work, then it should also be okay to fire a person for past or current homophobic/racist remarks."},{"text":"What choice does she have?

The New Continent was founded by the world's first corporations.  The House of Burgesses was a board made up of company men exercising political control of the Virginia Colony.  \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" was a term of art found in one of the earliest corporate charters meaning pursuit of profit.  The first state, Delaware, was practically gifted to DuPont by Jefferson in 1803 in exchange for his building a gunpowder plant there.  That said, the unruly people of North America were not so easily brought to heel and governing the states was always a cumbersome project.  It wasn't until GE, a large defense contractor, took the parts of an out of work actor whose career had died and created an animatronic device called Ronald Reagan that the corporatists were able to take full control of the apparatus of government.  The Democrat party quickly became swayed by corporate donations as well, and best interests of the People became subsumed by the what was in the best interest for special interests.  This all worked well for the corporate elite until Trump, after spending all his Apprentice money, decided to run for the presidency because he desperately needed cash, and laundering Russian mafia money through his properties was no longer as profitable as it once had been.  He surprised everyone, including perhaps even himself, by actually winning, and it soon became clear that our American system of government could be bought by whomever had the available cash to do so.  Leonard Leo quickly passed the hat among his faithful and bought the federal judiciary.  Foreign governments began to buy up the GOP, and the Trump Family brokered access through the Inaugural Committee.  The Corporatists were not going to be so quickly shut out of what once was their's, however.  After Trump's defeat and January 6th, they weighed their options and pragmatically came to the difficult decision, that as appalling awful as Trump had become, he was their best shot at redemption.  He became their guy because he can be bought at a more attractive price than anyone else.

I believe point 2 is broadly correct, though I disagree on some of your sub points.\\n4 is true, but a surprising amount of Materiel the US (and the rest of NATO) has given to ukraine has been equipment near the end kf its service life that needed to be disposed of. The US is basically just using it as an excuse to refresh its inventory as it shifts to China as its primary near-peer threatPoint 1: At best this is a self fulfilling prophecy. \\nCountries have joined NATO in recent history because they have a neighbor they do not trust to respect their sovereignty and did not believe they could deter aggression without NATO membership. The baltic states without NATO would be entirely unable to resist a russian invasion. This fear is entirely founded, first by russia's actions in chechnya, then by Georgia. Russia could demonstrate a lack of need for NATO by not invading its neighbors in response to smaller states it could conquer (and has in the past) joining NATO. Taking crimea in 2014 further demonstrated russia's willingness to act with military aggression.Point 3: If russia didn't want to go to war the simplest solution would have been NOT to occupy pats of sovereign countries that it shared a border with because that country was tired of russia propping up petty dictators and wanted free and fair elections. And then trying to fully invade and topple the government of one of those countries. Ans alsp declaring the full annexation of some of those countries territories.Putin's russia invaded ukraine because they thought they could win, they are still fighting because they still believe that doing so is worth it.To condense that: IF RUSSIA DIDN'T WANT WAR, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED ONE. The EU was increasing its reliance on russian imports, the USA was slowly increasing its trade with russia despite strategic and cultural distrust.Russia had an incredible opportunity to become a valuable trade partner to europe and the united states, with support for NATO among european member states, and the US slowly shrinking. And then russia occupied parts of two of its neighbors.

If a company operates in a society where sex work is stigmatized but homophobia isnt, its understandable that their decisions would reflect those cultural standards.Argument is about the principle businesses use to justify these decisions. In both scenarios, whether its sex work or public homophobic remarks, the company is responding to financial and reputational harm. The principle is If an employees actions (past or present) cause backlash and hurts companys profits, the company will act to protect itself.Im also pointing the inconsistency in how some people justify it. In Western societies, where both sex work and bigotry can cause financial harm to businesses, theres a double standard. Firing someone over sex work is protecting the company, while firing someone over racist or homophobic remarks is cancel culture or wokeness gone too far.Youre right that societal norms will dictate what causes backlash in different cultures. If were applying consistency in principle (specifically in contexts where both actions are seen as damaging to a companys image) then how do you justify one case but not the other?","title":"CMV: if you think its okay for someone to be fired from their job for past/current sex work, then it should also be okay to fire a person for past or current homophobic/racist remarks."},{"text":"The first Trump admin was pretty bad, but Im hoping for incompetence to once again save us from the worst.","title":"As red flags go there can be few more glaring than Trumps crypto plans"},{"text":"Let us cook.

In the strictest literal sense, both these moves would be reactionary but leaving out the wildly disproportionate nature of the reaction paints an incomplete picture. Like, sure, its understandable that Putin isnt fond of Ukraine joining NATO, but you make it sound like that move essentially forced him to invade Ukraine, and thats a logical leap I cant get behind. He had literally every other option in the world that didnt involve invading a sovereign neighbor, but he chose invasion. That is, IMO, entirely on him. If Ukraine had invaded first, or even just fired some missiles or whatever, I could see an argument that Putins actions are reactionary, in a way that doesnt destroy the meaning of the word, but the facts just dont support it. He was 1000% the aggressor here, and the fact that he was so quick to launch a war shows that Ukraine wanting to join NATO was in fact a prudent and wise decision on their part since their eastern neighbor is so quickly bellicose.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"I can see the obvious w/o being a repbulican.. it's not black or white. that's the problem with you people.","title":"Trump/Elon Increasing H1B Visas will be devastating for American Tech workers"},{"text":"Unless youre white, Christian, inbred, and rabidly evil, you are under threat of Trumps deportations.","title":"This town was built on migrants cash.

In reality, we absolutely can make incremental improvements, but everyone needs to understand that it works that way. Instead, you have a bunch of pragmatic people voting for one candidate, and a bunch of less-informed people think just assume we need a revolution with no specific/workable plan, they just want to attack pragmatism. A revolution won't happen, and if it did, it would be an utter disaster that's far worse than our current situation. In reality, almost everywhere else in the world has it worse than we do, so it's all 100% relative. But the fact that people who want something better for America end up divided because one group fails to understand that our system only changes incrementally is self-defeating. I think Bernie Sanders is a perfect example of people sort of ignorantly wanting a revolution, but all it ended up doing was putting Trump into power so he could try to destroy America. Until those people can come around to some kind of pragmatic worldview, the bad guys will keep winning. They will keep using the extremists on the fringes to attack their own party and cause them to lose.The more people they can peel off with frustration, feelings of powerlessness, and lies, the better their chances become. The only way to fight back is to not hold the worldview they WANT YOU TO HOLD. They want you to post that on Reddit and demoralize others. Don't help Trump win. Do not give up.

In both scenarios, the reasoning is about the company protecting itself, not about the legality of it.I agree rthat racist or homophobic remarks create a hostile work atmosphere, while sex work performed outside of work doesnt. The reputational harm argument still stands independent of the workplace.

Weapons are a means to achieve a goal but what is that goal? To hold the front lines? To push the Russians back? To cause the fall of Putin's Russia? Each of them requires vastly different levels of commitment by the US and perhaps more importantly very different 2nd order effects.For example, if the goal is regime change in Russia, is the US ready for what comes next? There is absolutely no guarantee that a Putin-free Russia will be any better (it could be far worse). Or a civil war in Russia with thousands of nukes unaccounted for. Just look at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The US funded the rebels, but also directly lead to the rise of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. These 2nd order effects matter a lot and not thinking about them is foolish.2. Foreign Policy goes beyond one region. The world is ever more interconnected and there are implications beyond Ukraine. The US does not infinite amount of weapons/resources and the war in Ukraine has highlighted short comings (like Artillery shells or Javelin Missiles for example). The US has reached the stage where the US is moving weapons away from allies to give to Ukraine. For example, Artillery shells intended for South Korea or Taiwan are heading to Ukraine.

Thats fair, if customers/business partners recognize an employee and it impacts business, the company might respond accordingly. However, the same principle SHOULD apply to racist or homophobic remarks when theyre tied to someones real identity. If Gary Williams (the principal) is publicly exposed as having posted harmful content under his real name, it carries the same reputational risk for the school as if he were a visible sex worker. The key factor isnt the nature of the activity, but whether its traceable to the person and impacts business outcomes.I agree most online racism/homophobia happens anonymously. But Im talking about when anonymity is removed. If someones racist or homophobic remarks become publicly tied to their real identity and damage their employers image, the principle of firing for reputational damage remains the same. Just like the being exposed for pornographic content could harm a schools reputation, Gary Williams publicly posting racist diatribes under his real name can equally drive away students and cause financial harm.Youre suggesting that shitposting shouldnt be taken seriously if hurts a company? I can agree for many cases it shouldnt, but the distinction doesnt matter once the public perceives it as harmful. If customers, clients, or businesses partners perceive the remarks as sincerely racist or homophobic(regardless of intent)it can still damage a companys reputation. The deciding factor isnt what someone did, its how publicly visible it is and how it impacts the company financially. If both scenarios create financial harm, the companys justification for firing is equally valid.","title":"CMV: if you think its okay for someone to be fired from their job for past/current sex work, then it should also be okay to fire a person for past or current homophobic/racist remarks."},{"text":"If Russia didn't want a war, why did they start one?

The higher the inflation, the more risk people are willing to take to make an X% return on their investment.  This needs to be balanced of course - rampant inflation means people will be making extremely risky investments, which isn't good.  On the other hand, zero inflation means that people may be incentivized to make no risky moves, stifling funding to potential innovators.Also, if people really want to use gold as a store of wealth, they can just... go do that.

The only realistic possibility of trump/Putin being reined in from destroying it all is when his policies negatively affect his wealthy benefactors. Those oligarchs are on the gravy train right now, and if that comes to a halt, trump will no longer be useful to them.From the article:Michelson says shes anticipating trouble coming from industry leaders too. Mass deportations and massive tariffs will increase prices, will cause inflation, and will decrease the quality of life and the growth of the economy in the United States, and because thats so true and so predictable, I think those policies will see some pushback from industry saying, look, we cant return value to our shareholders. We cant run our businesses if you take away all these workers.Trump, she points out, wants nothing more than to be seen as a strong businessman presiding over a strong economy.

Ukraine would likely be in a far worse position now if not for western aid. The strength of Ukraine's position in any negotiation is largely dependent on their standing in the war. If Ukraine gets to keep a large part of their territory intact, as well as have a path towards EU and NATO membership, that is far from the worst case scenario of this war for Ukraine.Also, not to mention that if you want a negotiated settlement, Russia needs a reason to sit down as well. If you preemptively make it so that Ukraine won't get additional aid regardless following a negotiation, what incentive does Russia have to sit down at the negotiating table? You're already signaling to them that you're willing to give up if they play the long game and will eventually be able to have their goal of total territorial conquest of Ukraine if they keep at it.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"I would like to counter this with the fact that no one has a system that works.

This will likely only lead to greater embrace of MAGA, as they keep seeing mostly rewards from their behavior, at least during general election years.As for why the GOP's become more diverse, I think that there are two main issues at play.Until recently, racial / ethnic minorities in the US have largely voted for Dems despite being fairly conservative, socially if not economically. As the goodwill that Dems bought themselves from stuff like the Civil Rights Movement wears off with each generation, more and more minority voters will go with their actual political lean when deciding whom to vote for.There is the often trumpeted idea that Dems must ditch identity politics / \\"wokeness\\" to appeal to the working class. While this may have had some merit in the past (Hillary Clinton's campaign slogan isn't exactly subtle), from looking at actual 2024 campaigns, I don't think that that it accurately reflects party elected officials anymore. Harris palling around with Liz Cheney on multiple occasions and explicitly referencing her firearms usage in debates doesn't exactly sound like \\"wokeness.\\"Unfortunately, right wing media is very good, loud, and incessant at painting Dems as overly \\"woke\\" (and thus more concerned with Ivy League student protestors rather than \\"real\\" working-class Americans) based on heavily cherry-picked quotes from otherwise unimportant, usually left-wing, people on social media (and apparently dating apps now as well). They then use these quotes to tarnish every Dem alive (or perhaps even dead) 24/7.

As I recall Russia was even invited to NATO. As I understand it they have also been expansionist before now, but that isn't even actually relevant. Germany also wasn't expanding in the mid-20th century... up until it was. It starts somewhere, so the argument that it isn't part of an existing pattern is invalid regardless of its veracity.2) \\"also, NATO expansion\\" - NATO has no mechanism for declaring an offensive war. Further, there is no coherent reason to pick a fight with nuclear-armed Russia; the risks outweigh any potential upside, even within your dubious framing of NATO. Assuming the US and all other parties would benefit from war, they would benefit *more* from almost any other adversary.3) \\"Russia doesn't want this\\" - Then don't invade? They seized Crimea and thought the sequel would be just as easy, so the argument about the economic impact is moot. No one planned for that. As for the \\"prior offer\\" to avoid it, if anything that's evidence of their commitment to war; if NATO agrees not to let Ukraine in, then they can invade at their leisure without NATO response and catch defenders off-guard. If NATO does not agree, they can point to this \\"attempt\\" as justification and have people like you defend them. It's a political no-brainer.4) \\"It doesn't benefit people\\" - Neither does a ceasefire. The people of Ukraine deserve the right to self-determination, and the cost of a buildup of defenses and capabilities against a victorious Russia would be immense.Let's not pretend here. The war could end tomorrow if Putin pulled out and let Ukraine be Ukraine. His nukes deter any NATO fuckery (and since you like bringing up patterns, there haven't been any cases of NATO challenging Russia's integrity, so we have no reason to expect it). And we shouldn't stop, not just because that would be morally wrong and lead to mass human suffering in Ukraine beyond even current levels, but also because the costs to us in additional defense spending would be more than what we are spending now.ETA: \\"something is broken, try again later\\" message which IIRC is the thread author blocking.

The Senate may have always been 2 seats per state, though they became elected instead of appointed only around the early 20th century, I believe.The House was capped at 435 seats in 1929 because they literally didn't want to bother expanding the Capitol building (yes really), so now the number is based off the Census...in 1910. One solution to this could be the [Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule), where one seat's constituent population is equivalent to the least populous state's at-large seat's constituent population, presently Wyoming.This would lower each district's population by about 200k, but that's still 500k people per district (for perspective, each seat in Iceland's parliament represents about 2k people). I think the half-Wyoming rule, or dividing Wyoming's population in half for each seat, would be ideal nowadays. Just stack all of the seats on top of each other. It'll be fine.And one last thing: unicameralism. Nebraska is the only state to have a unicameral legislature, that is, only one chamber instead of an upper and lower one. I prefer this system given how A) either pointless it can be if both chambers are elected in the same manner, or B) how unfair it can be if the upper chamber has some odd representation rule in its elections or is appointed (i.e. two seats per state regardless of population). So my solution is half-Wyoming Rule or 250k people per seat, and unicameral with only the House of Representatives.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 5, 2025"},{"text":"Fun fact...

If you dont like the taste of broccoli then there is nothing I or anyone can really do or say to convince you, that is your preference. But if you value the well being of people, then I might be able to convince you that you ought not to rape people. To use the broccoli example, I may be able to convince you that you should eat broccoli, IF you value health/fitness/nutrition, but there is nothing I can do to convince you to like the taste of broccoli IF you already don't like the taste of broccoli. \\"morallity is subjective\\" is an extremely broad and vague statement that could mean several different things and captures several different philosophical perspectives.To clarify further, imagine a spectrum with moral realism on the right side and anti-realism on the left side. Lets start at the far right and work our way leftward. On the far right we have something like emotivism, which believes that moral claims (i.e. it is wrong to torture cats) is entirely preference based and lacks truth value. Further down we might find pure selfishness (do what brings the most utility to you). Further on the left might be something like social relativism, which says that you ought to do that which is most acceptable by society. Further still would be pragmatism, which says that you ought to do what is most pragmatic given the circumstances. As we approach the center we find Humian constructivism which is as I have described, but they deny that universal values exist.All of the above moral frameworks could be considered \\"subjective\\" but they differ in some important ways and do not generally agree on the existence of moral facts.Just left of center we have Kantian constructivism which is also as I have described but they do believe in values that we all universally share. This would still be somewhat subjective as most values would still be relative, but not all.further down you have utilitarianism, deontology and perhaps some religous frameworks.\\"if you value X, then you ought to do Y\\" is not a subjective claim, this is what constructivism is talking about. Moral claims do have truth value, even if values differs from person to person.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"I mean sure but thats old news","title":"As red flags go there can be few more glaring than Trumps crypto plans"},{"text":"How big do you think the American Parliament would be?

The USA would benefit most from friendly cooperation with Russia and so would Europe.Now you may say How could we cooperate with an illiberal dictator like Putin!? And to that Id like to bring 2 points for your consideration:1) Why do we need to tell other countries how they must run themselves in order for us to cooperate with them? Look at Russia and China for example. They couldnt be more different ideologically and yet theyve increased cooperation to unprecedented levels because it benefits them both. Why cant we cooperate with others based on mutual benefit without concerning ourselves with their ideology?2) I get that western propaganda has instilled this image of Putin as some mad dictator invading foreign countries for irrational reasons, but do you want to know why he still has so much support in Russia? Its because from Russias perspective, NATO expansion right up to their border is quite literally the same as the Cuban missile crisis was for the US. Hypothetically, if there existed a military alliance with the US as its declared primary enemy, do you think wed just allow that alliance to acquire countries on our border like Mexico or Canada and potentially station nukes in those countries which could hit any US city in a matter of minutes? Of course not! Wed launch a preemptive strike the same way Putin did to defend our border.To sum up, literally nobody benefits from US support to Ukraine except defense contractors and NATO personnel. Even Ukraine itself would be much better off declaring neutrality and fostering friendly relations with all parties.

Trump and your Republican Party, based on various analyses and discussions in your media and on several social platforms:Strategic Military and Intelligence Gains:1.\\nCountering Chinese Influence: Recognizing Somaliland could provide the U.S. with a strategic position to monitor and counter Chinese activities in the Horn of Africa, particularly given China's military base in nearby Djibouti. This aligns with the Republican emphasis on countering China's global influence.\\n2.\\nSurveillance Opportunities: It could enable U.S. intelligence to set up operations for monitoring weapon movements in a volatile region and keep an eye on activities in Yemen, including those by the Houthis. But also on Somalian terrorist coming to Minnesota, tribalist taking advantage of your migration system such as Ilhan Omar lying about her refugee status. Including Ayaan Hirsi Ali, from the same tribe who has done this dirty action in the Netherlands. Ayaan got kicked out of Congress, and country. Republicans should be as firm as the Dutch 3.\\nEconomic and Trade Benefits:\\nAccess to the Port of Berbera: Somaliland's strategic location along the Gulf of Aden and the presence of the Berbera port could be beneficial for U.S. interests in terms of maritime security and trade routes, which could be leveraged for economic advantage. Berbera port is now one of the best running in Africa. Without need for funding from Western nations or the IMF. Soomalilanders do business, they don't expect handouts.4.\\nPolitical Capital:\\nAppeal to Conservative Base: The move could appeal to Republican voters by demonstrating a strong foreign policy stance against traditional U.S. policy of supporting a \\"One Somalia\\" approach, which has been criticized as ineffective by some Republican policymakers. Recognizing Somaliland could be portrayed as a bold move to support emerging democracies and free-market economies.5. \\nSupport from Think Tanks: There's evident support from conservative think tanks and former Trump administration officials, suggesting a policy that could resonate with the party's base, which values such endorsements. Heritage Foundation mentioned Somaliland in Project 20256.\\nGeopolitical Realignment:\\nHedging Against Regional Instability: By aligning with Somaliland, the U.S. could hedge against instability in Djibouti, where multiple foreign military bases exist, including those of China and the U.S. This could be part of a broader strategy to stabilize or influence the Horn of Africa.7.\\nSupporting Ethiopia: The U.S. could strengthen its ties with Ethiopia, which has recently shown interest in Somaliland's recognition in exchange for maritime access, potentially shifting regional alliances in favor of U.S. interests.8.\\nSymbolic Victory for Nationalist Policies:\\nShowcasing U.S. Unilateralism: Recognizing Somaliland could be seen as an act of U.S. unilateralism, aligning with Republican views on U.S. foreign policy that prioritize American interests over international consensus or traditional diplomacy.","title":"A Trump White House looks set to recognize the worlds newest country The Republic of Soomaaliland | Semafor"},{"text":"Funny how you jump to this without knowing OPs gender identity, shows just how obsessed you are with people who are no threat to you.Were not safe in the bathrooms you all want us to use, either.

Trump objectively ran a bad campaign. His solutions to our current problems dont make any sense. His approval rating when he left office in 2021 was 34%, he should have been easy to beat. https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspxBack in 2019 when Biden was running for his first term, he seemingly indicated that he would not run for a second term. He knew he would be too old to run in 2024. https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129 But there didnt seem to be any plan to prepare a candidate for 2024, and he ended up running and dropping out late in the race. This left no time to have a proper primary, and while I think Kamala was a good candidate, she didnt do enough to beat Trump. Maybe someone else would have.On top of this, Trump has been found guilty of many crimes since leaving office, but Merrick Garland declined to prosecute him federally. Its very possible that a conviction on treason charges for the January 6th insurrection would have made Trump ineligible to run again. Even if the Supreme Court stepped in and protected Trump, I think just presenting all of the evidence against him publicly could have swayed voters. And the Democrats dont just have to lie down and accept that a conservative court will prevent them from taking any action against Trump. They could have taken measures to expand the court, or impeach Clarence Thomas who is not reporting gifts that could cause conflicts of interest. https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crowWhen one political party is not engaging in democracy in good faith, the other party must use every tool available to protect our system.

This is a drum I've been beating on Reddit for some time, and it's something that I don't feel a lot of us get. They literally could not give a damn. Not a single one.

Stupidity shows an unwillingness to learn or change perspective. I'm sure MANY Americans go through changes in their lives that help dictate political leaning. Not everyone starts and ends in the same place. Some of these people are actually ignorant. For instance, people literally didn't understand what American soilders/personnel were doing during conflicts during the cold war, because there were actors whom benefitted from distorting the truth. The more the American public heard of these attrocities, the more they were rejected. The system in place deliberately witholds and censors information so that the military industrial complex can continue to pilage the rest of the world.More recently, many people who voted for Orange guy genuinely did not recognize what things like tariffs were...nor do many Americans understand what a trade war with China would look like. I also think a major problem arises when Americans cannot be bothered with the use of their tax dollars. For example,  if you disagree with the violence the state uses against not only against foreigners, but citizens as well, don't support a system that encourages it. When you recognize a problem, don't embrace it, even when you are offered concessions in return. Recognize the turning point from ignorance to stupidity, when you turn to insulting others just on the basis of disagreeing with them. Recognize the turning point when you no longer reflect because you live in a comfortable position. Never assume you have stopped learning from life, you learn until you die unless you reject it.","title":"As Trump's election is certified, Americans should declare war on stupidity | Opinion"},{"text":"It should be a slap in the face to every officer, regardless of where they're located.","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"Our side","title":"Elon Musk is not on our side.

I don't think Democrats bear anything close to the majority of the blame for Trump's victory. However, I am sympathetic to arguments that they bear some blame. In particular, do you not think it is fair and reasonable to place some blame on:* Biden for staying in the race for far longer than he should have.\\n* Not having an open primary (this was also probably largely caused by Biden's stubbornness to stay in the race for as long as he did).\\n* The way the Harris campaign was run. I tend to think it was a solid campaign, but there was a lot of criticism for the way money was spent on conventional door knocking as opposed to exploiting the alternative media the way the Trump campaign did and running a more modern campaign.\\n* The Democratic voters who stayed home on election day, out of apathy, cynicism, or whatever.If I had to put numbers on it, I'd personally hold Trump supporters something like 85-95% responsible for the current state of American politics. They voted for an openly transparent demagogue, a sexual assaulter, fraud, and con man. They have maliciously betrayed the foundational principles of this country out of self-interest, grievance politics, and sloppy epistemology.But that leaves a small percentage of blame on the plate of Democrats.

Neither side wins in this war. Ukraine will lose territory and citizens through a slow war of attrition with or without western aid (unless the west dramatically steps up its aid). Russia loses billions on military spending through this conflict, hundreds of thousands of able bodied working age men in the hope of extending its natural resources and sphere of influence, and receives a black eye on its military ableness in the region.

No. If I were Russian would I want to admit defeat to a US proxy state, as well as show weakness on the world stage, especially after multiple years of fighting for meager gains?

In early 2022, when Russia withdrew from Kiev, the terms Russia and Ukraine discussed in Turkey were better than anything Ukraine could walk away with now, and they still had most of their country / population/army at that point. In late 2022, Ukraine had just pushed Russia out of two major regions and held practically all the marbles but didnt push for peace talks. This was also when Russia had 180,000 men in country to Ukraines 1,000,000 and hadnt fully committed. You know who encouraged Ukraine to keep fighting? We (NATO and the U.S.) did. And for what at that point? If our politicians comments on the matter are any indication, its all to make a buck.?Now, Ukraine has suffered at bare minimum 400,000 casualties, the average age of their soldiers are almost 50, mass desertions are being reported, theyre pulling old men off the streets to fight, almost 1/3 of the countrys population has fled never to return, and now Russia is dismantling their infrastructure. At this rate, there wont be an Ukraine to rearm in the future.?We shouldnt support it because the U.S. and NATO dont give a flying f*ck about Ukraine and see this as a money making adventure. Ukrainian politicians have never been richer and the U.S. defense industry is booming. Were using the population of Ukraine, which at one point may have believed in their fight for self defense, for our own goals. Even you admitted it, you dont care about Ukraine. Your justification was every bullet we send weakens Russia, which is a terrible reason to pick a fight. It was never about Russia conquering Ukraine either. Its about Ukraine potentially joining NATO. We also hold NATO membership over Ukraines head in exchange for them fighting this war, we promised and promised them membership but now that it counts, we come up with every reason why they cant join even after the war. Russia from the beginning never cared if Ukraine joined the EU or participated in European trade, etc, but will not stand to see their strategic neighbor join a military alliance meant to oppose them.?If you disagree, please explain how Ukraine is better off today with the previously listed conditions than if they were to even have given up Donbas.?","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"I think CNN had a lot to do with it by dragging him back to do that first town hall like he was a legitimate candidate.Before that, I think most people were ready to move on.","title":"New York Republican suggests hush money case helped to elect Trump: Great irony"},{"text":"Fuck the elite","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"My favorite is when people on channels like whitepeopletwitter say \\"no conservatives in sight!

All of that natural gas that Russia is so famous for exporting has been sent eastward instead of westward. It is not really possible for them to replace the European natural gas market with China, or anyone else for that matter. They CAN sell it to other countries, but they will never make the same amount of money they did selling it to Europe - not close.They are getting closer and more cozy with China. We have pushed them into Chinas arms.Unless you want to ignore every year after 1991 of them getting closer and closer to China, this is true. In actuality, this relationship already existed and would continue to exist regardless of anything. We are providing China with a cheap source of fuel that was once destined for Europe.The Chinese do not and have never desperately needed that gas and they would have just bought it anyways if they did- it's not like Russian gas supplies are known for their small quantities. They could and did easily sell gas to Europe and China at the same time. Russian gas is entirely replaceable as well and people just kept buying it because they were lazy + they'd NEVER start a war while we were buying their gas, right?It has been American policy since the Cold War to keep Russia and China separated, as an alliance between them is the only one that has the potential to overthrow an American-led world order. Thats why Nixon went to China, and why every successor of his continued that policy. Now weve united them against us to help Ukraine fight a war that it is unable to win.China does not actually give a single shit if Russia conquers Ukraine or not. They're just doing it to spite the west and entrap the Russians deeper into their own pocket (which was happening anyways)- make no mistake, the Chinese are the dominant partners in the relationship.I fail to see how letting Russia conquer Ukraine improves our geopolitical standing whatsoever. Russian propagandists and even Russians I loosely know or see talking would not be satiated with just Ukraine. Many consider the Soviet Union to have been basically stolen from them and recently-ish there's been a small but existant revival of Russian claims to ALASKA, of all places. Will they follow through? No. But it's very indicative of the current regime and it's political base - Russia is strong, Russia was robbed, we will right historical wrongs and restore our greatness.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"I think a lot of the explosion of homelessness is a direct result of the opioid epidemic and a failure of our government to regulate the pharmaceutical companies.

HEAVEN. Dont get caught in someone elses heaven. Some people like the idea of having scarcity because it gives them an easy population control.Ill elaborate on MY heaven because this is what i want to see. First, my apoc of choosing is poleshift/thunderstorm/sky falling aurora. No real reason other than it sounds like the universes biggest ball drop. Magic just instantly becomes real once the aurora falls. Our mortal bodies get blasted away. Its over in a flash, no pain at all. I dont want a long drawn out apocalypse that sounds boring. To those who choose to stay mortal, gods have become real again, but this time they want no worship. the people who choose to become gods, or were gods before, suddenly remember its all a dream.Mortals who want no war, not even in self defense, are welcome if they wanna come. Gods too. Angels and Devils dancing side by side. If anyone attempts to attack another non consentually in any way in my universe they just get ejected based on their karma in reverse. if an angel attacks a devil, enjoy the depths of hell. if a devil attacks an angel, enjoy the depths of heaven. they fukking hate eachother, its like watching cats fighting. hilarious shit. Rap gods and Dj Gods playing out an eternal party is my idea of heaven.

Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia  and support for Chinas vision as rising. \\n \\n Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He wont personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trumps invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration. \\n \\n Hence Xis four red lines at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration. \\n \\n Small yard, high fences is not what a major country should pursue, Xi told Biden.  \\n \\n Beijings planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump. \\n \\n In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism. \\n \\n Much could go wrong. Beijings confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire.

You should listen to Jeffrey Sachs and John Mearsheimer. John in particular is a renown scholar and advisor to the US and his political theories are required reading in many ivy league programs.?\\nI'll try to condense their agreements here though:\\n1. You have to understand what the war was about to begin with. In the west, we're told Putin is a war mongering dictator who's deeply interested in expanding his empire and recreating the Soviet Union. This is just not true and there's no evidence for that. Every recent war Russia has engaged in on it's own borders has been reactionary. Reactionary of course, to NATO expansion. This is a really important point to understand. If Putin was really interested in expanding he should have been systemically conquering nations long before NATO expanded to his own border he has yet to conquer a single nation.?\\n2. The United states WANTS this war. They're interested in shoving NATO down Russia's throat. NATO does the US's bidding as the largest funder with no close second. The United States profits from wars and strategically leans towards keeping adversaries engaged in proxy wars. The US has no loss here. Most of the aid will be paid back, no us? citizens or soldiers are at risk and they have first dibs on the rebuilding contacts which will certainly be lucrative and in favor of the US.\\n3. Russia DOESN'T want this war. They're rebuilding their economy and a war would tear away at that. They don't want their population to decline. Putin reached out to NATO PRIOR to attacking Ukraine with a no-NATO treaty to avoid the war. NATO refused saying it has to be an open door policy. This shows Putin was more interested in not having Ukraine join NATO than acquiring Ukrainians territory.?\\n4. The war doesn't benefit PEOPLE. Ukrainian people are dying in droves and losing the war and their territory. Russian people are dying in droves and they are losing their economy and standard of life. The American people are struggling with basic healthcare while the government and military industrial complex gets fat off this war. The average American gets nothing from this war expect a bigger budget deficit and another reason not get healthcare.\\nAll that being said, it's a no brainer that the war should not have started to begin with. Russia was always willing to negotiate but the US wanted the war. Now that Trump is in office, there's a chance to finally end the war. Not because he's an amazing negotiator, but because the option was always there and nobody wanted to take it.?","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"TLDR: yes, they could and they are actively trying to gain control of the levers of government.","title":"Trump Has Stuffed His Cabinet With Oligarchs Poised to Govern for Their Profit"},{"text":"annoyingly its up to just a few people whether the GOP can actually put all that in one bill","title":"Johnson tells House Republicans Trump wants 1 reconciliation package: Sources"},{"text":"One could argue that the US has been a covert oligarchy since the 80s.Trump might just be the catalyst for them to come out of the cupboard with it and flaunt it now.","title":"Trump Has Stuffed His Cabinet With Oligarchs Poised to Govern for Their Profit"},{"text":"I mean if you define a career politician by holding office themselves sure.
