If a movement is going to capture attention, there's going to be a reason for it. Obviously there are probably specific reasons that this conflict caught attention, which would be true of any conflict.I'm just saying that the reason others that may be worthy of attention aren't getting an equivalent amount is that resources to do so are finite. There's a lot going on in the world.The last conflict that I can think of that had this much of the Wests attention - particularly American attention - was Vietnam. In that case, protests were driven very much by self interest: students of conscription age were protesting against their own conscription, in a deeply unpopular conflict.I mean, if we're including conflicts that involve the US being at war, there were plenty of energetic protests over Iraq and Afghanistan. It would be hard to argue that the US doing that for two decades didn't capture public attention.There isnt that self interest part of this conflict, and the sustained interest and attention of people who are not personally at risk of being shipped overseas to fight is unique in a way we havent seen.Protest/activism generally doesn't necessarily require direct self-interest, and there are many examples of people who may not personally benefit from a political change advocating for it.A straight cis person at an pride event, or a white person at an event advocating for racial justice isn't going to see a direct benefit from that activity. An indirect benefit surely just due to society sucking less at the end of the day, and their friends not being unduly persecuted; but obviously no direct personal benefit because that's not what they're on the ground advocating for.On the other side of that coin, events advocating *against* lgbtq rights, or racial justice movements, or something as divisive as abortion certainly don't directly affect participants who explicitly do not or cannot claim membership within a particular group, or expressly reject participation in a particular activity. And yet, there are very loud groups that gravitate toward those issues from that perspective regardless.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"yeah free speech is encouraged except if you mention you support trump.

That said, (1) the reasons that Turkey was initially included in NATO are non-operative today and are substantially undercut by Turkey's conduct, (2) Turkey's conduct as a NATO member is not in-keeping with the goals of the alliance, (3) Turkey's domestic activities which may have been acceptable under Cold War conditions are unacceptable now, and (4) Turkey does not deserve the umbrella protection of NATO.It's points 3 and 4 which are those addressed in my answer. Turkey as a country does not respect the fundamental human rights norms that have become a key aspect of Western society in the Post-Cold-War period and, instead has remained the same discriminatory state as it was at its founding nearly 100 years ago.With respect to Point 1 -- Turkey was brought into NATO to prevent a Soviet invasion of northeastern Turkey. Turkey is no longer worried about a Russian invasion, so much so that it actually buys Russian military hardware.With respect to Point 2 -- I would point out Turkey's position on the Ukraine War, the obstructionism when it came to admitting Sweden and Finland, taking antagonistic diplomatic actions towards European states, etc.Turkey's military is large but it doesn't actually assist other NATO members, so pushing it out of the alliance would not have any meaningful impact on the alliance's military power.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"Nonsense.

Then there's the one about sowing a wind and reaping a whirlwind.-Already there are conflicting interests emerging: Turkey wants to destroy the Kurds on the border (the ones in control of Syria's oil and agriculture) while Israel is proposing an independent Kurdish state be created; and what's going to happen about those oil fields? US wants them, Kurds want them, Israel wants them (because 40% of the oil has been going to Israel) and the new Islamic government of Syria will undoubtedly want them since Syria has no economy otherwise, that's one reason they were in such a weakened state.-Edit to add: there have been reports of the Islamists saying how they love Israel, and it's known that during the earlier civil war in Syria they participated in, Israel was providing medical treatment for wounded fighters. But there's also been reports of Jawlani saying they need to reclaim Jerusalem so we may be looking at a future Al Aqsa-Mount Temple war as Israel continues to move toward destroying this mosque so they can build the third temple, which according to them is necessary to bring the messiah.

I don't think we have an example of clear tyranny where one group is overwhelmingly complicit in a government's systematic tyranny over another particular group.Take Assad's Syria which we just lost. you could consider this a tyranny of an alawite minority against a majority, easier to topple than, say, an Arab Islamist majority tyranny that might follow it. but I'd argue that you can more accurately call Assad's Syria a tyranny of the Assad dynasty, which favoured alawites, and repressed various groups, many of whom experienced such oppression they took up arms. not a tyranny of the minority, but a government favouring a minority, often engaging in tyrannical rule. Similarly, the following hypothetical government would more likely be a tyranny of a militia elite coalescing into a political group, with the broad support of a majority - not because they're in on it per se, but because policies in general favour them, and no pattern of tyranny effects enough groups to cause them to coalesce into a cohesive opposition.Of course it's hypothetically harder to topple a regime of tyranny where a majority of people strongly support it or are laced into it, but that basically never happens - regimes topple over issues where they overstep the interests of a wide group of people, in either various ways that intersect severely enough, or one extremely badly. it's a complex web not only of supporters who are \\"all in\\" and opponents who are \\"all out\\", but of the levels of support and opposition, mutual and crossed interests between minorities, and outside forces. \\"Tyranny of the minority\\" (Tyranny as usually used, I think) tends to refer to a government of a small group of elites, not a whole demographic segment. \\"Tyranny of the majority\\" tends to refer to the implementation of popular policies which may unfairly or unjustly impact a minority demographic segment. these aren't really comparable terms in that sense. iIf both terms are applied to the \\"actually in government\\" sense, then it already gets absurd imagining the actual direct complicity of an entire demographic segment in tyranny, even more so the majority.If applied to the \\"soft\\" definition, the one we usually use within a democratic nation when we vote to screw one group over, i.e when any government tramples the rights of either a majority or minority - well, usually that's a more complex question. it's all about power and media and need acknowledgement that many policies, systems and interests served by government may not be in the public interest but may have public support, so who's to say what is a \\"majority\\" or a \\"minority\\" tyranny? id argue most of our inequities in democratic societies are in some ways both. the same is probably true in non-democratic societies, where force alone backs power - people are left badly off by their government, but lack the political will to do so anyway. point is in either case, a tyrannical government or a tyrannical policy can and has been toppled by both a majority or a minority group, and the details of that depend on who those groups are and the intricacies of context far more.","title":"CMV: it's much harder to combat a Tyranny of majority compared to a Tyranny of minority"},{"text":" Democrats need to go on the offensive and stand shoulder to shoulder with trans activists and fight loudly about human rights.

Their reported features, including sophisticated ISR sensors, large lighting systems, and the ability to \\"go dark\\" when approached by law enforcement drones, imply they are not typical hobbyist drones but rather high-tech, possibly military-grade devices, often used for intelligence-gathering or reconnaissance. Furthermore, the lack of identification of the drones' operators and the failure to intercept or engage them in any significant way raises the possibility that these drones are being operated by foreign entities, with authorities potentially avoiding confrontation to prevent escalating international tensions. This is compounded by the fact that the drones have appeared at the same times every night and are seen by the public without any clear domestic explanation for their origin. Given the history of foreign surveillance operations using drones near U.S. military assets and the fact that no domestic group has been held responsible, the drones could very well be part of a foreign surveillance operation or intelligence-gathering campaign.","title":"New Jersey mayors pen letter demanding action on mysterious drone sightings"},{"text":"And Trump will reverse it","title":"Biden says hell veto bill that would let Trump nominate more judges"},{"text":"And those people think the dudes in Brooklyn wearing sweaters and glasses are the weird ones.","title":"Kamala Harris's presidential defeat was an attack on womens progress, Trudeau says"},{"text":" with a 5th grade reading levelOh, you give them [too much credit](https://www.thenationalliteracyinstitute.com/post/literacy-statistics-2024-2025-where-we-are-now). - On average, 79% of U.S. adults nationwide are literate in 2024.\\n - 21% of adults in the US are illiterate in 2024.\\n - 54% of adults have a literacy below a 6th-grade level (20% are below 5th-grade level).\\n - [only] 34% of adults lacking literacy proficiency were born outside the US.","title":"Democratic President Rebuilds Economy, Just In Time To Hand It Off To Trump  Again"},{"text":"Hes not entirely wrong. ?But it misses that her ascension without actually having accomplished anything that was what hurt women everywhere when she lost the election.Real, empowered and successful women are embarrassed by what they saw.","title":"Kamala Harris's presidential defeat was an attack on womens progress, Trudeau says"},{"text":"First Amendment said what?","title":"Joe Rogan: \\"The House released a 500 page report on COVID-19 pandemic key findings ...

Especially if a mod (or someone close to them) had an identity that was being constantly questioned/ridiculed, and then they got ripped to shreds in response, I can see why they'd resort to a blanket ban at some point.","title":"CMV: it's much harder to combat a Tyranny of majority compared to a Tyranny of minority"},{"text":"2020 was a huge year of anti-government sentiment and people being mostly at home.  \\nTrump has beaten two women who were coronated by their party.","title":"The preferences of our noblility, as demonstrated by the election."},{"text":"Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Amoral_Abe ([28?](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Amoral_Abe)).^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: Teams should have a feature to display the languages you speak"},{"text":"/u/Finch20 (OP) has awarded 1 delta(s) in this post.All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1hbyie6/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_teams_should_have_a_feature/), in /r/DeltaLog.Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: Teams should have a feature to display the languages you speak"},{"text":"I get so frustrated hearing so many people on the left say that she ran a terrible campaign.Ffs, she only had a little over three months to try to win the White House, compared to a man who has been campaigning non-stop since 2015.

And they deserve to know the federal judiciary has the bandwidth to carefully and thoroughly consider their cases.McConnell has led Republican efforts in the past to block Democratic nominees for existing court vacancies, including the blockade of President Barack Obamas 2016 Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. The White Houses announcement on Tuesday noted that some of the new openings the JUDGES Act would create were in states where senators have sought to hold open existing judicial vacancies.Those efforts to hold open vacancies suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now, the White House said.Lawmakers may try to get the bill passed in the new Congress, but getting Democratic support may require delaying the first allocation of new judges until 2029, when White House control will be unknown.\\"","title":"Biden says hell veto bill that would let Trump nominate more judges"},{"text":"Motherfuka needs to free and pardon LUIGI!https://preview.redd.it/tq9bmjin196e1.jpeg?width=656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d150bd40f39ae81516896d604e6acca20ac1caa1","title":"Biden Says He Regrets Not Signing Name to Covid Checks Like Trump Did"},{"text":"And why shell never hold the position.

No condemnation of the death threats that the employee has received since the arrest."},{"text":"**Point 1 - Identity politics in the sense of republican antipathy towards electing a black/indian woman explains some things but not everything.** Initially, I'm not sure what you mean when you say identity politics because you imply that this concerns both Kamala Harris's gender and ethnicity, but also racism/sexism/homophobia generally. It can (does) mean both, but there's a distinction to be made between Trump's rhetoric about race, gender, gender identity, sexuality, etc., and about the very tenuous chances that his demo would elect a black/south asian woman under any circumstances; and both parties' appeals to voters on the basis of race, gender, gender identity, sexuality, etc. The difference I'm talking about is a little hard to understand, but think of it like this - Trump practices identity politics on a personal, tactical level in the shitty, hateful way he talks about people, and the way he expects his voters to respond to it. This is what (I believe) you're talking about when you say that republicans used the economy as an excuse not to vote for a black/indian woman. This is different than the higher-order, strategic/operational way that both parties use identity politics to identify, persuade and turn out their voters. Republicans use race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality etc it to mobilize their voters during the election (\\"they're eating the dogs, they're eating the cats; \\"taxpayer funded transgender operations on illegal immigrants who are in jail;\\" \\"Kamala is for they/them,\\" puerto rico garbage island nonsense - you get the idea). Democrats play the same game, they just did it poorly this time and took their votesr for granted because they assumed that the stakes were so high that persuasion was redundant. They expected women to turn out to protect abortion and to punish sex pests; latinos to turn out presumably because they like porous borders, blacks to turn out because they always have and presumably always will. They were just wrong. This is all a very long winded way of saying that both parties \\"use identity politics,\\" and so its a little misleading to say that the Democrats failed because they stuck to kitchen table issues. As discussed, the democrats leaned way too hard on identity politics as a turnout engine without actually making their case. They took their voters for granted and assumed that abortion and Trump's convictions would hand them women, that latinos love open borders, and that blacks will vote democrat because they usually do. **Point 2, subpart a - the Democrats lost in very large part because they were the incumbent party during a prolonged period of inflation.** Above a certain threshold, the cost of living hurts and voters pin that tail on whatever donkey is in the White House. Home prices/interest rates, cost of gas, food, etc., you name it, Democrats took the blame for it. It does not matter that the stock market was surging all throughout or that the jobless rate stayed really low. Most people don't have much, if anything, invested inthe stock market, and whatever pay bump they got during the Biden years didn't keep up with the cost of food and gas. They were feeling the pain literally every time they swiped the ol debit card. To a voter, these are the only economic figures that matter - how many fucking hours do I have to work to pay for this bag of groceries? If the answer is \\"lots,\\" you're going to lose the election. It doesn't matter if its your fault, the buck stops with the sitting president and his party. The incumbent party/candidate owns the economic conditions of their term and right or wrong voters didn't feel like they were personally better off than they were under Trump. They wanted an alternative and they got it. **Point 2 subpart b - the Democrats were fucked from the jump because they not only owned inflation, but had no answer for it, no ability to deal with it, and made the dumb shit mistake of saying so.** To the extent that the Democrats did spin their wheels on \\"the issues,\\" it's arguable that they were fucked no matter what simply because they were the incumbent party during several consecutive years of unaffordable housing and sky-high grocery prices, and the only answer they had (indeed the only answer they could give owing to the limited control the President has to control consumer prices) was to blame \\"greedflation\\" and rattle their saber about big corporations. People ain't tryna hear that and it doesn't matter that Trump will face the same complete lack of leverage with respect to prices - he was telling them what they want to hear which is that \\"I'll make it better, I have a plan.\\" Is that bullshit? Probably. Does he have any more control over prices than Biden did? Nope, not unless he intends to rule by fiat (maybe!). Either way, that sounds way better to voters than \\"what the fuck do you expect me to do about it?\\"(side note, the Democrats - and only the Democrats - have this realy irritating, counterproductive tendency to confuse campaigning with governing, and to treat elections like policy roundtables. You see this play out every time a democratic pundit or the Post or the Times \\"fact checks\\" Trump and nobody gives a shit. To be fair, part of the problem is that the democrats, as the adults in the room, are held to a higher standard  in this regard. No one expects republicans to do anything but dribble on their tits and rant about immigrants during campaign season, and they somehow benefit from this. But, I digress. Bottom line, campaigning is advertising. Cynical but true, and the Republicans understand this better than the Democrats. That \\"Trump is for us, Kamala is for they/them\\" line? That was *killer.* Whoever wrote that ad got a bag, I guarantee. Say what you will about the substance but that is a fucking great line, and it probably mattered a little. And the Democrats had nothing in the clip, at least that mattered to persuadable voters.) **Point 3 - the Democrats lost in part because they owned a legitimate immigration crisis and had no good answers for it.** You had Kamala Harris on the record saying she couldn't thing of a thing she'd have done differently about immigration if she was President instead of Biden. That plays really, really, really, really fucking badly against campaign ads about busloads of migrants in tent cities and illegal immigrants attacking cops and stabbing commuters in NYC.**TLDR:** Identity politics is necessary but insufficient to explain the outcome of the election and its not enough to say that Trump won because his voters won't elect a black woman. It's more accurate to say that identity politics mattered more on a strategic/operational basis, in that the Republicans were able to get their voters to the polls by leveraging far left positions on immigration and transgender rights against the entire Democratic party, while the democrats a) overestimated their support from women, latinos and blacks while also continuing to lose men particularly young men, and b) failed to offer an alternative vision rather than relying on the fact that Trump is a sundowning convicted felon and incipient autocrat. Basically, instead of advocating an actual policy position that would appeal to voters, they did the John Oliver thing and just started screaming LOOK AT THIS SHIT, DO YOU WANT THIS GUY BACK IN OFFICE?! And they got their answer. As a wise man once told me, never ask a question you don't want to hear the answer to. And I think economic issues mattered way more, objectively, and more than you seem to think because Biden and by extension Harris and the rest of the democratic party owned inflation even if there was nothing they could do about it. Trump won by default on this because he hasn't been in office since 2020, and wasn't responsible for having to come up with a solution. He offered voters an alternative and promised to fix it, while the Democrats did neither. And, significantly, factual, objective reality is not relevant to this calculus.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"Your first mistake is believing that there is a group called conspiracist and the second is believing they all agree on anything.","title":"The Coronavirus Pandemics final report is very damning .

Nor does this deprive of Greece of the rights to condemn Turkey for that genocide, and call the international stage to do the same. The two things are completely distinct, and a pragmatic brief alliance between Greece and Turkey does not forgive or erase what Turkey did to its Greek population. Even today the Greeks do not really hate the Turks, though they still strongly dislike Turkey's attitude to the Greek Genocide it had perpetrated. Contemporary Greeks are more focused on contemporary issues with Turkey (like Turkey's threats of war against Greece). Back in the 1950s the Greeks basically even thought relations with Turkey were so good, that they would have no issue with Cyprus uniting with Greece (due to the small percentage of Muslim population there, alike in Western Thrace or the Dodecanese or Crete). What would you prefer instead? A pathologically hateful Greece towards Turkey? Please, please do not dilute the meaning of genocide because it is convenient for your political/nationalistic agenda.  \\nGenocide is characterized by the existence of genocidal intent. The deliberate and systematic extermination of the Greeks of Turkey, that led to the eradication of Christians in Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, was by all means intentional, which is evident even from the diplomatic communications between Turkey and Germany (where it was explicably stated as intending to erase all Greek element from the aforementioned regions). It is not a matter of any political or ultranationalist agenda, that would be the refusal of that historical reality.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"And Chasten is from Michigan","title":"Democrats eye Pete Buttigieg for potential run for Michigan governor"},{"text":"His husband is from Michigan","title":"Democrats eye Pete Buttigieg for potential run for Michigan governor"},{"text":"Ooo the classic jaq-off/sealioning.","title":"Why Democrats Got the Politics of Immigration So Wrong for So Long"},{"text":"His husband is a Michigander","title":"Democrats eye Pete Buttigieg for potential run for Michigan governor"},{"text":"That was how they worked in the 17th century.

Therefore, some large-scale businesses used other forms of association; for example, Andrew Carnegie formed his steel operation as a limited partnership and John D. Rockefeller set up Standard Oil as a corporate trust.In the late 19th century, state governments started to adopt more permissive corporate lawsSo it seems the rich and powerful have created loop holes which needed to be opened more.

However, this BLA was given priority review status, which stipulates that the process should be completed in around 8 months, therefore setting an ADD of mid-January 2022. Details provided by Dr. Gruber, and her deputy, Dr. Krause, indicated that high-level FDA officials imparted significant pressure on them to continually accelerate the timeline despite their concerns that safety and efficacy of the vaccines would suffer.The committee also included MTG, quite possibly the dumbest person in congress, so that doesn't fill me with confidence either.

We are being destroyed by this corrupt lawlessness and they are expecting us to take the high road. Answer these things tit for tat. Id say this :Did Hunter make a mistake? Yes. However unfortunately our government does not allow us to have a fair trial or treat both parties equally when we are talking about Justice. Hunter is an recovering addict who made mistakes and if you looked at the looses he suffered in his life anyone who has dealt with tragedy and trauma will understand what he and we all went through together. Its enough to break you completely and honestly as a father I do blame myself in many ways I put the needs of the Country first or maybe I dealt with my trauma differently. Then we lost Beau and again our lives were in disarray. That is no excuse for his actions but I hope you will understand mine. Im his father and I have sacrificed a lot for this Country and because of that my son suffers, I have the power to shield him and I am at the end of it all his father. He has been sober and clean for a long time and because I am your President members of the Republican Party shared his personal life on the floor of Congress for the world to see, not because Hunter has anything to do with the US Government but just to be cruel and evil to me. Meanwhile actual employees of the American Government and Children of the US President Donald Trump were actively involved in many things that failed and some of which led to them having financial gains in the private sector. Which is the same thing they falsely accused Hunter of doing. Example 1. Ivanka was placed in charge of the EIDL and PPP loan program. Where she worked with the lenders and SBA. Under her leadership the wealthy were the most likely beneficiaries of the SMALL BUSINESS LOANS and large banks even ones that were known to have been involved in fraudulent lending in the past were the biggest lenders. As most people know the money went to billionaires like Mitch McConnells father in law and others and there were millions in fraudulent loans. When my administration was incompetent charge we started with the poorest communities first. There were also no checks for any suspicious activity on the Trump loans. Jared Trump was asked to oversee the Kashoggi murder. Its required by law to inform a person in the US they are in danger and we failed to warn Jamal. No one was punished. Saudi was allowed to blame someone random. No one important was blamed. After Jared and Ivanka leave the White House they end up managing $3 billion dollars for the Saudis. Unless the GOP are investigating that, then the justice system isnt working fairly or justly.","title":"Only about 2 in 10 Americans approve of Biden's pardon of his son Hunter, an AP-NORC poll finds"},{"text":"It's very weird reading an article that argues that Democrats need to move to the centre on immigration and also work in a bipartisan manner with moderate Republicans but doesn't mention that, err, Democrats worked on a bipartisan immigration bill that Trump purposely sabotaged.","title":"Democrats Dont Have an Easy Way Out (Gift Article)"},{"text":"Prove it","title":"Biden Says He Regrets Not Signing Name to Covid Checks Like Trump Did"},{"text":"I don't approve of it, but I also don't really give a shitoh no, the octogenarian president pardoned his only living child, whatever will I domuch worse people have been pardoned for doing much worse","title":"Only about 2 in 10 Americans approve of Biden's pardon of his son Hunter, an AP-NORC poll finds"},{"text":"So what this is America theyll forget about it in two weeks","title":"Only about 2 in 10 Americans approve of Biden's pardon of his son Hunter, an AP-NORC poll finds"},{"text":"  Its clear people careEvidence required.To whom is it clear?

Typically, the tyrannical minority finds ways to placate the majority of the population to keep them from becoming too dissatisfied. Others utilize existing societal beliefs (or introduce new ones) to sway the majority to support something that, if they saw the full extent of it, they might not find all that pleasant. Many use fear tactics to induce people to support the tyranny and then use that to justify their actions.In fact, I might argue that there are few if any cases of a tyranny of the majority. All are of the minority in power, just that most find ways to sway public opinion to support them.Even with the Nazi example you gave, most people under Nazi rule had no power to determine policy. Even most Germans had been convinced in a moment of fear to surrender their authority to affect anything. The nazis were technically a minority who deceived or subjugated the majority. For instance, one of the first things the nazis did was to require Germans to only use approved radios that couldn't receive foreign broadcasts and would only receive channels the government approved of.","title":"CMV: it's much harder to combat a Tyranny of majority compared to a Tyranny of minority"},{"text":"Ah I see what you are saying, I was thinking you meant the original contaminant as methylene chloride (which is highly toxic when inhaled compared to TCE and its metabolites).

The Sistine Chapel is special because a person painted it. There's a story behind that. There's a story behind those famous pictures that people take, like the Migrant Mother, that a person wanted to tell. The photographer was inspired or outraged or moved by a scene and had to immortalize it on film. AI art doesn't have this because the actual artist, the AI, doesn't feel anything. It wasn't inspired by anything. It is a mindless, soulless machine simply outputting what it interprets the prompt to be.Is painting a portrait necessarily better than illustrating the same portrait with a digital stylus just because you had to source the paints? Maybe to you it is, but the preferred methods behind the product are ultimately subjective choice.The two are incomparable because they're two different forms of art. A painting is judged differently than a photograph because there are different skills involved. Even a photoshopped picture is judged differently than the same picture taken by a photograph.

History shows that majority tyranny is actually easier to combat than minority tyranny. Here's why:Minority tyranny maintains power through sophisticated systems of control - military, police, surveillance, economic leverage. Look at South Africa's apartheid or modern North Korea. The minority doesn't need popular support, they just need guns and money.But majority oppression? That's actually more fragile because it relies on social consensus, which can be broken down piece by piece. The LGBTQ example you mentioned actually proves my point - in just a few decades, we've seen massive shifts in public opinion through activism, media representation, and personal connections. Same with racial segregation in the US.Plus, minority groups facing majority prejudice can build strong internal communities and support networks. They can leverage international pressure and allies within the majority. A dictator's inner circle has no such backup - once their power structure cracks, they're done.I'd argue your view of \\"consensus toppling dictatorships\\" is oversimplified. Syria, Belarus, Myanmar - all show how a well-armed minority can maintain control despite majority opposition. But social attitudes around gender, race, sexuality? Those have changed dramatically because majorities can be educated and persuaded over time.","title":"CMV: it's much harder to combat a Tyranny of majority compared to a Tyranny of minority"},{"text":"BRAG IS THE CAUSE of Neely death.","title":"Lawless, defenseless, gunless, helpless and hopeless is where they want us."},{"text":"It wasnt a message, though.

That being the case, it wants for the area along its border to not be controlled by SDF.\\nSimultaneously, Turkey has had a huge amount of Syrian refugees, more than all other nations combined at over three million (though obviously Syria has more internally displaced). These are VERY unpopular so it would be electorally beneficial to return them ASAP. Previously Assad was not interested in talking with Turkey about return of refugees and they were reluctant to go back to Assad anyway so Turkey was looking to kill two birds with one stone by clearing out areas along the border with Syria from SDF control and return refugees to the strip. The problem is that the refugees are mostly Sunni Arabs whereas the border with Turkey is mostly made up of predominately Kurdish areas so this is considered by some as an attempt to change the ethnic makeup of the area from Kurdish to Arab. And the most amenable militia Turkey has been working with, the SNA, has been quite ruthless and cruel to SDF forces and some civilians when it comes to control areas so that inspires a lot of Kurdish people to flee when they take control of an area.\\nIt looks like now with the toppling of Assad though that refugees are now able to return to wherever in the whole of Syria outside of Israeli occupied parts (checkpoints for this are now apparently open 24/7) so that part of the equation is becoming alleviated. Regarding the SDF it has been attacked by SNA and Turkey since the start of the operations against Assad and has lost some more major areas on the border, now there is only a very small stretch of territory at Ayn al Arab separating the SNA/Turkish controlled buffer zones. SDF is also in a pickle because now that Assad is gone and the new Syrian government is on the border a lot of the Arab populations of their forces are figuring theyd prefer to defect or rebel to being aligned with the new government rather than remaining under a structure that is Kurdish dominated at the top, so theyve been losing territory west of the Euphrates.\\nBut anyway to make it short for what they want and are acting towards currently, Turkey does not want the border area to be controlled by SDF because they fear that PKK will be able to operate freely just out of reach. Whether that be they and their SNA militia controlling the region along the border or if they will put their trust in the majority HTS government to control the border remains to be seen. That will probably be a stumbling block in negotiations between the SDF and HTS which are apparently ongoing.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Jennifer Granholm was from Canada.

China and Russia are the US and NATOs biggest advisories on the world stage and no one disputes this. The US would indeed be strong with an alliance with RU and China but that will never happen. The point of NATO is nuclear deterrence. Russia has nuclear weapons, even after the collapse of the USSR they had the power to destroy the Earth. Instead of having every country in Europe build up a nuclear arsenal to defend themselves against a nuclear threat, they created an alliance with another nation (the US) that could respond to a nuclear threat. So yes NATO was created as an alliance against the Soviet Union, but more accurately it created an alliance against the Nuclear threat that is Russia - a nuclear threat which is still very active and currently becoming more and more volatile by the day. Currently the US is sending billions to fight against Russia, you could argue that we are already at war with them, since it is our weapons being used and likely our intelligence as well. Russia boarders multiple other NATO nations that now more than ever need the reliance of the US protection. China is the US biggest threat since they have a military that rivals ours, have more people, and their economy is quickly overtaking ours. Whats more, the US has vowed that we will defend Taiwan if it is ever attacked, and China has vowed that it WILL try to claim Taiwan (which is a nice way of saying invade). Both sides have said this is non-negotiable, so barring any momentous or sudden shift in policies on both sides, this is an inevitability.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"Melanin or the lack of has no effect on thought.There's nothing progressive, democratic, or liberal about Dogmacrats.

Many of the policies you have mentioned are have existed in the early-republic era for identity construction, but not anymore. I am a Turkish of Circassian descent and my fathers main tongue is Circassian. It is true the language was suppressed in the past, but not really anymore. My dad can and does openly speak in Circassian on street and no one cares, same with Kurdish. There are also minority language TV channels, newspapers, elective classes for children to learn their minority languages. I hope for more progress like recognition of minority languages in the parliament and constitution, but the current situation is far from banning the languages. As a visibly Circassian, I have never felt I have been treated as a second class while growing up for being a non Turk. I even sang folk Circassian songs in my school concerts and received only appreciation. I also dont think my ethnic root is a obstacle in seeing myself nationally Turkish. Most chunk of the Turkish society couldnt care less of someones ethnicity. We are all very mixed up anyway and despite the Twitter jokes we dont see this as fake culture, we see it as our richness. I believe the West is more obsessed of our ethnicities than we are. The Western people asking me how to be a true Caucasian or people questioning if the eartquakes victims are Kurds and thats why we didnt help them while we have been crying and running to help them in every possible day for months, is insane for me.About Hagia Sophia, Erdogan is a populist politician not much different than Trump in terms of religious nationalism. I really advise you guys to not to take Hagia Sophia conversion too deeply. Although it was definitely sad to see how a monument symbolizing peace and harmony was made a political islamist symbol to me, if you read a bit history Hagia Sophia always have been a victim of political propaganda. Its still there and its gonna be there. As such symbolist acts of Erdogan lost its magic, I am very sure current status of HS is temporary and its gonna be a museum again shortly after Erdogan is gone.Edit: you guys can downvote as much as you want for saying what I have experienced someone raising in Turkey as a minority.

Democrats ran on the strength of the economy, but ignored that nobody cares about the *rate* of inflation as long as they suffer from the consequences of that inflation. A lot of things caused high inflation on basic consumer goods, like eggs.Did you know that last year a jury in Illinois found that egg producers conspired to fix prices from 2004 to 2008 by limiting the supply of eggs, as alleged in a 2011 lawsuit? Did you know that we've had several egg shortages since 2020, causing the price of eggs to increase? Do I need to spell it out for you, or can you piece it together that Democrats had a slam-fucking-dunk to pin the cost of eggs on corporate meddling and promise to punish the conspirators and bring prices down?This is what I mean. Regardless of whether this particular bout of inflation is the product of corporate conspiracy, the conspiracy exists. I say \\"lie\\" but it's not even really a lie, it's just not relying on facts. It's not even that big of a leap to say if they could do it in 2008 (and they need to hit on that year, the year of the great recession) they can do it in 2024.Same goes for the other things I pointed out. People are so mad about health insurance that an insurance company CEO gets murdered and people are mad the assassin got caught. Why do we even have private health insurance?

Ill try and summarize: Joel Greenburg was a tax collector in Florida who gambled tax money on crypto and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars (lol.) He was simultaneously having sex with dozens of women whom he met on a Sugar Daddy website. One of those women turned out to be 17. Rather than cut ties and claim ignorance, he used his position to steal someones identity and printed this underage girl off an actual, of age Florida ID. Greenburg gets investigated by the FBI for the crypto scam and this is all gets uncovered and also results in sex trafficking charges for the underage minor. Somewhere along the line Gaetz has sexual relations with this girl who is using a false identity of someone who is of age at a party that Greenburg was also at. Gaetz most likely had no idea who this woman was or that she was a minor but there was most likely a honeypot operation going on at parties with this 17 year old using a false identity to entrap people. Some guys who were most likely in on the honeypot use this sexual relationship with the 17 y/o fake identity girl and Gaetz to try and extort Gaetz father for $25 million dollars. They spin up an Iranian hostage extraction operation for a guy who was captured by Iran over a decade ago and is probably dead. They told Don Gaetz that if he funds the hostage extraction, he will secure a pardon for Matt Gaetz. No one has any fucking clue what is going on so the Gaetz contact the FBI who then opens an investigation and criminally charges and secures plea deals for the extortion attempt The FBI very quickly dropped the investigation into Matt Gaetz because they knew the minor he allegedly had sex with was using a stolen identity she had schemed up with Greenburg. What happened to Gaetz reeks of a fed honeypot. https://youtu.be/xm8vDgTvb3o?si=2pGCyOXTVoRMh6ub","title":"Report: Top Ethics Committee Democrat Leaked Matt Gaetz Report Details, Violating Sworn Oath"},{"text":" People tend to trust...

The conclusion was that the value of wearing masks was approximately zero.844 There is just no evidence that they make any difference. Full stop.845\`When Cochrane has said  [this](https://www.cochrane.org/news/statement-physical-interventions-interrupt-or-reduce-spread-respiratory-viruses-review) about that very study:\`Many commentators have claimed that a recently-updated Cochrane Review shows that 'masks don't work', which is an inaccurate and misleading interpretation.\`\`It would be accurate to say that the review examined whether interventions to promote mask wearing help to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, and that the results were inconclusive.

Somehow, like Sideshow Bob stepping into rakes non-stop, the Democrats at the national and local level have only stressed the unpopular parts AND taken the unpopular position.Democrats didn't really talk about these things, which was the problem. That let Republicans define their positions on those things to voters. Everyone is against illegal border crossings and policies of both Democratic and Republican administrations reflect that. But Republicans were able to conflate people crossing the border to enter the asylum system with illegal border crossings, and explaining the difference is too complicated too people, and they don't really care. Most people don't know about the asylum system, and it was never designed to be used in the way that it was being used post Covid. So in people's minds it wasn't really any different than illegal immigration, and it was hard to explain to them otherwise.The Biden administration did eventually clamp down on entries into the asylum system (after Republicans refused to do so I might add), but by that time it was already after a 1.5 years of the system being overwhelmed, and Biden had lost a lot of credibility on the issue by then.","title":"Why Democrats Got the Politics of Immigration So Wrong For So Long"},{"text":"Cuz it is.

A couple points first: We had universal programs that raised a generation of Americans out of the great depression.It's almost unanimously agreed by economists that while the new deal helped to stabilize the economy, world war II production, not the new deal, was the key contributing factor to lifting America out of the depression. We had civil rightsHuh? Most of those reforms weren't until the late 60s or 70s and even then the anti civil rights (drug infusion into black communities, higher incarceration, e.g.) persisted into the 80s and even until the turn of the millenium. Then everything changed when the Ronald Regan attacked.Appreciate this reference. The problem is that this rests on the belief that society should always get better. Unlimited growth is not sustainable.... Things are ultimately way better than they were 100 years ago. While I agree that unlimited growth isn't sustainable, continuous improvement is. It's true that virtually everyone is better off than their counterpart from 1924, and that there are more of us, but there are still problems that can be addressed, which brings me to the crux of the argument: Democrats are hopeless because they lack unity in their cause. To explain: Democrats/Liberals/Progressives are, as the name implies, interested in progress, in change, in improvement (or what they feel to be improvement). However, within the party there are competing opinions and interests on the direction that progress should take. Do we care about racial injustice or income inequality. Is immigration, healthcare, or college tuition the bigger issue. To some, some of these issues might not even be on the radar while to others, they are seismic. To all, each issue carries a different weight of interest.This translates to different candidates who care about different things. Joe Biden might have polled well with college age adults by promising to forgive large amounts of tuition, but for a moderate, middle-aged dixiecrat. That issue might be irrelevant or even one they oppose. And that sort of pattern is natural with those seeking progress.On the other hand, republicans/conservatives are more concerned with conservation of the existing power structure, which is a united front. If the system has worked well for you (and to be sure, for the vast majority, republican or democrat, it has), what incentive do you have to change?So I don't think having high expectations is the issue. Obamacare was a high expectation that improved the lives of millions by giving them access to healthcare that they didn't previously have. What's plaguing the democrats is that they have too many competing players trying like salespeople to entice voters with too many varying incentives.","title":"CMV: The reason things seem so politically hopeless in America for the left is because their expectations are too high"},{"text":"Yeah I'm not quite sure if we yank out insurance companies, what all of a sudden drives prices on medicine, medical labor, etc down.","title":"Health Care Is NOT a Difficult Problem to Fix"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|qN7NZR3Q5R2mY|downsized)","title":"Joe and Jill Biden give Kamala Harris and Doug the cold shoulder in very awkward encounter at Kennedy Center Honors"},{"text":"Daniel Penny never faced homicide charges.

And Turkey was undergoing significant restructuring and rebuilding post WW1 and the Greco-Turkish War.Contrary to this, Greece had to deal with an unscathed Bulgaria, that was claiming Macedonia and Western Thrace, practically having suffered no damage through WW1. Greece was so paranoid over that matter that there was even a Greco-Bulgarian War in 1925, over a border skirmish, with Greece pre-emptively invading Petrich, a Bulgarian border-town, out of paranoia that the Bulgarians would be invading first. In the meantime, there had also been the Corfu Incident in 1923, when Italy actually captured the Greek island of Kerkyra for a whole month. When Venizelos nominated Ataturk in 1934, it had been after a whole decade of tensions between these two countries, and Greece was looking for any ally possible, hence why Greece organized the Balkan Pact specifically against Bulgaria (prompting Turkey to join due to their own fears over Bulgaria invading Eastern Thrace and capturing Istanbul).","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"Xbiden is brain dead to enjoy any kickbacks.

I'm going to play the devil's advocate here as that is the point of this subreddit.  \\n  \\nWhy was Turkey added to NATO and should Turkey be expelled?  \\n  \\n- Turkey is an ally because of their strategic significance and their removal would likely be catastrophic for the balance of power.  \\n   - Turkey was added to NATO because of the strategic position it held.  Turkey controls the Bosphorus Strait between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.  This is key because it serves as a major limiter to Russia's ability to leverage naval power.  As Russia's primary warm water port is Sevastopol and it's secondary warm water port is Novorossiysk, control of this strait is key.  We saw the effect of this during the Ukraine war as Russia has been unable to move ships from the Baltic sea or Mediterranean Sea into the Black sea to fight Ukraine because Turkey closed the passage of military ships through the Bosphorus (in line with international treaty obligations).  A nation that shifted against NATO and the west may have been willing to allow Russia through.  \\n   - In addition, Turkey represents the largest military in NATO outside of the US.  \\n  \\nWhy is Turkey against the Kurdish people  \\n  \\n- Turkey is against the Kurdish people for the same reason every other country in the area is, the Kurdish people have been attempting to break away and form Kurdistan.  \\n   - Kurdistan is a nation that the Kurdish people have been attempting to create for decades.  The map of Kurdistan that they're fighting for takes land from Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and other nations.  It is why all of these nations have waged campaigns and wars against the Kurdish people who have operated semi autonomously and attempted to break away.    \\n   - In an effort to break away from Turkey and other nations, the Kurdish people have used violent means to achieve this goal including active fighting, terrorist attacks, bombings, and more.  \\n   - [Here is a map of Kurdistan](https://www.institutkurde.org/images/cartes_and_maps/cartkurd.gif)\\n   - To be clear, I am not arguing that the Kurdish fight is good or bad, I'm just explaining why all the surrounding countries have been constantly fighting them.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"The ironic part is that it's usually the rich who are more Marxist.","title":"Progressives want major DNC reforms"},{"text":"Stick to a train of thought or this isn't a conversation. I myself am a Turkish Kurd.Something I find fascinating about the discourse around Kurds is people very rarely ask *us* what we think.So I will speak plainly. You're welcome to look into the surveys and election histories which back this up, if your curiosity is sincere.The vast majority of us do not support separatism. We have no desire to pull a 'Brexit' from Turkey and become part of some new landlocked state merged with bits of Iraq and Syria. We do not see ourselves as 'one' with Kurds from other regions. We have different cultures, customs, and contrary to popular belief we don't even share a language.The PKK is a terrorist group. They attack Kurds, as well as Turks. And I don't mean just as accidental collateral. They have bombed airports in the Kurdish majority parts of Turkey. Kurdish streets. Assassinated Kurdish MPs who chose to honour the wishes of their constituents rather than bend to the will of a terrorist group operating out of the mountains near the borders.What is contentious is the exact nature of the relationship between the PKK and the YPG. That involves a lot of assumptions one way or the other and is a topic I won't attempt to persuade you on. The Turkish position is that they are effectively the same network of fighters operating under different brand names.The PKK will never stop attacking Turkey until they achieve their goal of annexing huge swathes of Southern and South-Eastern Turkey. That has ways been their agenda. The current tension with the AANES boils down to the fact that the YPG is their de facto military, and Turkey *already* considered the YPG to be the PKK but with a new coat of paint such that the Americans could supply them with military gear in the war against, well, anyone I guess because that was was a shower of shit.That doesn't excuse every or even most actions undertaken. But it doesn't appear that you're making an honest and sincere attempt to understand where we slot into Turkish society.And you're doing the oh so typical Western thing of blurring us into a single hegemony, as though despite wanting to remain Turkish, we owe it to tribes from other countries to allow ourselves to be absorbed by them and transition into a degraded quality of life, divorced from out Turkish cultural heritage.What do I owe other Kurds? Is it because we share... blood? Is that it, the justification for an ethnostate which disregards *our* right to self-determine by drowning us out with the noise of people we have very little connection to?I don't know much about you personally. But this sudden wave of support for other Kurds which ignores us seems to be getting peddled by the usual suspects online, which is to say tankies.All I ask is this: whatever your opinion on Turkish foreign policy, please for the love of God, stop trying to make the same mistake the West keeps fucking making.The last time patronising Western interference meddled in the region in this manner, we ended up with Israel-Palestine. Now the West is angry about Israel being an ethnostate or something. Cool, I get that.But man I get a weird feeling of deja vu watching how you people are convinced that *this time*, a Western-promoted ethnostate in the Middle-East is gonna work for sure. And that's why I bring up tankies. Because in my heart of hearts, I don't believe for a moment that a Kurdish state with neoliberal ambitions would enjoy anywhere near this level of support.I'm sure you'll probably have some quip about how long this was or something. I get it, but you know, I'm a Kurd. This matters to me, I'm sick of being treated like a football by champaign socialists, and people who say they're interested in the region would do well to actually *ask*.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"There's a small chance tariffs or a national sales tax slowly bleed across the the Republican/libertarian line into progressivism when they realize ubi is the easiest way to undo the regressive nature","title":"Biden points to the one thing he learned from Trump (and hes right) | \\n\\"I also learned something from Donald Trump: He signed checks for people ... and I didnt,\\" President Joe Biden jokingly complained."},{"text":"And even then the media couldnt fucking shut up about Trump.

The Turks organized and used their right to self defense and kicked out the occupying forces in 1922.Greece only invaded Anatolia in 1919, which was 6 years after the purges of Greeks of the Ottoman State had began since mid-1913, with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople declaring itself in persecution in early 1914. As a consequence to that, many hundred thousands of West Anatolian Greeks and East Thrace Greeks had fled to Greece, causing a massive refugee crisis, and in extension to it, major economic and social problems, which Greece sought to ameliorate by taking over parts of Anatolia and resettling these Greek refugees back in their homeland. Since diplomacy of 6 years had failed to prevent Turks from butchering Greeks of Turkey by the hundred thousands, Greece simply resorted to different means of prevention. Greece did not just decide to attack Turkey out of the blue.The two sides reached an agreement to exchange populations in 1924. Venizelos, the prime minister of Greece at the time, nominated Ataturk, the commander of the Turkish armies that fought Greece and signed that agreement, for the Nobel Peace Prize.The only reason Venizelos sought to have good relations with Kemal was the fear of Greece being isolated, so since the issue with Turkey was basically deemed as to have been \\"solved\\", while there were many open issues with Bulgaria and Italy, Greece wanted to create a pact against them, mainly the former (hence why Turkey was part of the Balkan Pact).It is not as if Venizelos, or anyone in Greece, really thought that Mustafa Kemal was really worth for the Nobel Peace Prize. Modern Turkey whitewashes him, to the point of presenting him as a saint, but it is a case that under his leadership Turkey did not even abide to the cease of hostilities, but continued to execute civilians that were their own subjects, just because they were of the \\"wrong\\" ethnicity.On the 3/16 September 1922, a week after the entry of the Turks in Smyrna, the military commander of Smyrna Nuredin, under his 5th command, he gave order that all male Greeks and Armenians of age 18 to 45 are arrested. In practice, were arrested all males of age 15 to 55-60. Under the same command were called all families of Greeks and Armenians descending from the Asia Minor coasts to abandon the country until 17/30 September 1922. Those who could not leave until that specific date were considered possible threat against the security of the army and the public safety, with the result of being exiled into the interior of Asia Minor. There they were entered into the so-called \\"working legions\\" (Amele Taburu). \\\\[...\\\\] The conditions of life in them were tragic, as they presented the highest mortality rate even compared to the divisions that were sent to the war. It is stated that the average life duration in these legions was 2 months^(\\\\[1\\\\]). The Kemalists continued this practice.  \\n  \\nAccording to witnesses, it is estimated that from the region of Smyrna and the adjacent cities were arrested about 125,000-150,000 persons. On the British newspapers of the time they mention that according to turkish sources, 125,000 men had been arrested^(\\\\[2\\\\]). Aggelomatis speaks of more than 150,000, including women and children. The envoy of the League of Nations for the Refugees, Nansen, observed in November 1922 that refugees from Asia Minor were mostly women and children and old men^(\\\\[3\\\\]). According to information delivered to the Parliament of the Greeks in 1924, around 270,000 citizens had been arrested by the Turks^(\\\\[4\\\\]) \\\\[...\\\\]. The visits of the International Red Cross and the organization Near East Relief were allowed only after many months following the Asia Minor Disaster \\\\[September 1922\\\\], while before had preceded many mass slaughters of captives or thousands deaths in the working legions.  \\n  \\nOut of the hundreds of thousands of civilians arrested by the Turks, all were almost totally exterminated. In Greece only 320 persons returned - among them there were no women and children.  \\n  \\n1)  Memorandum by Mr. Rendel on Turkish Atrocities between March and October 1922, 30 October 1922, Papers of Fridtjof Nansen, League of Nations Arvices, R1709 (1922).

The Turks organized and used their right to self defense and kicked out the occupying forces in 1922. The two sides reached an agreement to exchange populations in 1924. Venizelos, the prime minister of Greece at the time, nominated Ataturk, the commander of the Turkish armies that fought Greece and signed that agreement, for the Nobel Peace Prize.Prior to 1915, the Armenian group Dashnaks were terrorizing civilians in Eastern Turkey with support from Russia, with the hope of removing Turks from the area so that Armenians can become a majority and establish a nation state. The Ottomans response was similar to Israels response to Hamas,  and many landlords used this as an opportunity to steal land and wealth from Armenians. The crimes committed against Armenians in 1915 were recognized by Turkey and some of the perpetrators were brought to justice up until the partitioning of Turkey by European powers. After the European powers attempted to give eastern Turkey to Armenian SSR and Armenian volunteers dominated the French Army that invaded Southern Turkey and abused civilians, Turkey chose to defend itself against invaders. In the 1970s and 80s Soviet-founded and funded ASALA terrorized Turkish diplomats and civilians and this was enabled by European governments. Turkey defended itself singlehandedly from the terror of ASALA (only Israel helped). If the Armenian diaspora did not choose to becoming a pawn against Turkey by the Europeans, that story would have been very different.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"Wrong.The left is actively encouraging and celebrating murder.

The FIVE strongest arguments in favor of the lab leak theory include:1. The virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature.\\n2. Data shows that all COVID-19 cases stem from a single introduction into humans. This runs contrary to previous pandemics where there were multiple spillover events.\\n3. Wuhan is home to Chinas foremost SARS research lab, which has a history of conducting gain-of-function research at inadequate biosafety levels.\\n4. Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) researchers were sick with a COVID-like virus in the fall of 2019, months before COVID-19 was discovered at the wet market.\\n5. By nearly all measures of science, if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced.**PROXIMAL ORIGIN PUBLICATION**: The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2 publication  which was used repeatedly by public health officials and the media to discredit the lab leak theory  was prompted by Dr. Fauci to push the preferred narrative that COVID-19 originated in nature.**GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH**: A lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is most likely the origin of COVID-19. Current government mechanisms for overseeing this dangerous gain-of-function research are incomplete, severely convoluted, and lack global applicability.**ECOHEALTH ALLIANCE INC. (ECOHEALTH)**: EcoHealth  under the leadership of Dr. Peter Daszak  used U.S. taxpayer dollars to facilitate dangerous gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China. After the Select Subcommittee released evidence of EcoHealth violating the terms of its National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) commenced official debarment proceedings and suspended all funding to EcoHealth.* New evidence also shows that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an investigation into EcoHealths pandemic-era activities.**NIH FAILURES**: NIHs procedures for funding and overseeing potentially dangerous research are deficient, unreliable, and pose a serious threat to both public health and national security. Further, NIH fostered an environment that promoted evading federal record keeping laws  as seen through the actions of Dr. David Morens and FOIA Lady Marge Moore.","title":"The Coronavirus Pandemics final report is very damning .

Turkey is a restrictive ethnostate that has as an organizational policy nearly consistently repressing all non-Turks in its vicinity. Turkey should be ejected from NATO and made a pariah state.This is no different whether the ruler was Ataturk, Erdogan, or any of the intermediate persons; Turkey made it clear that Non-Turks lived in Turkey only at the behest of the Turks.During the Turkish War of Independence, Greeks were hunted and expelled from Smyrna, Armenians were hunted and expelled from Marash, and Assyrians barely held onto to Tur Abdin. Never mind, of course, that hundreds of locations in Turkey were intentionally renamed so as to remove the Greek, Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, or Laz origins of these places.Ataturk was responsible for rehabilitating Reshit Bey, the leader of the Seyfo or Assyrian Genocide that occurred contemporaneously with the Armenian Genocide. (Of course, both genocides along with the Genocide of the Pontic Greeks are, per Turkish law, still denied and that denial is not only taught in Turkey but intentionally sold to the world through paid spokesmen.)Ataturk ordered the massacre at Dersim, which even Ataturk supporters acknowledge was an atrocious human rights abuse against the Kurds.Many Christian sites were confiscared and continue to be confiscated. We should note that it's not just that Erdogan converted Hagia Sophia into a mosque, but that he routinely confiscated Assyrian (Christian) religious sites as recently as 2016 and, despite pressure from Assyrian organizations worldwide, only returned around 30% of the sites confiscated to the Assyrian people.During World War II, the Turkish government passed the Verlik Vergisi, which was a tax designed to expropriate all of the wealth held by Turkey's remaining Greeks, Armenians, and Jews. Failure to pay the amounts (which were greater than the total amount these people owned in many cases) resulted in forced trips to labor camps. This only ended when the Allied Powers forced Turkey to stop.In the 1970s, with the rise of the Grey Wolves movement, the Turkish government began a wholescale attack on the Kurds in the southeast and terrorism towards minorities throughout the country. In the southeast, the violence innaugurated by the Turkish Republic resulted in 2MM Kurds becoming internally displaced and, up to today, around 40,000 deaths.Erdogan's policy is not unique but a symptom of the underlying values of the Turkish Republic, as codified in the Constitution of 1980, Article 66 that every citizen of the Republic is a Turk -- ignoring Turkey's multiplicity of idenitities.Turkey should not just be condemned but it should be a pariah state like Iran.","title":"CMV: The Turkish government should face condemnation for attacking Kurds and the general persecution of them, and they also should be condemned for their persecution of Christians."},{"text":"I dont see him beating Whitmer as much as I like Pete.","title":"Democrats eye Pete Buttigieg for potential run for Michigan governor"},{"text":"People around here are celebrating it too, Makes me sick","title":"2 assassination attempts, 1 dead American and now a dead CEO"},{"text":"The left only \\"celibates\\" re the 4B Movement. :)","title":"2 assassination attempts, 1 dead American and now a dead CEO"},{"text":"Yuuuup.?\\nIn 2020 there were so many people posting AMAs reddit about how they were running for Congress on long shot campaigns.

So under this criteria, why wouldn't drunk driving be irredeemable?\\nLonger answer - Redemption literally means exchange. You redeem a coupon to get a milkshake. Redemption has a religious twist once we introduce Christianity into the mix. Christ \\"redeemed\\" by exchanging his life for our own. In this way, redemption isn't a moral quality, but a theological question of whether you accept Christs trade or not. The modern moral concept of redemption generally is a metaphor for the theological - are you worthy of heaven. However, modern morality isn't a solved problem - different worldviews give different moral answers. So determining whether someone is morally worthy is indeterminate since we don't have a fixed set of rules. Finally, redemption has a literary meaning - a redemption arc, which ironically brings us back to the first definition. If a villain sacrifices his life to save the hero, then like the coupon for a milkshake he is literally exchanging himself for the life of another.?\\nDrunk drivers aren't making literal trades, so the first definition is out. You don't specify a theology so the second definition is out. You don't specify a moral system so the third definition becomes tricky. Under some moral systems drunk drivers might be redeemable but others wouldn't. If we assume innocence and moral purity are the standard, then drunk drivers would be disqualified. The last definition is also out of the question here since the drunk driver in question is still alive and therefore cannot have sacrificed herself.?\\nSince all the definitions are exhausted, how can you argue that she is redeemed?","title":"CMV: Drunk Drivers Arent Irredeemable, and Jamie Lee Komoroski's Case Shows That Mistakes Dont Define Someones Entire Character"},{"text":"This should be illegal.

He only started to chirp after it was put on his desk, and he realized it would do wonders for the PR of his now ending messy presidency. So, of course he SAID, \\"We want bigger checks! More money for the people! This is all CHINA'S fault!\\" before he signed the bills into law. The painfully sad reality is that many of these people actually believe that Trump is gonna give out another stimmy. They think the economy is currently so bad that it calls for that course of action. When the truth is that Republicans hated Trump's decision to issue the first checks, DURING A NATIONAL CRISIS THAT FROZE OUR ECONOMY! Trump was against the bill, calling it wasteful spending before he realized he could be remembered for it. The only thing that he actually advocated for was that his name had to be on all the checks, which actually delayed the crisis relief payments by 2 weeks. And it fucking worked. That's how dumb people are.","title":"Biden points to the one thing he learned from Trump (and hes right) | \\n\\"I also learned something from Donald Trump: He signed checks for people ... and I didnt,\\" President Joe Biden jokingly complained."},{"text":"It by all rights should be blocked by the FTC and, furthermore, was really shitty and massively worse than Nippon Steels?","title":"Biden Set to Finally Kill Nippon Steel Purchase of US Steel"},{"text":"How is this legal?","title":"Florida lawmaker abruptly switches to GOP shortly after winning election as Democrat"},{"text":"**Rule IV**: *Off-topic Comments*  \\nComments on submissions should substantively address the topic of submission and meaningfully contribute to the conversation.---  If you have any questions about this removal, [please contact the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fneoliberal).","title":"Biden Set to Finally Kill Nippon Steel Purchase of US Steel"},{"text":"first time here? what brigade brought you?","title":"Joe Rogan: \\"The House released a 500 page report on COVID-19 pandemic key findings ...

However, this BLA was given priority review status, which stipulates that the process should be completed in around 8 months, therefore setting an ADD of mid-January 2022. Details provided by Dr. Gruber, and her deputy, Dr. Krause, indicated that high-level FDA officials imparted significant pressure on them to continually accelerate the timeline despite their concerns that safety and efficacy of the vaccines would suffer.The committee also included MTG, quite possibly the dumbest person in congress, so that doesn't fill me with confidence either.

While it's easy to highlight the most glaring offenses and abuses, the context is more challenging to grapple with.Causes, both international and domestic, that get the most attention and support from the general public are those that garner the most attention. Building that attention is a big part of what activism is for, and if they haven't been successful, people aren't going to be invested in the situation/outcomes. Now as to why picking a side can be virtuous, particularly considering the level of effect you can have; that can be a bit more accessible. In the case of the Israel/Palestine conflict, many of the contours of that fight are intertwined with international relations (e.g. countries like the US acting upon them), and the US specifically. The US in particular can have a rather outsized effect on outcomes in the region through things like [funding ](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/14/fact-sheet-memorandum-understanding-reached-israel)(military support), [supporting where capitals should go](https://il.usembassy.gov/statement-by-president-trump-on-jerusalem/) (Diplomatic support), and [ensuring that people in harms way have a semblance of support](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/18/u-s-announcement-of-humanitarian-assistance-to-the-palestinian-people/) (humanitarian intervention). The US leaders that make choices about which if any of those things are a priority, are responsive (to a degree) to the voices of American citizens, as are businesses that interact with the space; so mass movements where people are collectively making choices to support, or not support, entities abroad can influence geopolitics by motivating leadership to make choices in that arena that align with their values.If you view something occurring in the world as evil, you can act as part of a group to have a positive effect on that issue. Sure, you can't dictate policy decisions, but you can influence them. There's a subjective component to that, but the point is that your actions can have an affect to a degree, particularly as a citizen of a nation that has an outsized effect on those affairs. If one sees injustice and chooses to act upon it, that is virtuous. Of course the problem with this conflict in particular, is a lack of consensus in the US about who the \\"real\\" victim is, hence the subjectivity here.Further, even if you just pick a side; you don't actually *have* to act upon it directly. Much of the public is not directly involved in protests and the like, but if there is passive support for those causes; the views of those individuals harboring that support empower those who are willing (or who have the bandwidth) to act by comprising/informing public sentiment. Public sentiment/opinion ultimately translates to votes, which too informs policy decisions; and also provides a context within which activism can be more effective, because to would be activists it makes the change their trying to create more plausible.Is that last bit virtue signaling? Maybe, but if a loud enough signal influences someone in power to make a change, is it really so insignificant? So... unvirtuous?","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"Makes one wonder if Biden is that clueless? ?If not, seems it borders on treasonous (to give our stated enemy access to cash)","title":"Biden Gave Iran $10 Billion in Sanctions Relief Days After Trump Won Election"},{"text":" The progressive activist idea of populist policy however is completely out of touch with what working class multiracial voters actually want.Well yeah, working class voters want manufacturing to come back to the states, trans people to disappear and immigrants to go away.

When ACA was being bounced around, there was a lot of talk about a nationwide VA Style Healthcare System for the poor.  Theyd pay nothing if truly poor, with very affordable premiums as income rose.  You know what the left said?  The VA system was broken and wasan example of why such a system would fail.  Now, today when we on the right scream our veterans need better care - the left says the VA health system is the envy of the world. Thing is we pay little attention to the cost of care. Pricing is supposed to be transparent now, but, if you go to a hospital website and to get an idea what a procedure costs, good luck.  Its a muck of obfuscation.  Which makes it extremely unlikely people will shop for procedures.  Physicians offer one to their fav clinic for an MRI, not because theyre the most cost effective.  But because they like how that MRI providers sales rep takes them golfing, or smiles at the Doc and flirts.  Same with pharmaceuticals.  Docs often prescribe extremely expensive medications no because theyre actually better and cost less, but because AMCE Pharmaceuticals has the rep they love, and pays for continuing education at 5 Star resorts, and brings their staff lunch every other week.  Insurers dont run on fat margins. A Quick look and net margins for 2023 were about 6%.  Theyre the largest insurer so folks see their net profit and it freaks them out. And I get that.  But if you look at the number of policy holders vs net profit, they could operate at zero and it wouldnt move the needle much at all.  A HUGE chunk of healthcare costs is administrative, because insurers have to basically follow Medicare guidelines, and guess what?  Theyre just as youd expect, with a shit ton of worthless red tape.  This is literally the reason we get this jaw dropping first this is not a bill, statements that look like a bill.  For most Doc visits here is more administrative overhead costs than the cost of providing the visit. The Nurses time, Docs time, its almost always less than all the administration requires to bill and get reimbursed.  Why?  Medicare guidelines must be followed - and the administrative burden is mind boggling.  And dont even get me started on the FDA and their games with big Drug companies. ACME Pharmaceuticals makes a drug that costs $.10/pill to make, under patent they charge $20/pill.  Then just as the patent is due to expire, they make a super minor change to the formulation, and the FDAs corrupt administration OKs a patent renewal.  The weird thing is our physicians, hospitals, medical equipment are actually-absolutely kick ass.  Folks from all over the world come to the US, if they can afford to, for the best care.  But they gotta be wealthy.","title":"The Mainstream Media FINALLY Admits Obamacare Is a Failure"},{"text":"Similar to the story of state rep Tricia Cotham in North Carolina.

Her tax policies were to the right of Biden and she went from pro-M4A to just expanding the ACA. This lack of clarity on what she believed was the same problem she had in the 2020 primaries. Union leaders and her own campaign workers had complained that their message wasnt resonating in direct conversations with voters who should have been in the base. Bernie and super PACs both complained Harris had unclear economic messaging.  So people struggled to learn who she was and what she wanted because she comes across as just endorsing the status quo, but they liked her when they learned more about her.

Further, NIH fostered an environment that promoted evading federal record keeping laws  as seen through the actions of Dr. David Morens and FOIA Lady Marge Moore.**SOCIAL DISTANCING**: The 6 feet apart social distancing recommendation  which shut down schools and small business across the country  was arbitrary and not based on science. During closed door testimony, Dr. Fauci testified that the guidance, sort of just appeared.**MASK MANDATES**: There was no conclusive evidence that masks effectively protected Americans from COVID-19. Public health officials flipped-flopped on the efficacy of masks without providing Americans scientific data  causing a massive uptick in public distrust.**LOCKDOWNS**: Prolonged lockdowns caused immeasurable harm to not only the American economy, but also to the mental and physical health of Americans, with a particularly negative effect on younger citizens. Rather than prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable populations, federal and state government policies forced millions of Americans to forgo crucial elements of a healthy and financially sound life.","title":"Joe Rogan: \\"The House released a 500 page report on COVID-19 pandemic key findings ...

I think Really what they want are the criminal elements, the ones killing, selling drugs, doing prostitution etc., deported but people just working in the fields or in restaurants or construction should stay and be given a chance to become US citizens. What they want to avoid are free loaders crying persecution to get asylum and a cash payout with free housing while the working class struggle to pay rent.?Republicans see their victories and think well that must mean Americans support our policies. ?similar to how Democrats view abortion.

But I don't see what any of that has to do with the suggestion they planted Manchurian candidate, a fox in our hen house, a coocoo in our nest, a viper in our crib because we made fun of them after the collapse of the USSR. It's been reported that Putin personally holds a grudge for the fall and sees it absolutely as the fault of the west and not the utter failure of communism and their own leadership. He's full of imperialist fervor, but I think that would be true regardless. If we'd been holding their hand for the last 25 years and helping them transition to a first world country with a first world economy he'd resent our superiority and condescension. And in fact, private efforts to bring Russia into the sphere of modern, law-abiding nations have largely failed. People trying to open branches of western businesses or franchises of American or European companies have been chased out by Russian mob extortion, with the collusion, backing and profit participation of the Russian government.
