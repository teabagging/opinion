While Id welcome more conservative provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta joining the union, it means wed have to take in Quebec (10M pop) and Ontario (15M pop) as well, and theyre basically a colder, gayer, more French New Jersey and New York thats an insane amount of electoral college votes (12+28=40 EVs between the two) no thanks. If they both had a say in our election, Trump wouldve still won narrowly, as the new margin for victory wouldve been 290 (578/2=289+1). Adding the rest of the provinces would make for an even bigger disaster electorally for republicans. I threw this scenario into ChatGPT (Canada is being admitted to the United States and its provinces will each become a state, and thus awarded electoral college votes. How many electoral college votes would each province receive, and based on current partisan leans within the provinces, how would they likely vote in an election?) and got the following:\\n**Democratic-leaning provinces:**\\n1. British Columbia: 10 electoral votes\\n2. Newfoundland and Labrador: 3 electoral votes\\n3. Nova Scotia: 3 electoral votes\\n4. Ontario: 28 electoral votes\\n5. Prince Edward Island: 3 electoral votes\\n6. Quebec: 12 electoral votes**Total Democratic electoral votes: 59*Republican-leaning provinces:**\\n1. Alberta: 9 electoral votes\\n2. New Brunswick: 2 electoral votes\\n3. Saskatchewan: 3 electoral votes**Total Republican electoral votes: 14*Swing state:**\\n1. Manitoba: 3 electoral votesSo, if we add these to the existing electoral votes in the U.S., the new totals would be:- **Democratic**: 59\\n- **Republican**: 14\\n- **Swing**: 376 new electoral votes thrown into the mix would mean we have a grand total of 614 EVs, or a vote requirement of 308 to win a majority. 226 (Kamalas winnings) + 59 = 285\\n312 (Trumps winnings) + 17 (lets say he took Manitoba given the landslide year) = 329So Trump still wins, but more narrowly.

The US Navy also has been getting in on the planning and prepping for climate change. It turns out ships don't do so well if the navy bases they get serviced at are under water due to rising sea levels. And the threat of more violent and bigger storms is a challenge to the operation of naval assets, of which the US navy have the most in the world.

Just as an example diplomacy was vital to success in colonizing the Americas. Quick single example, I find it hard to believe Corts would have the same success if he was unable to ally with tributaries and other groups who had reason to hate the Aztecs (conversely maybe if the Aztecs had more inclusive institutions they would not have left such fertile ground here for Corts to exploit).Edit: in regards to the above example I should have said \\"I find it hard to believe the Spanish would have the nearly the same overall success if Cortes was unable to ally with tributaries\\"Although I think that's also likely just how it is for \\"big history\\" books, even though I think they can still have interesting/informative things to say \\nJust as a thought experiment: imagine a much more technologically advanced civilization appeared out of the sky and started attacking with weapons that were sufficiently advanced that we couldnt reverse engineer them on a short timeline.

Sure it's convenient that it was, but that doesn't seem to have been a prerequisite for success for you.Your experience is also not typical. I know somebody that taught at a low performing high school while also working part-time at a remedial program at my local regional state univesity. Her experience was that students who didn't bother showing up or doing anything in high school ended up failing upwards anyway, then showed up at the university as freshmen, likely funded by grants or federal student loans. The only winners here end up being the school admins pushing college attendance metrics.Unfortunately for those students though, high school performance correlates highly with college performance and many of them end up dropping out or failing out. What was the point of this? Why couldn't they just have gone to community college for a fraction of the money?This is not a statement about the students. I think everyone deserves a chance and I believe 100% that you should be able to go to college at any age and with any level of preparation. But removing standards does not help the students. If they don't flunk or drop out of college themselves, they'll face disappointment after graduation when they learn their degree didn't prepare them for gainful employment or that they borrowed $20,000 to learn nothing of value.I'm really jaded on the education-industrial complex.

Syrias new finance minister estimated that such a promise would cost $120 million a month, covering more than 1.25 million workers on the government payroll.\\n \\n . . . \\n \\n An adviser to Trump, Ric Grenell, described the militant groups that overthrew Assad as a mix of a lot of different types of people.\\n \\n Were going to judge them by their actions, he said in an [interview](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/ric-grenell-syria-rebels/2024/12/09/id/1191025/) last month with Newsmax.I feel uneasy about leaving the decision in the hands of the Trump administration, though I can see the logic behind giving it some time.

That'd be great. Most notably, pretty much all of the material Luke added to Mark are just more fictitious narrative, which means that even in Lukes time there must have not been any good empirical information about Jesus.I don't think your conclusion necessarily follows. We know that Luke was concerned with writing his gospel such that Jesus fulfilled messianic prophecy (like claiming that Jesus was born during the rule of Herod the Great and also claiming that Jesus had to travel to Bethlehem from Nazareth because of the Census of Quirinius, which took place ten years after Herod died). So that's at least one reason why additional stories (even if we agree that they're fictitious) could be added beyond \\"no good information existed\\".

It's possible that \\"brother\\" was meant in the sense you included in your OP; that Paul viewed everyone as a \\"brother/sister in Christ\\", but why would he apply that label to James and not Peter (who he mentions earlier in the verse) or to Andronicus or Junia in Romans?

I was on guard for bias in this book from the start because they use Bill Gates as an example of the great things about the US education system and also the financial system but they neglect to mention he dropped out of university to start Microsoft (so he could afford to go to Harvard and then reject it), and his mother's connections were key to him getting Microsoft's foot in the door with IBM, the origin of Microsoft's success story. Those options are not available to everyone. I think it's a good adjunct to Capital and Ideology, that posits some solutions to the increasing disparities in wealth and power in ostensible democracies like the UK/USA where oligarchy seems to becoming more entrenched and they have not addressed in the first 80% of the book I have read so far. There's also the constitutional issues in the USA with the low population states analogous to the rotten districts in Great Britain issue where tiny numbers of people have outsize influence on national policy, the UK at least tried to address this, this is impossible with the USA realistically.

You cannot tell me he isnt a weak opponent.Again, he gained votes. By definition alone, that is not a weak opponent.Maybe every year wouldnt be the most important election of all time if democrats would get a spine, fight fascism seriously, and offer meaningful change for once. They do, you just aren't paying attention. You can't fight fascism with authoritarianism. It requires the system and the people to push back and WE aren't. So the system becomes more corrupt. We disempower progressives and democrats and then get mad when no one fights for us. It's our fault. Ours.Such as, universal healthcare.They're pushing us in that direction, it will never be an overnight change, you would literally have millions of people without jobs, and system which frankly would just outright break. The changes made would then be reveted in the next election cycle and we'd that much worse off. I mean fuck, the right want's to kill the ACA and they got enough votes to do that, while campaigning on that. This what I mean, real change takes time effort and multiple election cycles. It's not an easy battle.Why not make republicans have to defend their position on why they dont like it?They do, again, you aren't paying attention. Which is a major problem.Democrats always concede to rightwing framing on these issues and it makes them crash towards the right. They concede because that's what gets them votes, just not enough. Progressives are not voting. Democrats can not win if they don't get enough votes.Sure, republicans picked up voters all across the board.Yes. People who literally ran off the right wing cliff gained votes. Stop and think for a second, if you were a politician what would you think?Democrats couldve done that too had they offered a different vision than the last 4 years. The Biden administration was historically unpopular and people were desperate for change. The Biden administration was historically unpopular and people were desperate for change. Biden is literally one of the most progressive presidents we've had, and he lost votes.The only conclusion any politician will reach is: Progressive, and the left are not winnable populations.Progressives dont owe anyone their votes.And because of this attitude, LGBT, people of color, minorities, and hell even other progressives are now going to suffer. All it's done is hurt progress and pushed everything to the right.And Democrats should work for those votes.Dude... After nearly 20 years of trying, I am convinced there's nothing they can do to get these votes. Maybe in a few generations, but the left has killed progress for at least another 20 years, and given what I've seen of gen Z and Alpha, I'm not hopeful for the next 40. They are tilting to the right, hard.They are entirely at fault for allowing this to happen because of their hubris, largely Joe Bidens hubris. I would not for a second blame progressives for this.No they, aren't. We are to blame and I do blame us, all of us including me. I'm sure there was more I could have done. I was literally the youngest person canvasing in a college town, and I couldn't get progressives to do anything. Even for local races they just didn't give a shit. Until we grow-up and accept our responsibility for this, we'll keep losing.Democrats didnt even attempt to meet them where they were at so I dont really buy any of the progressives always hurt themselves stuff.They did, both Biden and Kamala had the most progressive agendas in the history of our country, and they lost votes. Again, you just aren't paying attention. And I can't make you see that, so I'm done.The next election will likely be much righter, and honestly, democrats will likely gain votes when they do.

The fact that this happens \\"on both sides\\" is pretty telling about what modern communication has done to our collective psychology (and how those in the know are able to easily manipulate so many people).We are still in the relative infancy of this as well, and I am sure it will look very different as more decades pass.

Let me a give a second example of symbolism in the narrative: Jennifer Maclean published an article in Harvard Theological Review which argues that the Barabbas narrative in the gospels is symbolism based on the Levitical scapegoat ceremony. In a nutshell, the scapegoat ritual in Leviticus 16:6-10 prescribes that (a) We take two goats (b) release one (c) sacrafice the other for remission of sin. Now look at Marks Barabbas narrative. Little known fact, Barabbas means son of the father and Jesus, of course, is a Son of the Father. The plot of the story is that (a) We have two sons of the father (b) One is realeased (Barabbas) (c) The other (Jesus) is sacraficed for remission of sin. Matthew understands the symbolism, as he redubs Barabbas Jesus Barabbas. The scapegoats were to be not one white different so in retitling the character his name is much more obviously similar to Jesus Son of the father to whom he is contrasted.","title":"cmv:The Christ Myth Theory is True."},{"text":"Reddit is such a gift.

The Chinese government responded with a security clampdown.* The situation continued for a period of years, up until 2014. There was an attack at the Kunming train station, which authorities attributed to Uighur militants. In response, President Xi Jinping declared a \\"peoples war on terror\\" in Xinjiang.* 2015-2016: The governments response became increasingly forceful, with large-scale military presence and harsh security measures. * 2017-2018: China initiates a campaign of \\"re-education\\" and \\"stability maintenance.\\" Large-scale internment camps were set up, reportedly holding hundreds of thousands, if not over a million, Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.* 2019: The situation was characterized by near-total surveillance and widespread restrictions on religious practices, with Uighur (ie.

And that story, Marks, does not seem to be designated history or said to come from eyewitnesses (emphasizing the purported factuality) whereas the later gospel of Luke does.The issue of Galatians 1:19 James, brother of the Lord is briefly addressed in my OP and more substantially addressed in Richard Carriers *Jesus from Outer Space* and *On the Historicity of Jesus.*Is it? Or, rather, should we expect it? We dont have eyewitness biographical accounts of most people in antiquity, including those who would be much more likely to have that evidence than an itinerant preacher.Christianity had the opportunity to preserve at least ten documents from the first century, not one of these having clear fingerprints of either being eyewitness testimony, not one of them even *based* on reports of those who knew the witnesses, and effectively no content that could only have come from eyewitnesses, since practically everything Paul says is as much as was said about other dying and rising gods.

It gave Kamala, a weak candidate who was attached to a historically unpopular admin, very little time plan a course to victory.Again, all the numbers and projections showed a challenging path to victory for any progressive and incumbent party. Hell, people literally blamed COVID on the democrats, and then you had historic misinformation, this is not a battle that's easily won even with more time.Progressives hold no power in this country, moderate democrats and older people do.First, even moderate democrats are progressives. Second, you're right they don't have power because we aren't voting for them.So I have no clue how you glean that progressives purity tested themselves out of a win when they have literally no power.Because we didn't vote. It's that simple. We have no power because we don't show up and vote. I was fucking out there canvasing and honestly, after this last election I'm forever done because I can't get progressives off their ass to do shit.And moderates are almost never in lockstep with the left or progressives or democrats for that matter. I dont think any of that is true at all.Progressives aren't even in lockstep with themselves, so that's already an impossible hill.Democrats fumbled the bag massively because they crashed towards the right in an effort to win over conservatives who would never vote for them over progressives who had moral qualms and could still be won over if they cared to.Progressives were refusing to vote this election, and some of the past ones too. The only possible path to victory the DNC or any party has in the future is by turning rightwards because they're the only ones who reliably vote. Progressives have stopped showing up, and stopped caring about actual change. I know because I'm now one of them. Even before occupy many started to just stop engaging while the right kept building up a power base. Now, there's almost no hope. Progressives are just too fucking fragmented, and I think we all hate each other more than we hate the right. Hell, I know so called progressives who even voted for Trump because of how much they hated Biden and Kamala.I mean, come on.I give up. I'm tired of trying to fight, going out every election to pull idiots off their couch so they'll vote. I'm tired having this same argument every 2 years, only for people to drown themselves in out right lies and propaganda. I literally don't know how to fight against it anymore. You know, I'm 40 now, I was the youngest person canvasing in my area full of college students. Literally one of the most important elections of our life time and they just didn't care. Even back when Bernie was running in '16, I was the second youngest canvasing for him.The left and so called progressives have been progress' worst enemy.

Also, his father died of Alzheimers so it does run in his family.

It's insanity how you communicate by saying \\"my fingers are over my ears stop talking\\" like communicate by saying \\"well, the info you got was wrong and here's a link to several studies and or sources that indicate otherwise\\" i mean fox news was caught lying so much they literally state in court that no sane person would believe most of what they say.","title":"Proud Canadian is heading to the gun range to prep for an American invasion due to trumps dementia which will turn Canada into the next Ukraine"},{"text":"Agree with most of your post but B&amp;N is actually doing well for itself these days","title":"A looming 'demographic cliff': Fewer college students and ultimately fewer graduates"},{"text":"Anyone have the math on how we over performed last night?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 8, 2025"},{"text":"Hot take but some of these lower ranked private schools are downright ridiculous with the tuition they charge (cough cough Jesuit/Catholic based universities) while nor providing any better facilities than the public university, not providing any significant network or research opportunities, and having shit name recognition.

Thats often decades of hard work.Its easier to not do any of that - sit on the sidelines and cast stones at the people who do.  Then you get to sound like a hero while not having any accountability at all for any failures - because you didnt participate in the process in the first place.

I actually fully agree with your breakdown for the early show as the marquis being almost immediately beaten back into line and the kuzon being so one dimensional made this period very much a TNG lite story progression with almost no actual moral issues being tangled with beyond we are advanced and they arent/theyre radical and we arent. However after that first era Id say that voyager dealt with some of the most extreme moral battles that the federation ever had to deal with and those outcomes essentially shaped the entire plot and journey. The ship and her crew are almost constantly being hounded by local societies and empires for being outsiders but in many of these cases voyager would come to agreements that culturally shaped both groups. Janeway became almost accustomed to forming regional alliances with weaker partners and having frequent technology/cultural exchanges to the point that it became the standard operating procedure upon entering new sections of space to do just that. Now this may seem like an unimportant or survivalist example but its actually the complete and total opposite. These smaller partners were almost always at the receiving end of aggression from larger empires and Janeways mini-federation tactics were done so to not only bolster voyagers strength but to also form a regional power structure for forward thinking groups to survive in an incredibly dangerous area of space.I mention this because this, in my opinion, is the most ignored portion of the entire voyager plot. It would be simple to use the many, many times that voyager had the option to get home almost immediately but chose not to because it would harm other groups or the times that voyager put itself in extreme danger by trying to save entire *enemy* species from a far stronger faction that chose to play nice with voyager(this is the early-mid show borg plotline). Voyager was alone, nobody was coming to help them. They didnt have the federation behind them or any allies to sacrifice themselves. Janeway did not have literal guidance from dimensional god or the entire fleet at her command. Voyager was a weaker ship that was outgunned almost the entire trip home. All of this and the crew still kept to their federation ideals while also spreading these ideals across the most dangerous space in the galaxy.","title":"CMV: Star trek: Deep space nine was the absolute best of star trek in terms of displaying its moral character."},{"text":"Legislation affects how precipitation moves through the continental watershed?

You compared the evidence for Jesus to the evidence for Alexander. And it is factually untrue that the evidence for Alexander is anywhere near as poor as Jesus. Now: does that mean the evidence for Jesus is therefore expected to be as good as Alexanders? No, that is not what is being said. What my OP is trying to show is that mythicism is a better explanation of the data than historicism.Also you cant just say we have no Contemporary sources, then list a bunch of them, especially if your trying to argue the works of poetry or playwriters somehow count for Alex but not for Jesus. Its dishonesty at its core. Its just nit picking only sources that work for your argument, acting in bad faith for the rest.WhatI have said is that Pauls Jesus appears mythical, so does Mark and Matthews, its only Luke and onward that seem to start explicitly making Jesus out to be historical.You and he also acts like Pauls letters were intended to ever need to reference an eyewitness, these were letters to leaders of active churches, and contained information directly related to the topics he is writing about, why would he ever need to bring up I met an eye witness, if the assumption at the time was that there were eyewitnesses, including some such as Peter and the other Apostles. He lived in the period where eye witnesses were still living, his story has him meet apostles and such.I think wed expect in passing for Paul to mention something that happened during Jesus life that could only originate or was even explicitly sourced to a witness. For comparison, Paul mentions the contents of his visions (1 Cor. 11, 1 Cor. 15:3-8). According to  1 Cor. 15:3-8, Christ died according to the scriptures, which may mean that is how it was learned (and therefore is a myth, not derived from a real event people saw). On the other hand, some scholars think the passage might be translated as Christ died in fulfillment of scriptures but if so, nothing is shared of how this is known. Absences and failures to confirm a historical Jesus are numerous and are the consistent broad picture in these letters, Earl Doherty even created a list of 200 Missing References to a historical Jesus.Its a totally valid point. You started with the assumption that obviously they didnt believe he was a literal person and just ignore any possibility that they did in fact believe that a real man lived and died and lived again.I do not start with that assumption, I start by demonstrating mythicism is feasible (Jesus mythicism is as believable as Satan mythicism) and go on to show why this feasible conjecture makes more sense of the chronology and contents of early christian literature than the standard historical Jesus hypothesis does.","title":"cmv:The Christ Myth Theory is True."},{"text":"OP is currently not disabled so doesn't care.","title":"cmv: many people online, especially on Reddit are unreasonable about COVID"},{"text":"0%.

The US and Panama both accepted that outsource because at the time Hong Kong was a British territory.

The easiest and fastest way to address that concern is to make unscripted media appearances.Interviews are something that every winning campaign focuses on during the home stretch of an election. In many cases they are literally free advertising because they get to broadcast their message to a large audience without having to pay for the airtime themselves. They don't have to be interviews with unfriendly reporters to achieve this goal, but they do have to be an actual interview instead of having the campaign provide the questions to be asked by whatever influencer they want to advertise for them this week. Her media appearance requirements were so strict and outside the norm that even the people producing content with/for her were commenting on them. It's fairly common for a reporter to send a list of questions they plan to/might ask to a candidate ahead of time so they know what topics to be prepared to discuss. It's not at all common or normal for the candidate to give the questions to the \\"reporter\\" and prohibit anything not on the list.","title":"Kamala Harris Delivers Moving Eulogy For Jimmy Carter, Whose Dying Wish Was To Vote For Her | Harris remembered the late president's \\"humility, modesty and grace\\" in a speech at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday."},{"text":"Can confirm.

The people who got this wrong or right, and frankly, most of whom were even discussing the story, are mainly the terminally online. They frequently get things wrong, and when they do, there's no reflection or growth. They're already busy being wrong about the next inconsequential topic.As for the Heritage Foundation, they're a thinktank - by definition, they're expected to get a lot of things wrong. Thinktanks make proposals, suggested policy, predictions, etc, using multiple contributors who quite often even contradict each other. Groups like the Heritage Foundation exist to win funding, and a strategy used to achieve this is to throw 3 darts and hope 1 hits - i.e., multiple policies on the same issue. When one hits, they spread use it to prove their influence/insightfulness and gain further funding. To criticise a thinktank for being wrong is missing the point.When it comes to the World Health Organisation, I don't think I need to elaborate too much on why they need to be held at immeasurably higher standard than your average grifter or troll. When dictating global policy, there is no room for error. Infallible has to be the standard because mistakes cost lives. They should be reminded of their mistakes, loudly and often, to reinforce the fact that inaccuracy is unacceptable.You really can't compare these three examples because they're all completely different levels of importance and legitimacy.

If there are 100 famines, and of those famines 99 occur under capitalist and fuedal systems of government and 1 occurs under communism, then why do you attribute the ONE to communism but then shrug shoulders at the other 99?  Famines happened many times in many places for many reasons throughout history.WhataboutismHow so? Understanding that the scale of death in that region, for that era, is not disproportionate compared to elsewhere is perfectly relevant because the entire point of the Black Book is to allege that Communism is uniquely disastrous, not that history happens everywhere.\\"Communism is the worst system ever because 65 million people died under it (also remember this figure is counting those poor, poor Nazis who died to Russian hands in the war as victims of communism, rather than of fascism)!\\"Okay but capitalism kills far more if you look at the same time and population scale.\\"Whataboutism!\\"No, it's a refutation of the original argument.The rest of the article is just a bunch of whataboutism on why Nazism and Capitalism killed more than Communism, but doesnt actually prove why the black book of communism lies about the numbersI mean, it did illustrate that the figures were exaggerated, but I don't know what you were expecting - the author to reveal that the Soviets achieved immortality and *nobody* died in the USSR?  Again, not whataboutism to say, *yes, but under the same conditions capitalism is deadlier than communism* when the entire point being made in the Black Book is that communism is deadlier.This is the only part of the article I will agree with.But that's the whole central point! I'm so confused.  You agree that if one has to compare 100 years of communism to 12 years of fascism to make communism sound as bad as fascism by not pointing out the very very obvious omission that they're comparing 100 years to 12 (and by a smaller population) that it is intellectually dishonest to do so?  Awesome, great.  Then why is the rest of the article, detailing the specifics of why this is whataboutism rather than being the supporting argument?  You need to look at every point being made in the context of the overall argument being made and what, specifically, is being challenged.I also love how its writen to say Communists were not *that bad* they killed just 65 million!!!!! Compared them to Nazis!!!! Who wouldve killed way more!!!!I hope you see how saying that is bad. No, not really.  If person A says \\"communism is the worst system ever because it kills 5 people per time unit\\" then it's perfectly valid to counter this claim by pointing out that fascism or capitalism kills 50 people per time unit - not whataboutism. The point is illustrating how the original underlying argument is invalid because it is completely dependent on *not* making a fair comparison when talking about what's the worst system ever.Look at it like this.  Let's say you and I went backpacking and have returned to civilization after several days without showering.  If I say you're the smelliest person ever because two people held their noses as they walked by you, would you be doing whataboutism to point out, \\"well actually Zeydon, *10* people held their noses as they walked by *you*\\"?  Of course not!  Because the point of contention isn't just that you or I are smelly - we both are.  The point is I alleged you were the *smelliest* and so it is perfectly valid for you to refute that by pointing out how the data suggests I am even smellier.  That doesn't make you an apologist.I was right. This read was a waste of time. The article is bull crap.

So the gospel of the sky Jesus could be received from Peter, James, etc. If everybody who originally received the Gospel received it from mystical divine revelation, this passage would be unnecessary.There were people who received divine revelations and people taught by those who had those revelations.

To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms.

Both are critiques that I think are the more straightforward sort of counterbalance against any big-picture narrative: Anthropologists and historians interested in non-Western societies and Western colonialism also get a bit uneasy with a big-picture explanation of world history that seems to cancel out or radically de-emphasize the importance of the many small differences and choices after 1500 whose effects many of us study carefully. For example, it seems to me that if you want to answer Yali's question with regards to Latin America versus the United States, you've got to think about the peculiar, particular kinds of political, legal and religious frameworks that differentiated Spanish colonialism in the New World from British and French colonialism, that a Latin American Yali would have to feel a bit dissatisfied with Diamond's answer. For me, I also feel a bit at a loss with any big-picture history that isn't much interested in the importance of accident and serendipidity at the moment of contact between an expanding Europe and non-Western societies around 1500. That seems a part of Cortes' conquest of Montezuma, or the early beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade, when West African practices of kinship slavery fed quite incidentally into exchange with Portuguese explorers who weren't there for slaves at all. It may be that such accidents are not the cause of the material disparity that Yali describes, but in many cases, they're what makes the contemporary world feel the way that it does. It's not that Diamond argues against such matters, but he doesn't leave much room for them to matter, either.Those were from Timothy Burke's post in _Cliopatra_ in 2005, [cross-posted here](https://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/blog/2005/07/29/delong-diamond-and-savage-minds/).

This is 2000 years ago.Paul opposed Peter to his face (Galatians 2:11), so not exactly nonexistent. What I was saying was that not only is Paul not an eyewitness of Jesus life, he never claims to know anyone who did witness Jesus life, and we would have to believe gospels and other documents are at least indirectly and partially based on eyewitness testimony to believe there was a historical Jesus, but I find no reason to believe that, since I think the gospels can be explained as fiction, along the lines of the fig tree story being fictional.We have more contemporary and near-contemporary primary sources for the existence of Jesus than of Alexander the Great. But youd never doubt for a second he existed. From Historian Richard Carrier: Alexander the Great is discussed in several contemporary or eyewitness sources we still have, including the poetry of Theocritus, the scientific works of Theophrastus, the plays of Menander, and the speeches of Isocrates, Demosthenes, Aeschines, Hyperides, and Dinarchus. Again, we have not a single contemporary mention of Jesusother than the theological mentions of Paul (and maybe James, Jude, Hebrews, 1 Clement, and 1 Peter, if we imagine they all date early), none of which clearly place Jesus on Earth, unlike contemporary attestations of Alexander. The eyewitness and contemporary attestation for Alexander is thus, again, vastly better than we have for Jesus, not the other way around. And once again, thats only if we count what survives on its own. We also have quotations of lost texts in other surviving textsliterally hundreds of quotations of contemporaries and eyewitnesses of Alexander. Again, we have not even one such source for Jesus. Even Paul never once quotes anyone he identifies as an eyewitness or contemporary source for any of his information on Jesus. Jesus from Outer Space: What the Earliest Christians Really Believed about Christ by Richard Carrier\\nhttps://a.co/fIXkYpWthings like Pauls letters are actually letters from a guy named Paul living at the time. They are not made up documents.I do not dispute that Paul existed or wrote letters, in fact I refer to those letters throughout my OP.Peter is a real person who met Jesus. He claims to be an eyewitness.1 Peter does not claim this, and 1 Peter may be authentic. 2 Peter claims the author was an eyewitness, but 2 Peter is widely agreed to be a forgery written at least a few decades after the real Peter died. I mentioned this in the post, that 2 Peter has a line about eyewitness, and placed it in my timeline as a late document.\\nthe Bible was not a religious document at the beginning. It was assembled into that by a librarian who just aggregated a lot of the most relevant Christian texts at the time.

Like the amount of political franchise extended to the English population following the Glorious Revolution, which Acemoglu and Robinson cite as one of their critical junctions in the creation of inclusive institutions was arguably not much greater than the post-colonial regimes of South America which the authors consider to be a continuation of extractive institutions, seemingly because England and the UK would go on to be incredibly prosperous and start the industrial revolution, while South and Central America stayed poor. Nevermind the undeniably extremely extractive institutions in India and the UK's other colonial possessions that also occurred during the industrial revolution in the UK.Acemoglu and Robinson also wander into a bit of geographic determinism themselves, despite critiquing Diamond, when they talk about the early english colonial settlements in North America, and how because Jamestown was far less resource rich, nor as densely populated as the Spanish Empire's colonies, the english colonists where forced to adopt more inclusive institutions to survive.However, my understanding is that a lot of Acemoglu's academic research deals with game theory in economics that does a much better job of distinguishing inclusive and extractive institutions, it's just too technical in nature to make for a mass market book (i.e. \\"Why Nations Fail is only really an extremely rough and broad overview from 10,000 feet of the actual political and economic theory by the authors.)","title":"Opinions on the book why nations fail?"},{"text":"yup that proves my point.","title":"Fascists use lies as a weapon, to demonize their opponents and incite hate and violence."},{"text":"The amount of people who think you should not own a home because you had stupid things like an appendix burst and now owe 20k in medical bills due to what insurance refuses to cover is wild here.","title":"Biden administration says its ban on unpaid medical bills from appearing on credit reports could lead to 22,000 more mortgages each year"},{"text":"I wouldn't give a rat ass if Trump was *physically* in peak condition, the soupy idiocy his moron brain floats in, the high water mark of his low expectations (which itself are subterranean), are so awful he shouldn't be in charge of stacking turds together","title":"Biden says he thinks he could have beaten Trump in the 2024 election"},{"text":"I need to see 159 names...vote them out!","title":"House Again Passes Laken Riley Act; 159 Dems Vote Against It"},{"text":"Good point, sure.","title":"Biden Says He Would Have Beaten Trump if He Stayed in the Race"},{"text":"You seem terribly confused.

It was early March, and he was flanked by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and a pair of his former rivals, Kamala Harris and Cory Bookerall members of what Biden would call an entire generation of leaders and the future of this country.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/09/biden-reelection-transition-president/675395/","title":"Biden, 82, Admits He May Not Have Lasted Another Four Years in Office"},{"text":"Boomers not only screwed Gen X but the planet.

Those are weird things to say if Jesus was just some cosmic figure.Not a weird thing to say: Ishtar was crucified in Hades, but in any case a fictive Jesus can be crucified on earth, also. Regarding Romans 1:3, I wrote: *The terrestrial version of the Christ myth theory can explain this as much as historicity: in both, Jesus was a man on earth, presumably born at some point and necessarily having ancestors. But could a sky god be made of the seed of David according to the flesh? Yes, as the phrase translated according to the flesh, kata sarka, most commonly means according to a human understanding. (Ludemann 2010). A Jesus made of the seed of David, according to a human understanding, may indicate only that Jesus was Davids successor as king of a new Israel, irrespective of a biological link (a view largely corroborated in Van Aarde 2016, p.37).*And the whole brother of the Lord thing with James? If that just meant fellow Christian, why would Paul even bother pointing it out?From the post: Some query why Paul would bother saying James the Christian, but that could easily be to distinguish him from James the Apostle. Also, first-century Judea was full of messianic movements tied to real people (e.g., Theudas, Judas the Galilean). Why would Christians buck the trend and make their messiah entirely mythical? It doesnt fit the cultural context.Wrong, there were lots of mythical messiahs back then, see sources cited here https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/s/DB3UvQGXJnAnd the sky Jesus idea? It feels like a stretch. If thats what the earliest Christians believed, why invent an earthly story later when itd be easier to stick with the original idea? Mythicists act like this kind of pivot is normal, but its not.It was common for gods to have earth stories or become historicized, like Plutarch says about Osiris and just as the goddess Ishtars drama in Hades was transformed into Esther.

If you continue having symptoms after the virus is gone then your immune system continues to kill off your own cells, even though they have no virus in them at all!The only known methods to suppress autoimmune disorders is by suppressing the whole immune system, which exposes organism to external dangers.

When Russia launched their invasion of Crimea a few years ago, there were Ukrainians trying to convince Americans to care by asking \\"how would you like it if China took &lt;insert X state\\" and be frustrated to tears by people responding with jokes like \\"oh Florida? you can have them for free\\" etc. Even peeling aside the joke, when asked and answering seriously, many Americans probably wouldn't have a strong objection.This is an American privilege. We aren't actually concerned about China invading Florida. It's an abstract concern. We dislike (or are apathetic to) the actual Florida than we dislike the fantasyland idea of China invading.On one hand, it's a privilege to be completely disconnected from how basically every other country in the history of the world sees the world and their relations with their neighbors.On the other hand, this is absolutely not the line of argumentation you'd use to convince us regarding the annexation of your country, whether it be Ukraine, Greenland, Canada, or Mexico.

Why does oppression and autocracy needs your protection?For instance instead of the chance to experiment with their own architectural styles as cities begin to lay down their first skyscrapers, they will be getting giant glass and metal dick shaped obelisks in the middle of a desert. As you might notice, Dubai, Kuwait etc lack a strong identity and have other issues, some pertaining to the fact that maybe glass is reflective and steel tends to overheat in a desert.Why do you have to blame the West for that? The cause of it is that they're an oligarchically led society of nouveau riches who don't know what to do with their money, they only thing they know is they don't want to distribute it. Building phallic towers is a pretty universal human endeavour as well, nothing particularly Western. As many of these nations develop economically, entering the third or fourth phase of demographic transition, they are developing the markets and demand for a larger variety of goods and other services. During this process, western and other cultures organically grew and experimented, developing solutions and ideas that suited them and their communities. However it is ever becoming more apparent, that in many places especially in the english speaking world, they will not be getting this chance as our cultural exports will immediately begin to fill up these niches. You're romanticizing the past. It was -and still is- a hectic process in the West as well.You're also neglecting that in the present, there's as well a problem with the dominance of US-based culture to others in the Western world, with eg. popular music and films being overwhelmingly dominated by English material, pushing away local production.Not only that, but more importantly, we are stunting their political progress. On this topic, perhaps we are going beyond cultural influence but rather direct influence. I'd argue that anyone by now should have realised, that making certain developing nations adopt full western style liberal democracy is a fat mistake. It's not because it doesn't go perfectly from the first time that it's not worth doing. It didn't work perfectly out of the box in the West either, and it remains a constant improvement.Even moreso when copying word for word British/French/American systems in, that are utterly mismatched with the local culture and political situation.Straw man, and begging the question.I'd argue that part of the reason why western democracies are so successful is that we've had to room to figure out what uniquely works for us, an opportunity that we are denying to the nations that are still developing their political structures if we shoe in democracy right now. Switzerland's referendum system would not work in the France. My country's mandatory voting system would not work as well in say, Spain. France's hybrid presidential/parliamentary system would also not work as well in the UK. Perhaps it might, who knows? There's no reason to assume this is what it's going to be forever. Spain was a dictatorship 50 years ago. In fact, in Europe the most advanced political experiment, the EU, is ongoing. Where do you get the idea that democracy does not allow room to figure things out, and autocracies do? It's the other way aorund.Countries like Indonesia which are complex and multifaceted need the room to figure out a legal code and political system that works for them, even if it might not agree with our sensibilities.Having a democracy is doing exactly that. But to do so, you must start from elementary principles like freedom of expression, civil rights, etc. or you run the risk of just getting and autocrat who \\"solves\\" the issue by enforcing the dominance of one group.Your position is very paternalistic towards non-Western people, as if they aren't capable of preserving what they like about their own culture, and you have to do it for them.It's also generalizing. China and India for example are more than capable to fund and export their culture, and indeed do so successfully (Bollywood) or forcefully (Tibet, Uyghurs), or for example the muslim dominance in the Middle East still today results in suppression of non-muslim cultures like the Yezidi or Egyptian Copts. The West somehow closing itself off would only result in those cultures to dominate more, with one less different viewpoint. Western ideas like freedom of expression and democracy will give them a secure base to practice their culture instead.Ultimately Western culture has always been open and curious towards other cultures, and has incorporated elements of other cultures without a Big Brother deciding what was good for us. I see no reason to deny other cultures to be curious towards ours.All in all, this whole statement smacks of a preexisting idea of \\"The West is bad, how can we punish it\\".In fact, you're advocating for less democracy and less western influence. This would just leave the door wide open for autocratic dictatorships to impose their model on everyone. No, bad idea.","title":"CMV: The western world, in particular America and Western Europe should attempt to curb or limit its influence on developing nations"},{"text":"Why would they want to be a state though?

Why Nations Fail is almost exclusively (unless Ive forgotten major parts entirely) about things from much more recent history. The Authors really cant answer questions from before ~400BCE because theres not written records that have survived where you can really analyze what kinds of institutions they had. It really left me feeling like Diamond was catching stray bullets for no reason other than because Guns, Germs and Steel was a very popular book about trends in human development at the time.Eurasias geography meant that there were civilizations from Korea to Spain with similar ish climates that could keep the candle of civilization lit so any one civilization failing wouldnt thrust the continent back into the Stone Age.

Those seaports have been operated for decades by Hutchison Ports PPC, a division of CK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company.\\nCK Hutchison is a publicly listed conglomerate whose largest owner is a family of Hong Kong billionaires, not the Chinese government. But Beijing has extended its national security laws to Hong Kong, and the Chinese government has recently shown willingness to weaponize supply chains (something that Beijing also accuses the United States of doing).That has U.S. officials on both sides of the aisle increasingly worried that the Chinese government could exert influence over private companies to shut down commercial and military shipments in a time of war.https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/politics/trump-panama-canal-china.html","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Has there been a schism over _this_ discussion yet?

Any referendum on something like this should be preceded by a clear and genuine movement for independence/joining another country, not because another country loudly started shouting about it and apparently it's ok that they get to define the narrative.Like, there are almost 200 other countries Greenland could join, why isn't anyone talking about asking them if they 'want to' join any of the others, and only about the US?

Basically, he can still give us free will, but make us unable to harm others and make suffering impossible. After all, we're not able to fly or shoot lasers out of our eyes either, so us having free will isn't an excuse for God to make rules and only nudge us in the direction of them with a book that uncontacted tribes never heard of.So suffering exists because... two people ate an apple?

In the UK for example it is extremely rare to hear anti-muslim jokes, but anti-Christian is fair game. The media does tend to bias against Christianity. TV shows are more than happy to introduce ridiculous 'Christian' characters that are nearly always massive hypocrites - they wouldn't dare do this for any other religion. I wouldn't personally say that everything in the world is out to get my faith - but there's certainly an element of it being an easy religion to attack without consequence.I wouldn't say this group has been infiltrated by fundie Christians - I've been here for many years (under various accounts) and there's always been a number of Christians here who are happy to declare their faith.I haven't been gaslit by any church. I've been gaslit by people multiple times in my life so I'm confident I would recognise it.I don't feel that Christianity is all about rules and regulations.

Now, I know some of the women in this room wouldnt say the same, Trump, 78, joked, per the outlet.The audience then reportedly erupted with laughter as Trump said, I know at least four couples. There are four couples, \\\\[Texas. Gov. Greg Abbott\\\\], that I know and youre not one of them. At least four couples here would have been thrilled, actually.The former president noted members of the Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida donated to Comperatores family. \\"I said absolutely and they gave me a cheque for a million dollars,\\" he added. \\"Thats a lot of money. Maybe even more impressively we put out a GoFundMe and we raised more than $6M for the group that got hurt, which is essentially three people.Trump returned to the Butler Farm Show grounds?on Saturday, Oct. 5 and reflected on the incident that led to the gunman Thomas Crooks' death, according to?NPR. \\"Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country,\\" Trump said.He added, \\"But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred and destruction.\\"Trump also honored Comperatore, 50, with a moment of silence, per the outlet.

This included the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic downturn, a nationwide reckoning on race, the outgoing presidents unwillingness to accept the election results and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.The United States ultimately upheld its long tradition of the peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20, 2021, and Biden began governing immediately with a substantial foundation of planning and personnel in place. This was in large measure due to months of preparation taken well in advance of the election, including contingency planning and the tireless efforts of many career agency executives, dedicated public servants within the Trump White House, and a Biden-Harris transition team that succeeded in building an impressive, well-resourced and organized transition\\nNonetheless, the events of 2020C21 revealed longstanding areas of fragility in the presidential transition process.Trumps refusal to concede the election led to a delay in ascertainmentthe formal decision that initiates the governments post-election financial and substantive support for the winning candidate. In addition to delaying funding and access to federal agencies, some members of the Trump administration were not fully cooperative with the incoming Biden team, further complicating matters.In previous transitions, some practices have been determined by law. Other major elements have been governed by norms and traditions. Sitting administrations helped a new administration prepare to take office regardless of party. While the Trump White House and federal agencies worked hard to meet the statutory transition planning requirements during the preelection period, Trumps doubts about the integrity of the election and, in some instances, the lack of cooperation from his administration after the election exposed areas where norms and precedents were not enough to ensure a seamless transfer of power.Trump did the same my dude.","title":"Trump: Biden doing everything possible to make transition difficult"},{"text":"This is what it will take.","title":"'This Should Make Your Blood Boil': Top NC Court Blocks Certification of Democratic Justice's Win"},{"text":" LOL!

The broader the term you can use, the better. However, as one should expect when dealing with an entity who identifies itself using an acronym, theyre extremely smart about the words they use to write about the most sensitive subjects.

I believe there are plenty of reasons one could justify taking a life and be moral in that action. And, since I believe this, there are plenty of ways the death penalty could be implemented in a Just way. Obviously, the current way our state is and any forms it would take under the American Government would not fit my criteria.Ex. A State fundamentally dedicated to the preservation of ALL life, which would be opposed to the monopoly on violence form of authority (most of my education about the framework behind this concept comes from Gene Sharp).
