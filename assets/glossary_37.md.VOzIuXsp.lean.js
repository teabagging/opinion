You see this in Japan, Israel, and many places that keep immigration low or do so very selectively while not permitting the opportunity for conflicting ideals or cultures to implode within themselves.This isnt to say there arent white nazi extremists in the bunch; they both have ideals that conveniently overlap.

The bed is difficult to load, it's towing capacity is awful for its price competitors, its range is bad outside of a local use area.  It's also an awful car.  There's no instrument panel, meaning you have to look down to your right by a considerable amount to see your speed.  The body is built with no crumple zones making it extremely dangerous to its occupants in the event of an accident.  And because of its weight, it also has a high likelihood of killing anyone it hits (pedestrian or in another vehicle).  I honestly don't think the shape of the Cybertruck is the ugliest thing (however the Cybertruck's exterior design and use of that shape does make it look really ugly). If it had a normal instrument cluster/gauges and was more like a sports car with a bed: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_El_Camino it would honestly have a lot more appeal and be more practical as a designBut, uh, rant aside, back to my point: For all the stupid edgy teen naming scheme of the Models S, X, 3, and Y, they are for the most part, good cars.  Maybe not the best put together, but at their core they would make good vehicles if Tesla could ever get their quality control in order.  The Cybertruck, Cybercab, and RoboTaxi are all extremely impractical and poorly designed vehicles that at their core show Musk doesn't know anything about automobile design and function.A much better electric bus design has already been made by a company in Turkiye: https://youtu.be/QI1yM9mzCAE\\nAnd the best part, you can drive it with a normal drivers license.

In reality, that's the only way government can ever actually work: It functions not through some sense of pride or civic duty (though that is nice to have), but rather via the threat of accountability to the mob; governments and government authority only exist and function from the consent of the governed. If the government, or an agent of the government, becomes derelict in their duty to the governed... then the governed (e.g. the People) are well within their rights to hold the offending individual, organization, etc., accountable according to their own methods and judgments.\\nObviously, what I'm talking about isn't awesome - but that's how it works. It seems that a lot of people have grown too comfortable to recognize or understand that liberty isn't free and does, in fact, require civic input to function -- the lack of civic engagement will, invariably, result in the need for *civil engagement* later on, as officials eventually forget to whom they are truly accountable.","title":"Florida Voters Sue Gov.

But the rest? Nah. If the US attacked a NATO ally, it would not only lose any resemblance of soft power or good will, but especially attacking countries like Denmark or Canada, who really dont have any enemies, would be geopolitical suicide.For starters, Europe and Canada are two major trading partners for the US. Without them, it would be a massive economic blow to the US. Furthermore, a significant share of creditors holding US debt are European (same goes for investment), and they would not longer be willing to hold US debt as the US would no longer be deemed stable and trustworthy, confidence would be shot and thus sell of US bonds en mass.\\nThen you have China, who would only be too happy to step into the power vacuum left behind. They would create closer ties with Europe and Japan, SK and would likely also sell off US debt. Then you have the long list of countries who still have an axe to grind with the US, waiting for an opportunity to get back at the US. This could result in the Dollar being dropped as the global reserve currency alltogether, which would borderline if not outright collapse the Dollar itself. You have to remember how massive the US debt is. Its gigantic. Losing the ability to manipulate your currency and print money when the Dollar is replaced, would almost instantaneously result in a mass default. The US military is powerful, no doubt. But a big part of its power relies on western partners having its back. The US has a secure border with Canada and Mexico, attacking NATO would mean US troops abroad would be surrounded in enemy territory right away. Russia, China and Iran, may or may not directly threaten the US homeland or at the very least US spheres of interest and influence. The US is powerful, but not powerful enough to fight Canada on its enormous front line, potentially Europe on their territory, as well as Russia, China, Iran (etc) in US spheres of influence spanning across the globe. The US military is designed to be able to fight in two theaters at once, sure, but that is alwasy assuming that the homefront is secure take that away and youre looking at a different scenario.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"No shot of that.Most likely, DeSantis is using them as currency and strategically negotiating with Trumps team about them before he does anything, including negotiating his own future since his term is up next year.DeSantis is a horse trader and wont lift a finger for anything if hes not getting something in return.

In addition generally we say right wing we mean pro free market and that's what I meant when I instinctively said Canada is right wing. But actually the US has quite an anti free market right wing and Trump in particular is very anti free market.Breaking it down further across a number of different ways of measuring left right- Canada is well to the right of the US when it comes to regulating the private sector, Canada is aggressively anti red tape for commerce, whereas in the US because of the lobbying industry it's a lot more complicated\\n- As discussed Canada is well to the right of the US on free trade\\n- Canada is well to the left of the US on social issues, even right wing Canadians consider US attitudes on abortion (readily available and publicly funded in Canada) to be medieval\\n- Canada used to be aggressively pro immigration due to being underpopulated and needing demographic support. That is starting to change, but it's still well to the left of the US on immigration.\\n- Canada is well to the left of the US on welfare and even on the right the idea of abolishing universal healthcare is a fringe belief So in summary Canada is well to the right of the US in terms of economic policy and well to the left of the US on social issues and the role of the state. It's well to the right of Europe on all these things.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"I became manic bipolar out of nowhere 6 months ago.

Then, on December 12, he revealed that the core of his campaign was false all along. Its hard to bring things down once theyre up, he said. You know, its very hard. He also acknowledged that his tariffs could spike inflation. I cant guarantee anything. I cant guarantee tomorrow. Oh, and, in his one truthful statement: Things do change.\\n \\n One of Trumps changes since the election in his endless three-card monte game is making Greenland into his new frontier, for national security.

The notion of purchasing Greenland, for example, originally was raised to him by Republican Party funder and cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, an important art collector, including of German art of the Weimar period, who ought to know better than to be so irresponsible as to dangle a shiny object before Trumps hooded eyes. Trumps latest and inevitably doomed chief of staff Susie Wiles will be doing her job as his handler only if she can lock Trump in a soundless isolation booth.

They do not watch/listen to any news at all and so have no idea about all Trump's negative attributes.  All they know or care about is how much gas or groceries are costing them today, and they associate any price increases with whoever is president at that very moment.  They have no interest and know nothing about the economy or how it works.  They care nothing at all about how other countries think/feel about us or how good/bad they are doing compared to us.  They simply do not know anything about any political issue and they have no interest in learning.  They choose to be ignorant, and yet they still vote.  These people are the reason the Founding Fathers designed the Electoral College system of elections because they believed that the average American was this type of person and could not be trusted to vote with any intelligence, so \\"electors\\" who actually understand the importance of elections were put in charge of them.  These \\"Type-1\\" are not bad people, they are just ignorant and apathetic about things they should not be for their own good.2) The second type of people who support Donald Trump those who simply lack the skills to recognize liars, conmen, shysters and/or generally bad people.  This skill is known as \\"Wisdom\\" and sometimes \\"Street Smarts\\".  Trump is a liar, sexual predator, convicted criminal, is accused of 91 felonies, and by most reasonable measures is just an asshole of a human being.  But, because these people believe that he \\"speaks like them\\" and says things they've always thought but never felt comfortable saying out loud themselves, they feel a connection to him personally and find themselves capable of denying any negative statements about him and believing every word he says, no matter how outrageous.  They possess a severe lack of Wisdom in their inability to recognize his negative traits.  They may not be bad people, and should be pitied as you would your grandmother who was conned out of thousands by telephone fraudsters.  They simply don't know how wrong they are because they refuse to listen to anything negative about him whatsoever.3) The third type of people who support Donald Trump are the worst.  They do NOT lack Wisdom.  They KNOW he's lying.  They KNOW he's a criminal.  They KNOW he's an asshole.  They KNOW he says and does very bad, wrong things.  They know all this, and they LIKE that he gets away with it because they believe it gives them permission to be the same way.  If an asshole like Trump says and does all these bad things and is the President of the United States, then it's ok in their minds to be lying, criminal assholes themselves.  All the bad things they've always thought but never said are going to be allowed when Trump is president.  They no longer have to hide these thoughts or feel bad about themselves for thinking or saying them if the President is also saying them.  These are the truly horrible, BAD ones.","title":"There are a lot of bitter people here, Im one of them: rust belt voters on why they backed Trump again despite his broken promises"},{"text":"IIRC that's an assumption, but we really don't know for sure, and there's a little bit of evidence that seems to suggest it wasn't the case.Apparently [back in 2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/06/russian-government-agency-reveals-fraudulent-nature-of-the-crimean-referendum-results/) a Russian government website leaked what appeared to be the real results of the referendum, with around 50% for joining Russia at 30% turnout. If those numbers are real, it'd suggest (given people against Russia were intimidated and might not want to vote) only a minority ever voted to join.Of course the whole thing was a sham, and I think once a state like Russia uses illegal military force to try to annex a territory, it can't be recognised simply because of the precedent that sets.","title":"Trump to urge Zelenskyy to lower Ukraines conscription age to 18"},{"text":"I am not so sure with the Elon Musk shenanigans in Pennsylvania and the voting machines...","title":"Trump is a Coward"},{"text":"Majority government for the cons in Alberta.

And especially for Greenland or Canada nothing exists. You can't make up anything like Bush did for Iraq.Second, attacking an ally is the stupidest thing a president could do. Any military or economic benefit is lost by the dissolution of NATO, which is what such an attack would immediately cause. Panama could be different if Panaman government for some reason decided to block the US from using the canal. In that case the benefit from the invasion could outweigh the diplomatic loss. In the current situation that's not the case. Thirdly, at least Canada would most likely start some form of guerilla war as it a relatively large country both by population and especially area, which would make it extremely hard for the occupation force to keep under control. The cost of the occupation would quickly outweigh any direct economic gain that the annexation would bring. The other two (especially Greenland) are probably less problematic in this sense.Fourthly, the US population would not accept the invasions, especially Canada that is probably the most friendly nation on earth towards the US. This would cause further trouble for the government as it would have to deal with military recruitment crisis and constant protests.

In September, the European Commission published another report, by former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, on enhancing EU competitiveness. Both reports argue that Europes relative economic decline constitutes an existential threat to the European Union and stress the importance of strengthening research, innovation, and sustained investments in new technologies to reverse that decline. And both explain that the only way the EU will achieve these goals is by making it easier and more attractive for Europeans to invest their savings within the EU, rather than burrowing them in savings accounts or investing them abroad.This post was essentially made for fellow Draghi flairs.","title":"The Biggest Threat to Europe: Its Not TrumpIts the EUs Weak Defense Policy and Stagnant Single Market"},{"text":"Pinged EUROPE ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20EUROPE&amp;message=subscribe%20EUROPE) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20EUROPE&amp;message=unsubscribe%20EUROPE) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=EUROPE&amp;count=5))Pinged EU-LIBS ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20EU-LIBS&amp;message=subscribe%20EU-LIBS) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20EU-LIBS&amp;message=unsubscribe%20EU-LIBS) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=EU-LIBS&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"The Biggest Threat to Europe: Its Not TrumpIts the EUs Weak Defense Policy and Stagnant Single Market"},{"text":"Senators do not have any control over that.

A change in trade policy is not the answer. The EUs trade surplus with the United States was $20.5 billion in October 2024, up from just under $17.5 billion the same month a year prior. This trade balance is just a part of the EUs current account surplus with the rest of the world, which increased from $64.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 to $134.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. That current account balance is the mirror image of the EUs own imbalance between its domestic savings and domestic investment. Europeans lack neither savings nor opportunities for investment. What they lack is the ability to move money efficiently from one part of the EU to the next. National rules regarding income taxation, pension funds, risk absorption, and bankruptcy proceedings make it unattractive for investors to look beyond the boundaries of their own countries to the rest of Europe. As a result, much of Europes savings either sits idle in domestic banks or chases higher returns in the deeper, more liquid capital markets in the United States.

In the meantime, the US would have a failed state on its northern border which would make its security situation much worse (a drug cartel problem similar to what they are already dealing with in Mexico would likely emerge).In short, Trump could destroy Canada but he could never make it an American territory and his popularity would tank as soon as people realized that American soldiers are being ordered to die in a war against their friends and relatives for no reason other than stroking Trump's ego.TBH, If Trump ordered troops into Canada, it would not surprise me to see mass resignations from the senior military staff and a push to impeach.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"I'm actually not trying to be argumentative, I just see a lot of anguish from my fellow democrats about him \\"getting away with his crimes,\\" I don't think it's that bad....

In 1903 US had decided to buy the land and complete the channel. However, Colombia had refused. So US had declared independence of Panama from Colombia, and had sent troops to enforce it:* November 2: US military arrives to defend Panama* November 3: Panama republic declares independence from Colombia* November 6: Panama republic sells Panama channel territory to United States.I.e. Panama was, basically, created by United States for the explicit purpose to own Panama channel.Local population had never exhibited great ability to resist US intervention. For example, US was able to easily replace government of Panama in its 1989 invasion.It is very unlikely that annexation by US would be resisted more than previous invasion. Especially, if general population gets to acquire US citizenship (which is likely to improve their financial situation).&amp;nbsp; Greenland: Greenland is an Autonomous region part of Denmark, who is an ally to the US. Buying it would be a huge betrayal for Denmark, and could lead to the US potentionally losing all of Europe as an ally.There are plenty diplomatic ways to wrangle Greenland from Denmark.As Greenland can declare independence (there is a strong support for it), US only needs to browbeat Danish parliament into accepting said independence. There shouldn't be much doubt that White House has enough influence to pull this off.Worst case scenario, Greenland can declare independence unilaterally, as a colony (there are plenty precedents of this). That might cause some outcry, but it doesn't violate international law much, and US can frame Denmark as being oppressive towards Greenland.From then on, independent Greenland can be safely incorporated into US.This can fail only if parliament of Denmark decides to dig its heel in (which would be quite uncharacteristic, as Danish politicians tend to toe the line when it comes to international politics), and - as nobody else is likely to be sufficient deterrent for US - decides to call Russia and China for help to defend Greenland (which would be very unlikely due to Denmark being strongly aligned against either). Leaving aside aforementioned scenario, there isn't much Denmark can do to stop US. US reputation might suffer, but I don't see any European nation actually switching allegiance over this. Even those that already are openly anti-US (Slovakia, and Hungary) aren't likely to quit NATO over this.&amp;nbsp;Canada is a separate matter, as there are too many factors involved. Hence, I don't have a defined scenario on how exactly would incorporation of Canada proceed.Nevertheless, you overstate impossibility of this: Canada: the ONLY thing they share are a border and the sports leagues.Canada is part of US \\"close allies\\" (the rest being UK, Australia, and New Zealand), and is deeply connected to US on all levels, from economic to military.While Canada is a big nation, the amount of influence White House has within Canada is immense. Don't forget, Canada is one of the most liberal countries in the world, and buying it would be a huge loss to the Republicans (as Canada likely won't vote for them).You might want to elaborate on Canada being \\"one of the most liberal countries in the world\\". I have a very strong impression of Canada being a thoroughly right-wing nation.Moreover, while Republican party might have some problems in the future, Trump isn't exactly losing anything here as he won't be running for president again. Most of all, buying all of these would cost the US a lot of moneyWho exactly would US be paying money to? Into the budget of Canada that it is going to acquire alongside Canada?As I said, I don't have enough information to come up with a plan on how US might annex Canada. However, I don't expect actual *sale*.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"These situations are not close to the situation with Greenland.

These kinds of organized groups always have informants surrounding them.What is shocking to me is even with the 3 informants, who did share info with their handlers, gave multiple warnings about what the plans the proud boys and oathkeepers were going to do on J6, a number of those warnings werent shared within the security and law enforcement agencies.

Once violence erupts, those soldiers are trapped because they are now seen as the enemy by the civilians and feel the need to morally justify their own complicity in the violence by believing in and identifying with the cause that prompted them to commit it in the first place.

So Elon gave lots of?*money*?to the Tesla founders and struck a deal under which he could call himself a?**founder.**?Calling himself a co-founder was of course ridiculous, as he had played no part in Teslas formation whatsoever, but it was a critical lie for Elon Musk as he tried to weave a mythology of success around himself...[The Truth About Musk, From His Biographer](https://sethabramson.substack.com/p/the-truth-about-musk-from-his-biographer)See also: [Elon Musk is a Cuckoo: He doesnt found anything](https://x.com/HaHaScribe/status/1848863245542780952)","title":"Steve Bannon Vows To Oust Elon Musk From Donald Trumps Inner Circle Before The Inauguration: I made it my personal thing to take this guy down"},{"text":"Well you're not saying what you believe and you don't seem to know what zero sum is at all.

Unlike progressive opposition to war, which is generally framed in moral terms, Trump's opposition to a muscular foreign policy is rooted in a sense of unfairness at America carrying too much of the military burden for the rest of the Western, capitalist world, and for its costliness. Withdrawing military bases around the world and the security guarantees that they bring would amount to a retreat of US power to pre-WWII levels.Note that paleoconservatism is also in favour of protectionism, which is consistent with Trump's trade war rhetoric. This would again roll back the US's position to something closer to a pre-WWII era, which is why I would call Trumpism reactionary, and not merely conservative.

For once, there's a big risk of brain drain, as it's generally the wealthiest aspects of your population which can receive higher education, resulting in brain drain as they are generally more sought after in foreign countries, and can largely afford moving elsewhere, and are more likely to be critical of the current leadership. What most dictatorships do is allow for critics to leave the country if possible, which allows for no internal critics, however, that ruins the possibility of any advanced industry or service economy.There's also the issue that China doesn't attract external Western investors like it previously did, or said otherwise, \\"having full governmental control and modifying or destroying any existing economic records to fit your agenda is not exactly good economic practice, and heavily destabilizes an economy\\". Economic transparency is a common issue in most one-party states, and generates distrust in the economy. I would highly recommend Nobel prize winner Daron Acemoglu's book *Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy*, as it goes far more into detail than I possibly could.You also have to take into account that most Chinese oligarchs do not want this transition to occur, as Manufacturing is not only far more stable for internal politics, but also facilitates corruption far more than any service economy could.","title":"CMV: China's economy will collapse in 2025."},{"text":"You forget that the DoD likely wants to bleed Russia, and is generally indifferent to the cost in Ukrainian lives.","title":"Trump to urge Zelenskyy to lower Ukraines conscription age to 18"},{"text":"The top brass should launch a coup against the Trump Administration if they're ordered to do unconstitutional or illegal actions.The military wandering the streets, being used to drag people onto cattle cars and transporting them to massive camps for mass deportations is unacceptable and it should be opposed by everyone in the military","title":"I Think Things Are Going to Be Bad, Really Bad: The US Military Debates Possible Deployment on US Soil Under Trump"},{"text":"You're right.??

Conservatism isn't just about \\"not change\\". Yes, Trump is radical. He's an extremist, a populist, and radically illiberal. But, he's not proposing any progressive changes. Even rhetorically, he's fighting to bring us back to a mythologized past. Both his first administration and his coming administration were heavily influenced by the Republican elite, especially lobbying groups like the Heritage Foundation, who have built a database of people for Trump to hire to bring about their ideals. These ideals are pretty much what conservatives have been trying to do for decades: dismantle regulatory agencies to allow corporations to make more money harming average people, cut the safety net (social security, ACA, etc), expand the military, and enforce concepts of a Christian state. Then Trump brings his own flare, xenophobia, corruption, hate towards immigrants, a white nationalist bent. None of this is the least bit progressive. But, sure, people who pay no attention to policies whatsoever and just want radical changes and to burn everything down with no care for what comes next find Trump's rhetoric appealing. But, that flips constantly, depending on who's in power. It's hard to say Trump is against the elites when he's a former president, a billionaire, teaming up with other billionaire elites to implement trickle down economics. And yes, conservatism has come back around to being more mainstream, as it's basically always been through history. We're back to conservatives enforcing their views on people and targeting anyone they view as outside their norm. But that's also not what progressive means. Change is a shit metric. Everyone talks about change. Trump isn't a progressive, he's regressive, he's largely trying to dismantle the liberal achievements of the past several decades. He's illiberal, undemocratic, and wants the country to be less progressive, less democratic, and more weighted towards people like him and his friends.","title":"CMV: Progressivism Has Become The New Conservatism and Conservatism Has Become The New Progressivism"},{"text":"Trump is explicitly regressive.

Yes, it is true that Bidens expanded Child Tax Credit reduced childhood poverty almost by half in 2021, but that was a temporary policy and expired within a year. That claim about Biden cut childhood poverty in half omits the fact that, due largely to Congressional inaction, the rate in 2022 returned to its pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, the major Trump signature domestic policy, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, has been criticized as favoring the rich but doubled the standard deduction and expanded the Child Tax Credit to make many middle-class families tax-free.On foreign policy, the claim that Trump did absolutely nothing to end wars ignores major troop drawdowns during his presidency. Troop levels in Afghanistan, for example, were cut from roughly 15,000 down to 2,500 by the end of his presidency. The killing of Qasem Soleimani made things worse with Iran but did not provoke a new war, and generally Trump refrained from deeper military involvement in several areas as befits this administrations goal to recast U.S. involvement.Bidens withdrawal from Afghanistan was framed as a decisive move to end forever wars, but the chaotic execution resulted in the death of 13 U.S. service members, left billions of dollars in military equipment behind, and plunged Afghanistan into humanitarian crisis under Taliban control. These are realities that seem to undermine a narrative that what Biden did represented anything cleaner or more effective a break from the past than what came before him. Lastly, the plausible view that a Trump policy legacy has been no more than Republican norm continuance with unpredictable variations, his trade war with China, the renegotiation of NAFTA into USMCA, and the emphases on isolationist foreign policy have broken ways with traditional Republican priorities. Legislative successes for Biden too, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, have been incremental rather than transformational.","title":"CMV: Progressivism Has Become The New Conservatism and Conservatism Has Become The New Progressivism"},{"text":"Tariffs might protect some jobs but they also raise prices for consumers","title":"Trumps tariffs will create a hunger games landscape where the little guy is guaranteed to lose"},{"text":"Tesla was the greater intellectual genius, Edison a much more proficient business man and operator.

That if they could carefully make the Queer community marketable, and cool? But without all that socialist or anti-authoritarian stuff? That whacko Christian white nationalists would inevitably become unmarketable. Opening the door for greater and greater profits, for everyone.So, they didn't treat them as a threat. Instead treating them as a niche market. That was a mistake.  \\nBecause, times changed.

Sure, the rhetoric of conservatism and progressivism have changed, but not the actions.Look at Biden and Trumps actual policy achievements. Biden cut childhood poverty in half, Trump cut taxes for the wealthy.  Another example would be foreign policy. Trump and his supporters have gone on and on about ending the forever wars and yet Trump did absolutely nothing to end wars, and even did crazy risky actions like killing Sulemani (which could have led to a new war). Meanwhile, Biden got us out of Afghanistan. Yes, something like DOGE would be progress/change if it were enacted, but Im extremely skeptical it will ever come into existence - I mean even the idea itself is non-binding, it has zero direct influence over government spending, its effectively an advisory committee.Trump has a lot of big ideas, but his actual policy implementations are the same thing Republicans have been doing for decades, with a little bit of insanity and unpredictability mixed in.","title":"CMV: Progressivism Has Become The New Conservatism and Conservatism Has Become The New Progressivism"},{"text":"Wait!You mean it WASN'T Antifa??","title":"Insurrectionists Melt Down After Vance Says Trump Shouldnt Pardon Violent J6ers"},{"text":"The left is still progressive.

Once you have a larger market share you can start to raise prices again to make a real profit without subsidies. 2. Transform economy into a high tech economy like the United States and offshore all your labour to up and coming countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, India, South America, and Africa. Then replace all your labour related positions with robotics and AI. This will lessen the effects of population crisis a bit depending on how fast they can achieve this. 3. Promote child birth by giving massive incentives. Although I dont know if this can work, we will have to see how it plays out in South Korea and Japan.

If rebels were still actively fighting, then they obviously wouldn't have been arrested and taken to trial yet, but it was understood that they could be granted a pardon regardless.The need to use pardons like that is one of the reasons they didn't require anything like Senate approval for pardons.

Later reveals included controversial DNCCClinton agreements dated before the primary, regarding financial arrangements and control over policy and hiring decisions.[9] The revelations prompted the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz before the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[10] The DNC issued a formal apology to Bernie Sanders and his supporters \\"for the inexcusable remarks made over email\\" that did not reflect the DNC's \\"steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process.\\"[11] After the convention, DNC CEO Amy Dacey, CFO Brad Marshall, and Communications Director Luis Miranda also resigned in the wake of the controversy.[12]\\nConsidering the email leak did in fact show the DNC had genuine bias against Sanders and people literally resigned over the outcome of what was learnt with these leaks then yes.

He offered a real change from what came before and America got its most best President since JFK. Doesn't need to be lefty, just large and shake things up.

The 19th, if you recall, was punctuated by a Civil War, an Apocalyptic event that resulted in the disenfranchisement of traitors, and the enfranchisement of formerly enslaved. Literally the world turned upside down by violence. It also featured the settlement of a vast frontier, where opportunities to obtain land and property were actually available to the uneducated if they were willing to overlook a little genocide, and capitalists were satisfied by a constant stream of immigrants who were considered thoroughly exploitable unto death. The 20th started with 2 world wars, a Global Depression, and a flu pandemic that killed 50 to 100 million people. The progress, which included miraculous advances in medical science bringing vaccines and antibiotics, vastly improved peoples lives without their having to do their own research. The enfranchisement of women and the civil rights movement that youre likely thinking of when you refer to progress through the ballot box are still being fought over to this day. The people who oppose these changes are not going to be convinced by the promise of more progress. There isnt going to be much more progress. People are already enjoying lives of phenomenal success by historic standards and the spread of literacy has only been met by access to more sophisticated propaganda and programming, convincing them that whatever grievances they have are the result of Government taking their livelihood and giving it to someone else *in the name of Progress*. Add the manipulation of the electoral map, the closing of the frontier and NIMBYism, the sophistication of marketing and degradation of education leading people to fear the very advances that brought them out of poverty and childhood mortality, and we are truly fucked.

Now put these kids who are trained to kill anyone on the other side,  put them in a heated situation and you get Kent State. Unarmed kid protesters killed and wounded. I remember watching that on TV. It changed this country massively. For decades the hate from the civilian populace towards the military and government was massive. Much violence in this country was spurred by that and what was a similar attitude of the US Gov towards the populace as a herd to control by any means. Here we are again, history repeats. And now we have our first Convicted Felon/Sex Offender President with a score to settle, and the Supreme Court gave that criminal basically Full Immunity from Criminal Acts while President. So that cake is baked and now we wait for the inevitable.The only thing that will keep things in check is those young kids with weapons not wanting to kill their own countrymen, women and children. But we also know in those ranks will be people that won't care and can't wait to pull the trigger.","title":"I Think Things Are Going to Be Bad, Really Bad: The US Military Debates Possible Deployment on US Soil Under Trump"},{"text":"This is basically the Southern Strategy 2.0A new study, however, suggests that the main threat to our democracy may not be the hardening of political ideology, but rather the hardening of one particular political ideology. Political scientists Steven V. Miller of Clemson and Nicholas T. Davis of Texas A&amp;M have released a working paper titled \\"White Outgroup Intolerance and Declining Support for American Democracy.\\" Their study finds a correlation between white American's intolerance, and support for authoritarian rule. In other words, when intolerant white people fear democracy may benefit marginalized people, they abandon their commitment to democracy.the GOP has increasingly been embracing a politics of white resentment tied to disenfranchisement. \\"Since Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy, the GOP has pigeon-holed itself as, in large part, an aggrieved white people's party,\\" \\"Social intolerance isn't just leading to GOP support as we know it and see it now,\\" Miller says. \\"It's leading to preferences in favor of the kind of candidate the GOP ultimately nominated and supported for president.\\" In embracing the politics of white identity, then, the GOP made a Trump possible  and is likely to make more Trump-like candidates successful in the future.  https://archive.ph/GvO5MAlso...A better narrative is the drift Democrats have seen in their coalition is the end phases of a gradual realignment that started with the Civil Rights Movement. As Angie Maxwell and Todd Shields convincingly demonstrate in The Long Southern Strategy, the process of racist white southern voters (and others with a southern identity) moving from their ancestral home in the Democratic Party to an increasingly nativist Republican one was a long one. The bulk of them had left by Clintons time, but a few stuck around well into the Bush and Obama presidencies. The defection of seven million working-class (I use parentheses because many are reasonably affluent) voters to Trump in 2016 was not a delayed reaction to the economic policies of Clinton two decades prior. Rather it was a final few late adapters catching up to where their cohort had been for some time. Many had already been trending this way, having voted for Bush and split tickets under Obama. With Trump the realignment was complete: attitudes to race now directly lined up with partisan identity. These voters are now locked in as Republicans. They will not return in our lifetimes. https://archive.ph/Okt5w","title":"There are a lot of bitter people here, Im one of them: rust belt voters on why they backed Trump again despite his broken promises"},{"text":"Amen","title":"GOP Senator Blames Americans for Most of Their Health Problems"},{"text":"They need you to bend the knee.","title":"Banned for like Donald trump wow"},{"text":"Musk embarrasses himself when conversing with true professionals because Musk has never valued learning or education.

This interpretation distorts the original context and meaning of Jesus words.Context of Jesus StatementIn the Gospels, Jesus makes this statement when a woman anoints him with expensive perfume. Some disciples criticize her, suggesting the perfume could have been sold and the money given to the poor. Jesus responds by saying, The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.Key points of the context:\\n\\t?\\tJesus emphasizes the importance of recognizing the significance of his impending death.\\n\\t?\\tHe is not dismissing care for the poor but highlighting the unique moment of his presence.\\n\\t?\\tJesus ministry consistently advocated for caring for the marginalized, sick, and poor (e.g., Matthew 25:35-40, Luke 4:18-19).Misinterpretation in the Statement\\n\\t1.\\tIgnoring the Call to Compassion:\\nJesus consistently urged compassion and care for the poor and vulnerable. Using his words to justify neglecting healthcare contradicts his teachings. He healed the sick (Matthew 14:14), fed the hungry (Mark 6:34-44), and commanded his followers to care for the least of these (Matthew 25:40).\\n\\t2.\\tMisunderstanding Jesus Message:\\nJesus statement acknowledges the persistent reality of poverty but doesnt suggest passivity or justify inaction. Instead, it implies that because poverty exists, continuous care and support are necessary. In Deuteronomy 15:11, a verse Jesus may be referencing, it says: There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land. This calls for generosity, not withdrawal of aid.\\n\\t3.\\tBlaming Individuals for Health Issues:\\nThe assertion that some people dont want healthcare and arent going to take care of themselves contradicts the spirit of Jesus ministry. Jesus never required people to meet certain conditions before offering healing or help. Blaming individuals ignores systemic barriers to healthcare, including affordability, accessibility, and education.Biblical Support for Healthcare and Compassion\\n\\t?\\tMatthew 25:36-40: I was sick, and you looked after me Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\\n\\t?\\tLuke 10:25-37 (Parable of the Good Samaritan): Emphasizes helping others regardless of their background or circumstances.\\n\\t?\\tJames 2:15-17: If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?ConclusionUsing Jesus words to justify cutting healthcare support misinterprets Scripture. Jesus called for compassion, healing, and care for the vulnerable.

They just get spent by the government.And how does the government decide on what to spend money on? They're incentivized based on what is politically desirable. And this causes all kinds of problems. Suppose we have a $1 tax on all Americans that goes to a program that pays a bunch of people to dig holes in the desert and a bunch of other people to fill those holes back up again. Your average American isn't going to notice the $1 tax bill, but the folks digging the holes are going to notice their share of $330 million and fight tooth and nail to keep it. Thus you have a political pressure to preserve and expand even the least effective government programs. Additionally taxes pay for research into things that are not profitable to pursue in the near term but become extremely profitable in maturity. The corporate world will not find research if the pay off horizon is too long.A big part of this is government research crowding out private investment.   We the people can spend it better than the oligarchs.We the people might. But the government is not we the people.

Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives with 219 seats, representing 140 million people, while Democrats have 215 seats, representing 160 million people. Congressional Republicans in both the Senate and House represent a minority of the population. The founders knew that having two Senators for each state, regardless of population, would give smaller states more power, but the House of Representatives was meant to be more representative. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has been capped at 435 seats since 1929, which again gives smaller states a grossly unfair power advantage. Uncapping the House, making each congressional district half the size of the population of the smallest state would move the country much closer to a more perfect union. The threats, corruption and incompetence of Congressional Republicans, representing a minority of the American population, exacerbate the political divisions that our foreign enemies have been trying to foment  for decades.","title":"House Republican Threatens To Withhold Disaster Aid From California Amid Deadly Wildfires - Ohio congressman Warren Davidson's \\"problem\\" with the state's forest management appears to echo misleading claims in conservative media."},{"text":"Hell, he may look for a way to penalize people for using solar","title":"People are rushing to install solar panels before Trump becomes President"},{"text":"It's all a bad idea tbh and probably won't work.","title":"Trumps threats to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland sound like Putin on Ukraine | Embracing the Kremlin plan to establish U.S. and Russian spheres of influence would be a dangerous mistake."},{"text":"Yeah, I read it.

I feel like I have a new clarity, a key insight into the politics of my entire lifetime (I'm 56) that I never, ever had before. It is this.Great social progress was made by blacks and women in the 1960s and 70s. White supremacy and patriarchy run very, very deep in our culture. It goes back centuries. Naturally some of us were not happy with these new developments. Black people could go anywhere white people went, including your kids schools. And women could get their own credit cards, have jobs, and control their own fertility with the pill.In the wake of these developments, some of white America turned against the government they felt had betrayed them. They migrated to the Republican Party. And so the party was against just about every policy that might materially benefit average AmericansCbecause now it included *them*. (See Heather McGhee's The Sum Of Us and how white Americans across the country drained the public pools and filled them in permanently rather than swim with their black neighbors.)It's the reason why we have shit healthcare, shit wages, shit childcare, shit infrastructure and all the other things that wealthy democracies elsewhere seem to have. If we have to share it with *them*, then nobody will have it.Not coincidentally, it was around this same time that American evangelicals developed strong feelings about abortion that they'd never had before. The desire to control women is very strong and it if cannot find a socially acceptable outlet it will find an underground one, a proxy issue. Welcome to the pro-life movement.Also not coincidence that it was around this same time that a 200 year old gun safety and marksmanship outfit transformed into a crazed gun rights lobbying group. Meet the modern NRA. Gotta have a lot of guns around in case the government tries to make things even more equal. Plus there's black people everywhere!Meanwhile, the rest of us become a little more progressive each passing decade. Next thing you know there's a black family living in the White House for eight years. Democrats seemed certain to put a women in next and gay people can get married now and you're supposed to treat them like regular people!It was too much. Along comes Donald Jerome Trump. His open racism and misogyny signals that finally here is someone who will champion their vanishing way of life. MAGA is nothing more than a desire to return to a time when straight white men controlled everything, women and people of color knew their places, and the LGBTQ folks were invisible.And so 98% of the vote is locked in, completely tribal, us against them. But Trump's brand of politics isn't quite popular enough to win reliably without an assist, without a good tailwind behind it. It got that assist in 2016 from James fucking Comey and Vladimir goddamn Putin, and Trump won. It didn't get such a boost in 2020, and he lost. But in 2024 he got a big assist from post-pandemic inflation. Voters wrongly blamed it on the incumbent party just as they did in many other countries.That is what this is about.

Nixon was a nutcase and a criminal; Reagan was a piece of shit who started our now-endemic quest to make the rich ever richer at whatever cost to the not-rich. But I think the party was still salvageable, to a point -- had any Republican given a damn.They blew past that point when they were incandescent with rage because Clinton beat the incumbent Republican President, George H. W. Bush. If you were both alive and old enough to be aware of politics at that time, the GOP desire for vengeance against Clinton was both bizarre and palpable. (Remind you of any evil idiot with an orange rat's nest on his head?)In effect, the Republicans considered it an outrage that Clinton had won -- as though he had no right to the presidency, as though he had stolen what belonged to them. They were determined to punish him for his \\"wrongful,\\" undeserved victory. Gingrich &amp; his filthy ilk jumped on the task of bringing him down immediately. (Clinton was a deeply flawed human being, and certainly a flawed politician, but frankly he was no worse than anybody else at that time -- and was actually a decent president.)So for me, the GOP's march to sociopathy truly began with the defeat of G. H. W. Bush. Their party became all about retaining power at any cost, and continuing Reagan's work of lifting the rich ever higher; inviting grotesque foreign leaders into our political process to gain access to foreign funds and support; punishing Democrats rather than improving the lives of Americans -- and doing everything they could to create a world where no Democrat would ever win an election.","title":"Let's see what Trump does with this."},{"text":"Every time they invent a weird authoritarian conspiracy theory about the Democrats, it's because they would like to do that thing themselves.","title":"\\"There will be strings attached\\": GOP Sen. says Los Angeles wildfire aid won't be \\"blank check\\""},{"text":"Yes, there has always been cancer, but not nearly on the level we see today.More people die of cancer today because people live longer and other illnesses that would typically kill younger people (like tuberculosis, smallpox, measles, malnutrition, etc) have largely been solved in first world countries.","title":"CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire"},{"text":"no but the true number is unknown.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"Its better for the dems to find their own talent then rely off someone who had previously lost statewide in Florida.","title":"Matt Gaetz says he will potentially run for Florida governor"},{"text":"Triumph out here taking strays, and not the canine kind.","title":"Trumps Talk Of Expansion Puts World Leaders On Alert: You cant distinguish between the insult comic dog and an actual U.S. foreign policy"},{"text":"Fuck off  Republicans.

Trump asked, Cant you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something? Esper wrote in his 2022 memoir, A Sacred Trust. At another point Trump urged his Joint Chiefs chair, Gen. Mark Milley, to beat the fuck out out of the protesters and crack skulls, and he tweeted that when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Esper wrote that he had to walk Trump back from such ideas and the president didnt pursue them.One lawyer, John Dehn of Loyola University  a former Army career officer and West Point graduate  calls this the Milley problem, referring to the well-documented angst of the former Joint Chiefs chair during Trumps first presidency. Milley stirred controversy by publicly apologizing after Trump used him in a staged photo of the Lafayette Square incident. During the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, he reportedly assured then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would prevent any unwarranted use of the military, and he has acknowledged calling his Chinese counterparts to assure them that no nuclear weapons would be launched before Trump left office.Milley, who has called Trump fascist to the core, later told Bob Woodward for the 2024 book War that he feared being recalled to active duty to face a court-martial for disloyalty. At one point Trump himself suggested Milley could have been executed for treason.Even if we get the law straight, whats the right thing to do? adds Parsons. If the president invokes the Insurrection Act we dont really know what the ethical boundaries are. Among the military lawyers this is just uncharted territory.Says one lawyer who has studied many cases of military-civilian conflict and spoke on condition of anonymity because he fears retribution from the new Trump administration: I think things are going to be bad, really bad. This is going to be worse than last time. Trump is angry.

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

The people who bring those advancements out of the lab and to the mass market where they can actually make a difference in peoples' everyday lives are the business and finance folks. There may in fact be more efficient ways to martial resources to do that, but every other system in history that we've tried so far has been worse.

Just as often, it has led to a decline in SOLin the exurbs that get polluted and squalorized or in regions that get abandoned to decline because their industry did not keep up.So your argument is that in the nations that have industrialized, more people are poor compared to before the industrial revolution? That technological progress has stripped away as much wealth from the everyday man and woman as it has generated?The poverty rates don't bear that out at all.  These were mitigated by collective bargaining and regulations. What good is electricity and TV if youre working 16 hour days in coal mine giving yourself black lung?Similarly, if the populace doesn't need electricity to run their home appliances then you don't need coal miners to source fuel for the power plants. But that means that a lot of people's time and labor is being spent on other menial labor tasks that could've been electrified.","title":"CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire"},{"text":"I think they realize how infeasible it is and if Holeman is saying this that's saying something.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"I'm glad things are getting better for you all out there.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"\\"The law allows only for?express?exceptions, and no part of the Constitution expressly empowers the president to use the military to execute the law.?\\"Military leaders can refuse because it is an unlawful order.

We all want to just live happily and enjoy our family and friends while making ends meet in exchange for our efforts of labor. There are plenty of issues to be concerned about, but I think we need to be worried about the rich on both sides, because they only care about getting richer, and that usually happens at our expense. Capitalism isnt functioning properly, stifling innovation and ballooning wealth inequality. Im worried that our concern about immigration depressing wages is misplaced, not because it doesnt matter, but because I think it will be like a wave compared to the tsunami that AI will bring. Rich people will naturally employ AI and robotic systems that are getting cheaper and more reliable than human labor in a lot of aspects. That will depress wages way more than immigration because those agentic systems will be cheaper and mass producible. Not to mention surveillance and privacy threats. They will have the ability to control our minds and movements, if they dont already, and we will never be able to fight back. I just hope my fellow countrymen are waking up to whats coming so that we can advocate for the most pressing issues. We really are all on the same side.

I made it my personal thing to take this guy down.Steve Bannon, former advisor to President-elect Donald Trump and a podcaster who calls his right-wing audience on War Room his army of the awakened, is determined to get billionaire and new Trump ally Elon Musk far away from the White House.In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Bannon said that hell get it done before the president-elect takes office in just over a week. I will get Elon Musk kicked out by the time hes inaugurated, Bannon told the outlet. He wont have a blue pass with full access to the White House. Hell be like everyone else.Bannon did not respond to an email from Vanity Fair asking how he plans to oust Musk.The pair have been dueling over what the future of the Make America Great Again strategy ought to look likeand who should be let into that movements ranks and the countrys borders. Bannon, and some other staunchly anti-immigration MAGA talking heads like Laura Loomer, are against the highly coveted H-1B visa programwhich allows employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations or as fashion models. Specialty occupations require the visa applicant to have at least a bachelors degree or its equivalent, per the Department of Labor. This kind of visa often goes to workers in fields such as math, engineering, and technology.Enter Muskthe richest man in the world who also happens to be the CEO of multiple companies in these fields, and who himself came to the US as an international student and says he worked using an H-1B visa. (According to reporting from Forbes based on H-1B data from fiscal year 2024, Tesla, which Musk runs, was among the leading employers of new foreign-born scientists and engineers.)The reason Im in America, along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong, is because of H1B, Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, in late December. Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face, he continued, I will go to war on this issue, the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.In tandem with railing against the programs detractors, Musk also said the visa system could use major reform and was broken.That week on War Room, Bannon called Musk a MAGA convert and told him to sit in the back and study.We love converts, Bannon said. But the converts sit in the back and study for years and years and years to make sure you understand the faith and you understand the nuances of the faith and understand how you can internalize the faith.Dont come up and go to the pulpit in your first week here and start lecturing people about the way things are going to be, Bannon continued. If youre going to do that, were going to rip your face off.Trump, who in 2020 referred to the H-1B visa program as very bad for workers and said that we should end it, sided with Musk. Ive always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. Thats why we have them, Trump told the New York Posts Jon Levine in December.The visa debate was one of the latest examples of MAGA infighting, fueled by conflicting ideas about what it means to be a Trump supporter and ally going into his second term. On one side, theres Musk, who has become increasingly influential to the president-elect and gave over a quarter billion dollars to political action committees that backed Trump in the final months of the campaign. On the other, theres old-guard MAGAincluding people like Bannon, who was pardoned by Trump in 2021 for allegedly defrauding Americans who chipped in to Build the Wall.Musk acknowledged this divide in December when he responded to a post on X that wrote of two factions, the tech right and right right.Continue reading at [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/steve-bannon-vows-to-oust-elon-musk-from-donald-trump-inner-circle) ","title":"Steve Bannon Vows To Oust Elon Musk From Donald Trumps Inner Circle Before The Inauguration: I made it my personal thing to take this guy down"},{"text":" The Gilded Age (1865-1910) was a time of rapid industrialization, private excess, and public corruption.?The dominant economic doctrine of the U.S. government was laissez-faire, which meant the government played a minimal role in the economy.?","title":"Wall Street looks forward to a bonfire of capital and climate rules under Trump"},{"text":"It's not a pyramid scheme it's a greater fools scheme.","title":"Trump and His Crypto Cronies Have Big Plans.

Meanwhile, apparently the women he traveled with were all at least 18, according to the House Report. So, I had it backward.

Vance is in this to advance his own political future.

Just stick to his duties as President of the Senate and distance himself from Trump. Because the alternatives are worse: resigning means he's lost the approval of Trump and many likely GOP voters, but given their short memories maybe he can stage a comeback for 2032 (he's young). Resigning means giving up.Plus, impeachment and conviction is impossible since no Democrat will vote for that because it's likely Trump would pick someone way worse than Vance as VP, some rubber-stamper. I dislike the guy but at least I think that (like Pence) Vance would be more of a tempering voice than anyone else Trump would appoint if there was a theoretical falling out.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"It's from Battlestar Galactica.

If taxes are 0%, then it's worth pursuing this venture because your expected return is $1.5 million. If taxes were 50%, then your expected return is only $750,000, so the venture is not worth doing.I think that America can certainly increase certain taxes without causing too much economic harm, but OP thinks that there should not be any billionaires, and any country that makes that a priority would face economic disaster.

Capitalism is an economic system that existed since the days of the cavemen. Only in the last 200 years (out of about 300,000, that human kind exists) people started debating alternatives. So far very few alternatives were implemented and they failed big time. Having said that, different societies decided to adopt all kind of shades for their capitalism. In some civilizations the thinkers, philosophers and scientists were at the top. In others, military people and army leaders. Others preferred religious leaders and personalities (like shamans and prophets). US decided that people who generate profits are the most valuable. Among these: speculators (aka investors), money manipulators, top athletes, gamblers (aka stock traders), entertainers, comedians, actors They became like aristocracy or royalty in other countries. That however, has nothing to do with capitalism! These are the priorities of the American society! Americans also decided that scholars and scientists (that in other societies are top tier), will be in a low(er) priority.

The increase in domestic manufacturing prices for products like washers and dryers might have been a short-term side effect, but it also led to a resurgence in domestic production, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains which can be less stable during global disruptions like pandemics or geopolitical tensions. Inflation during Trump's presidency was relatively low, averaging around 2% per year until the onset of the global health crisis in 2020, which significantly altered economic conditions worldwide. Comparing inflation rates during his term to post-2020 shows that much of the inflationary pressure seen later was due to unprecedented global economic recovery efforts, supply chain issues, and monetary policy decisions, not solely Trump's policies.","title":"Mike Johnson Seeks Money From Inflation Reduction Act"},{"text":"\\"What the hell is a possum comitatus anyway?\\" -- Trump","title":"I Think Things Are Going to Be Bad, Really Bad: The US Military Debates Possible Deployment on US Soil Under Trump"},{"text":"Panama has broken treaties when it comes to the canal being neutralI think you're making this up.Greenland has taken great interest of leaving the UK unionI know you're making this up.leaving us venerableI gotta agree here, helping Ukraine is quite venerable.","title":"Trumps threats to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland sound like Putin on Ukraine | Embracing the Kremlin plan to establish U.S. and Russian spheres of influence would be a dangerous mistake."},{"text":"\\nIt always embarrassed Samuel Vimes when civilians tried to speak to him in what they thought was policeman.

He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans took advantage of both opportunities to blame their opponents for the economic consequences.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump admin crippled the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize everything pandemic related, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*To elaborate more on Trump's tariffs:Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations, things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved, and risks that Trump failed to take into account. Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources to manage the fallout. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesTrump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the outcomes are estimated to be costly for most Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump is not an \\"economic genius,\\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. Trump has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.He has profited off of screwing over people who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties for decades, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.Trump is not a financial guru, his admin's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.The next Trump admin, which is already the richest in U.S. history, will destroy what's left of a labor movement that's been in steady decline ever since Reagan's presidency. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of union workers, when he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.And over the next four years, Trump's MAGA coalition will continue their efforts to redistribute wealth to the top.Even Trump's immigration policie, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"Canadas Trudeau urges US consumers to consider the harm of Trumps tariff threats"},{"text":"What the article says makes sense.

But I can almost guarantee you and all of your friends and family use Amazon regularly, because they are amazing at what they do. Even if you have claimed in this thread that the workers conditions are appalling (they are not) compared to many developing and developed nations, we all still use it. Because it's a great product.I am hugely in favor of allowing businesses to operate without being strangled by regulations. Of course we need some to stop complete exploitation. This all exists on a spectrum and we go back and forth over time but largely since industrialization we trend towards increased regulation over time. Occasionally some deregulation occurs, but largely, more regulations pile on every year. In America, if you started a business that grew as large as Amazon and touched basically every single household in the country, a country of 330 million people ranked top 5 in the world for MEDIAN income, what do you propose we do? Amazon has a trailing 12onth revenue of $620B and net income of $50B dollars. Jeff Bezos started and grew  a successful company that employs over 1,000,000 people in the US. The stock market values his company at $2.3T and as 9% owner at this point he he has created almost $2T in wealth for other people along with providing a service the whole country uses. You can argue over the valuation, for example in my opinion, the market cap of tesla is far higher than makes sense when compared to other legacy car companies, even if tesla is a \\"tech\\" car company.Anyway, as the other commenter has basically asked, what is your better solution here? You are aware almost all of the wealth of these individuals are not in a bank account and is instead equity in the company they grew. So the options as i see them are essentially something like this (not exhaustive, just my general gist)(1) Recognize that at scale, any individual company as large as Amazon or Walmart will create millionaires and a maybe a couple of billionaires per company, and find a way to fairly tax them on the company via salary, dividends, loans with stock as collateral etc. But they're still going to be billionaires. (2) Hinder the creation of wealth by over regulating/absurdly high taxes. In this instance, we draw an impossible line somewhere bw a small business/startup which we want to incentivise in this country (so we continue to be market leaders and innovators amongst the rest of the world), and a company with a billion dollar market cap. At some point bw the startup and the mature billion dollar company, we find a way to take the owners wealth they are creating for themselves with their company. At the extreme, wed basically lose all large companies in the US as they grow at some point to countries abroad with more favorable business environments. We'd at least lose US jobs as they offshore portions of the business. We lose innovation and wealth creation to countries abroad if we make it too hard to grow a business (3) But if you want to make this a capitalism vs communism thing, if we let the state takeover the businesses once they get too big, then the billionaire class still exists they are just now guaranteed to also be involved in government whereas we at least get the illusion of voting for our representatives In my opinion, we need to find a way to let the billionaires grow businesses in the US. We are fucked if we lost all of the great American companies. It really just comes down to the fact that the workers at these companies that are truly massive just need to be compensated fairly somehow. Either higher salary or equity like we see in the tech companies (Nvidia made so many employees millionaires). But we cannot create an environment that forces people with drive and passion and good ideas to not start their companies hereWe have to be realistic, we are never going to make the whole world the same. Where everyone is perfectly equal. So again at the extreme, if we try to go too far down that road here, people will look elsewhere in the world and the US is no longer a superpower and we lose tax revenue and people pull their money from pur capital markets and our military shrinks as a result and we truly start to degrade as a nation as people go elsewhere.

Another misconception is that wealth has a limit, as in there is a finite amount of wealth, so rich people getting richer automatically means everyone else is less rich- this is not true. As wealthy people get more wealthy in modern times, so are poor people. The biggest misconception however is that capitalism is objectively bad for people compared to alternatives.

Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of Denmark and host to one of the largest US Air Force bases, contains large deposits of most of the minerals considered critical by the US Geological Survey.**That was my attempt to provide to investors a glimpse of what opportunities exist in Greenland, Fernandez told Reuters. Greenland wants to become the next mining frontier.**In Greenland, we see the development of critical minerals as a shared global responsibility, where our country can take on a leading role, said Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenlands minister for industry, trade, minerals, justice and gender equality. The US State Department has been offering permitting, mapping and other regulatory advice to Nuuk officials, as well as helping to draft a mining investment law, all aimed at prodding investment in Greenland at standards considered higher than Chinese-linked rivals. Yes, we want to get their critical minerals and use them in our economy, but we dont want to do that at their expense, said Fernandez.*If Greenland becomes independent from Denmark, which could very well happen in the next years, they need investment and a way to sustain themselves economically.Trump's warmongering isn't helping, it only drives Greenland into the hands of Russia and China who also have an interest in the island.\\n...Reg PanamaChina has taken control over the entrance gates on both sides of the Panama Canal, which of course is worrying and a shitty move by Panama, who dropped diplomatic relations to Taiwan in favor of China in 2017.
