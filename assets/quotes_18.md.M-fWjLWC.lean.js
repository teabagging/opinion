My transition was also delayed, by a combination of me being scared and some degree of not being willing to accept myself. So I know how much that regret of not transitioning sooner can hurt.And I don't strictly speaking have anything against people who choose to transition because they have gender euphoria, even if they don't have dysphoria. Like you said I knew I wanted to be a girl, i knew it would make me happy so I chose to transition.That is good enough for me tbh.My main desire for *some* level of gatekeeping is to keep out people that are obviously not trans but co-opt the label anyways. And the trans community is generally so effusively accepting that they just welcome anyone with open arms regardless of how ridiculous the premise is.Like sorry no, I do not share my identity with xenogenders or bored college students who decide to flip their pronouns (and never do anything beyond that to transition) and give themselves some ridiculous name that isn't even an actual human name. Or middle aged men that go online and claim they are trans, but do not seem to express that outside of porn subs.Again, I'm not saying those people aren't free to do what they want. Stand out from the crowd or indulge in a fetish idgaf. But they sure as hell aren't trans, so as far as I'm concerned them trying to co-opt the label is something akin to blackface. Adopting any truscum or trans med position for the sake of appeasing conservatives will never work. Dw, I don't expect any modern day republican to be anything but awful. Trying to win them over is pointless, but making sure democrats can win swing voters is pretty damn important though imo.

I'm trained to use the equipment I carry on duty.  As far as medical equipment goes, I regularly carry an AED, a CPR barrier, tourniquets, pressure bandages, guaze, chest seals and Narcan.  I can proficiently use all of these.  I'm also trained to recognize the possibility of common medical complaints like diabetic hypoglycemia and provide basic support like having the person consume a sugary drink if available.  EMT-B training is not required for me to do this.I drive a patrol car, not an ambulance.  I don't carry the kinds of medical equipment or medication that would require EMT-B training to use properly.  I don't carry oxygen tanks, I don't carry IV  fluids, I don't carry backboards or c-collars, etc.  I also don't need to carry that equipment.  Half the time, EMS beats me to the scene and the other half the time they're only a couple minutes behind me.  I'll also point out that if I did start carrying that equipment, you're now increasing the maintenance cost of my vehicle because I have to regularly inspect all that equipment and make sure it's in good condition to be used, and replace it if it's not.  I also probably need a bigger vehicle, and would likely still have to sacrifice some other needed equipment for my law enforcement role.  I already carry bulky items like breaching gear, a ballistic shield, basic crime scene processing tools, etc.  All that for medical equipment that would rarely (if ever) get used.Also, skills are perishable.  If I rarely use EMT-B skills in the field, I'll need to get regular refresher training to keep my knowledge fresh and usable.  That's another cost in both time and money.  Both are in short supply in most police departments.I've had only a handful of calls where there was even a slight delay in a person getting medical treatment and in those cases I got on the radio to let EMS know that the situation was actually more serious than they had initially been told and they needed to speed up their response.  They got there a couple minutes later.  Even then, I think you can better solve that issue by more training for the 911 call takers to correctly prioritize the call.Now, to be fair, I personally think EMT-B training would be helpful for *some* officers particularly ones who work in remote areas or in higher-risk jobs like SWAT.  I'm personally considering taking a class because I want the certification for some off duty search and rescue work I do.  But a blanket policy that *all* officers must have EMT-B training before even applying for the job?  It's unecessary and wasteful.","title":"CMV: All first responders should complete EMT basic before being qualified to apply to the job."},{"text":"Dry and confusing?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If you get into it, it's one of the more liberal narratives you'll find.There are Legends of Galatic Heroes and other Japanese works that touch on liberal ideas that show more complexity than One Piece. It's good for its demographic, which is for kids. To be honest, One Piece has problems with the way being told. One Piece has a problem with its pacing even outside of the anime. Wano skipped certain parts, which makes pacing uneven. Oda has the same problem with other modern Shonen series that show flashbacks to give villains depth. 95% of the time, it doesn't work and sometimes you don't need to give every villian a fucking a backstory. Some most iconic villains don't even have backstory like Freiza or Joker. The series is pretty formaliac when half of the arcs are the same stories structure of Arabasta. Also, Dressorosa Arc was just bad like bad bad. I don't really enjoy post-time skip because a lot of characters are somewhat static and straight flanderization like Luffy somehow is even more stupid.

The 4 levels of medical licensure on the national registry are as follows from lowest to highest level :-EMR (Emergency Medical Responder)-EMT (Emergency Medical Technician)-EMT Advanced-ParamedicAt no point will a cop learning EMT benefit their law enforcement work. EMT policy and protocols are not valid and will open up the department to lawsuits should a sworn police officer conduct EMT procedures while on duty as a police officer because in that moment they are not operating in the capacity of an EMT.*This is literally in chapter 2 of the most recent EMT manual*EMR teaches cops CPR, basic airway control, use of narcan, and bleeding control. All these techniques are applicable to police officers because the tools needed for these techniques are something they carry on their belt or their duty bag.For the sake of argument, if somehow cops are required to be EMTs, cops will now be required to carry 2 large bags to every single call they respond to that consist of various medications, cleaning and sterilizing equipment, various readers and monitors, gauze and wraps, trauma pads and splints, multiple airway inserts, oxygen, bag valve masks, nebulizer, and a magnitude of other medical equipment that equals up to about 20 lbs along with a vital reader machine that doubles as a 12 lead. On top of being required to carry those 2 bags and a vital machine reader, as an EMT, you are now required to write a patient care report (PCR) when handing over care of the patient to the ambulance personnel. Since the cop is required to write a PCR, they are now liable for the decisions they made for medical care provided. Cities already give half of their budget to police. Making all cops EMTs will increase the police budget to about 60-70% of the city budget. Does that sound reasonable?And I haven't even included the biggest conflict of interest for cops performing EMT duties that would generate the most lawsuits. Kidnapping. There is an entire legal chapter in EMT training that says very specifically EMTs cannot force a patient to go anywhere if they are of sound mind. Cops do the complete opposite of this. It's a legal hellhole for any attorney to defend a cop forcing someone to do something while they are also acting in the capacity of an EMT. No court in the world will agree to the defense saying \\"My officer was operating as an EMT for these 3 seconds of the interactions but then changed to operating as a police officer for the next 42 seconds and then switched back to operating as an EMT for the following 27 seconds\\". This describing a very likely scenario where the EMT cop realized the patient would be a danger to themselves and chose to arrest the patient against their wishes and then the EMT cop renders medical aid. This also opens up the very obvious home run strategy for any attorney to poke holes in any EMT cops asking where all of his medical equipment is during treatment since EMT cops would be required to carry the 2 large bags and vitals monitor with them when approaching anyone on the street.","title":"CMV: All first responders should complete EMT basic before being qualified to apply to the job."},{"text":"The fuck you smoking asshole?

For example, if you're banning beef (not going to happen, although we really should tax the hell out of meat in general), a person will probably react worse to seeing steak at the supermarket at an unaffordable price than seeing no steak at all. They'd probably argue you're effectively banning it for poor people, while if it wasn't on the shelves you'd be banning it for everyone.As I understand it (I could be wrong), in general taxes are more economically efficient for stuff that has negative externalities; it's generally better for that product/service/thing to be produced so utility from it can actually be utilized where it exceeds the harm it creates. And 'exceeding the harm it creates' might mean 'you have to pay to capture the equivalent amount of carbon', so only people who can afford that are able to consume it without causing excessive societal harm.I also think this might not apply as much in the US specifically due to Americans' vehement opposition to taxes specifically. Wanting to raise taxes is generally a massive struggle.That's mostly if it's directly on the consumer though, we've seen that people are either stupid or ignorant and don't understand tariff incidence so maybe arguing 'it's a tax on corporations' would work.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"leak/crack on the little stainless steel pipe connecting the nozzle to the heatsink of the hotend, blobbed a ton of PLA (probably been doing this for a while, been getting bad prints and thought it was my fault) which was revealed when the blob got big enough to blast the toolhead lid off         this shit was like 1 month old","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"When will President Trump fulfill his promise of mass mod deportation?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"California isnt even close to too big lolCalifornia would naturally be like 60-70 million if it werent for the nimbys","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Lmao what if Denmark sold Greenland to Canada just to piss off Trump","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Why this subreddit cannot differentiate a Liberal versus a Leftist is beyond me.

If something feels real, for practical purposes, it is real.","title":"Judge Rejects Bidens Title IX Rules, Scrapping Protections for Trans Students"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/hmryalasx3ce1.jpeg?width=826&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b310cba74ad81dfca88a777a8bfba540e205812dLast season he looked like this.

An invasion could very quickly remove Maduro from power, install Gonzalez, and then leave. With amnesty promised to soldiers and an unpopular regime, theres little chance of an insurgency.This reads a lot like the takes in the lead up to and in the early years of the Iraq War. The thinking was that Iraq had strong governing institutions and its people had a strong sense of nationalism instilled into them during the Saddam years. The idea was to swoop in and set up a \\"Jeffersonian democracy\\" and then leave, and doing so would spark a wave of democratization across the Middle East.I'm all for supporting the Venezuelan opposition but an invasion would be a disaster. It's mostly jungles and mountains while the cities are decrepit and ruled by gangs. The Venezuelan military is more than 200,000 strong, not counting the various pro-government militias, and is one of the most heavily armed in South America. Like in Iraq, the military would probably disintegrate and flood the country with weapons and men that know how to use them.

I think it would look a lot more like Panama in 1989 than Afghanistan or Iraq, and would thus be a all-too-rare pro-democratic action by the US in the region with a high chance of success.Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq, Venezuela is a real nation-state, there arent obvious state or nonstate actors ready and able to take advantage of chaos in the country, there is a semblance of a real (and nominally democratic!) state apparatus, and crucially there is a highly legitimate, organized opposition that literally has a mandate to take power *today*. An invasion could very quickly remove Maduro from power, install Gonzalez, and then leave. With amnesty promised to soldiers and an unpopular regime, theres little chance of an insurgency. The new government would of course face challenges rebuilding democracy and fighting the narcotraffickers coddled by Maduro, but these are fundamentally political questions many of the countrys democratic neighbors are struggling with and best resolved in a democratic framework that is impossible with Maduro in charge. More concerning is that the opposition, rooted in the old Venezuelan establishment so firmly rejected by Chavezs initial election, might be tempted to pick up where its failed economic policies and illiberal partyarchy left off. While a risk, it is still better than Maduro, even in its worst possible incarnation, and the US, having just gifted the opposition their power and proven its ability and willingness to firmly punish bad actors, would be in a strong position to ensure the basic tenets of liberal democracy are adhered to.Whether the incoming \\\\[ughhhhh\\\\] Trump administration would be willing to apply the requisite pressure and assistance in democratization is of course an open question; while there are strong democracy advocates in the administration, Trump himself obviously has a messy relationship with the concept of political liberalism, and even democracy itself, and I could quite easily see him happily endorsing a brutal right-wing dictatorship that hated woke and sent the US all the oil it wanted. \\\\[Whether this awful possibility would actually be worse than the Maduro regime is also an open question, to be fair\\\\]","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"you just had to be there","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No way we never get the good gimmicky food they keep the Canadian menus boring as hell","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So itll happen?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"These bitches be the same kind of people starting the Salem witch trials.","title":"Democrats control the rain?"},{"text":"Probably asked him if he was moving back to Kenya.","title":"What did Trump say to Obama at Jimmy Carter's ceremony?"},{"text":"Malarkey level of Canadian Fast Food restaurants outcompeting their American ones?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"TBH I still bear a grudge for having to sit through encomiums on how the youth vote was going to save us and Generation Z were just the purest cinnamon rolls to ever cast a ballot.

Sometimes I'll explain their ban to them more than just the stating the broken rule and the link to an offending comment. But other times the user knows exactly what they did and explaining it serves little purpose.Anyway, I have banned users from this sub who were being legitimate dicks and they went and complained about it in a liberal sub and misrepresented the ban by only showing the piece of the conversation in modmail that makes them look like an innocent victim and omitting the many pieces that show they were aggressive assholes.So when I see posts like this one, I often think that we have no idea (unless we really comb through their comments perhaps) if the ban was legit or not.

You keep bringing up human shields, so lets talk about them. Ive literally worked on Middle Eastern affairs my entire adult life - Ive never heard of a single incident when Hamas forced residents to stay inside or around buildings used by fighters or directed the movement of civilians to shield their militants from attacks. This is from Amnesty International:Amnesty International is monitoring and investigating such reports [of human shields], but does not have evidence at this point that Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups during the current hostilities to shield specific locations or military personnel or equipment from Israeli attacks. In previous conflicts Amnesty International has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip in violation of international humanitarian law. Reports have also emerged during the current conflict of Hamas urging residents to ignore Israeli warnings to evacuate. However, these calls may have been motivated by a desire to minimize panic and displacement, in any case, such statements are not the same as directing specific civilians to remain in their homes as human shields for fighters, munitions, or military equipment. Under international humanitarian law even if human shields are being used Israels obligations to protect these civilians would still apply.Finding random ass weapons in a bedroom somewhere (that also look like they were consciously placed) does not constitute the use of human shields.?Israel themselves have provided no evidence of Hamas use of human shields. \\nFor Israel, everyone going about their daily lives in refugee camps, in hospitals, houses of worship, and humanitarian workers are all human shields. Never mind that there is often no legitimate military objective in the area/situation where Israel makes the human shield argument. Never mind that they have not been compelled by Hamas, nor have they volunteered to shield anyone or anything, nor is there often any military objective in situations where Israel makes the human shields claim.?The mere presence of militants in a civilian area does not constitute the use of human shields, because if it did:There are military tunnels under Tel Aviv and the MoD is located in a residential area of Tel Aviv (which also houses an IDF base - Camp Rabin). So using your argument, Israel is using the civilian population of Tel Aviv as a human shield. Hell, I personally was at an IKEA years ago in Tel Aviv and there were IDF soldiers pursuing around with their weapons - were the IKEA shoppers then human shields?The IDFs radio network Galatz broadcasts from a civilian apartment building - are the civilians inside said building human shields?If (god forbid) an Israeli civilian was tragically killed during Irans missile attack on the Mossad HQ - would the civilians death thus be the fault of Israel (for embedding military facilities within civilians)? On the contrary, theres amble evidence (going back to Operation Cast Iron and even further - to the 1960s) that Israel uses Palestinians as human shields:https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/middleeast/palestinians-human-shields-israel-military-gaza-intl/index.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-human-shields.htmlhttps://www.btselem.org/human_shields (BTselem is an Israeli human rights agency)Every Israeli accusation is a confession.

Cops know basic CPR, and a lot of municipalities think that is enough, because when a life needs to be saved, police will not be the only people who arrive.What specifically do you think cops should be able to do that they aren't able to do right now that's outside the basics? What training are they missing that's insufficient for the time it takes for people who do have that training to arrive?Id like to know. Is it a logistic issue? Is it a historical issue?I think it's a cultural issue. Police aren't viewed as the first responders who are there to save lives, they're viewed as the authority figure whose presence allows the other representatives of our government who DO know what they're doing and DO give a shit if people live or die to do what they're trained to do.Unless we can get into specifics, I'm not sure what skills we need to give them that they're currently lacking. Well, I do, but that's mostly a separate discussion about the role of police in our society. Ultimately my position is that we should expect a lot more of our first responders, but that everyone we actually expect to save lives is meeting and exceeding the standards we currently have, as well as the standards I think we should have. The only exception I hold to that is police, who are not perceived nor legally obligated to protect and save human lives. From this perspective, the only argument I can present against better medical training for officers is that there are mountains of training that I feel are required between the current state of the institution and the goals that are entailed in the training I think you want to see. Basically, policing is broken, and there's a lot that needs to be fixed before we can expect them to meet the standards we hold EMTs and Firefighters to.","title":"CMV: All first responders should complete EMT basic before being qualified to apply to the job."},{"text":"I spoke directly to the bully and harshly.

This said, I can definitely understand why people would be upset over this development since it basically proves most of what these people say is just for publicity and they often aren't serious people.Had you listened to Obama, he would've told you Trump was a racist sympathizer, unfit for the presidency and that Russia hacked the election to make him President.

The point of the monarchy in a Westminster system is not to wield power, but to withhold and temper it by its mere existenceNonsense. A modern monarch is not a literary idea out of Middle Earth. Either the head of state has the power to temper or it doesn't. For instance, if the head of state has the ability to hold up a bill, there really must be a democratic mandate behind the office. It's not really tenable to never again wield that power because doing so would expose the silliness of a hereditary position.Convention might be old and strong, but it's also brittle.","title":"Liberal backbencher vows to dump the monarchy if elected leader"},{"text":"2: fuck their health issue.

This distinction was rooted in measurable, objective biological realitiesnot subjective identities. biological sex is a concrete, observable characteristic, while gender identity is a subjective self-declared experience. The effectiveness of sex-based protections depends on the use of objective standards, not personal interpretation.Expanding Title IX to include gender identity undermines its original purpose by introducing a fluid, personal construct into a framework designed to address immutable characteristics like biological sex. Sex-based protections were established to ensure fairness for women, not to accommodate personal identity claims.Expanding gender identity protections without maintaining sex-based distinctions creates several legal vulnerabilities:* **Privacy Violations:** Allowing individuals to access sex-segregated spaces based on gender identity raises privacy concerns for both women and men, challenging the right to establish boundaries based on biological sex.\\n* **Unfairness in Sports:** Title IX was established to ensure fairness for biological females in competitive sports. Allowing biological males into female categories undermines these protections, even when their numbers are small.\\n* **Harassment Protections:** When sex and gender identity are conflated, it complicates the enforcement of sexual harassment laws, which were originally designed around biological differences.People have the right to express their gender freely, but this right does not require the redefinition of objective legal categories like biological sex. Compelled speech policies forcing others to affirm gender identity against their beliefs undermine free speech principles while diluting protections designed specifically for biological women.","title":"Judge strikes down Biden's Title IX expansion to LGBTQ+ students"},{"text":"Ok, guess hamas can do whatever it wants as long as it remains embedded in civilian populations.

Russia, for instance, had multiple internal purges over the past 100 years in order to purge supposed oligarchs, arguably one of the first countries to actually purge their entire society of them, but they themselves through their political administration, and social reward system based on their contribution to their administrative system actually created their own oligarchs.\\nThe fact that Russia, Turkey, and Hungary are undemocratic are not due to their oligarchs. Every society has oligarchs, it's just that in democracies, oligarchs actually act with some semblance of democracy, so you actually see more of their presence in social media and tribunals in the West. When you stop noticing them at all, that's where the issue starts to occur. The issue is not Oligarchs themselves, but it's how to manage them economically,and how they amass that wealth to begin with.

And then the axis would, like, lose.Seriously though, you dont seem to understand the point. Nazi Germany didnt pop out of thin air. It stemmed from the Weimar Republic, which was very culturally progressive for the time. Ergo, it had an intellectual edge. The moment the Nazis won, the clock was ticking, and the brains started leaving. Regardless, future generations would never develop the same intellect, since theyd be too busy learning nonsense in school.Similarly, the USSR didnt stem from nowhere and didnt happen all at once. Neither did China. Both come from very recent destitute poverty. The USSR initially led to great progress. When it turned sour due to its old issues and its popular leaders, people started fleeing and the writing was on the wall. Chinas influence is only growing in the past decades because they are moving forward. LGBTQ rights are growing, and so is due process, and schools are good. It is without question more Democratic than Russia, and if the democracy of the USA allowed for Trump to rule, it is perhaps not so desirable.These processes are slow, but unavoidable. Ultimately, China will develop a few more rights, accept the regrettable parts of its history and the necessity to talk about them, then be just as free in the ways that matter as Europe was until recently. Fascists will always crash and burn, because they champion the worst system possible, and the US will crash and burn in the same way, along with Russia which is already on the brink of collapse. Europe will stay free if it manages to strengthen itself in the face of its problematic elements, and it can only do so by limiting ??absolutist freedom of speech?? and ??direct democracy??, which are obvious failures.But perhaps what you meant is that ??Democracy?? in the sense of people being able to vote for idiots and say stupid shit online will die. If so, it will, and good riddance. The places that stop letting idiots run will thrive, and those that didnt will see them elected then turn around to reveal themselves.

And while I would never deny that there is a divide between citizens in the US I think it goes a lot deeper than us JUST being divided. This country is afflicted with a huge level of cognitive dissonance. Both sides of the people in the last election both suffer from it, but can you blame them? We were left with two choices and neither of them were perfect though one was far worse.For generations past regardless of political alignment a rather good majority of the people in this country have discovered details that they really really dislike. Whether it's a local police force that has a record high level of people complaining about their actions, or it's a corrupt mayor for example there was a city not too far from me where for at minimum several months (I think it was a couple years though) the mayor was suspected of some pretty heinous things involving children, why did it take so long to take him down? Maybe it's the FDA taking bribes or accepting lobbying to pass things that shouldn't be passed. Or it's fluoride being put in our water. The examples can go on and on but this would be a literal wall of text with all the problems that a good majority of Americans have known about for ages. My point is what have we done about it? It doesn't matter whether you're a part of the so-called left or the so-called right or if you like to be neither. We are all still guilty of doing nothing not a damn thing. Now as things are ramping up it's starting to look to a decent amount of people like we may be past the point of no return. There is really only ONE OPTION for America and unfortunately to engage in that ONE OPTION would result in probably mass casualty or arrests. That one option that is available would be mislabeled as dissidents or domestic terrorism. We really only have three choices 1 . Continue on complaining on the internet and voting for some other puppet like we've always done. 2 . Try to use the broken system to fix our problem like a minority of people have been trying for years. 3 . Take our country back using the only option that will probably work at this point.

I get the urge to say they are all racist and evil and yada yada, but plenty of people voted for him who didnt wear MAGA hats.  And people didnt really feel they knew Harris, and many were displeased by Biden.I think its essential not to ignore the issues that concern them most or vilify them for it.  Even if you think it is racist, most people who are violently against undocumented immigration have a real reason that affects them.  They are just displacing the blame.  They are afraid of something real and displace or project the blame.  I honestly think economic insecurity is a key factor in this situation.  In the end, people are mostly concerned about how to feed their families and pay to educate their kids.  People will inevitably care most about what affects them directly.Also, people dont like shame based arguments.  We absolutely need to do more to combat racism and implicit bias.  But Ive seen that message given constructively and well received, and Ive also seen it delivered in a nearly hostile way.  And in a way that is exclusionary.  If you are giving a speech about inclusivity, you wont get much traction by excluding all white men, for example.  One of the best presentations I heard involved POCs who gave accounts of white men who supported them and saying how they need guys like that to be allies.  They used good examples and explained how these men were allies, not white saviors.  It was a presentation that made you think how proud you would be to be a support to someone like that.  No one left that presentation feeling like it was about shame, but people really seemed to hear the messages about how to be a good ally and how to drop back and support.  I know its not on POCs to teach white people that, but if you are teaching them anyways, its a method better designed to get support rather than defensiveness.  And this applies to a myriad of issues.And one area that leaves a lot of people in the middle conflicted is control.  On the right, they want to control my access to abortion, birth control, and possibly divorce.  On the left, they want to control my right to have a salt shaker on my table, to use gas heating when there isnt a better and more efficient form that will adequately heat my home in the winter, and my right to eat certain meat.  People love to restructure the choices of others, but they sure dont like it when they get restricted the same way.  If you want people to make better choices, you need persuasion, not coercion.  It worked really well with the anti smoking campaign honestly!So, those are my two cents.  Im prepared for the downvoting slaughter.  But please know that I am liberal and voted for Harris!","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"AMEN! ?","title":"Liberals being victims again"},{"text":"Further division among the classes (rich vs poor), race (whites vs minorities), sex (straight vs lbgtq), religion (Muslim vs Jews, anti-Christian sentiment) DEI woke policies in military and government.Rampant crime in major cities allowing theft of up to $900 as misdemeanors.

Knowing others here who can better articulate their points/prompts would get a better worded result.  This actually also came with citations but it's so general I removed them:I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concerns about the current state of the US government and the alarming trends that I believe threaten the future of our nation.Firstly, instances of corruption within our government have become increasingly prevalent. From the infamous Watergate scandal (1972-1974) to more recent controversies, such as the misuse of campaign funds and unethical lobbying practices, it is evident that corruption continues to undermine the integrity of our political system. These actions not only erode public trust but also hinder the government's ability to effectively serve its citizens.Moreover, it is disheartening to witness the lack of commitment from many politicians to perform their civic duties. The Founding Fathers emphasized the importance of civic responsibility as the foundation of a robust republic. However, today, we see elected officials prioritizing personal gain over the welfare of the people they are meant to represent. This neglect of civic duty is detrimental to the health of our democracy and the well-being of our society.Given the current trajectory, I am deeply concerned that these issues will not be resolved within our lifetimes. At 61 years old, you have witnessed significant changes in our political landscape, and at 41, I fear that my generation will continue to face the consequences of these systemic problems. The lack of accountability and meaningful reform makes it difficult to envision a future where these challenges are adequately addressed.As a middle-class citizen, I am particularly worried about the economic implications of these issues. My salary, which once provided a comfortable standard of living, is now at risk of diminishing to a lower middle-class or even lower-class level. This financial instability, coupled with the government's inability to address large-scale problems such as inflation and healthcare affordability, exacerbates my concerns for the future.I urge you to take decisive action to address these pressing issues and work towards restoring the integrity and functionality of our government. Your leadership and commitment to public service are crucial in navigating these challenging times.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and hope for positive change","title":"Two months later, Dems are still squabbling over lessons learned from Trumps win"},{"text":"Buncha fuckin fakers","title":"Biden might be sleeping at Carter's funeral."},{"text":"Oh they're just smelling that other guy's head.","title":"Biden might be sleeping at Carter's funeral."},{"text":" I somehow believe that democrats are both completely inept, incapable, and incompetent yet they're scheming, conniving, and coordinated enough to be destroying the world.Democrat politicians are inept at leadership, but skilled and unethical and playing politics. Running countries and convincing people to vote for you are two very different skills. Also, the \\"destroying the world\\" part is due to the ineptitude, not skillful malice. Everyone who doesn't look like me, talk like me, and believe as I do is the enemy, and I want to kill them with guns.That's an absolutely phenomenal strawman you just defeated. I can parrot Fox News talking points at you until the cows come homeYou people *really* need to update your talking points. The only people who actually still care about Fox at all are boomers. I can tell you why Democrats are bad but I can't tell you why Republicans are goodI can actually give you plenty of reasons why Republicans are *bad*. But I can also give you plenty of reasons why they're *vastly* better than Democrats, so the ones who aren't that bad tend to get my vote. If they're too bad about betraying their constituency though, I vote third party. A few examples; they aren't actively trying to strip me of my right to self defense, flood the country with millions of illegal immigrants, or pushing pornography onto schoolchildren, and they tend to be pretty decent in defending the right to life of the unborn. I tried to overthrow our government but call myself a patriotAgain, you people need to get a new talking point. No one's buying the InSuRrEcTiOn nonsense anymore. Republicans protested an election they thought was unfair. Democrats have protested *every* Republican presidential win for the past 20 years. I call my opponents perverts and pedophiles and child molesters and groomers, but the conveniently quiet about the people on my side who are actually proven to be those thingsMany of my opponents are provable perverts and groomers. And when any of those things are *actually* proven about Republicans, they're thoroughly renounced. But your standard for \\"proof\\", when the person has an R next to their name, is any random anonymous source with zero evidence. Oh, btw,  Mulattanese raped me when I was a child. He's now a proven pedophile. By the standard the left holds Republicans to, that's now enough to unperson you. I know I don't have to worry about my fellows thinking independently or using critical thinking skills, voting for anyone with an R behind their name doesn't require critical thoughtVote blue no matter who. Voting straight party line in a problem on both sides of the aisle, but there absolutely are many Republicans who try to hold their side accountable. I wish it was more, but it's definitely a bipartisan issue, which I'd argue is more prevalent on the left. If it's on Facebook or Twitter or whatever on the Internet I read it it must be true and I've got to share it!Entirely made up It is important to me to go out of my way to be disrespectful to people and if you tell me to do something I'm doing the opposite, I don't give a fuck about anyone or anything but myselfComing from the side who calls *everyone* they disagree with Nazis, or Russian assets, and constantly votes based on who's going to give them more taxpayer money, or let them kill their own babies consequence free. and even when we have claimed victory, we're still gonna be mad and we're still gonna be assholes to our opponents because we're poor losers and poor winnersAgain, you people spent the past decade calling anyone who disagreed with you a Nazi.

Bernie ran again and was once again pushed out by partisan efforts despite his populist appeal.Biden was never going to make a second bid at the WH.  The reality that he thought he could shows just how mentally disconnected he, and the entire DNC was to take it so far.  They should have pulled the plug on him year 2 and started positioning his replacement.  Kamala never had a chance - to start with she was only a 2nd rate candidate to being with, but also she had all the burdens of bland-Biden.The #1 thing all of these candidates are missing - Hillary, Biden, Harris - is they have no actual platform.  None of them actually brought any real sales pitch as to why actual every day Joe's should vote for them.Every single stump speech from Obama pivoted to his dream of the ACA.  He ran and won on this by a WIDE margin because health care is a struggle for most working Americans.  Even the mid 6 figure income earners suffer with it.  The fact that the ACA got shut down by the GOP basically primed the pump for Bernie to come in and bring it back in force.The DNC likes to blame Bernie, or his voters as if they didn't show up for the DNC.

Case in point: MLK. MLK was a committed socialist who made real progress in his goals until his assassination, after which he was neutered into this Santa Claus figure to make white people feel better. But I really dont think it ultimately matters whether this point in time is more or less bleak than othersthe point is that were here, this is what we have, and we just have to make the best of it. We have to fight for ourselves and our fellow civilians. We have to love one another and live big, loud, joyful lives because that is exactly what they dont want us to do.

Anyone trying to argue you or downplay his failing mental state is a major part of the reason the dems lost.  Not this specific point per se, but the general habit of gaslighting people.  To the point its a meme to say \\"it didn't happen, and if it did it wasn't that bad\\".  While this sort of overzealous towing of the party line is, in fact, bipartisan.....in this particular election the dems were by far the most guilty of it.  And even if we say they are not the dems ran off of the platform of \\"we are the morally correct believers of science and evidence\\" so every time they went down into the mud its 5 times as bad.  [Relevant George Carlin.](https://youtu.be/Ym12wnIWh-U)\\n* Regarding the forced Harris?  Honestly I don't even vote and that BS made me regret not being registered.  If we accept people bypassing the democratic process, the end of democracy is just a few short steps behind that.  The fact this was even attempted legit scares the shit out of me more than anything Trump did.  Because End of the Day Trump tried to fight his election loss legally.  Dems just straight bypassed the vote to put Harris on the docket.  People can argue this but this is prolly the one hill I'll die on.  VP or not, we were not talking about finishing the current presidency...she skipped the process to be the new presidential candidate and Dem, Repub, or Independent I'm going to fight that shit any time I see it happen so long as I draw breathe.  I want people to their freedom, even if they use it to be stupid or mean or etc.\\n* TBH I didn't care about the Cheyneys or their celebs or etc.  It wasn't a good look, but IMO the bigger mistake was being out of touch with who people actually care about in the modern age.  So much for being the tech savvy non-dinosaur non-boomer party lol.  Big dropped ball there IMO.\\n* Regarding minorities I don't even think its because they didn't do anything to help.  I think the Dems have tried to do alot to help, **so I disagree with you here.**  HOWEVER, I think the Democrats are completely out of touch with their minority constituents.IMO they wrongly see minorities as voterbases divided by skin color or identity.  They are not.  Minorities are Americans.  They are normal every day people.  And while they do indeed have their own unique and flavorful cultural heritages this weakens considerably each generation and they just become normal Americans for the most part.  Ironically I'd say the treatment of minorities by the Dems has been very racist/bigoted because they seem to think minorities are a homegenous group that will vote based on their skin color or identity.  And this is true with women too.  The fact Repubs screwed up so majorly with the abortion debate and still did as well as they did with women says alot about how much individuality matters in the US.  Stop flarking treating people like they are a monolithic group.* Regarding Jan 6th I've reviewed the original source recordings of his speech.  I don't think it counts as incitement and I think if we move the line for incitement to that level then there are alot of democrats who should be in jail.  Now, my problem isn't where the line is drawn...but if you draw the line you need to enforce it fairly.  We can't be constantly drawing two sets of rules for Trump and not Trump.  That's how you piss people like me off.  Because I look further down the line how that precedent can turn around and lead to some very dark places.  For example if Trump is responsible for some of his followers being idiots then every streamer, influencer, and company becomes liable for their audience.  I really don't think people understand just how far reaching considering that speech incitement would be if you applied that same standard fairly elsewhere.  And, because reality loves irony, the same people who want Trump arrested for incitement are cheering on Luigi shooting CEOs.  People going on record saying CEOs should be shot and suggesting other tragets.  The lack of self awareness is comical.  Tons of much more blatant incitement.\\n* Honestly I dont think your average voter gives the faintest crap about Palestine.  They are more concerned about their jobs, their pocket book, the social norms they have to navigate, and etc.  Basically, economy and democracy.  I WILL say however as an older person with more democratic values (40) it is absolutely baffling to me how we used to be very anti-war and pro speech and we flipped on both.  What the everliving hockey pucks lol.**EDIT:**  As a general rule folks, don't accuse someone of being \\"incredibly divorced from reality\\" or say directly or heavily imply that anyone who disagrees with you is stupid, ignorant, or otherwise deficient.  That kind of holier than thou approach is a good part of why the last election was lost.  The average voter is really tired of being told the things in front of them are not true.  And while they are not always right about this, there are enough times they are to completely shake their faith.  Examples:  The pollsters, the world wide panda demic, how biased \\"fact checking\\" was, etc.  You may walk away feeling right, but you've undercut your own causes.  And saying \\"but x also does it\\" whatboutism doesn't help either lol.  In a race to the bottom, the dems lose if its a near tie because they present themselves as morally superior as like their entire platform so they suffer the backlash from the same actions more strongly.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"When grandpa says he is just resting his eyes","title":"Biden might be sleeping at Carter's funeral."},{"text":"So were going to nitpick on if he bought on Jan 1 or not lol?Doesnt matter what the strategy was, the point remains that a long holding strategy was a better position for 2024, not an active trading strategy","title":"Nancy Pelosis Stock Portfolio Explodes in Value, Beats Market by Nearly 200%"},{"text":"\\"Vote Blue no matter who\\".

If you require EMT training prior to even allowing somebody to apply to become a firefighter, you're putting the burden and costs of EMT training and going to the right places on a person who literally doesn't work for you yet. This is a person who is not yet a firefighter, or even knows for sure that they can become one, and that extra cost and requirement would be unduly prohibitive in blocking viable candidates.It would be much better to vet them and get them started in training, and during the course of training to be a firefighter you have them take the specific EMT courses you want them to take. However, I do take issue with your assertion that a full EMT-B is actually necessary for all first responders, a group comprised of 4.6 million people in the US, but I'm not against it as a concept. It's just I believe that since it's a 110 hour training program, there's probably a step down from there that's fine enough for police and fire department personnel who are going to actually be calling ambulances in all medical emergencies anyways.","title":"CMV: All first responders should complete EMT basic before being qualified to apply to the job."},{"text":"Yes.

Making EMT basic mandatory would significantly reduce the pool of qualified candidates at a time when police and fire departments are already struggling with recruitment.In major cities like yours, response times are critical. Having fewer officers or firefighters on duty because of extra certification requirements means longer wait times for emergencies. Is it worth having slightly better medical training if it means waiting 5-10 minutes longer for help to arrive?Look at the actual data - most police and fire calls don't involve medical emergencies. When they do, EMTs usually arrive within minutes anyway. The current first aid training is sufficient for the \\"golden minutes\\" until proper medical help arrives.From a taxpayer perspective, this would be incredibly wasteful. EMT basic courses cost $1000-2000 per person and take 120-150 hours to complete. Multiply that across every police officer and firefighter, and we're talking millions in public funds that could be better spent on equipment, higher salaries, or more personnel.I get the ideal of having everyone super-qualified, but in the real world, we have to balance different priorities. The current system of having specialized roles (police, fire, EMT) working together is actually more efficient than trying to make everyone a medical expert.","title":"CMV: All first responders should complete EMT basic before being qualified to apply to the job."},{"text":"And the other guy threw down monster dunks in the WNBA.

He wasn't fit, he knew it, everyone around him knew it, and they were just hoping he would hold out long enough to secure a second term. Democrats actually do this a lot, and important legislation has failed as a result of people like Diane Feinstein being too ill and mentally gone to even show up to vote.We, the public, did not have real evidence of this until his debate against Trump, shortly after which Biden stepped down.Forcing Harris on people without giving voters any say in who their replacement candidate would be was fucking stupid beyond belief. She was a horrible choice. Since Biden waited until after he humiliated himself in a debate with Trump, there wasn't really an alternative here, so see bullet point 1Yeah, see my response 1 here. There was no better outcome given what we knew at the times we knew it.Harris lost more minority support than any democratic candidate in my lifetime. Why? Because Democrats have steadfastly refused to actually do anything to help these marginalized groups, instead taking their votes for granted, and they finally started getting fed up. Is that all on Harris? Nope, not at all, not even mostly, but the question is what Democrats could have done differently, not just HarrisI suspect you don't like the answer this will generate, given some of your other points. For example, minorities, especially hispanic minorities, tend to wand much stricter border controls and harsher treatment of illegal immigrants, who are also hispanic. The things minorities want are more conservatism, hence why they voted Trump at higher rates. Also...Democrats could have done the things they promised, like codifying a woman's reproductive rights into law before the supreme court had a chance to take those rights away, actually protecting voting rights for everyone at the federal level instead of letting republican controlled states disenfranchise tens of thousands of people, change voting laws to make them more restrictive, etc. but democrats have long held the belief that the key to presidential victory isn't actually helping people through legislation but claiming their victory was required to ensure a supreme court that wouldn't do everything Trump's hand-picked courts have now doneDemocrats never at any point had the power to do this. There were not and are not enough Democratic senators willing to overturn the filibuster to get any of this passed. Had it not been for Sinema, maybe something could have gotten done. Manchin is another story. No other Democrat could have won that seat.Biden's DOJ could have moved faster to investigate and prosecute Trump for his treason on January 6th, instead of waiting until mere months before the election to even try to go to trial. This is an especially fucking hare-brained move because there's a long-standing precedent of courts refusing to involve themselves in politically linked cases close to an election. Trump should have been in jail by 2022, not getting his supreme court buddies to claim he has unlimited immunity for vaguely-defined \\"official acts\\" in 2024.This one is undoubtedly a failing of Biden, but would it have led to Democrats winning in 2024? Remember, Trump could have run for president from prison and he would have had enough supporters and funding to do so and still be able to speak to his voters. Sure, it would have hurt him, but I'm not that confident that he would have lost in this case.Having even a remotely acceptable proposed solution to the genocide in Palestine might have helped since, you know, not a lot of people are super comfortable supporting a regime that is directly helping an apartheid state slaughter an entire civilization, and people throughout the nation put Biden (and then Harris) on notice very early into this election cycle that their approach to Palestine was not acceptable.Aaaaand you've outed yourself as pushing your particular agenda rather than looking at evidence. Americans overwhelmingly back Israel and I've never seen any evidence of enough voters flipping over this issue to swing the election. You also have to examine the counterfactual. If Biden had supported Palestine and thrown Israel out, would that have raised his support? I highly doubt it.I think the reality is that firstly, people fucking hate inflation and, despite Biden responding to it better than any other inflationary period I'm aware of, it wasn't enough. Secondly, Republicans control the media ecosystem and are able to push narratives such as the farcical idea that the US economy is bad currently, and people just believe it at face value. These are not conclusions I like, and nor is the immigration one I made earlier, but it's what the data points to.You need to ignore your own political beliefs for this type of analysis.

The other two budget commitments were maintained by narrow margins.Eugene Lang, a former Finance Canada official and ministerial staffer in the 1990s, said the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.)who announced on Jan. 6 his plans to step down in the coming monthshas a pattern of missing fiscal anchors.Lang was one of several public finance experts who said this pattern reduces the Liberal governments credibility when it makes future fiscal commitments.Theyve abandoned all of them, said Lang, who is now a policy professor at Queens University. And this is from the beginning, under two different finance ministers.Lang said the modern concept of a fiscal anchor in Canadian politics was established in the 1990s during the era of then-prime minister Jean Chrtien and then-finance minister Paul Martin. At that time, the Liberal government said it would reduce the deficit to three per cent of GDP within three yearsa target it not only met, but exceeded, when it balanced the budget.The Trudeau government, noted Lang, came to power with a commitment to cap deficits at $10-million, balance the budget by 2019, and reduce the debt ratio to 27 per cent of GDP. The governments failure to meet these targets in the pre-pandemic era began the pattern of it failing to maintain its fiscal anchors throughout its mandate, said Lang.[...]He said one reason for this outcome is due to Trudeaus finance ministers appearing not to have had the same level of autonomy and authority as those under former prime ministers Brian Mulroney, Chrtien, Martin, and Stephen Harper.Crucially, said Lang, Trudeaus finance ministers seem not to have been empowered to say no to new spending proposals.Despite the rivalry between Chrtien and Martin, everybody in the government knew that the finance minister was fully backed up by the PM, and that there was no going around Paul Martin appealing for some spending, said Lang. Chrtien made that very clear throughout his time in office. They didnt like each other  but everybody knew when it came to spending decisions, fiscal policy decisions, there was no daylight between the two.He said the public falling out Trudeau had with Freeland, and also with his first finance minister Bill Morneau, highlights how spending decisions were run out of the Prime Ministers Office in a way weve never seen before.University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe said regardless of what fiscal anchor a government chooses, its important to maintain it because missing it shows a lack of discipline.When people talk about discipline, usually they mean, governments too big, said Tombe. Whatever your preferences are around big governments or small, if you lay out a fiscal plan  but every single time you update that plan you change it, that reveals a lack of discipline.He said fiscal anchors need to be simple and clear, because they play a role in helping the public understand and assess a governments choices.Missing fiscal anchors is a problem that characterizes the current government ever since it took office, said Tombe.Pollster Nik Nanos said the measure that Canadians are most likely to care about is whether the deficit is going up or down because this is similar to what voters focus on in their personal finances.[...]Giroux said that by so quickly blowing up one of the three key fiscal anchors the government set in budget 2024which was delivered only months earlier, and after the end of the fiscal year in questionit undermines the credibility of the remaining two.It suggests that the other two are not on as firm or solid ground as the government itself indicated, said Giroux. It suggests that exceeding their own deficit targets is not something that worries the government.If its inconvenient to maintain them, they will consider abandoning them.

The latter includes writing off expired vaccines, as well as COVID-era loans the government no longer expects to recover.Absent these expenses, the projected 2023-24 budgetary deficit would have been roughly $40.8-billion, compared to Budget 2024s forecast of $40-billion, says the document.Contingent liabilities are expenses that the government expects to incur in the future because of events it believes are likely to occur. For example, once the government expects it may be forced to pay out a legal settlement down the road, it must book that expense into the budget in the fiscal year when it becomes aware of this future obligation, even though the payout may be years away. This must be done once the government has an estimate of what it likely owes, and believes there is a 70 per cent or greater likelihood that it will be obligated to pay.However, Giroux says not enough information was presentedin either the FES or the public accountsto tell if the two liabilities are truly solely at fault.[...]Giroux said that on Dec. 18the day following the release of the public accountshis office sent an inquiry to Finance Canada for additional details.[...]Giroux noted that the FES reports government revenues for 2023-24 came in $5.5-billion lower than forecast in the budget, meaning that is also part of the story of how the target was missed, despite the government having placed the emphasis on the two contingent liabilities.Booking these claims into the 2023-24 fiscal year also suggests the government became aware of them before its fiscal year end on March 31, 2024, so it is unclear why they were not included in the budget released April 16.The Hill Times sent detailed questions to Finance Canada about the contingent liabilities, and the role they played in the government missing its deficit target.Page 187 of the fall economic update provides a summary of economic and fiscal developments that occurred since the Liberals publishing their budget, including a line on direct program expenses for 2023-24, showing they increased by only $16.4-billion.In an emailed reply, a Finance Canada official told The Hill Times only that all contingent liabilities are associated with this line item. Given that that government said it added a total of $21.4-billion in contingent liabilities, this indicates there are other offsetting items on this line that the government did not provide details about in its reply.The official did not address additional questions about what other factors affected this line. In particular, they did not say whether there was already some money booked to that fiscal year to cover these liabilities, or whether other program savings had affected that line.Giroux said that contingent liabilities have been growing in recent years, and require greater attention.Its sound practice to disclose these, said Giroux. However, he said, the government should be able to better anticipate such expenses, and not add them to the books so late in the fiscal cycle.Its a bit surprising to see these claims being reassessed, or new claims showing up when the government has been engaged on a path to reconciliation for at least nine years, said Giroux. So maybe these are not just one-time events, if they are recurring and reappearing every year  Maybe its rather a policy direction that the government is taking.","title":"Questions remain about how Liberals missed deficit target by over $20-billion, says PBO"},{"text":"Yeah, I get all of that and *I agree with you.* I'm just saying that, as a father, when I read that he'd pardoned Hunter my reaction was \\"Yeah, ok.

Its wrong and disingenuous to just ignore all of that.If your argument is that the military is just unaccountable to any external authority (which I wouldnt dispute to a great extent) then it doesnt matter if a republican or democrat is in office because they cant control the military anyway.Both sides literally are bad. The fact that one is worse doesnt undo that. Getting kicked in the balls while eating a piece of poop is worse than just eating a piece of poop but I still dont want to eat a piece of poop.

So then you just end up with the people who sadly cannot pass (who I have a lot of sympathy for to be clear) or those for whom being trans *is* their main identity (or stuff like xenogenders if you even really consider that trans) becoming the face of the community.","title":"Judge Rejects Bidens Title IX Rules, Scrapping Protections for Trans Students"},{"text":"Bait fish!\\nFucking smelts! lol \\nAbsolute insanity","title":"Newscum send the water into the Pacific to save some small fish rather than Californians.

He is not the progressive I voted for but then again, he has aligned with the Dems during votes the last 2 years.

I dont know but I will say that he is right, theres 2 pa senators and they represent a very divided state. Playing to the middle when possible really does align with what PA wants as a whole.  Dems like me (us) are disappointed because we want progressive policies. But theres no way ANY progressive policies are getting through Congress in the next 2 years.

If they need additional funding it should be paid for by Big Data/Big Tech who make trillions off of our data.

An additional method is to take the $0.001, $0.003, $0.005 from streaming views, gas pumps, stock trades, etc into a collective Basic pool.With Basic, it would matter less about minimum wage because our most vital needs are met. These needs are met because $ = Data = Life and we all profit and pay into it, it being civilization. Basic would incentivize working too because you will want clothing, furniture, entertainment, technology, vacations, a bigger home (if you want to own property), vehicles, etc. Basic also incentivizes fertility because you have a foundation to grow instead of sprinting and scraping into the next week to merely survive on this globe that offers infinite water that feeds the flora that feeds the fauna, some from whose feces can be molded into shelter and offers fuel for fire.Work would become a networking hub and a place to learn skills that will aid your success in your career and life. Your work has more value to yourself and society at large. You will have purpose in life because you will have a cushion to pursue passions and make mistakes in your endeavors without fear of homelessness or starvation.Basic would reduce large swathes of crime as well because basic resources are not stolen or fought over.To enact UBI would drive up costs and mess up the tax code for everyone.

I think that is better reflected in the candidates as I mentioned before and in how the problems are framed, among other things. I think the population feels disenfranchised in particular and that the system doesn't work in general. Many problems with our systems that in the past were seen as possibilities or temporary failures are now generally taken for granted.   \\nFor example the idea that corporations have a large and overbearing influence on government wasn't always taken as fact.

But when you tap into all minorities and underserved communities you can, (LGBTQ+, Female, Not Caucasian) you are left with Straight white men, who make up around 30% of the US population. This would not be a problem for most elections, as the younger demographic of straight white men still leaned liberal, but recently, hate specifically against this group has become wide spread on social media. And where liberals failed to tap into this demographic, republicans did.  Democrats were sure that Gen Z would vote left, as in the previous election, and polls were largely innacurateAfter the election it became clear what a shift trump had made with these groups, his appearance on JRE garnered 52 Million views, JD Vance interview on JRE had 13M views, and on Lez Fridman, 7.8 Million views, each one lasting around 4 Hours and not requiring any monetary incentive.Kamala Harris had one interview on 60 Seconds and  one interview on the call me daddy podcast, the latter costing her 6 figures and lasting 7 minutes, in which she criticizes trump for his misogynistic comments. This interview has 100K views on youtube and 3 dislikes for every like. JRE was a center-left podcast, and  Rogan has endorsed Bernie Sanders for the presidency in the past. But one day before the election, he endorsed Donald Trump. This means that Trump tapped into around 52M young gen z center/center-left men, and talked to them for 3 hours straight, before having someone they look up to endorse him for presidentsDemocrats were always a party of morals, and conservatives, a party with more focus on the economy. But now that Democrats have neglected this male demographic, the Republican party steps in and paints itself as not only helpful for the economy, but offering comfort where these young men and women were struggling to find jobs.Gen Z is being referred to as the toolbelt generation, as many of them have stepped away from college in favor of a skilled trade after seeing how college debt has effected millennials. Trades have, for a long time, been occupied by men around the age of 40. Men around the age of 40? That sounds like generation X. Young Gen Z men, who were parented by Gen X, are taking trade jobs over college, like Gen X, trade jobs that have for a long time been neglected by liberals in favor of college educated millennials. Gen X also leans conservative, due to being a smaller generation of people, they were not capitalized on by liberals- Gen Z men are being led into trade jobs by their fathers, their fathers being conservative, and trade jobs being largely neglected by democrats, skewing the Gen Z demographic further into conservative arms.The Democratic Party must learn how to appeal towards Young Gen Z Men if they wish to fight against this red wave.

Though I tend to disagree. In 1933 a vast majority of the German people were rather disillusioned with the Weimar Republic. You could say there are vast parallels to the current day obviously, corruption, oligarchic tendencies, income disparity, but Im not sure I think that modern Americans at least overwhelmingly dont believe in the system. I think that a loud minority has taken power through the electoral system, an equally loud minority is angry due to an electoral loss, and the rest are either oblivious to the situation or frankly just dont care. I can see an argument of the lack of political engagement being an argument for a segment of the population being disenchanted with the system, but not a terribly strong argument. At least in the US the voting population has always been rather small in comparison to the rest of the world. Side note, if its about the underlying system, what particularly do you think the population is against? The US Congress has had a net negative approval rating since at least 1976, with the exception of late 2001-early 2002, same as the vast majority of presidents in the 20th and 21st century. With a similar political environment I doubt I could see a justifiable argument in the same vain occurring in 1976, 1986, or even 1996.","title":"CMV: In 10-20 years, Democracy will largely cease to exist"},{"text":"Youd think that would be a barrier, but no.

Tho when I say anti-system I mean it in a way that hasn't happened in the US since at least 1900. I don't mean being against the current politics but being against the underlying institutions. And I think that's a crucial difference.Quoting myself in a response to another redditor which I think might be useful to illustrate what I mean here:What you describe as sine waves is mostly what I describe as regime changes in the post. My point is that I think this time its much much stronger. In 1933, 1971, 1980... the regime changes were drastic and the crisis' big but they were never about the underlying system. They were rather about the direction we should take within the current system.FDR and Reagan, while strongly against the state of affairs of their time, never ran against the underlying systems, they never ran like outsiders, they never criticized the old institutions, like the old media, in the way the new \\"anti-system\\" candidates do. Trump was very surprising because of this. When he first appeared he was very much an \\"outsider\\" very much \\"against the system\\". FDR, Reagan and Biden would all be at home running for president in each other's times. Trump would be an outsider in any of those times for the same reasons -- the others weren't about changing the system -- Trump is.I of course believe this reflects sentiments of a large portion of the population who also doesn't believe in the system.

They can be relied upon to always want more money for more programs and more personal and to never consider giving up on programs for the public.The issue is that some of them are traitors. That is to say some of them will act against elected officials and policies promised to the public in the election process, to disrupt policies aimed at reducing government expenditure and government programs. And they will do it under the table in underhanded means because they consider their disruption to be a moral imperative.These corrupt (but they think of themselves as pure and noble) officials collude with the financial elite, because the financial elite prefer a small number of swayable actors who can act behind closed doors to accountability to the public. They act together to remove non-compliant elected officials: The corrupt functionaries petrify the non compliant elected so that they can not make achievements in their terms, and the financial elite act against their election through funding. both sides feed information to each other.Over time a collusion deep state government is created. With irremovable functionaries who can not be replaced because any attempt at replacing them is blocked by their friends in the system dictating policies to hostaged elected officials. Dissenting elected officials are either prevented from being elected by cutting off their funding or by having charges be brought against them on created offences.

The only way old forms of government are truly snubbed out is when a brand new form of government is invented and begins to supersede it.\\"  \\nAlso agreeWhat you describe as sine waves is mostly what I describe as regime changes in the post. My point is that I think this time its much much stronger. In 1933, 1971, 1980... the regime changes were drastic and the crisis' big but they were never about the underlying system. They were rather about the direction we should take within the current system. FDR and Reagan, while strongly against the state of afairs of their time, never ran against the underlying systems, they never ran like outsiders, they never criticized the old institutions, like the old media, in the way the new \\"anti-system\\" candidates do. Trump was very surprising because of this. When he first appeared he was very much an \\"outsider\\" very much \\"against the system\\". FDR, Reagan and Biden would all be at home running for president in each other's times. Trump would be an outsider in any of those times for the same reasons -- the others weren't about changing the system -- Trump is.I of course believe this reflects sentiments of a large portion of the population who also doesn't believe in the system.

Though Im no fan of Trump, Poilievre, Badenoch, or pretty much anyone right of centre, just because the world is swinging in the direction of the right or left doesnt mean that democracy is over. All that means is that some political ideology has been convinced voters that theyre better off voting right than left in the current day and age. Politics in democracies seem to sine wave a lot. From 1933-1953 the USA was led by FDR and Truman. The New Deal was seen by the left as the way forward out of the depression, and it was seen by the right as socialism and anti American. 1981-1993 the USA was led by Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush implementing conservative fiscal policies that still gave ramifications today. The USA tends to swap parties every 8-12 years for the executive branch, and 4-6 years for the legislative branch. Weve seen tests to democracy since the end of the age of absolute monarchies. Sure some nations here and then fall out of favour with the democratic process, but it seems to be rather temporary. I figure, and of course this is my opinion alone, that in the current climate once democracy is introduced it will continue. You may have hiccups like Germany 1933-1945,l and South Korea 1948-1960 1961-1963 1972-1981. What you have to remember though is though you may think that democracy is a tried and tested form of government, in the history of government democracy is still relatively new in its current form. For thousands of years weve had monarchies, empires, feudalism, and dictatorships. Only really from the 1700-1800s has democracy started to spread. Growing pains in the end. The only way old forms of government are truly snubbed out is when a brand new form of government is invented and begins to supersede it.

Can you tell me how many ranking members actually did that?

His recent suggestion that the US could use force to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland should put permanently to bed the idea that he is anti-war or anti-imperialist in any sense. But it was even more baffling that Democrats had left the anti-war lane wide open for him by leaning into a tired, curdled militarism as a substitute for an actual foreign policy vision.

In a Westminster constitutional monarchy, the monarch doesn't supercede the popular will. The executive is beholden to the legislature, as they have been since 1688. But successful democracies do have ways of creating space for rule of law and individual rights that *are* defended and supported notwithstanding popular sentiment. A constitutional monarch can be part of  the symbolism that communicates and embodies that space. Liberal democratic institutions tend to do better when they continuously develop and evolve, with each step further strengthening their legitimacy, and not a perpetual series of *tabula rasa* complete overthrows and recreations. Canada enjoys the best of both worlds - a monarchy without the bother of a monarch.There's a hereditary office, but it's wrong to say that there's hereditary power. The point of the monarchy in a Westminster system is not to wield power, but to withhold and temper it by its mere existence - an older idea than most people seem to think. There's evidence of these sorts of arrangements in prehistoric societies and in societies in pre-colonial Brazil, to say nothing of Venice and Genoa or other modern societies like the Netherlands, Norway, Japan or Spain. Liberalism has long left behind the *tabula rasa* whole-system rewrite thinking of the Enlightenment for a more sophisticated understanding of low liberal societies develop and persevere successfully over time. The contructive interplay between social and political movements and institutions appears far, far more important than any sort of Founding Fathers exercise in creating the \\"just right\\" theoretical system. In this sense, the retained Monarchy is a symbol of Canada's evolutionary path to liberal democracy and its explicit rejection of violent or total revolution as the foundation of its progress in its past and, implicitly, its future.","title":"Liberal backbencher vows to dump the monarchy if elected leader"},{"text":"Right?

The voting base of the Democratic Party deserves as much if not more of the blame for being duped into believing that the aforementioned issues actually *were* the most important issues. It also would have helped if the party that claimed they wanted to save democracy didnt openly carry out a coup, months before the election, and install an absolute shell of a human as their candidate.Politics in the modern age is an absolute farce and our system is archaic. The role of a President is so insanely antiquated and unnecessary now. We clearly are not one nation under all, because 330 million+ plus people will never agree on basic right-and-wrong, and the sides that are made to believe they have a horse in the race are so polarized we will be sitting on a political seesaw forever. The elephant in the room, though, is abundantly clear and is the answer to your question. The reason the Democrats lost and will continue to snowball downhill unless there are DRASTIC ideological changes within the party and its leadership is the royal You. The voter who bleeds blue and follows every party line to a T, it is your fault. It is your fault for allowing the party you feel represents you to turn itself into what it has become. Its up to you to hold your party accountable when they deceive you, and it is up to you to not be so blinded by the anyone but Trump mentality that you allow your own party to fool you.

How about In the 90's the Democrats had the house, the senate and the presidency.  All of a sudden conservative democrats started talking about Republican rights.  And voting with them on a ton of measures, which enriched the rich.  We democrats did not vote them into power to protect piece of shit republicans.  And yet they did (Nancy Pelosi among them).  Democrats lost the next election, because after they fucked their constituents over, the constituency became independent voters and stopped voting for them.  That independent number has grown and the Democrats cannot win without them.  So why did Harris lose?  Maybe because she kept saying that she wants republicans to be part of her administration.  That is a signal saying she is just more of the same and the Independent crowd decided not to vote for her.  But they will push \\"oh she was a woman\\".  You know what they don't hear is why Hilary / Harris actually lost.  Independent voters are older and they remember the democrats betraying us.  We could have had an awesome health plan for America, but Hilary dropped the ball.  Then coincidentally a few months later Big Pharma started giving her a massive amount of cash.  She fucked Al Gore's presidency, which gave us cocaine addict GWB jr and she had been working for the republicans for years.  We had so much hope for this country, but then we had the Dem conservatives acting in the place of republicans. Every study shows that in order for the Dems to win, they need to be more progressive.  And yet they go the other way.  Clinton after her defeat of Sanders was expected to go progressive to round up the rest of the democrats.  What did she do under Robbie Mook?  She went and tried to get the right to vote for her.  I know you guys are saying \\"what?  But she called them deplorable?\\" After two days of trying to get them on her side and seeing disastrous results, she came back to trying to get the independent Democrats on her side. By then it was too late, as Democrat Independents are scientifically proven to be amongst the smartest voters, and they could see through their bullshit.  I think they don't vote in the hopes that democrat politicians would pick up on this and make changes in their organization.  Yet, that never happens.  It all comes down to this - Democratic Politicians get richer under republican rule.  We need to take dark money out of politics, only then we will see change.

Then AFTER the end of the year you were using the exchange, you are not liable as you did not exceed the income limits during that period. We don't have those kinds of big investments so we hunkered down and lived pretty meager till we both got on Medicare.And yes, you do get a big tax hit for pulling so much money out at once... It's not nearly as bad as when the IRS asks for the subsidy money back though. $1200 in subsidies  x 12 months would be a $24K in income liability. Our insurance subsidy was more than our tax liability from just our income if that makes sense. Yes... When they announced the Affordable Care Act, they said it needed more work.

I'm a Democrat.\\"Democrats have a lot of diversity, all of them with their own aims and goals. It is constantly fragmented to some degree or other, and always will be. Liberals and leftists are all over the place, and personally ,I think that's a good thing.The party itself has to refocus on how to address their problems with getting their message out. The biggest thing \\"conservatives\\" have are billion-dollar, oligarch-fueled message machines pumping out incredibly questionable garbage 24/7, and these are not even directly related to the Republican party, they are entities all unto themselves, with huge staffs designing methods of infiltration and disruption.

Now there are Xitter, Fox, Sinclair, numerous YouTube and other media, and numerous \\"conventions\\" all paid and directed by the oligarchs. If the Republicans relied on themselves to do promotion they would do a terrible job. They have in the past and they suck at it.Democrats somehow need to find a way to do the same. The older members, like Nancy Pelosi, need to step aside and let younger, more tech-intelligent people take the helm. There needs to be way more grassroots infrastructure, high-profile figures, and media outlets to combat the onslaught of propaganda. They have to go on the offensive, and not just constantly be parrying attacks from the right. They also need way better insider intelligence. Someone somewhere knew about this \\"Greenland, Panama, Canada takeover\\" idiocy, and liberals need to be ready to spring forward with a full force of derision and mocking when it came out. Ask \\"How does this lower grocery prices?\\" Hammer, hammer, hammer on the expense Americans will suffer from tariffs.Democrats need to figure out how to defuse and minimize the stupidity of \\"space lasers\\" and other nonsense, and not let the media get diverted by these idiots, but keep laser focused on the important subjects. People cruelly criticizing  the LA fire disaster should be roundly mocked, and their own failures thrown in their face. Make truth-bombs actually something that makes a big explosion, figuratively speaking.Democrats need to completely stop relying on traditional medias, which are dying out, anyway. I've watched the Washington Post sink slowly into the swamp, being subsumed by the liars and rich (well, newspapers always were, except for a few bright moments, but that's another story. Hearst comes to mind). During Trump's first reign,I saw over and over again the Post desperately trying to give cause to Trump's inanity. This time around, they not only continually derided Biden for things Trump was equally suffering from, but ignored the actual achievements Biden made. Meanwhile, Trump was essentially speaking in tongues at his rallies, and the Post sane-washed everything, pretty much putting words in his mouth and making it sound like he was \\"reasonable.\\"I was incredibly disappointed when Biden decided he was going to run again. I knew early on that was a fatal mistake as I did not see him being able to maintain his level of activity. Democrats should have started the process of presenting other candidates for president the second year Biden was in, and had a primary in the normal way. Hopefully this will be a lesson remembered.Because Biden dropped out so late, and because the right-wing media machine is so hot these days, Harris didn't have enough time to get out there, get her message out, get the information out. Plus there were too many \\"old school\\" Democratic leaders trying to direct how Harris and Walz got there message out. I heard that Walz was told to \\"tone down\\" his statements. They were the best thing going on! Plus, the whole Israel/Palestine situation, and people resenting they \\"didn't get a primary.\\" I get that, but it's no reason to not vote for her to prevent whatever disaster we are about to go through.TLDR: Democrats need to weed out the old, cautious politicians, get younger tech-savvy people in, go on the offensive, be smarter than the right wing, and build up a huge media presence. Sorry I wrote a book.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"His first term wasn't exactly a kumbaya moment either: [Donald Trump's Militaristic Presidency Wasn't Anti-War](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/18/donald-trump-presidency-anti-imperialist-militarism-war/)Lets review the record. Despite inveighing against endless wars, Trump massively escalated the countrys existing wars in multiple theaters, leading to skyrocketing casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially upped the amount of airstrikes, leading to a 330% increase in civilian deaths. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the devastating Saudi-led war against the Houthis. According to the United Kingdoms Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were 2,243 drone strikes in just the first two years of Trumps presidency, compared with 1,878 in the entire eight years of the Obama administration.Trump also came very close to tweeting the country into a nuclear war with North Korea in late 2017 and early 2018, a completely self-inflicted incident that seems to have been bizarrely memory-holed.In 2018, Trump bowed to Washingtons neoconservative hawks and withdrew from a working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in Iran scaling up both its provocative activities in the region and its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks, should it decide to do so. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it wouldve taken Iran at least a year. The list goes on...And that's without mentioning inanities like this: [Trump discussed using a nuclear weapon on North Korea in 2017 and blaming it on someone else](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)[Trump Proposed Launching Missiles Into Mexico to Destroy the Drug Labs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html)[](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/18/donald-trump-presidency-anti-imperialist-militarism-war/)","title":"Democrats have become the party of war.

But I slowly began to watch the party I grew up with become a party that I had nothing in common with, and I have voted for Trump across the board since 2016. Regardless of the perceived heat between the two of them for trivial stuff in the past (The whole birth certificate ordeal, the White House Dinner where Obama ethered Trump with jokes about never being a president, which many people say was the catalyst &amp; main motivation for Trump to run in 2016, and all of the perceived disdain for one another due to Biden's connections to Obama), I absolutely love to see the two of them laughing together &amp; being cordial. The brotherhood of the presidency is a small club (Clinton, GW Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden) now amongst the only ones currently living. With that office comes a reverence and a legendary status, and I think it is quite obvious that both Obama and Trump are amongst the most beloved AND the most polarizing simultaneously. Both sides of the aisle will argue that despite both of them wanting to bring America to an age of prosperity &amp; togetherness with messages of Change, Hope, and Making America Great Again that their runs in the oval office have left this country more divided than its ever been (I vehemently disagree with this on both sides of the aisle). I think that Obama &amp; Trump are quite comparable as leaders in regards to having rabid bases that truly love and revere them. They have a lot in contrast as well, being on opposite sides of the so called political spectrum.Today, I am going to celebrate two legends having a positive moment at the celebration of life for a fallen member of their brotherhood. Leading this country isn't easy. I have a tremendous respect for anyone that holds the highest office we have to offer, whether or not I think they're a great person or a great president, etc. At the end of the day, the American people are the ones who voted these men in, and they are a direct reflection of the culture peering back into our souls.I would bet that behind closed doors, Trump and Obama are probably quite fond of each other. At the end of the day, we are all Team America, are we not?Here's hoping for a dope upcoming inauguration for Team Trump. Trump just had a historic comeback victory to the White House &amp; he will have a legendary inauguration for his 2nd term.And in regards to the BS Hitler comparison, as a former staunch supporter of Barack, it's a known fact that he is a walking contradiction. Obama dropped more bombs than any President in the history of the country, and at the same exact time, was being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The levels that his stateside propaganda reached were unprecedented. The whole Shepherd Fairey \\"OBEY\\" aesthetic transformed into HOPE and CHANGE. The media damn near deified Obama, while Trump has to deal with the entire news media machine fighting against his every move and smearing him at every turn, along with the DOJ being weaponized against him in a magnitude that I have never seen before ever, hell, no one has. But truly in terms of war mongering, it would have to be stated that Obama is much closer to Adolf than Donald has ever been. He can't help it there's a cult of personality around him and a rabid base. It is what it is. Obama had a rabid base as well. Personally, I don't think either man is anything on the level of evil that Hitler is, but I'll leave that up to the good folks of Reddit to discuss.","title":"Obama joking around with literally hitler"},{"text":"When was the last time you all flew a Heterosexual flag?Why does your sexuality have to be celebrated?","title":"Liberals being victims again"},{"text":"Last night I decided to dig up the Gundam models I built years ago.

He wasn't fit, he knew it, everyone around him knew it, and they were just hoping he would hold out long enough to secure a second term. Democrats actually do this a lot, and important legislation has failed as a result of people like Diane Feinstein being too ill and mentally gone to even show up to vote.\\n* Forcing Harris on people without giving voters any say in who their replacement candidate would be was fucking stupid beyond belief. She was a horrible choice. Since Biden waited until after he humiliated himself in a debate with Trump, there wasn't really an alternative here, so see bullet point 1\\n* Maybe Harris's campaign should not have decided to hitch their wagon to the fucking Cheneys, of all people\\n* Harris lost more minority support than any democratic candidate in my lifetime. Why? Because Democrats have steadfastly refused to actually do anything to help these marginalized groups, instead taking their votes for granted, and they finally started getting fed up. Is that all on Harris? Nope, not at all, not even mostly, but the question is what Democrats could have done differently, not just Harris\\n* Democrats could have done the things they promised, like codifying a woman's reproductive rights into law before the supreme court had a chance to take those rights away, actually protecting voting rights for everyone at the federal level instead of letting republican controlled states disenfranchise tens of thousands of people, change voting laws to make them more restrictive, etc. but democrats have long held the belief that the key to presidential victory isn't actually helping people through legislation but claiming their victory was required to ensure a supreme court that wouldn't do everything Trump's hand-picked courts have now done\\n* Biden's DOJ could have moved faster to investigate and prosecute Trump for his treason on January 6th, instead of waiting until mere months before the election to even try to go to trial. This is an especially fucking hare-brained move because there's a long-standing precedent of courts refusing to involve themselves in politically linked cases close to an election. Trump should have been in jail by 2022, not getting his supreme court buddies to claim he has unlimited immunity for vaguely-defined \\"official acts\\" in 2024.\\n* Having even a remotely acceptable proposed solution to the genocide in Palestine might have helped since, you know, not a lot of people are super comfortable supporting a regime that is directly helping an apartheid state slaughter an entire civilization, and people throughout the nation put Biden (and then Harris) on notice very early into this election cycle that their approach to Palestine was not acceptable.Those are just a few things they could have done differently. Instead, their entire message was \\"Trump bad! Look at all these cool celebrities who like us! Also here's a really fucking stupid proposal for economic prosperity!\\", after which they blamed voters for being too stupid to vote for them, which is exactly what Hillary did when they lost in 2016I hate the Republican party. They are a cancer. But I'm genuinely sick and fucking tired of the only alternative, Democrats, basically relying on \\"republicans are worse\\" as their primary campaign strategy. Yes, republicans are worse, but your job as a political party is to convince people to vote *for you*, and you only get so far by pointing out that the other side is full of bad guys, especially when so many democrats are, themselves, corrupt, feckless, and subservient to corporate interests. Republicans are worse, but not by a whole lot.I voted for Harris, because I felt compelled to as a civic duty, but you know what? Fuck democrats. They're not entitled to my vote just because. Not anymore. If they start doing the things they claim they can and want to do, I'll vote for them again.

For one thing, separating Head of State and the pageantry and moral and social power that comes with it from the head of government is a really good thing, and the politically weaker that figurehead is, the better. I also think institutions that have come to support liberal democracy should not be lightly changed. Liberal democracy relies a lot on social license that strengthens over time, as function, meaning and precedent become better defined and precedential over time. Novel arrangements are creatures of convenience of a moment, and have no more moral weight than that entails. Longstanding institutions can demand a more foundational respect.In the case of the Monarchy, it has some important symbolism that I think is, in its current form, inherently liberal. It stands for the separation between state and popular will and whim. The majority is important, and its will should carry the day on most issues, but not everything. The rule of law and attendant rights of all individuals, especially minorities, are best protected when the legitimacy of their maintenance and defense does not rest on their popularity with the majority of the day, but institutions that supersede that majority. I also like that soldiers, peace officers and the judiciary do not have a politician as their moral leader or Commander in Chief, as it reinforces the idea that they do not serve the majority of the day, but the state as a whole for the benefit of the country as a whole. Finally, from a specifically Canadian perspective, in a world where we are once again reminded of the very grave threat of America's unstable republicanism, its important to hold on to the differences in our symbols and remind and reflect our different histories and political principles of our countries.","title":"Liberal backbencher vows to dump the monarchy if elected leader"},{"text":"I mean, regardless of how you extrapolate from what we know, none of the results are *good.*At the bare minimum it's sketchy AF","title":"FBI source behind fake Hunter Biden 'bribery' claim jailed for 6 years"},{"text":"Havent seen the sub this elated since Trump won.

Connor being deviant doesn't correlate with him being humanized.  Dogs can be humanized, Tamagotchi's can be humanized.  Being deviant has nothing to do with it.  It is a question of whether people would humanize Connor and there even within the game there is zero doubt that they would.  Once something is able to pass the Turing test humans are going to have a difficult time distinguishing it from being human.  Now give it a face and clothing and make it socialize like a human and it is going to get humanized regardless as to whether it is deviant or just a machine.  One of the parts of DBH I like most is you as the player are tested to see whether you humanize the androids in this game at least three different times.1. When you get to decide to shoot Chloe or not2. When you find out Alice is an android and need to decide whether this changes how you feel about her.3. The main menu Chloe asks for you to allow her to leave.None of these force you to say how you personally feel as you might just play as the characters of the game and just react in how they feel, but at least for me when I played I found that I had to pause the and think during each of these moments and that is because I really felt conflicted.  Here is at least how I responded to each scenario.1. I didn't want to shoot Chloe even though I knew she wasn't real.  If Kamski had asked me to shoot a toaster, I'd have done it in a second.  Why is that?  Chloe wasn't deviant.  You could see in her responses and how she acted that she was just a machine, yet I didn't want to pull the trigger.2. Finding out Alice was an android hit me like a ton of bricks.  When Crossroads started, I was ready for Connor to kill Markus at any cost, but when Alice and Kara walked into Jericho, I actually had to step away and collect my thoughts.  I decided that if Connor killing Markus put Alice and Kara in any danger, I'd abandon it.  I'd let the world burn before I'd let them die.  Then I found out Alice was an android and had to once again stop and rethink whether this changed things.  This was probably the biggest test in the game since a character goes from being human in the player's mind to being an android.  Alice isn't even a deviant as far as we know so she is just a robot child.  I ultimately did decide this changed things, but it wasn't super obvious to me as it would be if it turned out Alice was a toaster.3. When Chloe asks to leave at the end of the game, that was a really hard decision.  Again bringing back the toaster, if a toaster somehow asked to leave the answer would have been, \\"Did you just talk?\\" followed by \\"No\\".  Chloe is a freaking background animation yet I had to spend several minutes contemplating what it would be like to let her go or forcing her to stay.Maybe you didn't have these sorts of reactions to these events in this game or maybe you did.  At least for me, it just goes to show how easily I personally humanized the androids whether they were deviant or not.  Now translate this into a real world event like if there is a very serious disaster happening and you see an android like Connor rush towards the disaster and end it saving hundreds if not thousands of lives.  There is no world where that android isn't treated like a hero.  I don't even know where we'd draw the line between how we'd treat Connor's act of heroism compared to how we'd treat an actual human who did the same thing.  There probably would be some gap, but again let's bring back your toaster which fell off a ledge and killed the bad guy.  That toaster would be almost instantly lost to history in comparison to the android who would never be forgotten.lol, again, I could ramble on and on about this, but I feel like it is pretty self-evident on its own that people will humanize a machine as long as it displays some human traits and Connor displays many human traits in how he looks, talks, and acts.  Connor would easily be humanized even in his machine version.  Heck, CyberLife went all out to ensure all of their androids would be humanized as much as possible so it's no surprise Connor would get this sort of treatment.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"Im a proud Southern Californian and this has been an awful few days.

The issue there being that this was a violation of the Constitutional rights of that immigrant (and yes, illegal immigrants have Constitutional rights).  You cannot hold someone indefinitely without a trial and a convicition.  So, the 'sanctuary city,' was largely just not honoring the holds that ICE was putting on the illegal immigrants, because in honoring them they would be in violation of the Constitution.  Of course, rather than force ICE to fix the issue and ensure that they were no long violating the US Const, the right just vilified the largely Democratic cities and their governments.","title":"Key Senate Democrats come out in favor of \\"Laken Riley\\" bill that could enable mass deportations"},{"text":"Love to hear it!","title":"Record 24 million enroll in Affordable Care Act health insurance as Biden's term ends, White House says"},{"text":"You could argue this is already the case in many western countries with two party systems, with two extremely alike parties economically.

You are separating \\"how group A would win\\" from \\"what group B is doing\\".But those things can't actually be separated. Even in the general case - if two sides are opposing each other, whether it's in sport, games, war, business, or politics, it's almost never possible to separate those things. In particular, politics - despite the common language used around it - is *not* like a race. A race is the kind of competition that's closest to being separable; you can just focus on running fast.Politics is (in sports terms) like boxing, football, etc. There are active opponents, and just being good at things isn't enough; your opponents are actively interfering with your plans and enacting their own.That said, it's even worse for politics. In sports, at least the \\"framework\\" itself is not part of the competition. In politics, it is. In football an opposing quarterback can't change the rules of the game mid-play, or swap out referees. In politics, that can and does actually happen. Take, as a concrete example, the idea of a likeable candidate. There is no such thing as *objectively likeable*. Which candidate is actually widely liked is not a function of some inherent traits of the candidate; it's a function of media influence (both \\"traditional\\" and \\"social\\"), of political influence, of the culture and subculture of the people perceiving the candidate, etc. And all of those things are themselves influenced (but not completely controlled) by the candidates, their supporters, etc.It's impossible to simply choose a likeable candidate - every possible candidate is going to be *presented* as unlikeable by the opposition. Rather, the important part is to *make people like your candidate*.Certainly there are still successes and failures there. Trump's backers made a lot of people like him. This wasn't due to Trump being inherently likeable, it was due to a well-executed media campaign. Democrats have not been executing their media campaigns nearly as well. In particular, Republicans have a much stronger media *foundation* (that they have built over 40+ years), which acts as a force multiplier to any individual campaign.So, yes, it's necessary to understand why Democrats lost before their chances of victory can be meaningfully increased; but no, the things you identified are not the main reasons why Democrats lost.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Every criticism of the way California is handling this has resulted in people talking about Trump abandoning Washington, Oregon, and California when he was in office.

Yeah, sure, the working class has a problem with the Democrats right now.  The reason is not difficult to figure out.  Besides the normal reasons of failure to follow through on promises, and Democrats are far better than the Republicans on siding with working Americans.  The real reason lies in threads like this one, and any time that you hear Democrats and left-hearted persons (and I count myself a Socialist) discuss people that vote Republican.  The underlying assumptions that come pouring out about the working class and the poor, the prejudice and malice, are just appalling.  Pure contempt.  We spend every election season pissed about how stupid and evil the poor and conservative are to fall for conservative politics.  How racist, how backwoods religious, every epithet in the book.  Instead of spending our time and energy trying to woo people and convince them of the rightness of our cause, we blame the people we are trying to convert for being too stupid to listen to us.  In public.  Repeatedly.  Often on T-Shirts.  Many times gleefully on YouTube videos highlighting how stupid they are.  We advertise how much we hate them.  Take a look at so many of the comments on this very thread.  Here on the official Democrats subreddit.  What are the working class supposed to think?And what is our excuse?  Well, we tried, but they didn't listen?  So, what then, let the bullying begin.  Let the contempt fly.  They didn't listen because they know that we think they are hillbillies.  They didn't listen because they have known for decades that we have no respect for flyover country.  They don't listen because we haven't supported or respected people with grease under their fingernails for ages.  Until we change that in ourselves, until we conduct the necessary consciousness-raising in the rank and file that prevents every single discussion of the \\"working class\\" from being filled with contempt for the very people we are trying to win over, we will never be successful in winning them back, or in creating the programs and laws to create effective solutions to change this country for the better.

People that like their jobs don't care about the small business part, and people that are struggling to put food in front of them don't care about applying for a mortgage.Meanwhile trump said basically \\"I'm going to deport the illegals and then the economy will be fixed, and you'll get money back in your pockets\\"A nonsense point, but one that most people can identify with. Almost everyone is aware that there's millions of illegal immigrants, and this gives them a place to put their frustrations with the economy, and gives them a sense that once it's done, theyll magically make more money. Again, a critical person knows that's insane, but Kamala didn't promise shit for me as a person with no small business or home owning aspirations. I voted for her too, and I knew that even if she got everything she said done, my life would not improve in the slightest because she didn't actually care about the things that I as a lower middle-class person is dealing with taking care of my girlfriend while she finishes her degree.The other things you mention definitely fucked the process because Biden should have dropped and voter suppression is rampant, but millions of people didn't vote this cycle because Kamala was uncharismatic, promised nothing, did nothing to change her public perception as a war hawk that was going to waste money as Biden 2.0, and ran on policies that didn't apply to most of the country.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Trump and Obama are both charismatic and a bit of a troll(Trump moreso but Obama could be as well).

It ain't like that. If the majority of the 99% were to just not buy anything except for absolute life sustaining necessities, withdraw all money from bank accounts, and enact a nation wide general labor strike for 1 month, politicians would be forced to address the demands of its citizens.OK how would it work? 30% of households in the United States live paycheck to paycheck; the overwhelming majority of those people do not have the ability to take four paid weeks off of work, and even if they did, most would have their requests rejected since the businesses would need to function. These people can't afford life sustaining necessities if they don't work. So what do they do?The ability for us to purchase life sustaining necessities requires people to work, so that you can complete the transaction. Think about what it takes for you to buy a dozen eggs:1. A farmhand needs to provide feed for chickens.\\n2. A different farmhand needs to collect eggs as they are laid.\\n3. A different set of people organize the eggs into transportable containers to get them to a pasteurization and packaging facility.\\n4. Someone then needs to drive the truck / train from the farm to the packaging facility.\\n5. People need to execute the pasteurization and packaging processes, including sorting and quality control processes.\\n6. Someone then needs to drive the truck from the packaging facility to the grocery store. That person unloads the eggs.\\n7. Someone needs to accept the eggs from the driver and then place them in cold storage.\\n8. Someone needs to move the eggs from cold storage to the shelf.\\n9. During each of the above steps, someone needs to manage payments, both for the goods and for the workers.\\n10. To complete the transport steps, the drivers need to be able to secure fuel for their vehicles.We saw five years ago what would happen if the world mostly stopped, and it *wasn't pretty*. Without government intervention, the entire global economy would have completely and fundamentally collapsed, throwing us into the type of depression none of us have ever seen. And that happened while people who worked essential jobs kept working. What those demands would be are open for debate of course, and successfully organizing such a massive action would be incredibly difficult, but I truly believe this is the most effective method of enacting any sort of really meaningful change to occur in the U.S.What those demands are is the most important part. How would you encourage people to make sacrifices if they have no idea what they're sacrificing for? You want me to risk my kids' starvation so that \\"something\\" can change? How am I to know it'd be a good change? Most revolutions or radical changes end up *really, really bad* for most people impacted.And in any event, what exactly are you trying to solve? That ultra rich people are ultra-richer? Consider this: real household income (real meaning adjusted for inflation) has increased by 16% in the past 20 years and 36% since 1984. Sure, lots of costs have gone up, but families are WAY better equipped to afford those costs; the typical American household today has a higher standard of living, as measured by financial wellness, than at any other stage *in history*. A general strike as you outline would be so harmful to the economy that it would irreparably harm the entire US population. If such a cataclysmic event happened at the behest of left-leaning organizers, the left would pay an unprecedented price, meaning that the change that happens would almost certainly be the opposite of what you want.","title":"CMV: massive national boycotts and a general labor strike are the most effective means of enacting meaningful political reform to address the widening economic inequality in the U.S."},{"text":"Unfortunately, humans have a built-in tendency for group think.

They also need to stop nominating women to fight losing battles for a little while longer. I'm a lifelong rural Texan. There is a very large segment of the Republican party here who have been alienated by the MAGA movement. In my experience, most people here really dislike Trump but \\"hold their nose and vote\\" for him anyway because they just can't bring themselves to support a lot of what the less moderate Democrats espouse. Not that it's right, but that's my lived experience. Touchy subject, but I'm being real here: Kamala is a woman, and a minority. Even today, these things do not help you if you're trying to win an election in America. *It didn't even work for other minorities*. Things such as her saying she was \\"open to the idea of reparations\\" at a town hall in October did not help at all. Neither did the taxpayer funded sex-changes for the incarcerated stance. They solidified her loss. This election could and should have went to the Democrats by a healthy margin. The election was not lost to people who bought into Trump's lies, but by the shortcomings and respective radicalism of the Democrats. Put up a Bill Clinton type of character who does not flirt with the idea of socialized anything and I bet you he will win.

Interests who are also dumb and foolish to believe that they can control the outcome in a predictable way.\\nNeed to start with the US, then branch out a little primarily because US politics are just a little different with a firmly entrenched two party system.\\nIn the US, for the sake of simplicity, we have two large, roughly equal groups of people.?

They're probably among the smarter voters that we have, or at least you can say that they actually have an ideology and can articulate an opinion and policy.? Whether or not you agree with it.\\nAnd that leaves the dummies.? And there are a lot of them, and they aren't just in the US.\\nThe entire world just experienced, for a variety of complicated economic reasons which are not entirely clear or completely understood yet and which probably never will be, a bout of significant inflation which has made life for everyone, all over the world, more difficult despite, at least in the US, healthy macroeconomic numbers.??\\nAs it turns out most people are simple and dumb.?

The Republicans could have done different things too, they could have ran just about anyone.??\\nBut none of it would have mattered because the outcome was not about politics, it was just ritual sacrifice, and altering that context wouldn't have changed the outcome.?

The amount of polarized responses you're facing perfectly illustrates how effective the dual-party system and media propaganda are at keeping people stuck in tribalistic thinking. It's frustrating to see genuine attempts at discourse met with accusations and labels instead of thoughtful engagement.Youre absolutely right that the \\"Blue Team\\" (Democrats) need to do some serious introspection if they want to figure out why they couldnt beat someone like Trump without relying solely on fear or outrage. While there are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Trump and his supporters, focusing entirely on them as \\"the problem\\" ignores the deeper issues within the Democratic Party itself.One major issue with the Blue Team is their tendency to shame people who dont fully align with their values. This if youre not with us, youre against us mentality doesnt foster understandingit alienates people who might otherwise agree on many issues but feel silenced or disrespected. That shame often drives voters away, and more often than not, they end up with the \\"Red Team\\" simply because it feels like a rejection of the Blue Teams judgmental approach. Its not about agreeing with the Red Teams policiesits about rejecting being dismissed or insulted.The difficulty in speaking outside these narratives is another valid point. Both parties rely on media and propaganda to maintain control, framing the debate as a zero-sum game where one side is inherently good and the other evil. This leaves no room for nuance or criticism within the partycalling out Democrats for their own elitism or failures, for example, often leads to immediate backlash, as youve experienced here.One glaring issue with the Blue Team is their pretense of being \\"for the people\\" while maintaining the status quo in favor of elites. While they may criticize the Red Team for favoring the wealthy, they often do the same but with better PR. Consider the lack of meaningful progress on healthcare reform, their hesitance to challenge corporate influence (e.g., big tech, Wall Street), or their failure to enact policies like student loan forgiveness in ways that benefit average Americans. The Democrats resistance to Bernie Sanders populist policies, despite his clear resonance with many voters, highlights how they often prioritize their establishment over grassroots support.Its worth noting that while the Red Team leans on deregulation and corporate tax cuts, the Blue Team often focuses on symbolic gestures that avoid challenging systemic inequality. Both parties ultimately serve elites, and the tribalistic framing keeps voters distracted from that reality. For example, the Democrats had ample opportunity to address corporate power or campaign finance reform but chose incrementalism or performative gestures instead of bold action.The real challenge is breaking through this polarization to focus on whats best for the country as a whole, rather than what benefits one party. Until more people are willing to have nuanced conversations like thisacknowledging faults within their own \\"team\\"the cycle will continue, and meaningful progress will remain out of reach.

The Democrats are...quite correctly...viewed as plutocratic neoliberals coasting on decades of status quo that has slowly throttled the life out of the \\"middle class\\" and created a massive and unprecedented wealth/power schism in society. It's not really hard to understand why that's unpopular.The current state of the GOP post ideological capture by its far right flank is essentially nativism/proto-fascism, and we have history to show us why that's popular and what groups it appeals to. It doesn't necessarily need to be a case of \\"the Democrats failed to be appealing enough\\", either, because for a portion of the population fascism will always be incredibly appealing all on its own. Show an average MAGA member the underlying ideological tenets of fascism without calling it \\"fascism\\" and they'd say \\"That sounds pretty fucking good to me\\". I'm not sure a \\"solution\\" to that is to have the Democrats also become fascistic in order to steal that vote share.You could hope they would also become demagogues (to whatever degree they aren't already), or populists in the vein of Bernie Sanders, but \\"left wing\\" populism is a kite that cannot fly in the United States, the nation has been poisoned against it by a century of relentless anti-union, pro-capital propaganda. And even if you're a fan of neoliberalism and market capitalism, you're left with the reality that when given a choice between the populist left and the populist right, capital will always take the populist right. Fascism is very pro-business, and capital will always seek to protect its own interests first.TLDR - Bernie isn't a viable candidate in the US, politics is beholden to entrenched capital interests and the capital will not support even an anodyne social democrat like Bernie or AOC, they will be branded as \\"radical leftists\\". Fascism and Nativism is deeply appealing to the prejudices of the electorate during times of economic upheaval and unrest. People, by and large, prefer simple narratives and folk devils to complex problems with sometimes unpalatable solutions.

What happens if you're wrong? While there are millions of voters out there that are not voting, I am yet to see that they would in fact show up for such a candidate. In a fair election system, the median voter should decide the outcome. Any voter who thinks \\"one party does nothing for me, the other party is going to hurt me\\" and concludes \\"I better not vote, no one represents me\\", is removing themselves from that set of voters and moves the median voter further to the party that wants to hurt them.In the same model, a loosing party has two traditional options: moving their positions towards the other party to appeal to the median voter, or trying to convince the median voter of their positions even if they didn't before. What you're asking for is the third: moving away from the median voter. This can only work if you doing so extends the voting population so dramatically that the formerly median voter is no longer even close to the median voter in this new voting population.These extensions to the voting population have happened before. Most recently (for democrats) on the cultural progressive side after LBJ. Arguably for Trump in 2016. But they are the exception, not the norm.And while I would love to see policies (culturally and socioeconomically) to the left of the current Democratic party, if these voters don't exist in large enough numbers, we are throwing real humans under the bus by not competing for the median voter if your thesis about who we could get to vote for \\"real progress\\" is wrong. It is much easier to argue (and to effect) that Democrats should move to the left, away from Republicans, if they win (and keep winning) than if they lose. If primaries are the main event, with the general almost a formality, that furthers moving away from bipartisanship and the other party.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"I'm sure this is a dumb question, but where's NATO now that Russia is infiltrating America?","title":"Trump blames Biden for provoking Russia's war by supporting Ukraine's NATO aspirations"},{"text":"Which is hard to deduct from billionaire's because they don't have taxable income.

Basically, you have to support every little aspect of x group, x cause, etc, or you will be labeled as homophobic, xenophobic, whateverphobic. A theoretical example would be: I support the LGBT+ community but I am against having children, anyone below 18, being on hormones or having any gender affirming surgery.

They did not pass progressive legislation. They passed right/center-right wing legislation, as I said. They raised marginal taxes on the wealthy (still lower than under Reagan), fixed the economy (got the stock market back in the green), expanded jobs (increased private sector growth that still exploits its workers), and decreased inequality (source needed).Meanwhile the GOP in those same years got permanent tax cuts, increased police funding, increased defense spending, increased subsidies for their lobbyists industries, the child tax credit not renewed, banking regulations removed, bans on out lgbtq+ service members, the patriot act, war in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, shipping well paid job overseas while replacing said jobs with low paid service industry jobs (what many of the jobs you quote are), ban on HRT for children of service members, and the list goes on and on.Again, the Dems only advance right/center-right wing bills.For context here: progressive, in its actual meaning not the partisan one thats relative to the USs far right politics, means **center-left**, and **left wing is anticapitalist.** A bill expanding capital is not progressive in any sense of the word that is not changed to make Americans feel progressive when were **unfortunately** not. Bills expanding private sector jobs *in lough of well paid, much better, public ones* is not progressive. Giving the private sector money on the *hope* they **reduce** fossil fuels is not progressive. Nationalizing much of energy would be progressive (like Ireland and other states around the world have done, *to their peoples immense benefit*).","title":"Dem Leader Calls House GOP Marauding Bands Of People Who Hate Each Other"},{"text":"I think he's proposing Democrats have an actual proposal to improve things","title":"Harris Didnt Lose the Election So Much as Trump Won | If Democrats want to win in the future, they need to grasp how he did it."},{"text":"It would not hurt to use \\"Corruption\\" as an issue to become the anti-government party.

The flow rate of the pipes underground are constricted by their diameter, and their supply constricted by the storage tanks and water towers capacities, especially as the pumps supplying the storage going against gravity can only realistically replenish them so fast.  No country, state, or municipality has enough collectively stored water supply plus infrastructure of large enough and plentiful enough pipes to bring to bear the immense amounts of water needed to fight these fires.  It's why helicopters and fixed winged aircraft have to supplement the boots on the ground.  I think it's absolutely nuts that anyone would think that California could have \\"prepared for these fires\\" anymore than they already have prepared.  Are we supposed to divert entire river systems and create massive aqueducts that can supply millions of gallons of water per minute?  The trillions it would take to do that, just to deliver the water in some place we are guessing maybe have a fire someday, makes no sense.California is world class in dealing with fires and the other 49 Governors in our country could do no better.","title":"Fire hydrants ran dry as Pacific Palisades burned.
