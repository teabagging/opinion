Biden did accomplish a lot in terms of policy, but really didnt (between not being able to and not prioritizing) secure long-term objectives for the left the same way that Trump did for the right. We can speculate on how much of what Biden did can remain after he leaves office but we still feel so many of the effects of the Trump presidency today. Imagine if the Biden administration had passed some law that could secure Americas participation in the Paris Agreement, or had packed the courts as was proposed. Unfortunately the American electorate is fickle at best so it seems that the best case scenario for any leader is going to be to find ways to guarantee the continued execution of their policies beyond their time in office, lest the next president try to unravel it all. This is clear to the right. The Affordable Care Act is standing on weak foundations as an example of a policy that has only stayed around because an alternative would be terrible, but at this point its not clear that the Trump administration would care about how unpopular ending it could be.","title":"Joe Biden and the democrats did NOTHING with this presidency"},{"text":"I just don't see how they could pass power willingly to Hitler.

Bankruptcy laws shouldnt be a political position, and is something fundamental to our country.Furthermore, a chapter 11 business restructuring bankruptcy is a completely different thing altogether than a personal bankruptcy, either chapter 7 or chapter 13.  Its used all the time in the corporate world as a means to flush bad debt, free up much needed capital and oftentimes save the company which is better for the overall economic impact long term.What do you think Mitt Romney and Bain Capital did numerous times when they acquired companies, stripped their assets and sold them for profit while flushing bad debt?  Thats right, they used chapter 11 bankruptcy as a tool to do so.This talking point is so thoroughly off base its remarkable.

For the most part I think it would be used as a negotiating tool vs actually imposing tons of tariffs. The other thing about tariffs is that there can be a tit for tat that happens when imposing tariffs on countries that we export to. Last time trump tried imposing tariffs on China they threatened tariffs on our agricultural products(china is a big buyer of our ag goods). So, both sides get hurt.I think offering tax benefits for certain industries we want to encourage to operate/produce goods in the US and employ us workers is a better strategy. This encourages us investment, and people don't end up paying more for their goods. However in many cases we still wouldn't be competitive in certain industries since our cost of labor is so much higher than otr countries. So I could see slight tariffs in conjunction with tax breaks to increase production of American made goods.","title":"Question about tariffs"},{"text":"NEVER AGAINTrump: Imma end this womans career","title":"Donald Trump declares war on Drug Cartels: We will show no mercy on the cartels"},{"text":"Works in Texas all the time.

That's not even touching the logistics of crossing the Pacific to invade North America. Even with the distance narrowed if staged from a place like, say, the Chukchi peninsula of Siberia toward the Bering Strait and Diomede islands, that's still some radically inhospitable terrain and a perilous route.

Carlson posted on X on Saturday afternoon. After Trump won, Mitch McConnell engineers a coup against his agenda by calling early leadership elections in the Senate. Two of the three candidates hate Trump and what he ran on.The former Fox host took particular issue with Cornyn, whom he summarized as an angry liberal whose politics are indistinguishable from Liz Cheneys. Cheney is a former Republican Congresswoman from Wyoming turned Trump critic; she campaigned for Kamala Harris. A Punchbowl News reporter described this comparison as completely off base.The election will take place on Wednesday, November 13. It will determine whether or not the new administration succeeds, Carlson wrote. Rick Scott of Florida is the only candidate who agrees with Donald Trump. Call your senator and demand a public endorsement of Rick Scott. Dont let McConnell get away with it again.Earlier on Saturday, Scott outlined that he was running for the leadership position to upend the status quo &amp; make sure President Trumps agenda gets done.Senators Ron Johnson, Rand Paul and Bill Hagerty also announced Saturday that they would back the Florida Senator in the race.Back in February, after McConnell announced he would be stepping down at the end of the year, Donald Trump Jr also labeled Thune and Cornyn as RINOs, or Republicans in name only.The president-elects son wrote: Both of them also voted to send billions more to Ukraine. MAGA must do everything in our power to stop either of these two RINOs from ever becoming Senate Leader!Trump also previously slammed Cornyn after he successfully negotiated bipartisan gun safety legislation, claiming the Texas Senator facilitated the first step in the movement to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY.On Friday, the National Association for Gun Rights also issued a statement against Cornyn: The arch traitor John Cornyn is being floated as the next Senate Majority Leader. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen.All of the momentum we have gained for gun rights could hit a wall if the man who spearheaded the largest gun control bill in decades is in charge, the group said.Although he faced a barrage of criticism from his own party for backing this bill, he stood by his work, telling the Texas Tribune in 2022: This was fundamentally important to the country at a time when things are so polarized and people are so intolerant of others that have different points of view.Missouri Senator Josh Hawley backed Cornyn, telling Fox News in a statement: I know he will work closely and effectively with President Trump to deliver on the promise of our new majority. Im delighted to give him my support.Heritage Action, the sister organization of the Heritage Foundation which is responsible for Project 2025, provided scorecards for Senators ranked by how conservative theyve voted. Senator Scott scored 92 per cent, compared to Senator Thune with 37 per cent and Senator Thune with 35 per cent.Meanwhile, the South Dakota Senator told CNBC on Thursday that while he understood that Trump could exert a considerable amount of influence on the Senate leadership race, my preference would be, and I think its probably in his best interest, to stay out of that. He continued: These Senate secret ballot elections are probably best left to senators, and hes got to work with all of us when its all said and done.Thune received the support of Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin, according to Punchbowl News.Trump has yet to publicly endorse any of the three contenders.While sources told Axios that Trump privately brushed off Scotts bid as not serious, a Trump spokesperson refuted that claim, telling the outlet that the former president hasnt weighed in on the leadership race and anyone who says differently is wrong.","title":"Tucker Carlson angrily accuses Senate Republicans of plotting coup against Trump"},{"text":"Thats a smart move.

They spent so much money coming up with bogus claims in 2020 even if they knew it wouldn't stick and would be easily debunked, one can only guess why. One answer to that would be that they wanted to set the public opinion that election fraud is ridiculous and anyone who would claim it afterwards would look like a hypocrite, and that's partly why the media and Democrats won't even dare to approach the subject. The other answer is that they went through it to learn all about the process and what security measures were in place in order to study it and find holes in them.I don't want to be the lunatic here. Just because I would like to believe it could be true doesn't mean I will be swayed by a dozen anodectal stories of people who say their ballots were returned. But if it becomes in the hundreds maybe I would. There's a difference between baseless election fraud accusations like we saw in 2020, and some that could hold ground. I know a lot of states have a very solid anti-fraud  procedural strategy in place, but I also believe some other smaller counties don't. And yes I also know the results are within the margin of errors of polling so that doesn't help this theory.A lot of people say the Trump numbers are so high that it couldn't possibly be explained with fraud, but I disagree, the vast majority of counties had a less than 2% vote difference, many even &lt;1%. It just takes one small change here and here to affect 1000 votes in the proper location to change the whole picture. Also the fact that they were saying everywhere we had a record number of voters and it doesn't match in the total count, the fact that Dems had a favorable approval rating, the fact their rally had so much more people than the other side. It is weird. I just hope there will be investigations and they won't just give up because of the optics.","title":"After Trump took the lead, election deniers went suddenly silent"},{"text":"Don't worry.

I'm wondering how much of it was built from a weird coalition of Catholics who voted for Biden because he's Catholic but got weird about abortion stuff this time around; the young-men-want-to-afford-groceries vote; the demographic shifts we have previously discussed; etc. This was a bad national environment because of vibes. It doesn't matter if the economy is good when inflation is bad. It doesn't matter if violent crime is down if you have to get someone to unlock your shampoo bottles and know it's not even worth telling the police that you caught your car getting broken into on camera, because the local DA explicitly doesn't prosecute car theft.

Genuinely explaining how to ensure cheaper rent would tbh probs go a long way.

World leaders want to shift the overtone window constantly so that they can look almost normal in comparison to those far left lunatics and so that it's easier to diabolize right wing ideas. But we all know that the \\"moderate\\" left from today is the far left from yesterday. Meanwhile the far right from today is at best the center/center left from yesterday. It's this endless shifting towards communism that got them lose the elections.An interesting fact is that Abe Shinz?, who developed a solid friendship with Donald Trump, had almost the same policies as him and was more extreme on certain subjects despite being from the Liberal Democratic Party. I remember how he only allowed a few dozen political refugees every year, always being looked as the black sheep among the corrupted G7 leaders who've been pushing globalist agenda those last decades. He was a real nationalist, protecting his nation and people from insecurity, poverty and uncontrolled immigration. He was way more right leaning than most of our far right western politicians.Most people from my generation (I was born in the early 80's) grew up sharing left wing values and fighting far right ideas. The constant shift of this left towards the far left that made people turn away from them. Nobody believes in Communism and Socialism anymore. Communism has only brought totalitarism, extreme poverty, political censorship and mass assassinations wherever it was, and Socialism has destroyed the whole Europe to an extent that I'm not sure it's even possible to recover. I sure wouldn't blame Americans for trying to escape this down spiral. I'm not American but I'm really happy because it's a massive win for democracy, and hopefully the start of a new era for the rest of the world. You American friends sent us a very strong message with those elections. No matter how crooked and corrupted our elites and institutions can be, power ultimately belongs tp the people. Politicians are the ones working for us, their only purpose is to give us better lives, not the contrary... They lost us when they forgot this fundamental.

When you include the territories and the indigenous nations you have something like 60 different levels of difference and how government is run and the policies they take, compared to any given time period of federal governance.","title":"Pennsylvania Democrats Win State House in Truly Unbelievable Way | Democrats managed to keep control of the state House in one of the most pro-Trump districts in the state."},{"text":"There are no ppl on twitter.","title":"After Trump took the lead, election deniers went suddenly silent"},{"text":"Yep.

It's very much average experience in the US. *YOU GUYS* think you're special, but you aren't. California loses money on taxesAbsolutely incorrect. California receives less in direct tax dollar returns from the federal government than they pay to the federal government. And they are certainly not unique in that regard. But in exchange for that, California has an export advantage due to the fact that dollar is too weak for their economy. It's the exact opposite of the situation Mississippi is in, where the dollar is too strong for their economy, and therefore they must be subsidized by the rest of the country in order to incentivize them to stay in the Union. This is exactly what happened with Greece and France and Germany. France and Germany get a huge economic benefit from the Europe being too weak compared to their economies and Greece is at a huge disadvantage because the euro is too strong for their economy. Greece would literally be better off going back to the drachma and letting it float on forex markets. This would make domestically produced products cheaper than foreign produced products and incentivize domestic production, which raises the strength of their economy. In order to keep them in the Eurozone using a euro that puts them at a disadvantage, the rest of the Euro zone has to subsidize them in the form of additional payments over and beyond what they submit to the EU. To put it another way, domestic policy within the United States results in a wealth transfer from poorer states like Mississippi to richer states like California. In order to offset that, the federal government takes money from California and just hands it back to Mississippi. It's a matter of evening the playing field, not giving Mississippi an unearned advantage.","title":"CMV: Californians should not be obligated to pay federal taxes for policies that are directly harmful to us."},{"text":"Firstly, lets address Nimarata Randhawa Haley by her legal first name","title":"Trump announces former WH officials Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo will not be in his next administration"},{"text":"I understand why you feel that way.

A unitary executive with broad immunities, an administrative state that is stripped of its independence and put under the direct control of the president, an economic agenda that will prioritize the interests of the rich, a Republican platform that will continue redistributing wealth to the top, protecting a broken tax code, while crippling the labor movement, and interfering with global trade.Trump's presidency and Republicans in power will enable and embolden an ultra nationalistic, xenophobic, nativist movement in this country. We'll see efforts from Republicans to roll back civil rights for marginalized groups, and Christian nationalists in government will endeavor to change the country's political, social and cultural landscape.Funding for education, medicaid, Medicare, Social security SNAP, TANF, universities, clean energy infrastructure, and more will be on the chopping block.What's more, we'll see a foreign policy agenda that will weaken our alliances, cripple our ability to act as peace brokers, make partners with autocrats, abandon our western allies, empower dangerous expansionists, forsake democratic countries and national identities fighting for their independence, that will cause trade wars, and strengthen our enemies geopolitical positions and alliances.And as long as Trump can be called king by his enablers and his supporters, as long as a vocal minority of Trump devotees (which is separate from all of those that voted for him) is still cheering him on, these things will be much easier to accomplish.More importantly, and this is the part that everyone should understand. Is that Trump is and always has been the perfect candidate to help carry this out. He's a useful idiot, and the goal isn't to appease Trump as much as it is to exploit him in order to reshape the government into something that Republicans can and will benefit from for decades to come. It's about using Trump to preserve and  abuse authority, to dismantle the separation of powers so that Republicans can work towards transforming the country into something that resembles *their* vision. A country that no one will ever be able to take back from them.We know this because this is what all the culture wars have been about. They see this as *their* moment and they're going to take advantage of it.","title":"Will Trump Buckle Again on the JFK Records?"},{"text":"I'm sure many members campaigned for Harris in the months before and during election day morning while simultaneously planning what they would do if she lost.

You can find articles from numerous main stream media sites questioning Trumps cognitive ability related to cherry picked quotes or scenarios and all of them were posted and upvoted here. I had a child a few years ago and havent been following Bidens presidency nearly as involved as I did Trumps, but the amount of static that came along with any news around Bidens cognitive decline was heavy, especially around this sub. I would see mention of it from right wing comment sections, but the media I took in was not covering it in full or completely truthfully and I was convinced the bad moments were outliers and I always knew Biden was a stutterer and said dumb shit out of nowhere for his entire career. It confirmed my existing bias. I dont understand why it is hard to believe. Does Fox News show it? News Max? Does my aunts preacher tell her about it?

Unlike them, I remember what it was like, and now hes going to *remind* them.But Harris and Biden support Israel and their war that has killed 40,000 civilians in Gaza, someone will say. Yes, they do, and of the two (viable) candidates running for president, Harris was the only one who bothered to say that Israel is not entitled to indiscriminately kill civilians when hunting Hamas. Shes the only (viable) candidate who even came *close* to empathizing with the innocent victims of this war and criticized the heavy-handed actions taken by Israel.No matter how you slice it, one of the two candidates is better for Palestinian civilians, and that candidates name is NOT Donald Trump, so spare me the arguments about how the Democrats needed to be taught a lesson while they were trying to walk a fine line (between pissing off supporters of Israel and supporters of Palestinians, both of whom Harris needed for victory); the lesson will be learned by the *civilians* in Palestine, and the people teaching the lesson (*some* left-wing voters in Michigan) will be responsible for that. Own your vote, and own the consequences of that vote.Its almost as if some people cant imagine a world where Palestinians suffer even more than they are right now. Well, they wont have to imagine it, because Trump and Netanyahu are going to put it right on their screens in full color. Were all going to have to witness the unbridled carnage Netanyahu will unleash now that he has the full-throated endorsement of Trump, an equally-corrupt man who actually *likes* old Bibi.Anyway, thats the reality. Dont tell me about third-party candidates, neoliberalism, or any other nonsense that belongs in an academic setting right now because the *reality on the fucking ground* is that Trump doesnt like Muslims or Arabs in general, and hes going to allow Netanyahu to do whatever he pleases. The end.But Biden let Netanyahu do whatever he pleased, too, someone will say. Spare me; Ive heard it all before and your comments are going to fall on deaf ears. You and I will soon find out how much worse it can getwe will soon see if Netanyahu has been holding back to avoid upsetting Bidenand then you can tell me how you feel.","title":"Voters in Arab-American strongholds likely tipped Michigan in Trumps favor"},{"text":"Just like that general strike lol.

From the image:Gov. of Pennsylvania J. Shapiro, et. al.\\nNov. 7th 2024This is a formal Duty to Warn Letter. Per DNI Dir. Clappers 2015 directive to all agencies and contractors associated with intelligence and financial agency technologies. I have a Duty to Warn of suspicions of hacking, and have done so for my customers including Govt. Agencies, Dept. of Defense, F100 firms and numerous banks. I do so here as a directly affected voter.Nearly all my investigations begin for one of two reasons. The hackers make a mistake triggering a system issue and/or the aggregate effects of the hacking creates results outside nominal expectations. There is a third and less common flag; an unrelated distraction to draw attention away from the hacking.All three of these indicators are present in the election of Nov. 5th 2024. Element three, distraction via bomb-threats, is confirmed coming from Russian agencies. Element one is the inexplicable mismatch of reported votes vs. voter turnout. Here in Centre County initial tabulation was an absurdly low 67K votes when over 80K voters participated. Element two is also present. Our local scanner systems worked in testing, but were unable to communicate properly with tabulation systems after the bomb-scare. I note from experience - the failure of a scanning systems to properly load a database is an extremely common development when a system is changed without notice to the users. I have personally worked on similar issues where sudden scanner configuration failures were the first symptoms of system hacking.With these three elements present, I suggest immediately doing a relatively simple set of preliminary checks. First, randomly selected precincts require manual comparisons of the number of voters who took ballots vs the scanned output of vote totals. Those did not match here in Centre County by apx 13K votes. Once added, those votes substantially changed outcomes and led to the outright reversals in multiple Centre County races.Centre County BOE now shows vote totals over 80K votes. Apx. 6% above 2020 turnout.

Democrats were dealt a bad hand this term, but they also played it abysmally. Whether in hindsight or not, Biden's decision to run for reelection all but guaranteed an uphill battle Voter turnout stayed consistent for Trump this election, the same cannot be said for Democrats. The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect on.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. The onus was on Democrats, not Republicans, to help Americans make those politically informed decisions, however unfair that may seem.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, yes, Biden was supposed to be a transitional president. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and oversaw an economic recovery. Republicans exploited these situations for political gain.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats continued to blunderWhile they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for political nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whoever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized, above all else, the message that Trump was *not* better for the economy and his economic policies for his next term are even more potentially damaging.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.But the national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions to that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively.He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations. Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades**All of these things contributed to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a disaster too. He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.On immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears and appealing to grievances while proposing extreme, non viable \\"solutions\\" instead of more practical, economically considerate, humane ones.Most Americans don't know this stuff. And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise.And if Harris was ever going to have a shot, despite rolling in at the last minute, her campaign was going to have to articulate these points, emphasize them over and over again, so that those low propensity voters might get the picture.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":" Bidens internal polling had Trump winning 400 electoral votes, ex-Obama official claims: Catastrophic mistake"},{"text":"I think about this way more than I'd like to admit.16 year old me was obsessed with Al Gore.

Shapiro, et. al.\\nNov. 7th 2024This is a formal Duty to Warn Letter. Per DNI Dir. Clappers 2015 directive to all agencies and contractors associated with intelligence and financial agency technologies. I have a Duty to Warn of suspicions of hacking, and have done so for my customers including Govt. Agencies, Dept. of Defense, F100 firms and numerous banks. I do so here as a directly affected voter.Nearly all my investigations begin for one of two reasons. The hackers make a mistake triggering a system issue and/or the aggregate effects of the hacking creates results outside nominal expectations. There is a third and less common flag; an unrelated distraction to draw attention away from the hacking.All three of these indicators are present in the election of Nov. 5th 2024. Element three, distraction via bomb-threats, is confirmed coming from Russian agencies. Element one is the inexplicable mismatch of reported votes vs. voter turnout. Here in Centre County initial tabulation was an absurdly low 67K votes when over 80K voters participated. Element two is also present. Our local scanner systems worked in testing, but were unable to communicate properly with tabulation systems after the bomb-scare. I note from experience - the failure of a scanning systems to properly load a database is an extremely common development when a system is changed without notice to the users. I have personally worked on similar issues where sudden scanner configuration failures were the first symptoms of system hacking.With these three elements present, I suggest immediately doing a relatively simple set of preliminary checks. First, randomly selected precincts require manual comparisons of the number of voters who took ballots vs the scanned output of vote totals. Those did not match here in Centre County by apx 13K votes. Once added, those votes substantially changed outcomes and led to the outright reversals in multiple Centre County races.Centre County BOE now shows vote totals over 80K votes. Apx. 6% above 2020 turnout. In my professional opinion every county in PA as well as many in WI, MI and GA currently reporting lower vote totals vs. 2020 and/or also experienced a distraction bomb threat should undertake the same process My professional opinion is: many thousands of voters are being disenfranchised, likely by a malicious actor via errors in tabulation software. My concern has been proven correct and warranted here in Centre County PA.ESignature - Stephen R.

The Church and state are intertwined and its people are infected.... By infected I mean situations like my mother. Who is still married to my father. She has convinced herself most of these things didn't happen. She still sang praise and worship along with the church band after she found out the 36 year old drummer had convinced her 14 year old niece to send him nudes. My dad watched my uncle beat him up, and they considered the matter handled and over with. ....(.While she knows about my uncle, she doesn't know about my father)... These issues get covered up on a regular basis in churches. The people involved and the cop at that church are usually the old ones who see it....

It's much more serious than whether the Dems \\"deserve\\" to win.?\\nThe DNC kept telling us that this was the most important election in US history. Democracy itself was at stake. If Trump won, life as we know it would be over. Women, LGBT folk, people of color, all would have their rights taken away. People would be deported. All manner of horrible things would happen.?\\nSo, if the DNC really believed that to be true, if they knew the dire consequences of losing this election to the GOP, you would think they would do everything they could to make sure they won. They would nominate a likeable, well-spoken candidate with a good record and popular policies. Then they would have their candidate appear all over the US, interacting directly and authentically with the American people.?\\nBut the Dems didn't do any of that. They anointed an unlikeable, weak candidate with a middling-to-poor record.? Then they set their highly-paid consultants and the propagandists in the corporate oligarchy-owned media to work, trying to shame, blame, scold, and terrify the American people, and otherwise force their unworthy candidate down our throats.\\nThis shows us clearly that the people running the Democratic party have other priorities. And they are happy to throw women, people of color, and LGBT people under the bus in order to advance those priorities.?\\nThey are not trustworthy. They are not what they pretend to be. They lie. Constantly.\\nThe big question is: what are the Dems' true priorities?

For example, Article 4 of the Paris Agreement reads: Each Party shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve.Nationally determined contributions is the term the UN climate talks use to refer to pledges countries make to  reduce their emissions within a specific time frame. All nations must legally prepare one of these pledges, but the ambition of those pledges is a matter for the country.Note here: Developed country parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. This particular should was the source of disagreements in the final hours of the Paris negotiations.Other legally binding obligations:\\nCountries that have submitted their nationally determined contributions must update them every five years. In their effort to meet these NDCs, countries must be transparent about greenhouse gas emissions and the actions taken to reduce those emissions.This transparency means that countries are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions with developed countries having to do so on an annual basis. This requirement is more flexible for least developed countries and small island developing states, which may choose to report as they wish.","title":"Elon Musks Net Worth Tops $300 Billion in Wake of Trump Victory"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/vpfkzthomyzd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e525ebf4ad373401aa7f5e9ff77d8ec3a52a9e","title":"Why Isnt Bush Hated as Much as Trump?"},{"text":"Didn't he also move the US embassy to Jerusalem?","title":"Voters in Arab-American strongholds likely tipped Michigan in Trumps favor"},{"text":"Its the poophole loophole.

There's so much pressure against the natural inclination people have toward freedom that they adapt to the contrary.There's a reason authoritarian systems are inherently contradictory. They need to turn your natural desire for personal will into submission.Children are blank slates. They all are impulsively freedom oriented til we beat it out of them.Democratic society itself is an internal war between domination and freedom. It's a philosophical desire by existing power structures to make people submissive and people trying to counter it or accept it and join it to secure their freedom through a piece of the system of domination. . That's actually the thrust of civilization itself.You need to teach people to be racist. They don't know that automatically. We have in group our group tendencies but they always drive toward hating the out group to protect the in group. That's the lever of authoritarianism.Generally research shows only about a third of society is inclined to authoritarianism. The rest are taught passivity or some kind of maladaption to submission. Otherwise democratic society wouldn't be possible I think and fascism always rises against the inclination of people to accept it. If they just wanted to accept it it would be easier to make it happen instead of requiring the progressive small step ratcheting.","title":"None of the conventional explanations for Trumps victory stand up to scrutiny"},{"text":"Keen to see the Walking Dead finally found some new extras.","title":"Trump &amp; the Republicans are the establishment"},{"text":"God bless us all!","title":"DAVID KRAYDEN: Happy days are here againTrumps victory might have saved America"},{"text":"And just that quickly, the need for moral coherence collapses. \\"Well, I can't justify my stance, but I have power so it doesn't matter.\\" It took someone one post for you to unmask yourself.

Just because they may not understand the ramifications of what Trumps policy proposals might do to the economy doesnt mean people didnt vote for him because of the economy. Most times when theres an economic downturn or economic hardship across the board, the incumbent party is voted out. This happened in 08 as well when Obama and democrats swept the White House and both houses of Congress. It happened just earlier this year when the Tories were summarily booted from government in the UK. This was absolutely an economy election. Until democrats can embrace an economic message that can resonate with working-class voters, we will continue to lose these elections.","title":"After Trumps win, some women are considering the 4B movement."},{"text":"I'm worried he'll get killed.

There has never been a country called \\"Palestine\\", and 80 years ago it was part of the British Mandate.  When the UN's attempt to create a Palestinian state failed (because the Arabs and Palestinians rejected it in favor of war), the British relinquished control in 1948, and the Jewish inhabitants of the area re-established Israel in *their* ancestral homeland.  Of course, all of their neighbors immediately declared war on them - but that followed 30 years of terrorist attacks from Muslims, so it wasn't really a surprise.Israel's neighbors lost that war.  ...and the war after that.  ...and the one after that.  ...and the one after that, etc., etc.When you start a war and lose, and the people you attacked take some of your land as a result, you have no one to blame but yourself.
