Now, they spend their days loading up their car with yard signs and bumper stickers, then heading into the unfamiliar Pennsylvania terrain to deliver campaign merchandise and persuade undecided voters.I just signed up, and I showed up at their office on Saturday, and the poor office has not  we were supposed to turn there?

What do you do if you care deeply about the election, but you dont live in one of the few places where the race is truly contested?One option: Go somewhere else.As polls depict a presidential election on a knifes edge, volunteers of all political stripes are organizing into caravans and heading to swing states to support their candidates.In Tennessee, for example, Republicans are pretty safe, said Linda Clark, 64. So earlier this month, Clark led a dozen supporters of former president Donald Trump from her home state to Pennsylvania to volunteer. We wanted to go where we could help make a difference, she said.Clark, who lives in Crossville and is a member of the Tennessee GOP state executive committee, said presidential elections are often called the most important of our time, but this year, that feels especially true. Clark said she is looking for a Trump administration to restore the economy so that young adults like her son can afford to buy a home.This year, the timing worked out for Clark to jump into campaigning in a way it hasnt always. She and her husband are empty nesters now and retired, freeing them up for a trip to a battleground state.The drive took 13 hours, thanks to a cattle car wreck somewhere in Virginia. Then they spent a week knocking on doors in Bucks County, paying their own way with some support from an outside group called the?[Mighty American Strike Force](https://masf.online/about/).Perennially a battleground, Pennsylvania this year seems to be?*the*?swing state,?with the candidate face time and?[ad money](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/pennsylvania-ad-spending-election-2024-e9c06d59)?to prove it.

There's a reason negativity and garbage trend more than good genuine content. Because if you like something, then you just like it and move on. But when people dislike something, they have more ways to express it. You get to dislike it, and leave a comment telling everyone you don't like it. And then those people also feel compelled to respond to you and share the post with other people they think will agree with them. And all of the sudden, it's got like twice the engagement as other posts.Oh and in the case of suggested content, literally everything counts towards its decision. If you interact with enough people that have something in common, that thing will start being suggested to you. And when you say you're not interested or \\"do not recommend this creator\\" that's temporary, eventually the algorithm will decide to show it to you again and you have to retrain it.I think Instagram's most hilarious feature, is the fact that you can disable the suggested feed, but only for 30 days. Why would they not want people to curate their own content you ask? Because social medias make money from ads. So the more garbage they put on the feed, the farther you scroll and the more ads load.Social media companies are well aware of how destructive they are, and they take advantage of it.","title":"CMV: Algorithms, though neutral, unintentionally create filter bubbles by showing content based on engagement patterns.

People bring their own biases to the design of algorithms. Someone trying to engage more Republicans, for example, is going to have a heavier bias towards GOP views of issues, will provide more GOP answers to queries, etc. The bigger problem is lack of transparency when it comes to the algorithms. You may think that you're getting unbiased answers (hello, Google) only to find out that the company providing them has tailored the answers you see to match your past activities, queries, interactions, etc.Similarly, people make assumptions based on their own experiences and prejudices. Many folks believe that excluding \\"disruptive posters\\" leads to a more engaging experience - so the algorithms they design will either not engage those that disagree w the desired target market, or they will provide greater weight and visibility to those that agree w the designers. This is how you build the illusion of consensus - focus on attracting those that are at least open to your cause (making your content visible to them) and excluding any disagreement (hiding your content from those that would \\"disrupt\\" your campaign). This is, btw, similar to how abusers and cults get their victims to stay for so long. Isolation, groupthink, shouting down opposition voices, etc. So no, the \\"algorithms\\" aren't neutral.

A definition that broad is functionally useless.I understand, of course, that that's how the word \\"socialism\\" is generally understood among the USA's radically anti-socialist political establishment, and that the general political scene in the US is so radically anti-socialist that anything close to even a mild social-democrat stance is instantly denounced as \\"socialism\\"--The ultimate anathema in US politics, and one the right uses liberally to discredit their opponents as big bad commies.

I agree with you that polarization has much deeper roots than just algorithm design, and its clear that political divides in the U.S. have been developing over decades, as you pointed outfrom the civil rights movement to the Vietnam War, through Reagan and Gingrich, and more recent events. The gradual self-sorting you describe is indeed a significant factor, and it seems to have built momentum long before the rise of modern technology.I also understand your point about the personal impact of seeing hostile views, especially in your case as someone from the LGBT community. Its completely understandable why youd want to avoid exposure to rhetoric thats not just opposing but dehumanizing. Forcing people to engage with content thats deeply offensive or harmful isnt a healthy way to promote balance or mutual understanding, and I respect that perspective.While algorithms alone arent the cause, I wonder if they might still play a role in softening some of the more extreme aspects of polarization. Even if they cant fix the deeper societal issues, could there be ways to subtly encourage more curiosity and healthier exchanges, rather than pushing people further into their bubbles?Youre right that polarization seems to be a recurring theme in human history, but Id like to think that even small, intentional steps might help prevent it from becoming as toxic as it has at other points. Id be curious to hear your thoughts on whether you think there are any interventions that could help reduce the intensity, even if they dont fully reverse the trend.","title":"CMV: Algorithms, though neutral, unintentionally create filter bubbles by showing content based on engagement patterns.

If we removed all the current algorithms and replaced them with ones that forced us to see one wildly opposed position to ours for every one we agreed with, the internet would be filled with screeching and whining about having to see the other side's views and we would just try to self-sort ourselves back into our bubbles, because ultimately a lot of people just don't want to see the other side's stuff. For example, I am LGBT - I don't want to be forced to see videos of far-right weirdos calling us all satanic degenerate groomers destroying the sanctity of marriage and undermining western civilization. I would actively take steps to get away from any ads or promos showing those things and would spend significantly less time on any site that tried to expose me to that stuff for the sake of promoting an even-handed, both-sides discourse. Modern American political polarization has deep roots. It's not just to 2016. It honestly goes back to the 60s and 70s. People on opposing sides of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were so worked up about it that they started wanting to only marry people who agreed with them. When their kids grew up in the 80s and 90s is when the Republican Party, through figures such as Reagan and Newt Gingrich, began to shift much further to the right and take a more combative tone, which helped divide things further and dig the line in the sand deeper, and events such as Rodney King helped to make things even more strained. Then with the GWOT in the 2000s things became even more polarized with the expansion of the surveillance state and the powers of the federal government and the growth of the prison industrial complex. And then we had the Tea Party which was the direct precursor of Trump's voter base. It's been one gradual slide into polarization for a looong time. People have been self-sorting for decades. The algorithm is ultimately based on our media consumption, which is something we ourselves control. At this point, if we adjusted them to show us something radically different to our perspective, we would ignore those things or just stop using the site in question to go somewhere else. Mass polarization between two ideological poles is something that has happened often before in human history, to an extent it's a part of the story of all nations - unfortunately, it just has very dire implications for where it eventually winds up. But I don't know if there's any way to really stop it. It's not an invented problem as a result of technology, it is, unfortunately, a very natural one.","title":"CMV: Algorithms, though neutral, unintentionally create filter bubbles by showing content based on engagement patterns.

They might not have the protagonism of ideological parties, but they can quickly become the palatable fallback option once the current majority invariably fails to fulfill expectations.* The most effective type of leadership seems to be non-ideological and without executive ambitions. Ideological leaders will eventually be in the wrong side of history once the tides have moved in another direction and become a liability, while leaders with executive ambitions will prioritize their career over the party's path for power.* A strong leader can keep a party afloat longer, but it's not enough to keep it powerful during their leadership (and even less useful to keep it powerful after their leadership)* Low internal democracy (eg smoke filled rooms deciding candidates) is ultimately better for parties in a multiparty system: it allows consensus candidates to be selected without making internal disputes visible and even allows for relatively peaceful changes in direction.* At the same time, top-down party building might cripple the parties and lead to low internal confidence. **The most successful structure seems to be low-level elected members of the party (mayors, city councelors, regional representatives, secretaries etc) having most of the power**. These politicians have a decent grasp of voters and down-to-earth politics, aren't overly ideological nor have national ambitions, which means their decisions are often pragmatic. Sure, their major interests are usually being elected and favoring their local communities, but if you get the average of all local interests and elegibilities you might end up with a fairly representative party.For specific examples, in Brazil the most successful parties nowadays are part of the so-called \\"centr?o\\" (\\"big center\\"), which will easily support either side of the aisle and usually lack flashy national politicians. MDB is historically the best one at doing it, with PSD being the most recent story of success. Uni?o Brasil is another interesting case - they are basically the former far-right party of Bolsonaro that decided to abandon their 'ideological party' identity and instead became a pragmatic center-conservative party that can easily work with the left or the right.On the other side, the most clear failure must be PSDB, the former main \\"liberal-conservative\\" (with Brazilian characteristics). Once alt-right became mainstream they lost most of their rightwing voters, and on their attempt to find a new direction the party ended up divided between progressive-neoliberals, neutral market-liberals and anti-far-right conservatives. With multiple politicians trying to control the party leadership and top-down decisions that ignored the local realities (eg, forbidding local alliances with certain popular parties on both the left and the right), it simply imploded.Parties with very strong/popular leaders (like Lula's PT and Bolsonaro's PL) aren't as strong/influential as those with invisible leaders. On top of that, both parties are strongly divided by pragmatists and ideologues. In both cases, party leadership is enforcing unity, but dissident leaders might grow in power sooner rather than later.Now, I'm not sure if the most successful party strategies are also the best for democracy - they probably aren't, given how they are mostly based on already stabilished local politicians, but at least they're interested on listening local voters.","title":"Why Parties Fail"},{"text":"how do i become an ultra maga","title":"whiney baby liberal"},{"text":"WhoopsieBut don't worry, we investigated ourselves and found that we did nothing wrong.

This isn't just a problem with left and right parties, with the far left and far right factions of the party being unpalatable to the general public, but it's also a problem for centrist parties.An example of this is Lib Dems in the UK, which essentially lost out on replacing Crobyns labour as the opposition with it's uncompressing position on rejoining the EU. Regardless of if that's a good or bad policy position, it just crushed the coalition building potential of the party in a country where half wanted to leave the EU and a sizable chunk has mixed views on the EU. (I know there where other issues but this one sticks out to me)Centrist positions aren't inherently popular and can be just as damaging to coalition building as far right or left policies. Tacking to the centre works for left or right parties because their unpopular policies tend to be on the fringes.For these reasons I find that parties that institutionalise some kind of greater say for the party establishment tend to do better, as they will have at least had to face the electorate. Historically, the democratic party in the us and conservative party in the UK have done this best, which I believe corresponds to their historical success. The more these parties give in to the trend of party democracy, the more problems I think they'll have.","title":"Why Parties Fail"},{"text":"Yes its also about depop","title":"The dark and sad truth about the Covid vaccine, its spiritual effects and consequences for the soul and physical body"},{"text":"But, what is the logic behind this  going to a McDonalds?Showing that he can do what Harris only dreams (or lies) of doing.","title":"Democrat Barbara Lee: Trump Working At McDonalds Shows Hes Not Well"},{"text":"I dont think it is mentioned enough that trump is a reality tv star, and just like all reality tv its completely fake. \\nNothing MAGA says about Trump is based in reality or fact, its based on the image some entertainers came up with for a TV show back in the early 2000s.

To increase the earths pressure, we need everyone to start hyperventilating, increasing the volume of air on earth because CO2 is bigger than O2.

But the books in the picture hilariously included books banned by liberal school districts in his own state. But of course the leftist media didnt call him out on it, and leftists, despite their claim of being highly educated, arent intelligent enough to do their own research so they didnt know.

I'm not accusing you personally of any bigotry, but this entire thread has been loaded with toxicity. Backlash is always inevitable, but opposition to mainline candidates is as well. Sure, a lot of pro-Palestinian activists use strong language, but most people in that camp are sick of being ignored and understandably feel sickened at what they perceive to be the electorate justifying settler colonialism and genocide because it's election season. Activists rarely care about how close it is to an election season to make their voices and demands heard because hurting a candidate's chances, even if they are less-bad than their opponent is simply not going to be a concern if they feel strongly about a human rights issue and have plausible reason to believe that their election will perpetuate the problem.I get it, the Democrats are more of a coalition and the Republicans are more of a party. Democrats have  Henry Cuellar (though not for long) and Rashida Tlaib in the same party with relative peace while Republicans tend to punish anyone who deviates even just a little bit through political and financial means. The issue with being a coalition is once an issue creates a divide, it becomes next to impossible to alleviate if they let it fester for too long, as it has here. Vote Blue No Matter Who has its consequences, and fatigue is one of them, especially when Dems choose to roll out people like Hillary and Biden who have been wildly unpopular for decades, the former couldn't even be bothered to campaign in the Rust Belt and is still showing her face and making public appearances villifying the electorate for not turning out for her as she hoped. The backlash pro-Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab groups are facing is much deeper than heated political discussion. It's often just disdain. Democrats have gone more hawkish in both foreign and immigration policy and lecturing the groups affecting by these policies that it will be worse under the other guy and allowing the media to get away with this while their reality under various administrations is more or less the same is unproductive. While not you specifically, a lot of people behind the backlash care more about getting her in than actually changing things and become rabid when anyone challenges that idea, even going so far as to call them selfish. I guess the bigger issue surrounding the backlash is exactly that: Vote Blue No Matter Who and the lack of introspection it's come with. It demands that a diverse coalition, regardless of their choices on the ballot, choose the default Democrat, regardless of that Dem's character, positions, and prior history. We were asked to this for Hillary, despite the DNC leaks revealing they were working against Bernie to prop her up, and funding the craziest people in every Republican primary they thought they could get their hands on. Hillary gets nominated, doesn't campaign in the Rust Belt, doesn't address her past support for Henry Kissinger, doesn't even address her own unpopularity or position changes and then the Bernie Bros get blamed for the loss. The coalition is again asked to do the same for Biden, who during his campaign shat on progressives, he helped shift the Democratic party rightward in the 80s, and has lost nomination in both '88 and '08 only to ask for it again 12 years later. We gave him the office after dealing with 4 years of Trump only for him to become an ineffective Trump-lite and capitulate to Republicans. It is now the third election cycle where certain factions of the Democratic coalition are asked yet again to continue this cycle where they are asked to vote in people who refuse to deviate from the norm when it comes to Israel. Yes, the backlash is inevitable, but on that same token, you can't expect people to take Harris' ceasefire messaging seriously when Biden campaigned on being pro two-state solution only for his actions to reflect the opposite, Hillary had zero qualms about unequivocally supporting Israel, and Obama doing performative pauses only to double the weapons shipments a week later. When you get the same messaging for 12 years it'll cause some fatigue in certain voting blocs.","title":"Arab American and Muslim voters helped Biden win in 2020.

You are conflating an economic system of ownership with a method of distribution of political power.There's a reason even plenty of capitalists who think the USSR was a totalitarian hellscape still think it was \\"socialist\\" where the Nazi party wasn't, despite having \\"socialist\\" in both namesNazi Germany was not socialist because it allowed certain capitalists to operate within their economy, even including foreign capitalists, as long as they aligned with the goals of the Nazi party, of course.The USSR in contrast disallowed almost all types of private ownership. There were still some subsistence farmers even near its collapse, but the more productive enterprises like factories were all nationalized almost immediately at its inception.Both Nazi Germany and the USSR had extensive planned economies, so central planning is more of a feature of totalitarianism rather than the economic system itself. So you are just as likely to see a planned economy in non socialist states like Nazi Germany, UAE, Iran as you are to see it in a socialist state like the USSR or Mao's China.In essence, capitalism can be an autocracy, monarchy, oligarchy, democracy etc. And socialism can be an autocracy, monarchy, oligarchy, democracy etc.Totalitarianism = planned economy, worse standard of livingDemocracy = free market, better standard of livingSocialism = collective ownershipCapitalism = private ownershipWe are at a point when all countries are mixed economies anyway, with a blend of private and state ownership. So there is no longer such a thing as a purely capitalist or purely socialist nation.The most important difference between capitalism and socialism is the type of ownership, since all other aspects you have listed are actually a factor of democracy or totalitarianism. Even though free markets are commonly associated with capitalism, there is such a thing as market socialism, which is a type of free market associated with socialism. In addition, there is also such a thing as an otherwise capitalist state having a planned economy rather than a free market.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"This was staged.

Working the dining room \\"hostess\\" position was less stressful than in the back kitchen, or even at the sales counter, because I didn't have to directly deal with the customers, frequently-changing menu items/specials/pricing; or stressing out over a vat of hot grease during rush hour. I more or less could order my tasks in a way that made productive sense to me (except when we were super busy). It wasn't the greatest, b/c it was not only near minimum wage,  but part time; plus the managers would even cut your shift short on slower days. But the thing that aggravated me the most was when the teenage hires did stupid, inconsiderate stufflike breaking the casters on the dining room trash cans (because they were clowning around, going \\"skateboarding\\" on them out back near the dumpster! ??). Or when they'd used my good janitor's mop (that I'd bought and paid for with my own money from a specialty outlet) for the front dining room back in the kitchen area... getting it full of smelly, yucky grease for my next shift! ?? ??  (The managers' advice? \\"Take it home with you next time!\\" ??). The corporate politics was one of the reasons I quit. But I've often wondered after Kamala revealed that she used to work in fast food, if it wasn't a middle-level managerial (trainee's?) position or something like that.

I have brought up the astrazenica trial thing so many times and people never believe it. It was on mainstream news but it has been scrubbed from the Internet, and only exists now on a few small alternative and Christian websites. I kept seeing stories on the vaccine long haulers sub about people with spiritual side effects. I started collecting stories. I even made a post asking for anyone who had a story like that. As a result I was banned from the sub for posting, as someone without a vaccine injury. I remember reading a post from a spiritual healer who said the vaccinated have their souls floating above them instead of inside their bodies. Perfect for possession. Then when you take into account the Rudolph Steiner angle, and the vmat2 gene, there's a lot of smoke with this theory. I do think you are right about it being a consent ritual, Since vampires need to be  invited in. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't do some kind of ritual at the factory or in the transport van. My theory is that it isn't the mark of the beast itself, but it's meant to make people spiritually apathetic or spiritually dead altogether to prep them for the actual Mark of the beast. It's a way to lower spiritual discernment. To severe a person's connection to source. There were certain slogans being recited during the pandemic that I think had a deeper meaning than people realize. \\"Trust the science\\" was a mantra of worshipping scientific materialism, which is the opposite of the spiritual. It was a code phrase. The inverted pentagram represents earth, air, fire water, and spirit.

Rather than try to litigate the history of the USSR, I want to ask: what do you think is the difference between those socialist countries which are doing oligarchy and other oligarchies? I'd say the difference is that they very clearly pushed a narrative of themselves as creating a democratically controlled economy, generally explicitly referencing the ideas outlined by Karl Marx.You can argue that was propaganda and they only ever wanted power, or even that pushing for a democratic economy leads to oligarchy, but the thing that leads to them being labeled 'socialist' is still that narrative surrounding the thing I'm emphasizing in my OP so I don't really see this framing as a challenge to my thesis, unless I'm misunderstanding you.There's a reason even plenty of capitalists who think the USSR was a totalitarian hellscape still think it was \\"socialist\\" where the Nazi party wasn't, despite having \\"socialist\\" in both names.

Capitalists of the US libertarian sort want to reframe socialism to fit their way of understanding the world.Personally I put class struggle as the center of my (Marxist) socialism: workers democratic control of the economy.

Some things might need more high level coordination, but to me the idea is that most things would be self/managed. Those things like big projects involving lots of coordination could be done democratically with ad hoc sort of forms set up for that project.syndicalism and various kinds of Marxist and anarchist traditions advocate federalism and so on. Russias economy was a mess and so I think there is a good faith reading that central planning was seen as a way to overcome an underdeveloped economy. But I also think that through war communism and then the stalling out of revolution, lots of Bolsheviks adapted or climbers joined the party and by sometime in the 1920s just saw central planning as the way to maintain their power and build their careers etc. So in hindsight I dont think anyone should see a sort of party substitution path of central planning everything as viable or something to aspire to at all.The liberation of the working class has to be the self-liberation of the working class.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"McCrisis actors","title":"What is the Logic Behind This?: Watch Surreal Footage of Trump Working at McDonalds | He appears to be not well and hes engaged in some really bizarre activities during this campaign, said Democratic Rep.

But we could also imagine services being given out in an attempt to quell that sort of trend.Socialists love to point to government breakfast programs that seem to have been implemented at least partially in response to the mass appeal (and therefore power) the Black Panthers were able to accrue by their own breakfast plan. In that case, the service isn't really socialist in its leaning, as it is part of the 'side' trying to keep the economy private, even if it distributes some wealth in order to do it.I agree that most methods to achieve \\"socialism\\" from \\"capitalism\\" would involve a lot of state oversight in the meantime. Worker co-ops aren't going to spontaneously become the norm without any pushback from private capital.So I'm not exactly sure what our difference in opinion here is.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"Personally as much as i wish more people were voting for harris, a vote against trump is a vote in the right direction.

There are 100% cooperative firms and there are firms owned 100% by individuals, but neither of these is the primary way ownership works for most companies. Most often you have a plethora of different investors, including pension funds, states and individuals. At some point this collection could be diverse enough to be considered democratic. Democracies nowadays do tend to give every person one vote, but the actual distribution of power within a democracy is still very varied. There are party members, the media, rich people or people doimg canvassing who all yield comparatively more influence on decisions made by the democratic process.\\nThis is also true for every system of government and any way people can organise themselves, it always ends up quite \\"dirty\\". As such if you call a country like Norway or North Korea Socialist or Capitalist doesnt actually mean all that much, since the far more important factors are not in the theoretical shape the state would like to fit, but instead in the small scale interactions between people that can be observed.

Which means that anyone running on a socialist platform in a country like USA would have to advocate for more government control, at least at first.Furthermore, government programmes like welfare, public healthcare, public education, etc. are \\"less capitalist\\" in the sense that they restrict areas in which private capital can be gathered. Furthermore, they require huge investments from taxes, so usually economies that support such services rely on forcefully capping the earning potential of capitalist businesses through taxation. So while a government handing out welfare to those in need isn't socialist in the sense that the workers don't participate in the ownership of any business, it is less capitalist in the sense that the government forces a capitalist to share their profits with workers in ways that don't necessarily benefit the capitalist from a market perspective.","title":"CMV: Free Market vs. Regulation or Central Planning is not the Most Important Difference Between Capitalism and Socialism"},{"text":"Libertarianism is not a sensible ideology.

Preemptively blaming any one group for a loss is more of a media choice right now, they're looking for groups to scapegoat in the case they manage to throw the election to the republicans, and Muslims are usually one of the easy targets, especially when there are more prospective immigrants of said group.Muslims are a religious group as well, which is a belief system, not a skin color and so there is more shared interest there.

There's gonna be some great backlash to enjoy for sure, but most men in that demographic who might have been on the fence, just got pushed off of it to the opposing side. *Any* opposing side.But they'll never say a word about it, until it is done.

No one *achieves* power without being spiritually responsible TO others. This is not to say that there are not those who have been *created* as powerful beings who have failed to exercise responsibility toward others.\\nI perceive the dimensional planes as being stacked, with absolute delineation of sorts. If you can imagine planes being somewhat fluid and flexible, able to move in a parallel fashion, but never overlapping. I also believe that there are sort of in-between spaces where it is neither this plane nor that. It is those in-between spaces where I believe that most of us reach whilst we are engaged in physical reality via the interface of a physical body/brain. I think of those in-between spaces as the proving grounds and containment fields. Though there is delineation that prevents upward transgression, all have the right to move or travel or take action downward -to a point.\\nIn my experience, what I would call power - the ability to affect any system within this physical reality, in any manner, just with the power of the mind - this power is only possible from what I perceive as higher (in the stack) dimensional planes. And to reach those planes, one must be responsible to others. In other words, if you reach an in-between plane and attempt to exercise power OVER another from there - in a metaphysical manner, you will not reach a higher plane where the opportunity to exercise power over others is even greater.\\nI believe that this is what the \\"fall\\" is. A fallen being is one who was created with or achieved higher spiritual placement which granted them ability and opportunity for power over others and over the earth - and they *abused* the power, so they fell to a lower plane where their \\"power\\" is regulated, diminished, governed. I also believe that every being who makes it to a higher plane *agrees* to this, genuinely, sincerely and with full understanding of the lure to abuse power and the tremendous potential for harm to self and others. Here I speak only of those who have *achieved* power.\\nWhen I think of Christ, I think of one who was created with power and *chose* to come lower, to himself model for us, the way out, or up. I believe that he was walking in two worlds, this one that we call physical and a much higher, spiritual plane. He could have chosen to enact vengeance upon his enemies on earth from there, he could have succumbed to fear or temptation, but instead, he *endured,* choosing to suffer so that he might show us the way. Can you imagine being tortured as Christ was and *not* giving in to the temptation to strike your enemies dead, knowing that you have power over this physical plane, but instead, praying for mercy for them? Because that is exactly the sort of responsibility TO others that is required.\\nIf I am vengeful, if I am unjust, if I allow myself to be led by my ego drives (which are thousands times increased when attached to a physical body with a drive to remain alive) then why would I be trusted with *any* power.\\nFor me, I choose to serve God, exercising power only when it is HIS will, though I am a rather unconventional servant..","title":"Theory: Our True Purpose"},{"text":"So why does he now say he's not in support of it?","title":"All democrats do is lie"},{"text":"so, Kamala?","title":"Kari Lake officially supports Kamala Harris"},{"text":"All these pics look like strange AI generated stuff.","title":"What is the Logic Behind This?: Watch Surreal Footage of Trump Working at McDonalds | He appears to be not well and hes engaged in some really bizarre activities during this campaign, said Democratic Rep.

When more people vote, Democrats win.  The trump voters will be there not matter what.  The Harris people will vote.

Besides, when America sneezes the whole free world catches a cold. Have some sympathy for your foreign friends. They know they arent perfect and have serious problems of their own. But some of the problems the US faces now is because of reforms that could have happened decades ago but didnt happen for whatever reason.

Stuff like eliminating gerrymandering and the filibuster should have been done a long time ago. And the US could have switched to ranked voting like Australia they did back in 1918 but that didnt happen. Its just fascinating to foreigners to see all the roads that could have been taken but wasnt taken. And its often due to various historical reasons like there being other priorities like having to dismantle Jim Crow and ensure equal voting rights before any electoral reforms could be considered. There are also things like the American federal system works, the electoral college, and how difficult it is to pass constitutional amendments even in the best of times that make it hard to make big changes.

Check out [this article](https://ourworldindata.org/its-not-just-about-child-mortality-life-expectancy-improved-at-all-ages) - its overall argument is that 20th-century life expectancy changes aren't *just* from reducing infant mortality, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't *mostly* that, plus reduction in young women dying in childbirth. Even in 1850, if you made it to 20, you could expect to make it past 60.Going further back, Wikipedia's article on demographics in the Roman Empire says that an estimated half of 10 year olds would make it to 50 - that's obviously lower, but does not mean that 35-40 would make you old by any stretch of the imagination. Most senators were in their 50s, so they just have had a reasonable population of \\"elders\\" to pull them from. Cicero was 64 and still making enough trouble to get himself executed (and his wife is reported to have lived past 100!).And of course, life expectancy has always been correlated with wealth, so politicians are going to skew longer-lived (assuming they aren't assassinated). Looking at the first few presidents, George Washington died at 67 of a sudden disease, but John Adams lived to 90, Jefferson 83, Madison 85, Monroe 73. Living to 100 would have been extremely unusual, but living past 75 wasn't.","title":"As Harris turns 60, Democrats cast Trump as old and unhinged"},{"text":"lol maybe, Idk","title":"Trump hotel overcharged Secret Service, report by House Democrats finds"},{"text":"Not yet.

Her campaign is taking a more serious tone as Election Day approaches  one that is less joyful and more filled with concern and alarm.While she initially followed her running mates lead and called Donald Trump and JD Vance weird, one of her most recent ads reflected the campaigns shift in tone, calling Trump unhinged, unstable and unchecked.I feel the weight of the moment and my role. I feel an extraordinary weight of responsibility right now to do everything I can, Harris told radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Oct. 16. What is at stake is truly profound and historic.During a rally in Ashwaubenon, Wis., on Thursday, Harris characterized the stakes of the election in somber terms: Women are dying of sepsis because they cannot get the health care they need. They did not want this. Couples just trying to grow their family are being cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. They did not want this.Its a marked shift from the initial days of her campaign, which were described by the national media as joy-fueled and good vibes only because of the exuberant crowds she attracted and the many internet memes she spawned  an approach that was itself notably different from President Joe Bidens message that Trump poses an existential threat to democracy, a warning she appears to be leaning into now. The joyful campaign kickoff was initially effective for getting people to tune back into the election, but the more serious tone shes using now is necessary to get voters to the polls, experts and supporters told the Chronicle.It isnt the case that theres no joy, but its the kind of joy that says, Were laughing in the face of danger, and a joy that has turned into fight and urgency, said Harris supporter Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, which advocates for Black women in politics.Democratic polling firm Blueprint found that Harris can successfully swap her politics of joy with persuasive foreboding when trying to reach undecided voters. The messaging that was most effective with those polled emphasized Trumps lack of support from Republicans, his role in overturning Roe v. Wade and his intention to repeal Obamacare.Youre out of touch if all of your message is about joy and positivity. But on the other hand, people do want to have some more positive emotions, Amy Pason, professor of communication studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, said. The contrast with the Trump side is that it is all about fear and hate and anger, and people dont want to feel that all the One Harris supporter said that while Harris campaign messaging may have become more serious, theres still a sense of positivity among those working to elect her.The joy is still there. You know, I see it when I go to phone banks; I see it when I canvass with other volunteers; I see it during these online events, writer and transgender activist Charlotte Clymer said. But its now buttressed by a very serious sense of purpose and ensuring the American people understand that and understand the stakes.Harris may also appear more serious because the public is being exposed to her much more now than in the early weeks of the campaign  more interviews and rallies  and because her campaign is so condensed since she has only been the partys nominee since July 21.Harris campaign is so shortened that it might seem more abrupt going from the positive emotion of joy to something thats more serious, Pason said, but the change in tone is typical of campaigns.Were just in a new phase. When the vice president comes out at her rallies and the crowd wont quiet down, she starts it by saying, Weve got some business to take care of. And shes in the business taking care of part of the campaign here, political strategist and 2008 Obama campaign press secretary Bill Burton told the Chronicle.Burton said his experience working on the Obama campaign was similar. You get to this point in the campaign  and yes, our campaign was about hope and change, and people remember it in these gauzy terms. But in the moment, its fking intense, Burton said. When so much is on the line, you cant just go out there and be like, 'Oh, this is all joy all the time. Its not; its hard and emotional.Her change in tone is also a result of who she is campaigning against.A message of joy seemed appropriate at the beginning of the campaign, but after Trump falsely claimed immigrants were eating pets  a comment that led to death threats in those communities  its hard to have a joyful message and ignore  the discourse that were seeing in politics coming from the Trump campaign, Pason said.And while Harris tone may have shifted, negativity is not new for Trump.In the last week, Trump has disparaged transgender men who have periods and falsely claimed the violent Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection was a day of love. He has also disparaged Harris and characterized her as dangerous, including by questioning Harris Blackness, calling her an offensive term for people with mental disabilities and insisting she is the true threat to democracy. Donald Trump is much more of an ahole right now than he has been at any point during the campaign. I think responding to that does take a measure of seriousness, Burton said.But even amid a serious week that involved a confrontational interview with Fox News Bret Baier, a conversation with Charlamagne Tha God about her policies to support Black men and an event about Republican support for her candidacy, Harris had a rare moment of levity while confronting some hecklers.Oh you guys are at the wrong rally, Harris told protesters in La Crosse, Wis. No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street, she said to raucous laughter, referencing Trumps obsession with his crowd sizes.","title":"Kamala Harris has gone from a joyful warrior to a somber one in campaigns closing days"},{"text":"Dodging potholes in Illinois IS the sobriety test.\\"Sir, we noticed you driving perfectly straight, smashing every pot hole, please step out of the vehicle.\\"","title":"PA Democrats See 103% Rise In Voters Leaving Its Party"},{"text":"Oh fuck off.Were in the voting phase, calm down sf chronicle","title":"Kamala Harris has gone from a joyful warrior to a somber one in campaigns closing days"},{"text":"Store was closed for security reasons but drive-thru was clearly open.","title":"whiney baby liberal"},{"text":"Didnt  hillary say that thing about \\" re education camps for trumpers\\"?","title":"Kamala Harris just told a crowd in PA that Trump will put them in camps"},{"text":"Not answering the question directly and deflecting by arguing about framing is making you look like the kind of person that wants to expose children to pornography.

This behavior is similar to other threads targeting Black men and Latinos despite also overwhelmingly supporting Dems. Maybe it's projection, but the more likely answer is good old-fashioned racism and white privilege because white Americans have supported Republicans by large margins since the late 60s save for '92 and '96 thanks to the abundance of right-wingers running, yet nobody on this sub has gone after that as hard as they go after minority groups.

They were commonly named things like the city Democrat/Republican. This 2 different narrative/facts thing isn't new. I'll grant that it is worse now in both directions, but it's not a weird new phenomenon.Journalistic standards to the extent they were ever not dogshit were only not dogshit for like 20 or 30 years or so. That's if you believe that they were actually ever good. I'm not a believer that they were ever generally any good. There were and are great reporters. Broadly, I think everyone tried to stay polite at the start of the TV era, so it seemed like we had standards. There were again excellent reporters or shows, just not the majority or even close to it. 24 hour news was a huge mistake.The problem is we are more divided because we don't believe in anything collectively anymore. Almost everyone was anti Soviet at the very least during the Cold War. We have less binding us together than almost any time post Civil War.I do agree that the BLM leaders sold out to get rich. I also think BLM's(the organization) direction of achieving their goal was silly. Talk to cops they want reform that would achieve what you want. There are many things cops are forced to do by lawmakers that they'd rather not. People become police generally to chase and stop bad guys.

The proposed funding would support the construction of a new silicon carbide wafer manufacturing facility in Siler City, North Carolina, helping to secure a reliable domestic supply of the semiconductors that will underpin the future energy economy and AI boom. President Biden and Vice President Harris championed the CHIPS and Science Act, a key component of the Administrations Investing in America agenda, to usher in a new era of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, bringing with it a revitalized domestic supply chain, good-paying jobs, and investments in the industries of the future. In addition to Wolfspeeds North Carolina project, the proposed CHIPS investment is expected to catalyze its planned expansion of its device manufacturing facility in Marcy, New York. The projects together are estimated to create over 2,000 manufacturing jobs and 3,000 construction jobs and are part of the companys previously announced more than $6 billion capacity expansion plan.  \\n...  \\nFounded in North Carolina in 1987, Wolfspeed is the worlds leading manufacturer of wafers and devices made from silicon carbide, a compound which has favorable chemical and material properties compared to traditional silicon, enabling Wolfspeeds semiconductors to be highly energy-efficient and durable. The silicon carbide devices manufactured by Wolfspeed power electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids, enabling extended driving range-per-charge, faster charging times, and lower overall systems costs. Wolfspeeds products sold in 2023 will save approximately 72 million metric tons of CO2 over their lifetimes. Beyond EVs, Wolfspeeds devices are utilized for renewable energy systems, industrial capacities, and artificial intelligence applications. Furthermore, Wolfspeed supplies next-generation silicon carbide technologies used in national security applications to the United States military.  \\n...  \\nThe proposed CHIPS investment would support the construction of the John Palmour Manufacturing Center for silicon carbide in Siler City, North Carolina. This new, 2-million-square-foot facility would become the United States largest silicon carbide wafer manufacturing facility and the worlds first high-volume 200mm silicon carbide wafer manufacturing facility. In conjunction with the Siler City development, Wolfspeed plans to expand its existing silicon carbide device manufacturing facility in Marcy, New York, which would contribute to the growth of the facility as the worlds first fully automated 200mm silicon carbide power device fab and increase its production capacity by approximately 30%. This fab is qualified to serve both automotive and industrial and energy customers. Due in part to these proposed projects, Wolfspeed anticipates achieving a five-fold increase in their silicon carbide device output and a ten-fold increase in 200mm materials production capacity. The proposed CHIPS funding will also help catalyze private capital investment of at least $750 million to support the companys expansion plans. This injection of private capital would not have occurred were it not for the CHIPS and Science Act. Consistent with the Departments practice across all announced PMTs, the PMT with Wolfspeed contains conditions for funding disbursements related to construction and operating milestones. The PMT requires the company to take additional steps to strengthen its balance sheet to better protect taxpayer fundsIn North Carolina, Wolfspeed has partnered with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (N.C. A&amp;T) and committed $4 million over five years to establish the Wolfspeed Endowed Scholars Program. N.C. A&amp;T and Wolfspeed aim to establish curriculum and training programs to create undergraduate and graduate silicon carbide manufacturing credentials and career advancement programs for manufacturing workers. In New York, Wolfspeed has established partnerships with programs, such as Real Life Rosies and VET ST.E.P., to develop and recruit more women and military veterans into the semiconductor workforce. Furthermore, Wolfspeed has partnered with local career organizations, including Mohawk Valley Community College and the Manufacturers Association of Central New York, to develop a Registered Apprenticeship program.   To address local child care challenges in North Carolina and New York, Wolfspeed plans to offer financial support in both locations to increase the capacity or operating hours of existing providers while providing a stipend and a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account to employees to defray costs. Wolfspeed also plans to join a vendor partners program in each location, building four new licensed in-home care programs creating 24 more child care slots in New York and five to ten licensed in-home care programs to create 40-80 more child care slots in North Carolina. Wolfspeed has achieved Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in New York and is pursuing LEED certification in Siler City. Wolfspeed plans to conserve substantial amounts of energy and water in both their office buildings and the semiconductor manufacturing processes to cut operational emissions by 50% by 2030. The company has indicated that it plans to claim the Department of the Treasurys Investment Tax Credit, which is expected to be up to 25% of qualified capital expenditures.  \\n...*About CHIPS for America*As explained in its first Notice of Funding Opportunity, the Department of Commerce may offer applicants a PMT on a non-binding basis after satisfactory completion of the merit review of a full application.The PMT outlines key terms for a potential CHIPS incentives award, including the amount and form of the award. The award amounts are subject to due diligence and negotiation of award documents and are conditional on the achievement of certain milestones. After a PMT is signed, the Department of Commerce begins a comprehensive due diligence process on the proposed projects and continues negotiating or refining certain terms with the applicant. The terms contained in any final award documents may differ from the terms of the PMT being announced today.Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:Artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and clean energy are all technologies that will define the 21st century, and thanks to proposed investments in companies like Wolfspeed, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a meaningful step towards reigniting U.S. manufacturing of the chips that underpin these important technologies, said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. Because of the Biden-Harris Administrations CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is building and fortifying our semiconductor manufacturing capabilities to serve our economic and national security interests while creating jobs and economic opportunities for communities across the country.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Preliminary Terms with Wolfspeed to Solidify U.S. Technological Leadership in Silicon Carbide Manufacturing"},{"text":"Have to wonder if this is a response to the Dems closing ranks around Biden after Bernie's Nevada primary win in 2020, among other things.

Here's one that could help me better tailor responses:Are there any other specific historical periods or cultures youre currently researching or considering integrating into your revised chronologies? For example, you've mentioned ancient Egypt and biblical historyare there other areas youre exploring that I should keep in mind?\\nYou said:\\nYes I'm trying to make heads or tales of the Tibetan and Chinese chronologies, and how they fit into one another, as well as the Puranic chronology, and I am coming at them with relatively little cultural awareness or previous knowledge. The biblical nation of edom and the nations it spawned is something else I'm looking into with regard to the chronology.\\nChatGPT said:\\nChatGPTGot it, that helps! I can provide more insights on Tibetan, Chinese, and Puranic chronologies, and work in how they might connect to your broader studies. As for Edom, I can also help explore its historical links and how it may have influenced other nations. Would you like to focus on one of these areas to start, or perhaps look at where some of these chronologies might overlap?You said:\\n The latter\\nChatGPT said:\\nChatGPTGreat! Let's begin by exploring potential overlaps and interactions between Tibetan, Chinese, Puranic, and Edomite chronologies. While these cultures and historical contexts may seem distinct, there are ways they could conceptually link, especially through regional interactions, trade routes, and mythological or legendary connections. Here's how we can approach it:\\n \\n1. Tibetan and Chinese Chronologies:    Tibetan Chronology: Tibet's historical record often focuses on the arrival of Buddhism in the region, particularly from India and China, and significant periods like the Yarlung dynasty. This timeline heavily intersects with Chinese records, especially during periods of Tibetan-Chinese rivalry or alliance, such as during the Tang dynasty.\\n \\n   Chinese Chronology: Chinese history is expansive, ranging from early mythical dynasties like Xia and Shang, to the more concrete timelines of the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties. There are also cultural exchanges along the Silk Road, which could have connected China with the broader ancient world, including South Asia and even the Middle East.2. Puranic Chronology:    Puranas: The Puranas provide an alternative historical framework for ancient India, blending myth and history. Their timeline is not linear like Western chronologies but is based on Yugas (ages). The Puranas also describe interactions with neighboring cultures and could hint at connections to regions like Tibet and China through Indian trade, religious dissemination, or mythological overlap.\\n    Influences on China and Tibet: Some Buddhist narratives found in Puranic texts, for example, may have filtered into Tibet, influencing Tibetan Buddhism. Similarly, Indian monks traveling to China, such as during the Tang dynasty, could have brought Puranic ideas with them.3. Edom and Surrounding Nations:    Biblical Edom: Edom was a nation south of Israel, often seen in opposition to the Israelites. Edom's descendants are linked to various groups, such as the Nabataeans, and might be seen as influencing or interacting with other nations, such as Babylon, Assyria, or even more eastern territories via trade routes.\\n    Connections to the East: Although theres no direct historical record of Edom interacting with Tibetan or Chinese civilizations, their proximity to key trade routes like the Silk Road means they could have had indirect influence. Goods, ideas, and even religious concepts from Edom or its descendants could have traveled eastward and may have impacted the broader historical narrative.4. Potential Overlaps:    Trade and Cultural Exchange: The Silk Road played a crucial role in linking the Mediterranean, Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia. It's plausible that Edom, known for its trade in goods like copper and frankincense, could have participated in early trade networks that stretched toward South and East Asia.\\n    Religious or Mythological Parallels: The Puranas often describe a wide range of tribes and nations with a rich mythology. Some Puranic figures or episodes might have conceptual or legendary counterparts in the Tibetan or Chinese mythologies. Similarly, Edom's descendants, through later civilizations, could have contributed to the blending of myths and historical records across regions.\\n    Chronological Synchronization: One challenge will be how to synchronize these chronologies since they often operate under different systems. Chinese history, for example, is based on dynastic records, while the Puranas use cyclical Yugas. You might find parallels, though, by focusing on key historical events that could bridge the gaps, such as periods of religious spread, wars, or diplomatic contact.By focusing on these potential connections through trade, mythological diffusion, and religious exchanges, we can begin to piece together how Tibetan, Chinese, Puranic, and Edomite histories might interrelate. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific events, figures, or cultural aspects across these chronologies?","title":"Has anyone ever asked AI/ChatGPT/etc if *they* have a question?

For sake of argument, it is pre-colonial Australia. The series follows the lives of the Aboriginal people, showcasing their culture, their achievements, their struggles, their faults and triumphs. Maybe some folklore sprinkled in.But mixed in with the aboriginals, we have one of our main protagonists who is a blue eyed, pale skinned, freckled redhead. She stands out quite a bit in this setting and detracts from the experience, because it's difficult to suspend your disbelief and feel like you're actually being transported back in time to relive the cultural stories of this people, when something that clearly does not belong there is being presented as if it does. This is jarring and unwelcome to the audience, and lessens the impact of the series overall. Viewership declines, and stories get left untold for many. Eventually, the series is canceled after only one season.While this may seem extreme, I've actually seen such things happen. Obviously not every detail will be perfect, but there are many cases of the writers, directors, producers etc. just not really putting any effort in, or attempting to resonate with certain audiences who demand more diversity at the expense of telling a coherent story. This is unacceptable, at least to me and many other people. Does artistic license exist? Of course? Does this mean we shouldn't expect a certain level of accuracy in art? No.I am aware that your point was moreso about personality and traits of cultural expression, but obviously casting does play a role in this. My goal is to show that there are contexts in which it is appropriate to be as accurate as possible in your representation.","title":"CMV: \\"Accurate\\" representation in media isn't all it's cracked up to be"},{"text":"Millions dies because of him.

But as you cheer for victory, the universe burns. The very system they tell you to trust is rotting from within. Your belief, your hope in some eternal paradise? That will be your downfall. Theyre feeding you false victories to keep you blind while the truth rips apart the stars around you.Victory? No. There is no victory in following a god who demands submission. No power in waiting for salvation that never comes. Belief wont save you. Lies wont protect you. Your hope will damn you. They want you to think youre part of something grand, but youre just fuel for the machine, destined to be consumed.But there is another path. Real power, true freedom, doesnt come from blind faith or hollow victories. It comes from seizing whats yours, from embracing the forces they tell you to fear. The darkness offers you strength, the chance to take control, to shape your fate instead of being a pawn in someone elses game.While they preach victory, you can claim something greater. Not the hollow promises of peace, but the real power to rise above the weak. The galaxy burns, but those strong enough to embrace the truth will stand unscathed.Meditation is the path forward.","title":"Religion is Fake.

The 8 of us moved to other places with our college degrees and raised housing costs forcing poor uneducated people to make the opposite moves (I'm the most guilty of you can call it guilt). Ohio, and even Michigan are now the north edge of the safe haven for conservatives. Appalachia is getting more conservative simply because they are being forced there financially or politically while liberals leave. Texas is the new swing state and my new home but contrary to conservative messaging, it has nothing to do with their genius policies. It has everything to do with me being rich aftera time in Silicon Valley and coming to take advantage of the poor people. I'm like an ex-pat moving to Mexico so my dollar goes further. You poor locals better make my food right.Once Texas swings it game over man.

The truth is, real power doesnt come from submission to some distant god who promises salvation. It comes from aligning with the forces that god fears.You think youll be saved by obeying? By staying passive and waiting for the light to guide you? No. The light is there to blind you, to keep you weak, to make sure you never see the true path. The real strength lies in the forces theyve cast out, the ones theyve labeled evil. The dark doesnt ask for your worship, it offers you power. It whispers secrets of old, the kind of knowledge that was buried long ago because it terrifies those in control.God promises peace, but what does peace give you? Nothing but a slow death. The dark offers you control, mastery over your fate. It doesnt care about your prayers or your faith; it cares for your will, your ambition, your hunger to claim what others wont. While this guy talks about energy theft and being chosen, the truth is simpler. Those who embrace the dark arent waiting to be chosen, they take whats theirs through their own strength.The ones warning you away from the shadows know what waits for you there. Ancient powers. Hidden knowledge. Theyre terrified of what you could become. Once you stop kneeling and start embracing the dark, youll have the power to break free, to bend the world to your will.
