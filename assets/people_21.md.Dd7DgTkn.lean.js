While Musk has never officially served as vice president or held any government office, some could describe him as a \\"shadow vice-president\\" due to the influence and support he has shown toward Trump in recent years. Heres a breakdown of how this dynamic came about:\\n1. **Early Interactions**: In the early days of Trumps presidency, Musk had a somewhat neutral stance. He initially joined two of Trumps advisory councils but resigned after Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017. Musk distanced himself from the president at that time due to policy differences, especially regarding climate change.\\n2. **Shifting Allegiances**: Over the years, Musks public stance started to shift. As the political climate in the U.S. became more polarized, Musk increasingly embraced populist rhetoric. He also began aligning more with conservative viewpoints on issues like free speech, government regulations, and technology. In the process, Musks statements and actions began to mirror some of Trumps sentiments, particularly in terms of criticizing mainstream media, questioning the legitimacy of certain government policies, and even supporting Trumps stance on certain issues.\\n3. **Public Support**: As Trumps grip on the Republican Party strengthened, Musks support for Trump became more apparent. For instance, in 2020, Musk publicly expressed admiration for Trumps handling of the economy, his direct approach to business, and his unconventional leadership style. Musk has also been an outspoken critic of the political left, something that resonated with Trumps base.\\n4. **Twitter and X**: Perhaps one of the most notable developments in their relationship came when Musk acquired Twitter (now X) in 2022. Musks acquisition of the platform aligned with Trumps preference for unfiltered communication and freedom of speech, a sentiment that mirrored Trumps own approach to social media. Musk reinstated Trumps Twitter account after it had been suspended in 2021, signaling a closer political alignment. In many ways, Musks management of Twitter has been seen as a platform for Trumps ideas and influence to continue, despite his own social media bans.\\n5. **Shared Vision of Disruption**: Both Musk and Trump have positioned themselves as disruptors of the political and economic establishment. Musks ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence, alongside Trumps America First policies and rhetoric, reflect a shared belief in challenging traditional systems. Musks business empire, which includes Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink, represents a high-tech vision for the future, while Trumps political style is focused on shaking up government norms.\\n6. **Influence and Access**: While Musk is not an official member of Trumps inner circle, his influence in both business and political spheres gives him a sort of shadow role. Musk is a major player in industries crucial to Trumps vision of American strength, particularly in terms of manufacturing, space exploration, and technological innovation. This indirect influence has led some to view Musk as a behind-the-scenes ally to Trump, especially when it comes to shaping public discourse, government policy, and public opinion.\\nIn summary, Musk hasnt been Trumps official vice president, but through their shared approach to challenging the status quo and their public alignment on key issues, Musk has become an influential figure within Trumps orbit, thus earning the title of a \\"shadow vice-president\\" in the political landscape.","title":"How Elon Musk became Donald Trumps shadow vice-president"},{"text":"Yeah, youd be surprised how many women (even feminists) have misogyny and rape kinks.","title":"Handmaids Tale soars 400 places to 3rd place in bestsellers after Trump win [+6.3k]"},{"text":"If you think the general populace is aware of all the details of the Paris agreement I'd be seriously impressed.

His supporters are in for a shock about that but they'll probably find an excuse.

It was a bad mistake by Harris not to distance herself as much as she could and say she'd do things differently. Don't talk about the economy or GDP. Talk about prices. Bills.

I have first hand experience that completely contradicts that.Now, Im fully aware that using just my experience is anecdotal and doesnt necessarily represent the entire educated populace accurately. Anyway, I worked for a school district for 13 years in IT as both a computer tech and a network tech. I can say, without a single doubt, that many of those teachers with much higher educations than myself (I only graduated HS), had the absolute least common sense and problem solving abilities Ive ever seen. We in IT always joked that these people seemed to have paid for their higher education with their common sense, reasoning and logic skills. It was mind boggling just how ignorant and incapable many of them were outside of their chosen field of teaching.This is not an insult to teachers, the good ones at least. I had many great teachers in HS that cared, were good people and a couple who I never would have graduated without their support and help. This is strictly about the lack of common sense and logic that plagued many of those with a much higher education than I.

Democrats do not even know what they are talking about, it is laughable 3) Democrats had no message of unity, no message of what will they do to improve the situation, Ya it is true, Covid screwed things up, and democrats and Trump had the country closed down, I do not blame Biden for this outcome, personaly, but I do blame him for having poor economic policy, and increasing the deficit by reckless spending. But Harris did not give perfect reasons on what she will do to improve the situation for every day Americans, instead in that one interview where she said she would not do anything different that doomed her to loose 4) The condensention, and the idea that democrats know better than the average american does, Having Obama speak to Blacks and tell them to vote for Harris is condenscending, having those cringe worthy commercials of women it is ok to vote Harris just lie to your husband, or hey husband did you do the right thing votting Harris for yoru daughter is cringe worthy 5) Just having Harris as a canidate in itself is disgusting. Seriously, she never prooved herself as a competent VP, and lets be honist, her first run for president, she hardly got any votes, never made it to Iowa, Seriously the idea that this looser is perfect for president is a joke6) She never proved that she changed her policy, she never explained that she will be rational, hell her arguement for food prices is by companies gauging prices. evil corporations, not thinking about the economics of what it takes to manufacture the food, transport it, and for the store to sell it.

He had to hide his heritage while serving because he was afraid the other men would be suspicious of him despite being a fiery patriot.He was in the air force as a side gunner on a B-17, was shot down, and spent the last part of the war in a German POW camp.Ive never met anyone since who hated nazis and fascists more than that man did. He hated dictators shown on TV, and men who thought weapons of war made them tough guys. Nazis werent just evil, they were losers in every regard.Guys wearing iron crosses, like bikers and such, really pissed him off something fierce. Hed call them Luftwaffe with a seething hatred in his voice.Ill never forget telling him about my trip to the Eisenhower museum as a kid. He was very proud that he got to meet Eisenhower after being freed. At the time, they displayed a painting taken as spoils of war, which depicted Adolf Hitler standing triumphantly with the German people looking up at him.I described this to him, and had never seen him that angry before. The only time I saw him turn red, and it scared me a bit. He sat me down as calm as he could,  and told me what Hitler was like, what the nazis were like, how they hated our freedom and democracy. He told me how they were the greatest evil the world had ever seen, and the greatest threat to America - not their army, but their ideology. They were everything a patriotic American should reject.It was an American patriots duty to fight fascism in all its forms. That failing to do so is a betrayal of the brave men who gave their lives to protect us from the barbarism of authoritarians.The man wasnt perfect, and was quite prejudiced in his own right towards the marginalized in society, but he understood the value of freedom, even for the people he hated, because he knew first hand the sacrifices that it took to make that possible.I miss him a lot, and I wish he were here still, but maybe its a small mercy that he did not live to see America surrender the freedom so many had suffered and died for.Rest in peace, Bill.

I think it supports what youre saying on a failure to describe reality accurately. I would debate whether we have real Democrats in the sense of this speech, but different argument, Truman btw.Now, we can always rely on the Republicans to help us in an election year, but we cant count on them to do the whole job for us. We have got to go out and do some of it ourselves, if we expect to win.The first rule in my book is that we have to stick by the liberal principles of the Democratic Party. We are not going to get anywhere by trimming or appeasing. And we dont need to try it.The record the Democratic Party has made in the last 20 years is the greatest political asset any party ever had in the history of the world. We would be foolish to throw it away. There is nothing our enemies would like better and nothing that would do more to help them win an election.Ive seen it happen time after time. When the Democratic candidate allows himself to be put on the defensive and starts apologizing for the New Deal and the fair Deal, and says he really doesnt believe in them, he is sure to lose. The people dont want a phony Democrat. If its a choice between a genuine Republican, and a Republican in Democratic clothing, the people will choose the genuine article, every time; that is, they will take a Republican before they will a phony Democrat, and I dont want any phony Democratic candidates in this campaign.But when a Democratic candidate goes out and explains what the New Deal and fair Deal really arewhen he stands up like a man and puts the issues before the peoplethen Democrats can win, even in places where they have never won before. It has been proven time and again.We are getting a lot of suggestions to the effect that we ought to water down our platform and abandon parts of our program.

There isn't a single country on planet Earth that has come up with a progressive tax system that funds every social program wanted by taxing the wealthiest citizens alone. The best any European country has come up with is tax everyone. The top 1% in America pay over 45% of the income tax in America. That's more than the bottom 90% combined.

Even Biden said \\"Hey reelect me and I'll tax the billionaires.\\" Why isn't he doing it now? Why didn't he do it when he came in office?

If people aren't worried about their kids having shoes and being able to eat and getting to work, they might have some mental energy for other stuff. When you aren't in survival mode, social media isn't as addictive. This will help with the propaganda machine.\\n-start building community. Start with like minded people. Do stuff together, fun stuff-you can't ask your neighbor to do something if you don't know your them (I saw someone bring a rock painting table to a queer coffee shop). Then do the stuff like help each other with house projects and car problems. Then learn how to de-program people from propaganda, and how to educate them-from reading to politics to economics. Knowing the audience will matter. Figure out the movable levers and move them, which will start to loosen others. But don't waste energy on anything else. As the movement grows-and as the pain of this administration grows-people will start to look at these activities and reconsider their positions. But until then, know what pieces are movable for who.\\n-once there is community, real resistance can happen. Like dismantling modern concentration camps and standing up to the bullies en masse. Because that's all they are, insecure jerks who don't have the emotional intelligence to have real relationships with people so they substitute with fear and control. Fascism relies on what you are feeling now to keep you down and out. I understand why you are feeling the way you are. But they (narcissists, oligarchs, fascists, authoritarians, etc.) NEED the people for a lot of things: labor, economic factors, adoration, etc. and when we don't give it to them, they crumble. If, and right now it is an if, violence ends up being perpetuated against the resistance, we go underground with the communities we have built, and we protect people. We push back. We actively dismantle the systems they try to use against us. There was opposition to Hitler. There is real opposition to Putin.?\\nNone of this is without risk, but it is possible.","title":"The US has lost faith in the American dream.

If you look at the communities the democratic official states it serves (https://democrats.org/who-we-are/who-we-serve/), there is no explicit mention of men or young men... I mean objectively speaking how are young men suposed to recieve that message as anything other then you don't belong with us.

If everybody starts trying to stockpile material, then the price goes up right now and will take awhile to stabilize even if Trump were to announce today he's not doing the tariffs (which obviously he's not going to do).","title":"Cuban implies Trumps tariff threat having negative impact right now"},{"text":"I see several glimmers. 1. This is the same situation as 2017. Trump had a trifecta then and nothing got done. The Republican's, with a majority in the House, is still a shambles and will remain so because of how tight so many races have been. Plenty of moderates by necessity there, including some that voted to impeach Trump and won again. And as they're preparing for the midterms, it's proof enough that they'll try to win fairly because buy in is still necessary. Besides, elections are run by states, not the federal government. The federal government has reach, but I think you overestimate it. The states proved themself litigious the first term, and are again.2. Trump is a selfish individual. I've no doubt he thinks that this is the last election they'd need to vote in C because this is the last election he's going to stand in again. One recurring theme at his rallies was that this is the end of his movement. There's nothing to pass on, because he doesn't care about passing it on. 3. Trump is a unique individual. The fact that so many people voted for him and left the rest of their ballot blank speaks to something about him that's captivating. He's been a national figure for decades with opinions baked in. He had to carry much of Congress over or near the finish line because they're not him, however hard they try. The others, meanwhile, are wet rags though quite ambitious nonetheless. 4. The first term was incompetent, and there's reason to believe this one will be as well. Some things might be better managed with people like Susie Wiles, but Trump and his orbit lead me to believe that it'll be high on bluster, low on action. The probability of the worst coming to pass is low, but it's something to be prepared for.Comparisons between the US and Russia are overblown. The two countries are fundamentally different. But Americans need problems to be up front and in their face before they make changes; they won't pay attention to history or probability. One lesson for Democrat's to learn is to make the *now* more important than the past or distant future.","title":"The US has lost faith in the American dream.

Busy hospitals pushing c sections or speeding up births instead of letting them happen naturally contributes to those numbers as well, in my opinion.\\nI am not religious in the slightest, and do not believe religion should have any kind of hand in politics or in most medical things. Do I think we should cloning people or killing people? No. Do I think abortion should be legal up to a certain point in the pregnancy? Absolutely!

No.\\nUnfortunately it all seems to be all or nothing for both parties and I think that's what causes the divide.

I think tying border security and immigration reform to marijuana legalization could offer a path forward by framing it as cutting the cartels' influence and cashflow.Hard disagree on the other issues. Abortion is nuanced and so are people's views on it. The vast majority of Democrats are just straight up not saying what you're saying we are, and even then, we can be where most of the country is on abortion and be loud and proud about it: Legal for any reason to viability/for 1st trimester (not the same but roughly interchangable) and illegal with strong exceptions (health of the mother, serious birth defects, etc.) after.Voter ID isn't a real topic. It was made up by Republicans to suppress voters. Most people don't care. Even then, I've always thought it was bizarre that we didn't take the wind out of Republican's sails on the issue by agreeing to voter ID laws, but sending every adult citizen a free ID when they turn 18 and registering them to vote at the same time. Make having it a requirement to graduate high school, drive, buy a car, have credit, open a bank account, etc. In short, a national ID card like other countries have and a proper replacement for SSNs.Trans rights, again, ceding ground to the bigots ain't the play here, chief. People should be free to live as they choose. That's the fundamental promise of America. Education is also desperately needed on this as well, because so much of what you wrote on trans people is flat-out false, even if you believe it. On the sports \\"issue\\" specifically (which isn't an issue because there have been all of 4 trans athletes in all of college sports in the last 20 years across the whole country), again, we don't cede the argument, we change the terrain. Sports leagues should be based on ability, not sex. There are exceptional cis women that can absolutely keep up with men in their sport, but they're not allowed to compete together. That isn't fair and keeps women athletes from really being able to capitalize on their abilities like male athletes are.The \\"woke agenda\\" isn't real. It's a bogeyman made up by right-wing media, the same as voter fraud and the trans athlete \\"controversy\\". The answer to the charge of \\"wokeness\\" is not to abandon the marginalized and attacked communities to their fates at the hands of Republicans. We should instead focus on building our coalition to include those that feel excluded by it, especially white, working class men, by talking about and proposing solutions to their issues just like we do other pieces of our coalition. Suicide prevention, mental health care, the loneliness crisis, offering an alternative to toxic masculinity, expanding union size and power, fair wages for fair work, etc. are all issues that hit other demographics too but are primarily felt by white men. People attack the \\"woke agenda\\" and \\"wokeness\\" because they aren't secure in themselves- financially, mentally, socially, etc. Ceding on the issues won't solve that and will get many marginalized people killed. Helping them solve their problems will.Fundamentally, the article linked in OP's post is correct. The media- right-wing media especially- is the single largest reason we lost this election, right up there with the global backlash to inflation against incumbent parties. Misinformation and lies are rampant and we cannot possibly debunk them all because they come too fast. We need a real focus on media literacy in education, to teach kids how to recognize misinfo when they see it. Ideally, we'd do that on a federal level, but we're not in control there.

Notable instances include:Sanctuary Cities: In April 2020, Trump threatened to withhold coronavirus aid from states and cities that maintained \\"sanctuary\\" policies, which limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. He stated, \\"If it's COVID-related, I guess we can look at it, but we're not looking to do that.\\" \\nVOXMail-In Voting: In May 2020, Trump warned that he might withhold funding from states like Michigan and Nevada over their decisions to expand mail-in voting during the pandemic, alleging, without evidence, that such measures could lead to voter fraud. \\nPOLITIFACTWhile these threats were made publicly, the actual implementation of withholding funds is complex and subject to legal and political challenges. The federal government's ability to withhold congressionally approved funds is limited, and such actions often face scrutiny and potential legal obstacles.In summary, President Trump did threaten to withhold COVID-19 relief funding from certain cities and states based on their policies, but the extent to which these threats were carried out is less clear and would have been constrained by legal and procedural factors.\\"","title":"FEMA employee removed from role after telling relief team to skip houses with Trump signs after Florida hurricane"},{"text":"He still seems burdened by what has been.","title":"Iowa pediatrician tells Trump supporter 'I hope you lose your kid in a school shooting'"},{"text":"Ok well you can keep on dooming then with the rest of the dysphoric dorks while the majority of the country can now refocus on putting in work and getting us back on track to being the greatest country on this planet.","title":"A message to the 40 million actual Trump supporters..."},{"text":"One of my friends discovered her Democrat husband voted for Trump.

In the general store they had coffee and Cokes, and hard boiled eggs and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for $1.75, bologna sandwiches for $1.50, and they also had Tamarind soda and popular Latin snacks.

First, the founding fathers warned us against party loyalty. We shouldn't wear the title of our vote, mostly because the party's of the past don't reflect the party's we see today and likely won't reflect the parties of tomorrow. My views are conservative, and I've voted for democrats in the past and would have voted for RFK this time around but gave my vote to trump when he endorsed him. As far as the sexual accusations against trump. No one has ever made any accusations that were concrete enough for criminal court to even consider. He was found liable in civil court, which doesn't need a unanimous vote from a jury, nor does it require any physical evidence to be presented in the trial. A lot of people like to use this as \\"proof,\\" but the woman in question endorsed trump as president immediately after, which makes people question an already questionable accusation. As for epstein. He bunped shoulders with a lot of wealthy people. He was kicked out of maralago by trump for making advancements towards a guests daughter, and the two never appeared again publicly after that, nor was he invited to any public events held by trump so it's unlikely they had any kind of relationship beyond just knowing each other. I don't say any of this out of an ultimate defense of trump, though. If it's uncovered that he's been up to funny business, he needs to be in the same boat as the rest of them. I don't think it's a coincidence, though, that almost all the accusations against him came after he announced that he was running for president, and all came from liberal states. While I don't think he's the best example of how a man should carry himself ,his behavior isn't repulsive. He acts like most guys do, and he's very open about that and wears it on his sleeve. It would be easier to believe he's a manipulative liar if he wasn't so brutally honest and open about so much stuff. He admitted to taking advantage of tax loopholes and about over evaluating his property when he borrowed on it...He didn't even deny that he said \\"grab her by the p*ssy\\"...he just pointed out that sometimes guys say stupid shit to each other when they're in private, and we do ??","title":"I did vote for trump, but I have questions"},{"text":"PA still has a blue governor and a slim dem majority in the legislature","title":"How blue states are plotting to thwart Trump"},{"text":"Because Bush was part of the political establishment","title":"Why Isnt Bush Hated as Much as Trump?"},{"text":"I've been asking this for the last four years.

I do think hes done a good job going into traditionally conservative spaces and holding his own, I do worry that since were prone to people believing republican messaging against identity politics, being openly gay may hurt him. And, for some reason, people are more apt to believe that dems with higher education at prestigious universities are seen as elites who look down on you, so I can see them arguing that against him. But agreed, he was my choice over Kamala back in 2020 because he was well spoken and made me more excited as a voter.I dont disagree that its been an issue for decades and we just ran people who happen to overcome their approach-Im 32 so i havent been actively engaged in politics for that long. I got really lucky going through my teens and early 20s under Obama- it wasnt something I had to think about much. Where we went wrong in this past decade Ive been more engaged,is not running Bernie in 2016. Weve been in a social atmosphere that has favored populous movements, and I think a lot of people who were excited about trump had similar sentiments about Bernie (I cant square the circle that is the chasm between their preferred policy and how the same people could possibly favor both, but people dont really pay attention to policy cause they dont understand it) im a more moderate voter, so Bernies policies were never my first choice, but I trust him as a person. Helps that I grew up in vt I guess, but I think their takeaway from that movement was all wrong after he won back in 2016, and that was only furthered when we ran Biden and won purely on reactionary votes after people realized what a trump admin really meant. I guess 4 years is long enough for voters to forget, but I wish dnc would start playing the long game like the rnc has.

Let's figure out how to tell the average American the truth:\\"Massive tax cuts for billionaires generally conflict with traditional conservative values of fiscal responsibility and fair market competition. While presented as economic stimulus, these cuts often increase the national debt and shift the tax burden to the middle class. Average Americans end up facing reduced public services, higher local taxes, and increased costs for basics like education and healthcare. This goes against core conservative principles of balanced budgets, community investment, and equal opportunity. True conservative values typically support broad-based tax relief that helps working families and small businesses, while maintaining essential services and fiscal responsibility. Instead of benefiting the economy as claimed, large tax cuts for billionaires often create unfair market advantages, hurt local communities, and force state and local governments to either raise taxes or cut important services to make up for lost revenue. This approach ultimately weakens the middle class, which conservatives traditionally view as the backbone of American society and economic growth.\\"I aligned this statement with conservative values as that seems to be the basic voting block that brought the R's back .

I DNGAF how many people complain about their feelings being hurt and then spite voting anymore. The easy answer is inflation, but the case for this as the primary driver, materially rather than rhetorically, also has some holes. The first is that inflation has drastically decreased, and has been decreasing consistently since early in the Biden presidency.The problem wasn't general inflation, it was inflation of specific goods whose prices going up was an immediate and tangible sort of thing relative to abstract economic stuff.The \\"my gas and eggs price went up, better vote for a fascist\\" thing is real.\\n I propose a different explanation than inflation qua inflation: the Covid welfare state and its collapse. The massive, almost overnight expansion of the social safety net and its rapid, almost overnight rollback are materially one of the biggest policy changes in American history. For a brief period, and for the first time in history, Americans had a robust safety net: strong protections for workers and tenants, extremely generous unemployment benefits, rent control and direct cash transfers from the American government.This is a fair point. Getting helicopter money especially is one of those very immediate things voters remember. One of the best things Biden could have done is just do something very tangible for people near the end of the election. Dems kept reassuring people of the long term, but they didn't buy it and I don't see that changing. And why did most Americans vote for someone they believe will harm the country but help their own pocketbooks? The answer is the ongoing decimation of working class institutions and civil society, started by neoliberalism, accelerated by the rise of the internet as a medium of interaction and put into overdrive during the isolation of Covid. The vehicles for building solidarity with others and for caring about strangers have been decimated. In crass terms, people have become more selfish.Agree.","title":"None of the conventional explanations for Trumps victory stand up to scrutiny"},{"text":"I appreciate the ideological consistency, even if I dont agree with it.

Thats what stopped him during his first term, except many of them have been voted out of office since then. Some moderate republicans that Ive spoken to say oh he isnt going to actually do that. There are smart people advising him that wont let him any time I bring up something absolutely horrible that he has said or promised, but its truly impossible to tell how much power he is actually going to have. Theres two ways this could go:At the absolute best its a repeat of his first term: he doesnt get much done besides tax cuts, its chaos in his cabinet, congress is divided and doesnt get anything done, we see an increase in hate crimes and violence, and we pray that there isnt another pandemic.At the absolute worst we may see immigrants being put into camps, which may lead the way to other enemies of his being put into camps too: journalists, politicians who oppose him, and eventually other minorities or anyone who disagrees with him. We could also see the war in Ukraine ending with them being forced to cede their land to Russia, which may provoke Russia to start trying to take over more of Europe. Similarly we may see China start a war with Taiwan, Israel expand their war and start invading Lebanon and Iran (if not more) and maybe even North and South Korea breaking their armistice, possibly at the hands of other countries involving them in different wars. If this does break out into a World War III level event then Trump may try to use the fact that its wartime as an excuse to stay in power for a third term, and America turns into a modern day Nazi Germany.\\nObviously both of these cases are very extreme, and itll probably be somewhere in between, but Id bet money on the fact that his second term will be much worse than his first, and he will solidify himself as the single worst American president (twice if you count Trump 45 and Trump 47 separately)","title":"Biden vows to make every day count before leaving White House to Trump"},{"text":"Youre welcome!

I would ask and would be eager to hear what would work?I think I've said this on most posts. I may be talking a lot of nonsense, and I'm not smart enough to know it. I wouldn't argue with that. But my intentions are pure. So I'll lay down a bit of my, possibly misguided, thought process.Let's say it doesn't do anything other than unite a bunch of anti Trumpers together in a way that, let's say hypothetically, the Republicans did. Let's pretend they called themselves the Tea Party. It was easier for them. They unified at church at local bingo at the VFW at Red hat society or city functions. We have proved that doesn't work for us. We, lets be generous and say people like me (under 50/60, trying to make ends meet, that don't own a home or will ever have a pension) have 5 friends. We agree mostly on politics and we go to clubs or bars or parties or to work and bed. These places do not lend themselves to political conversation. This gives us a cause, a movement, an action, and a town square.Look at O.W. that movement started so strong, but it got divided. They split up because they didn't agree on that one link. They didn't have one main end goal. Essentially, they didn't have a boogeyman. What's the last thing you should do in a horror movie (besides have sex)? Split up. My town doesn't have the same fights as your town but we know regardless of whether it's women's rights, the economy or how much your town should spend on Christmas lights, we agree we vote against the Trumper.That's one, and for all I know, it might be a shit one, but I'm willing to learn. Let's say it causes deflation by shear luck. Let's say it startles the higher-ups. Let's say it reminds them that we still have power no matter who is in office. Let's say it does absolutely nothing like you say, then you saved some money. That's what I'm typing on my phone for now. I haven't typed this much since college (or when I wrote Dr Who fanfiction).","title":"Can we stop buying everything but food now?"},{"text":"Theres a video of Trump himself saying it.

This year, it invested heavily in raising similar alarms that voting would again be compromised  only for those claims to evaporate as returns came in.The narrative twist emerging in the wake of Election Day shows how the movement is continuing to sow doubt about the voting process even after their preferred candidate won. The new claims center on comparing popular vote totals in 2020 and 2024: Four years ago, Joe Biden received around 81 million votes; as of Friday afternoon Harris's total stood at 69 million, according to the Associated Press.Election deniers have framed the difference as \\"missing\\" Democratic ballots that validate their suspicions about cheating in 2020. Some recirculated disproven theories about late-night ballot \\"dumps\\" that resulted in states that had early leads for Trump in 2020 shift to Biden as more votes were counted.There are a couple straightforward reasons for the gap between Harris's and Biden's totals. First of all, votes are still being tallied, including in the most populous state, California.\\"Most people just don't really understand how election administration and the tabulation of election results actually works in this country,\\" said Kathy Boockvar, who oversaw elections in 2020 in Pennsylvania as its secretary of the commonwealth. \\"And that of course leads, unfortunately, to susceptibility to conspiracy theories and false information.\\"...Numerous investigations and audits, often led by Republicans, were conducted after the 2020 election and no evidence of widespread fraud was discovered. Those checks will continue for the 2024 election over the coming weeks....On Nov. 7, Cleta Mitchell, an influential Republican election attorney who was at the center of Trump's failed attempts to overturn the 2020 election and has become a pivotal figure in the right-wing \\"election integrity\\" movement, weighed in with a post noting not just the difference between Biden and Harris' vote totals, but also the change in Trump's votes.\\"Where did 20 million votes go between 2020 and 2024? 15 million for Biden, 5 million for Trump. Who believes Trump received 5 million fewer votes in 2024?\\" she asked.Kate Starbird, a UW professor and co-founder of the Center for an Informed Public, said the dynamic reflects how figures like Mitchell have built their brands on these claims.\\"There are folks that are making a living right now on talking about election fraud,\\" said Starbird. \\"2024 isn't going to give them much material for that, because it's not going to advance their political goals.\\"\\"So they may be replaying 2020 and and trying to bring the events of Election Day 2024 and some of the outcomes into those conspiracy theories about 2020,\\" said Starbird.At this point, it's pretty clear that those still pushing 2020 election fraud claims in 2024 are doing so purely for clout and to further muddy the waters for elections going forward. This should not be acceptable behavior by anyone, least of all public representatives and members of the news media, and yet we're still dealing with this now.","title":"2020s debunked election fraud claims are coming back due to Trumps 2024 victory"},{"text":"Not really..

It's not totally uncommon to speak badly of straight white men.  A lot of these young male voters grew up seeing the country try so hard to bring up women and minorities, that I could see where they will feel like they've been left behind.  On top of this, the right has portrayed themselves as \\"manly\\" men which a lot of men and young men want to be identified with.  I enjoy being manly.  When I fix something around the house, I let out the deep \\"oh oh oh\\" that you'd see Tim Allen do in Home Improvement. What I'll say sets me apart from a lot of the right, is that I understand manliness is also uplifting those around you and helping those who need it when you are able to. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion.  I still want to reiterate, I am 100% for the uplifting of women and minorities and trying to correct the lack of inclusion we've seen in the past.  I've seen first hand little girls of color who were sad because they weren't one of the \\"pretty white girls\\" that they'd see on TV and movies.

If my memory serves 2016 Bernie did not take the lost to Hillary well. 2020 Bernie took lost to biden really well, that could be due to Biden being the few in the DNC that respected Bernie and I think he knew at that point beating Trump was more important.Part of the reason why Bernie clashes with the rest of the democratic party is his stubbornness to his ideals, which is both his greatest strength and greatest flaw.Left wing Bernie voter here ??

For example, the mass deportations will collapse our economy IF it can even be achieved. The amount of time, money, logistics, etc needed to pull that off is staggering.We are a divided nation and the ugliness is just beginning. Trump supporters are rude, divisive, antagonistic, vengeful. And now they are coming out of the woodwork.

Sure some biz tax breaks and blah blah working class but to think the average voter is going to connect the dots on that is just apparently a bridge too far.  We are dealing with an overwhelming majority that thinks immigrants are the issue, because that is easy to point to ( even though untrue) and say well this class of people over here is why you are suffering.  \\n- why did we put forward a candidate that was unviable ?  You don't miss out on 12 or 15 million votes and not see that internally BEFORE you start.  There are ways to move farther to the left but closing your eyes and hoping the vast majority can see what's going on is just frankly stupid.  As much as I want to say this isn't the problem it is, for whatever reason a female candidate is not well received.  I don't like this, I think it shouldn't be the case but it is, what can we do differently to make it be accepted?

Whoever comes next needs to get in their face on things.  We just allowed him to broadcast messages of stupidity without challenging them (see tariffs) why couldn't they ask them how it works ?

Maurice Frederick Strong, fossil-fuel magnate, was the founding executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_StrongMaurice Strong was no stranger to skepticism and criticism as a result of his lifelong involvement in the oil industry, juxtaposed with his heavy ties to the environmental issues. Some[who?] wonder why an \\"oilman\\" would be chosen to take on such coveted and respected environmental positions.  He served as a commissioner of the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1986 and was unironically recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a leader in the international environmental movement.https://spectator.org/rockefeller-dream-the-truth-behind-climate-change/In both cases the dire warnings were just useful lies, as the Club of Rome openly admitted in 1991 [in a book titled The First Global Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/FIRST-GLOBAL-REVOLUTION-Alexander-King/dp/0679738258), co-authored by co-founder Alexander King.  In the intro to Part II, he quoted French futurist Gaston Berger: We must no longer wait for tomorrow; it has to be invented. So invent they did: King noted that the end of the Cold War resulted in the sudden absence of traditional enemies against which support for global government could be justified. He wrote, In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that  the threat of global warming  would fit the bill.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/maurice-strong-an-appreciation/He was a great visionary, always ahead of our times in his thinking. He was my mentor since the creation of the Forum: a great friend; an indispensable advisor; and, for many years, a member of our Foundation Board. Without him, the Forum would not have achieved its present significance.-Klaus Schwabhttps://nationalpost.com/opinion/peter-foster-the-man-who-shaped-the-climate-agenda-in-paris-maurice-strong-leaves-a-complicated-legacyStrong, who died at the age of 86, has been called the man who 'invented the environment. Peter Foster says he was also a man of myriad contradictions who loved powerhttps://www.fdd.org/analysis/2007/02/06/at-the-united-nations-the-curious-career-of-maurice-strong/ Officially, Strong cut his ties to the U.N. Secretariat almost two years ago, as federal investigators homed in on the discovery that back in 1997, while serving as a top adviser to then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he took a check for almost $1 million that was bankrolled by Saddam Husseins U.N.-sanctioned regime. The check was delivered by a South Korean businessman, Tongsun Park, who was convicted last summer in New York Federal Court of conspiring to bribe U.N. officials on behalf of Baghdad. Strong denied any wrongdoing and said he would step aside from his U.N. envoy post until the matter was cleared up.Since then, Strong has receded, as he often does, into the shadows. He is currently spending most of his time in China. His name flickered recently through the speaker lineup for a gala dinner for clean technologies in San Francisco, but the organizers say he then canceled because he has so much going on in China.China is a special place for Strong, a self-declared, life-long socialist. It is the burial place of a woman said to be one of his relatives, the famous pro-communist American journalist Anna Louise Strong, a vociferous supporter of Lenin and Stalin until the mid-30s, and a strong booster of Mao Zedongs China. Maurice Strongs presence in Beijing, however, raises awkward questions: For one thing, China, while one of the worlds biggest producers of industrial pollution, has been profiting from the trading of carbon emissions credits C thanks to heavily politicized U.N.-backed environmental deals engineered by Strong in the 1990s.Strong has refused to answer questions from FOX News about the nature of his business in China, though he has been linked in press reports to planned attempts to market Chinese-made automobiles in North America, and a spokesman for the U.S.-based firm that had invited him to speak in San Francisco, Cleantech Venture Network, says he has recently been instrumental in helping them set up a joint venture in Beijing. Strongs assistant in Beijing did confirm by e-mail that he has an office in a Chinese government-hosted diplomatic compound, thanks to many continuing relationships arising from his career including 40 years of active relationships in China.And from China, Strong has to this day maintained a network of personal and official connections within the U.N. system that he has long used to spin his own vast web of non-governmental organizations, business associates and ties to global glitterati. Within that web, Strong has developed a distinctive pattern over the years of helping to set up taxpayer-funded public bureaucracies, both outside and within the U.N., which he then taps for funding and contacts when he moves on to other projects.","title":"Trump prepares withdrawing from Paris climate agreement, NYT reports"},{"text":"Exactly.

Some excerpts as a tldr:\\"Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt. The result is a self-fulfilling prophecyOver 20 years, an industry arose to cater to the smug style. It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show, the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were, before anything else, stupid. The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them.So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further. They will choose the smug style.It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them. What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for?...Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort their own impotence by shouting, \\"Idiots!\\" again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.\\"I do recommend reading through the whole article, or at least what looks like the important bits.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Of course we are.

Then Hillary would run again in 2016 and the Dems thought they would have another 8 years of power. They were wrong.Trump threw a monkey wrench into their plan for 16 years of rule, hence, the libs were so mad and created a slander campaign at Trump out of their asses. Obama, Hillary, and Kamala are all diversity hires. I did not know who the f Obama was prior to 2007. I heard him in an episode of 30 Rock and that he was a Black guy and was a Senator repping Illinois. Then all the Facebook hoopla from Millennials to vote for Obama because he happens to be Black. Gee, we can see that. What else can he offer?I wouldnt go far to say Hillary was a diversity hire. She was the former First Lady, Senator for New York, and Secretary of State. But I think people wanted Trump to run because they knew he never stood a chance against Hillary. While Sarah Palin was a diversity hire for the GOP to counter the diversity hire of Obama in 2008. Then Kamala was a diversity hire for Biden after they debated in 2019 and Kamala called out Bidens connections to China and the KKK. Then they kissed and made up and became running mates.https://preview.redd.it/muxw1tlkgwzd1.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=336503d6a69eeabdbc3a2827a02e74d2c490608eFor about a century from Hollywood, we were brainwashed to believe in the WHITE MALE hero. The WHITE MALE protagonist to always save the day. Superman, Batman, Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, and so on. The great white hope. For the last 8 years, Hollywood is now trying to vilify WHITE MALES by emasculating them. See Dial of Destiny or Daemon Targaryen in Season 2 of House of the Dragon going from masculine and war hero into a soy boy in Luigis Mansion. Not even George W. Bush, the previous Republican President, received this much media backlash the way Trump receives. Democrats and Hollywoods downfall goes hand-in-hand as theyre holding hands ready to jump off the cliff together.Hollywood now wants us to root for the female or the person of color while trying to make us hate white guys because being macho is mean. Being masculine is toxic. Being a man means misogynistic. It started with the #metoo movement in 2017 and then led to DEI WOKEness thanks to George Floyd and BLM. Its like, hey, please love Rey Skywalker! Shes cooler than Kylo Ren! Please love Galadriel in The Rings of Power! That Mary Sue and Karen? Please enjoy the repressed lesbianism between Alicent and Rhaenyra. And being queer is so cool! Accept and accept or we will call you whatever -ists or a homophobe!! ??And if we reject their woke nonsense, diversity hires like Moses Ingram and Amandla Stenberg will attack us and call us racists and sexists. We are tired of the Hollywood radicals from the Left telling us who to vote for and who to like. They will suppress or censor our opinions if we dont match theirs. They feel self-entitled if we dont approve what they offer which is mostly race-baiting and identity politics. Trump basically defeated two diversity hires from the Democrats. And the one time he supposedly lost, he lost to a white guy, the very thing Hollywood has tried to destroy during the last 8 years by vilifying them to make the female or POC look better.What adds even more irony is Trump increased his minority voters. Even the minorities and women got sick of Hollywoods bullshit. Politics should be focused on the actual issues, not a bunch of name-calling. Democrats used to be for the working class but they ignored them for the Hollywood elites so they can be endorsed by them. The more negative the media will continue to cover Trump instead of supporting him while they will hypocritically preach ACCEPTANCE, DIVERSITY, EQUITY, and INCLUSION, the more the GOPs will continue to stay in power because you can longer fool us with your HATE speech towards Trump.Its called the UNITED States of America,.

Stick with me for a moment, as I think all your propositions are correct, but you're missing one all-important proposition 5--that the voters were in fact conditioned to accept a false image of reality (a \\"hyperreality\\") that led them to vote against their own interests in our actual reality of facts and empirical truths.You're quite right about Proposition 1: Exit polling (and, indeed, pre-election polling) clearly indicated that a vast majority of voters--on both sides, but especially within the Trump camp--were concerned about the economy and immigration, not more esoteric themes like DEI or whether Harris should have won a primary first or whether SCOTUS justices should support abortion, etc. Those topics matter to the \\"very online\\" crowd, but not to the average unthinking/know-nothing voter. That means that propositions 2, 3, and 4 are generally accurate. Obviously if most voters cared mostly about the economy and immigration, and opted for Trump (2), Dems failed to message their proposals (3), build a case for a transactional vote in their favor, or consider ways to build a winning coalition (4).But here's the problem: The voters--the transactional voters who could have served as a Democratic coalition--are dead wrong. One might even call them stupid and idiotic and, at least by proxy, \\"racist and sexist\\" by virtue of supporting one even if the economy is chief on their mind.Why? Because, as a matter of *empirical fact*, Biden's record--which was basically Harris' platform--was better on these two core issues.Fact: The U.S. economy, in its fundamentals, is basically the strongest it's ever been by nearly all key indicators. Unemployment is at historic lows nationwide. Inflation is largely gone, and wasn't even Biden's fault in the first place (the burst of inflation was primarily a function of Trump and covid-era policies). The stock market is at record highs. The average American is better off than ever. And it goes further than that--Trump's proposed economic policies, insofar as they are anything more than \\"the concept of a plan,\\" are manifestly terrible for economic growth and prosperity. Tariffs, mass deportations, more tax cuts for the wealthy, etc., are *bad*, for everyone but especially the middle and working classes.Fact: Trump singlehandedly and cynically torched a bipartisan immigration bill that would have addressed the immigration crisis. Biden would have signed it. The absurdity of this situation didn't receive half the coverage it deserved, and Trump should have been shunted into the political wilderness forever as a result. But he skated away, as he always does. The voters were wrong. They drank all the misinformation kool aid. How are the Dems supposed to compete with this level of stupidity and denial of empirical fact?","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Silver lining: Czech Republic, where abortion is legal, is a couple hours by train.

Especially towards their opposition, but even just how they seem to treat their family and the people around them professionally.Trump seems to be a world class asshole who revels in that fact. It's a tiny and meaningless example, but he seemed to always put little antagonistic statements about \\"his haters\\" into official holiday statements.  The guy can't even just wish all Americans a Merry Christmas or whatever without being intentionally divisive.  This kind of attitude and behavior coming from a party that had personally hated on Obama for 8 years previously engenders a similar response back from Democrats towards Trump.Trump also spent years before his first successful political campaign developing a following by continually harassing Obama about his birth certificate on twitter, then launched his 2016 campaign with the infamous \\"rapists and murderers\\" rhetoric.  Contrast Trump against the early perception that Bush was a genuinely nice person who was just a bit of a goofy dumb guy who'd get chuckled at for grammatical mistakes and messing up common sayings (bush-isms). However, people still generally thought Bush was an earnest person who wanted to do good for all Americans, (even his opposition), in a period of time where that still seemed to matter to the electorate. Especially after 9/11 when the country was temporarily united in a determined resolve to kill anyone associated with the attacks and crush anything that got in the way of that. As time went on that attitude generally stuck even as he made mistakes and the political divisions opened back up.  People still generally thought that he cared, but didn't know all of the answers and wasn't great at negotiating the competing forces in the country and within his own party.  The perception stuck around over time that he was just a kind of figurehead that was manipulated by people like Cheney, the neocons in the administration, and the MIC. I don't think Democrats look back at the Bush years as a bastion of great leadership and governance, they just see it as how far we've fallen. That Bush somehow looks good compared to Trump for doing the bare minimum of attempting to act like a decent human being.he's also long retired so there's less reason to hate him now compared to the current President Elect anyway.","title":"Why Isnt Bush Hated as Much as Trump?"},{"text":"Whitmer already has two times.

Historically, Democratic policies have been better, but the average voter doesn't know that and would struggle to understand it if tol, because it's all about indirect control of the economy (e.g. regulation)*. The Republican message of \\"we'll cut taxes, deregulate industries so they hire more people, and throw out the immigrants taking your jobs\\" is much easier to believe it will make your life easier financially, even if it's not actually a good overall economic approach and doesn't actually improve wages.*I think the biggest misunderstanding is that inflation is not the same as prices, and prices going down (deflation) will basically never happen. So while the Biden administration fixed serious inflation, the less-informed population think \\"food is still at those raised prices, inflation is still a problem\\" TBF, food prices are still very reasonable to be concerned about, but nominal prices going back down was basically never an option without extreme regulation (which both parties but especially Republicans would prevent). What's actually happened is they've gone from rapidly rising to more stable, and (not necessarily for everyone, but overall) pay has been rising faster, so food is *effectively* becoming cheaper again. That's about the best-case realistic scenario under capitalism.

Democrats ALWAYS accuse people of doing exactly what THEY are doing. Read \\"Rules for Radicals\\" by Saul Alinsky. Thats their playbook, and Hillary Clinton wrote her thesis on that book. She worshiped Alinsky, you can easily find that out online. Part of their game plan is to accuse opposition of abhorrent things and even if it isnt true, it plants a seed in their minds. They have obsessively done this to DJT from day one. Where is all that Russian collusion that dominated the news ALL DAY EVERY DAY for an entire YEAR, lol. Research who was ACTUALLY colluding with Russia.....it was THEM! LOL. All of a sudden females were coming out of the woodwork accusing him of assault. This was and is just another favorite tactic that they use because it works. They dont talk about the fact that DJT is a germophobe and one of the last people on earth he would get with is Stormy Daniels, who by the way admitted she was lying, you can look that up too. If you look way back at various news and interviews he did, you can understand who he is. He is a workoholic who did many many things for low income people of all races, and never filmed himself doing that. He never drank alcohol, did drugs or smoked. Look at the women he dated or was married to and thats what he is attracted to. They claim he is a misogynist every 5 minutes which is another tactic they used but all you have to do is look up all the women in high positions he has hired in his company over DECADES. He just hired the first female presidential chief of staff LOL. I could go on and on but as in everything, you should always look at BOTH sides to see who is lying.   As for Epstein, thousands of people were around him for one reason or another, it doesnt mean ALL of them are pedos, the same thing with Diddy.

Approaching this with curiosity and non-judgment, it became pretty clear to me that there were several things that were true to them and conclusions they were arriving at through what I perceived to be a convoluted kind of logic. 1. *All politicians lie*. They believe fundamentally that all politicians are serial liars, including Trump (e.g., you cant take him literally, hes never going to actually do that). But heres the rub: they can at least figure Trump out. Its clear hes a bullshitter, they know it, but hes batting for their team. Harris, on the other hand, struck them as a true politicianone who will say whatever is necessary to win votes, regardless of the lie. Clinton was similar in their eyes, and yes, you cant divorce the fact that theyre also women. 2. *Trump is more authentic*. He says it like it is even if the like it is is complete, nonsensical bullshit. They know it, but again, at least they can parse it. Spend any time in rural America, and youll see bullshitting opinions is the great American pastime. And, they get that. The mental leap they make from here though is that this all actually makes Trump the more authentic candidate. Basically, we dont know exactly how Kamala is lying to us but we know she is whereas the other guy is bullshitting us but were used to that kind of lying (look at how they excuse anything crazy Trump says with he didnt mean it that way or youre taking him out of context). Then wrap all this in overt and unconscious biases and you have a recipe for how to arrive at who is trustworthy. 3. In this set of mental gymnastics, Trump is seen as the more trustworthy candidate, stemming from their perception of his authenticity. Yeah, they know hes bullshitting them, but their intuition has led them to believe they understand Trumps intent (e.g., Make America Great Again) so the semantics of whether or not he is actually being truthful about anything specific is of little concern. They trust him because hes authentic, and they cant (or dont want to put in the effort to) parse where a candidate like Harris might be telling the truth versus lying. So, they dismiss it all and never look back. Theyve been spurned by politicians in the past so its just easier to go with the guy they see as authentic. Couple all this with the most massive disinformation campaign Ive ever seen on X and other social media and you have the recipe for Trump getting elected. It all feels very logical to them, and they cant understand why we dont see it like they do. In their world, they have no clue why anyone would vote for Kamala Harris and why the left sees her as more trustworthy than Donald Trump (ergo, the left must just be batshit crazy!) They are two completely different heuristics, and the result of one of them has almost certainly set fire to American democracy.

And despite all of this, she failed spectacularly in ways that candidates in recent elections did not.You shouldn't look at this as an indictment of leftist policies.

Price increases will be their fault even if its not because of the tariffs or taking control of the Fed rate like Project 2025 proposes. Trump will put an end to the nonexistent issue of furries and litter boxes in schools (not Vance because Trump does not share credit).
