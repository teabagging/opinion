When presidents run on tax policy as part of their campaign, that suggests they themselves believe they have some power over taxation policy. Because generally a president who has a majority in one house of congress or another tend to have influence over what they send to his desk and what they prioritize. Republican tax cuts were made using budget reconciliation, a process that cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Dems controlled the Senate for the last 4 years.

As far as flirting with the desk clerk?  Yes, I absolutely can see that.  i left home at 18 to travel around, and worked temp jobs at a number of hotels, and hostelsespecially overseas, where I was able to work 2-3 hours for a free bed for the night.  Sometimes I did office work or cleaning, but most often worked the front desk, where I was hit on at least 10-20 times per shift, at minimum.  And thats pretty normal.  After all, when guys are away from home, by themselves, a lot of them are looking for go out with.  Its also how I first met my husband.  Considering that what he was planning on doing would probably not end well, why not have one last fling first?  I would. \\n \\nStory time:\\n  \\nOne day, I was doing office work at a hotel, where I also worked the front desk to relieve the clerks when they went on lunch, and checked in a couple of nice young guys who were flirting me up like crazy, asking when I got off work, and show them around.  They were nice, and looking fine.  I was considering it.  Then I went out to lunch, but when I tried to come back, I couldnt get into my office, because it had been invaded by an entire SWAT team.  So I went over to housekeeping, where they told me there had been a bank robbery 50 miles away.  But the cops had been able to obtain a photo of the getaway vehicle with the license plate number, which they out in the news on local TV, and someone had spotted that car in the parking lot of our hotel.   To get away from all that, I decided to play a few games in the video gaming room, where I ran into those same 2 nice young guys I had checked in and challenged them to a game.  I was deep in concentration mode, when the SWAT team burst in and threw all 3 of us up against the wall.  Even worse, they had to drag me off that gaming machine, kicking and screaming at them for ruining my game.  Fortunately though, some of the local cops were there.  They knew who I was and that I worked there (yeah, cops like to hit on desk clerks too), and along with the fact I had been working during the time the robbery had taken place, they released me.  i was pretty upset, so the manager let me take the rest of the day off.  I walked out the door of that hotel, right into all the news cameras and reporters!  They already knew I was one who checked in those bank robbers, and was with them during the arrest.  Worse yet, I was still basically in shock, and instead of keeping my mouth shut, I was dumb enough to make a complete fool of myself, ranting and raving about how SWAT had ruined my game, right in the middle of achieving my highest score everwhile I still had all my lives! So I got to relive my humiliation, on the local news, every day, for the rest of the week, and Im just glad that story didnt make it into national news.

In fact, it makes it easier to bring those individuals to testify under oath because they are no longer protected by their 5th amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.  If they do not cooperate, they can be held in contempt of court or Congress.This is hardly a \\"mercy pardon\\" so that these individuals are no longer targeted for investigation.  All it gives them is a free pass if Congress or the DOJ turn up evidence of a crime.  So, in order for this pardon to have any value, it must be connected with actions that could, reasonably, be the basis for a criminal prosecution.So, maybe Biden should disclose what he thinks would be the basis of a criminal prosecution for this very unique group of individuals.  What could General Milley have done during his tenure that would have resulted in a criminal prosecution?  Lie under oath?  Give a foreign government classified information? Did Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney violate the law during their January 6th investigations?  For the life of me, I can't think why they would be included.  They were sitting members of Congress during that investigation and protected by their own immunity from prosecution for official acts.  In fact, floating these pardons almost guarantees Congressional investigations, internal auditor investigations, and probably DOJ investigations for anyone you may have participated but are not given the benefit of a presidential pardon.  My guess is they either made a mistake discussing this and are now hoping it all goes away if they stay silent, or they are aware of serious crimes committed and feel the actual need to protect these people.  If the pardons are made, my money is on the existence of some serious crimes.","title":"Trumps F.B.I. Pick Has an Enemies List.

They both evolved in the same direction. The American left just went a bit further into neoliberalism than the American right didIt wasn't until 2016 with the rise of Donald Trump that the American right basically became fascism-lite (and this is really just the result of one charismatic leader rising to power).

You can place a political ideology on the right or left, but that's not how they are defined.Yes, and I'm not claiming the opposite. However, most politics are simplified for the public in a simple 'left' vs 'right'. Centrism lies in the middle when it comes to everything that makes an ideology 'left' or 'right'.You can place a political ideology on the right or left, but that's not how they are defined.It's indeed not part of their definition, they just get assigned a specific orientation based on common factors. The left-right political spectrum isn't exactly a new or a niche concept.Also \\"liberal\\" is incorrectly used in the context you are describing. American conservatives are also liberal.They're not though. In the US, the left-wing is liberal, the right-wing is conservative.Both sides arose from classical liberalism (individual liberty, limited government, free markets, rule of law), but have since evolved in their own directions. Modern American conservatism goes in the direction of limited government influence (ironic, given the state of affairs) and a highly individualistic approach to everything. It focuses a lot more on traditional social values. Socially they're not liberal at all.Modern American liberalism dials it back a little and focuses more on the rights of the individual. In general it's a lot more progressive and socially liberal.In the context of American politics, 'liberal' doesn't point to classical liberalism but rather modern/social liberalism.

Start with Common Values:Frame the conversation around shared concerns like health, family, economic stability, or stewardship of the planet.\\n2. Use Localized Examples:Highlight changes happening in your region, like shifts in seasonal weather patterns, local extreme weather events, or impacts on agriculture.\\n3. Focus on Solutions:Discuss renewable energy, sustainable practices, and how adapting to climate change can benefit society economically and socially.\\n4. Avoid Confrontation:Present facts calmly and avoid framing the discussion as a debate. Acknowledge skepticism and encourage questions.\\n5. Use Stories, Not Just Data:Personal stories and visuals (like before-and-after photos of glaciers) can be more impactful than raw statistics.\\n6. Explore Trusted Messengers:Share information from sources or individuals they trust, like respected scientists or faith leaders advocating for climate action.\\n7. Acknowledge Psychological Barriers:Some people resist accepting climate change due to political identity, fear, or perceived helplessness. Validate these emotions and focus on empowering, actionable steps.As far as how to approach these conversations:1. Understand Their Perspective: Ask open-ended questions like, \\"What are your main concerns about climate change?\\" This helps avoid assumptions and creates a respectful dialogue.\\n2. Present Evidence in Digestible Bits: Share small, easy-to-understand facts rather than overwhelming them with a barrage of data.\\n3. Model Positive Behavior: Demonstrate environmentally friendly habits, showing how small changes can make a difference.\\n4. Be Patient and Persistent: Acceptance often comes over time. Regular, respectful discussions can help.","title":"My wife is far right and doesn't believe in climate change"},{"text":"These people definitely know about the price of eggs at my local grocery!

I dont want to talk down to you, so excuse me if this is info you already know. This is very much a summary and there are some variations depending on the journal and field of science. But generally- when a scientist does a research project and writes it up for publication, it is reviewed many times internally by other scientists they work with, then sent to a journal. The editor of the journal then sends it to several other scientists in that field who read and critique the work. They ensure the methods used are sound and the conclusions drawn are reasonable based on the data presented. They can either reject, accept, or ask for additional experiments and revisions. If it passes all that it can be published. - that alone isnt enough though, in order for a scientific concept to be widely accepted (especially something large and across many disciplines like climate change), that same process has to happen with hundreds or even thousands of other scientists, all following the same peer review and critique process. This is called consensus- where all these different scientists in different fields are all studying a related topic and all finding the same general conclusions. At this point you have hundreds of thousands of data sets all pointing at the same conclusion. - A theory in scientific work is a very very strong thing, supported by thousands (or more) of experiments usually. It is generally defined as the best explanation for the phenomena we are experiencing. \\nClimate change (caused by human actions) is supported by SO MUCH DATA.  Go to the search engine called pubmed and search climate change and see how many hits you get. Those are all independent, peer reviewed articles. They all say the same thing.

Shortwave radiation from the sun is absorbed by the earth. Longwave radiation is emitted from the earth back out into the atmosphere and space. A certain amount of that radiation hits gases with three or more atoms and excites (ie. heats) them. You can think of these gas molecules like birds in flight with a central point and two wings that \\"flap\\" when they absorb energy. These molecules emit that energy in all directions and some of that energy is absorbed by other molecules. In this way, heat energy is \\"trapped\\" in the atmosphere. When you put more molecules capable of being heated into the atmosphere, you get more heat. CO2 is a tiny overall portion of the atmosphere but it the most abundant \\"greenhouse gas\\" other than water. The difference is water molecules spend a very short time in the atmosphere, only a few days. CO2 tends to stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Like, my country is currently run by what is considered a far right party. They're called that because they heavily oppose (muslim) immigration. However, if you look at their domestic policies, they have a lot of similarities with our left wing parties but apparently in this case that doesn't matter for their designation.But using your ideologies: are they authoritarian or not? Depends on the subject, they're very authoritarian on some issues (most notably on how to handle immigration) and not at all for others. I really wouldn't be able to say where on that axis they would land. And that's using my personal definition of 'authoritarian' which might not be the same as yours. You could argue that there's some textbook definition of what 'authoritarian' means, but if people don't know/use that specific definition and instead use their own, which many do, the vagueness of the term isn't solved. And even when using the same definition, you still can't really quantify 'how authoritarian' a party/person is. At best you can compare them to others, but that will always be relative. This goes for the other ideologies as well.If you really wanted some accurate political party graph, you'd need many more axes other than the two or at best three that most people seem to use. That would be pretty hard to draw though, since we only have three visible dimensions.The same goes for people. Even if we say that parties exist on some axis, people are not their political party. I've yet to find any person who completely agrees on everything with the party that they vote for. For example, two people who consider themselves 'liberals' might still not agree at all on a whole range of subjects. That gets even worse when you start comparing liberals across countries.In conclusion, I don't believe that 'centrist' is inherently more vague than the other designations.

Number 1, please keep him, we don't want him. Because he is neurodivergent and was bullied in school he thinks he understands the pain of all peoples at a lower power differential and acts like he is a martyr because if this. Clever man, terrible contextual awareness.Number 2, musk came here relatively early in life and quite frankly he is the epitome of American business. This is a harsh thing to hear, but as someone who has spent most of my career not working in the US, I am shocked at the how much leeway you have allowed companies here. It is literally the cause of most of the US's issues. In Last Action Hero with Arnold Schwarzenegger, there is a scene where Charles Dance's bad guy shoots a man in New York and nobody cares (great timing I know). But this is what it is like operating in America. Musk, coming from a more European style business environment where there are restrictions on what business can do for the sake of society must have cum in his pants when he realised there are no consequences here.Take the often shouted thought that America is a capitalist society that rewards exceptionalism. I cry bullshit because as soon as a bank is too big to fail you have created a socialist oligarchy. In 2008 banks should have failed. People should have lost their life's savings and people should have burned this motherfucker down. Because then maybe the ridiculous price gauging and just in time logistic mismanagement during covid may not have happened.I lived in London during the 2008 crisis and people shut the city down. When France wanted to raise the retirement age by 2 years the country protested. Here you seem to have been convinced in general that protesting is a dirty thing.Finally, it is hard to relate globally, how big and how unconcentrated the US is. That tied to your media diets creates a perfect system for abuse. I come from a medical family and was a paramedic and have never heard of most of the conditions you have advertisements for. To the extent I am now questioning whether I have wet AMD. The point being, you are hilariously influenced by media more than any country on the planet, with very distributed populace whose main cultural influence comes through media.The reason my last point is relevant is that Musk and his influence on your society is a consequence of the lack of guardrails you have and a person who came from a place with much stronger guard rails. Seriously in most places the market is much smaller and the guard rails are much stronger.Again, with the money he has, and the digital knowledge he has, he must be fucking astounded every single day at what he is able to do, control, and get away with in the USA.","title":"Elon Musk was behind mysterious pro-Trump super PAC that invoked Ruth Bader Ginsburg"},{"text":"Well, id say the imaginary friend thing as an adult indicates certaindeficiencies.?","title":"Trump ushers in a Christian \\"deep state\\": MAGA moves to gut the Constitution"},{"text":"These people wont have to worry when the FBI is dismantled!","title":"FBI arrests Boston City Councilor on public corruption charges"},{"text":"Christ, what an asshole.","title":"Elon Musk Behind Pro-Trump Group That Invoked Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Part Of $250 Million Spending Blitz"},{"text":"Let them try.","title":"'Nothing Is Sacrosanct': GOP Floats Social Security Cuts After Musk Capitol Hill Visit | \\n\\"They're going to put everything on the table,\\" one Republican lawmaker said of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy."},{"text":"Hmmm.

Like bill gates who donated 50m?Like I said in the initial post, it's recent through October 26th FEC filings. This is why it only shows $133 million for Musk instead of $259 million. shouldn't you list by amount of billionaires? The reason I'm far less concerned with the # of billionaires than I am with who each one is, how much they donate, and what they might want out of close connections with a politician are illustrated through this hypothetical comparison:Billionaire1:* Net worth of $5 billion.\\n* Donated $3,300 directly to CandidateY (to the campaign; no super PAC donation)\\n* Wealth is almost entirely derived from his diluted inherited stake in a large family business, which Billionaire1 sold and then invested most of his wealth in index funds, some of it in luxury real estate, and some of it in venture capital investing for nuclear fusion startups.\\n* No major personal financial ties to any company with significant federal contracts.\\n* Might possibly be concerned with some regulations and access to loans for the small percentage of his wealth invested in nuclear fusion startups, but only put $3,300 in the election so didn't donate enough to buy major influence.Billionaire2:* Net worth of $1.2 billion.\\n* Donated $5 million to a super PAC supporting CandidateX.\\n* Wealth is almost entirely derived from her ownership stake in an NFL team.\\n* No major personal financial ties to any company with significant federal contracts.\\n* No major personal financial ties to any company seriously concerned with regulations in areas of labor, environmental, financial, anti-trust, etc.Billionaire3:* Net worth of $100 billion.\\n* Donated $50 million to a super PAC supporting CandidateY.\\n* Wealth is almost entirely derived from her ownership stakes in a major defense contractor and a large US railroad company.\\n* Via defense contractor, has billions of dollars in federal contracts.\\n* Via defense contractor and railroad, her companies regularly face scrutiny across all regulatory categories. Labor relations, environmental concerns, market competitiveness, etc.Should these three billionaires each be tallied as an equal tick? Are they the same in your eyes?To me, they are *very* different.Billionaire1 is negligible. Just a rich person donating within our direct campaign contribution limits.Billionaire2's enormous contribution of $5 million is worrisome but the worry is dampened by there not being major conflicts of interest involved. It seems like Billionaire2 is contributing such a large amount because they merely like CandidateX.Billionaire3's is flat out plutocratic in nature. Enormous conflict of interest paired with full exploitation of our Republican-broken campaign finance &amp; election spending system.","title":"Elon Musk Spent Over $250 Million to Help Elect Trump"},{"text":"I love how people who don't need Social Security benefits are so eager to cut them.

Unless you are in the 10% of people that is some other ideology like anarchist, socialist, fascist, etc., then you are some variant of liberalism Centrists are often people who evaluate each issue on its own merits,Ok but that's not a political ideology. If you actually ask these people about their core political beliefs, you can easily figure out what their actual ideology is. Both major political parties in the US are different variants of liberalism (although you could argue that the MAGA party is borderline illiberal), and 90% of the US population are liberals. If your core beliefs generally include things like civil liberties, individual rights, free enterprise, etc, then you are a liberal end up with some views shared with the Democrats, some views shared with the RepublicansOk so then they are a liberal. The Democrats are neoliberals and classic Republicans are basically classical liberals. Although the MAGA party is maybe a bit different, although it seems like most of their voters don't actually support the specific things that makes Trump illiberal (e.g. his autocratic tendencies)ultimately I think \\"centrists are low information voters\\" is a bizarre conclusionThat's not what I actually said. I said that it can be hard to define what low information voters are because they are so ignorant about politics, so \\"centrist\\" is an easy label to apply to them in practical terms. I also said that if you actually grilled them on what they believed in then you could determine their actual ideology, but for practical purposes it's convenient to just call them \\"centrist\\"Anyway, based on your comment it seems like you don't have that much understanding of political ideologies and you view everything purely based on the platforms of American political parties.

The article seems to be ignoring this argument and is instead framing it as if only those that live in Dem cities are able to be frustrated with Dem leadership, when its just not the case.Their dismissal of analyzing crime is similarly bunk in my opinion; it shouldnt just be comparing crime data vs voting, it should be comparing *the perception of crime* with voting (i.e., if people perceive Dem policies to lead to more crime in Dem cities (which it has), then they wont trust Dem leadership).

Low information voters are more likely to just believe what their party tells them to believe than they are to develop opinions on each issue independently of party.Now, I agree that \\"centrist\\" doesn't tell you a whole lot about what a person believes (and is thus a pretty meaningless label).

Things need time to adapt and it's changing too quickly for a lot of species to be able to survive long term specifically because it's too fast.You can't slowly get better at living in the desert over millions of years and countless generations if the Sahara is growing by about 11,000 square kilometers per year and places that just 3 generations of animals ago were habitable are now arid wasteland. Polar bears aren't able to evolve to live without ice quickly enough when the places that their great-grandparents thrived in are now open ocean.

The military usually just follows orders. The same with the police. They don't immediately turn into hired goons for the dictator, but they will get placed in a position where their loyalty to the institution and its values is deliberately confused with loyalty to the regime. When something happens, they will not see a confrontation between government and people, but between order and chaos, and people in positions of authority (no matter how lowly placed) will usually choose the former over the latter. It's the same psychological effect that often prompts governments to prioritize security and enforcement of property rights over actually saving lives whenever disasters hit. The need to preserve the social order becomes paramount. It's not a coincidence that dictatorships emphasize order even though they themselves are often a chaotic jumble of fiefdoms. This desire for social order is what legitimizes their existence during a crisis.It's the same with the belief that paramilitaries will keep you safe from a tyrannical government. They don't.

The only information that is trusted are those that validate the in-group, because the in-group gives them a sense of comfort and safety.

Fucking with peoples healthcare is a dangerous job these days.Every single legislator gets a fair degree of security. They aren't worried about their personal safety, and frankly if even one of them was injured, they'd jack up security for the rest anyway.And why would they worry politically? The Republicans have been *brazen* and open about gutting people's protections and rights for years now. They quite literally did it to abortion rights. Have they been punished for it? For all the fact that Abortion rights win on direct referenda (kinda sorta, since states can fuck with those votes anyway), the voters haven't punished Republican elected leaders. The Republicans still have iron control over their states, while weaponizing the fairness of most blue states against them (see for instance how gerrymandering fights went in New York in contrast to say, North Carolina)At the Federal level voters were given a choice between the candidate screaming about migrants eating cats and dogs, and a candidate promising to fight like hell for our basic bodily rights if she received a clean legislature. Guess who the voters gave a trifecta to?So why should Republicans be worried? The Dems might outraise them in open fundraising, but they've got billionaires like Musk pouring black money to them, which allows them to do exponentially more than anything the Dems can do with their larger campaign coffers. The voters seem to adore voting for bigotry and blood libels. When it wasn't CRT, it was DEI. When it wasn't DEI, it was transpeople. If its not those issues, they decide to punish Biden for the sovereign actions of another country in the Middle East, by voting for a dude who openly promises to make it worse.

Russian interests aligned with those supporting Brexit, so Russian interference is then welcomed by a huge chunk of the political class and indeed the electorate because they value winning over any principle. Then intervening by intelligence agencies looks like youre intervening in domestic politics even though you aren't, but when the interests of hostile states align with those of a societal segment, it can look like it. I know the CIAs job is not aimed at protecting the internal national security of the US ofc, that's the FBI and other agency roles.The bigger issue is that Western societies have been asleep at the wheel for decades, distracted by a less significant threat, terrorism, while hostile states have been aggressively chopping away at our societies and unity via the open internet, and our general freedom of speech (a weakness they do not have) and we have let them do it. And cynical operators, mostly on the right, are taking advantage, openly or overtly to get what they want and they don't give two shits (or barely even notice) about the strange fact that what they want, is also, very interestingly, what our worst enemies want.","title":"Putins Pals Say Tucker Carlson Is Acting as a Secret Back-Channel to Trump"},{"text":"Let me guess...

Some natural climate changes have been slow. Some have been fast, like the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, to cite the most well known. That kicked up dust and effectively blocked out the sunlight for long enough to kill a ton of the living things on earth. And in geologic timescales, human beings 200+ years of fossil fuel burning is considered quite fast compared to other climate shifts which happened over multiple thousands of years. In short, natural climate shifts (discounting the big ones like meteors or volcanic events that are basically cataclysmic) are slow enough that life can adapt. Even in those disaster events, life on earth survived, it just took millions of years for it to recover and diversify again.Human caused climate change is probably not going to be the end of life on earth, but it could be the end of advanced human society, and maybe the end of humans. If we lose enough biodiversity, or destroy our own ability to farm crops, we wont be able to sustain the way of life weve built and it will all collapse. So thats why we should care. The survival of humans, but more importantly, other wildlife on earth hangs in the balance. If for no other reason, people should care/believe in it because it is already affecting the stability of society and its gonna get worse. In the grand scheme, life on earth might be okay, but it would be tragic to let so many living things perish because we wont change our ways. Again, it might take millions of years for life flourish again if there is a mass extinction event.","title":"My wife is far right and doesn't believe in climate change"},{"text":"So, what does more poor and destitute people do to make America great again?","title":"'Nothing Is Sacrosanct': GOP Floats Social Security Cuts After Musk Capitol Hill Visit | \\n\\"They're going to put everything on the table,\\" one Republican lawmaker said of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy."},{"text":"Dude craves attention more than he cares about the country.

Trump and MAGA already think theres proof of crime (or they just dont care), and are going to prosecute innocent people regardless. If pre-pardons are actually a thing that can protect these people, who cares what MAGA thinks? If Biden doesnt pre-pardon, it should be because he cant, not because the optics will look bad. Realistically, I think Trump will order his political enemies arrested and jailed regardless, so pardons are probably a moot point. It will come down to whether the people below Trump will follow unlawful orders or not. I fear the SCOTUS ruling that presidents have immunity for all official acts will allow Trump to order illegal arrests (officially, so hes immune), then pardon those below him who carry them out. Then the arrests are essentially legal. Under that scenario, it doesnt matter if the victims were pardoned or committed no crime, unless Im misunderstanding the SCOTUS ruling.","title":"Trumps F.B.I.

There is simply no way to do this consistent with the text, history, and structure of the Constitution.  \\n  \\nThe Constitution and laws require the Senates approval to fill many of the governments most important officessuch as attorney general or secretary of stateall of which wield extraordinary powers on behalf of the public. The Senates involvement helps to ensure that the people in these jobs have the necessary competence and integrity. In Alexander Hamiltons apt words, the Senate can prevent the appointment of unfit characters who would be no more than obsequious instruments of the presidents pleasure.  \\n  \\nThe Senates check on the president can of course lead to friction and frustration at the start of an administration, while a new presidents nominees are considered and sometimes even rejected by the Senate. Advice and consent takes time. But as Justice Louis Brandeis famously observed, checks and balances exist not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose of the Constitution is not to avoid friction but to save the people from autocracy.  \\n  \\nThat is why any effort to cut the Senate out of the appointments process would be troubling; it is disdainful of self-government under a Constitution altogether. Trumps supporters have suggested two ways to get around the Senates advice-and-consent process. In the first, the Senate would vote to go into recess soon after Trumps inauguration, allowing him to unilaterally make a series of recess appointments. That plan may formally be legal, but it is plainly improper. The president is authorized to make recess appointments to ensure the continued functioning of the Federal Government when the Senate is away, as Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Supreme Court in 2014. That mechanism was vital in an age when the Senate was frequently absent from the capital for months at a time and could not quickly and easily reconvene. But, as Breyer also noted, the Constitution does not give the President the authority routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirmation. For the Senate to go into recess at the beginning of a new administration for the sole purpose of allowing the president to fill up the government with whomever he pleasesall while the Senate is controlled by the presidents party and perfectly capable of considering his nomineeswould be a clear misuse of the recess-appointment power. Happily, the new Senate seems to agree, balking at Trumps request that it surrender its prerogative so meekly.  \\n  \\nAs a result, some House Republicans have begun to discuss a more extreme scheme, one Trump considered during his first term: Trump could instead send the Senate home against its will and fill the government during the resulting recess. This is flagrantly unlawful....Simply put, the House of Representatives cannot collude with the president to deprive the Senate of its constitutional power to advise and consent on appointments. That would make a mockery of the Constitutions text and structure. If the House attempts this maneuver, the Senate should resist it by continuing to meet, and the courts should refuse to recognize any resulting appointments. The threat to adjourn the Senate should be seen and called out for what it is: an autocratic move that is not just unlawful but contemptuous of constitutionalism.Unfortunately in this day and age it's no longer out of the question that the House and President might attempt something like this with the goal of removing any restrictions that might have been placed on them initially to help temper any potential excesses.","title":"No, Trump Cant Just Dismiss the Senate | The threat from House Republicans should be seen and called out for what it is: an autocratic move that is not just unlawful but contemptuous of constitutionalism"},{"text":"If Joe issued a blanket pardon of all immigrants crossing the border illegally between first and last days of Trumps term, thatd be hilarious.","title":"White House Discussing Preemptive Pardons Of Trump's Enemies, Opponents, Victims"},{"text":"No, he should not.Let the Republicans turn the FBI into a circus side show of horrors.

In those cases, it's 100% valid to contact the Bahamians and say, \\"We've picked up this person for \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_.  He says he's from the Bahamas.

Likewise the House is the representatives of *We the People*.  That is why the House has the control of spending as all money comes from us.Neither role was ever expected to be a career.  Senators would be replaced as State governments were replaced.  House members were expected to be *citizen statesmen* who would come from their community, serve a few terms (that is why House is only 2 year term) then go home.The founders knew relying on *popular vote* for anything was the wrong way to go.  The House is a local election.  The Senate was to be decided by the State, usually via a compromise between the Executive and Legislative branches.And as we all know, the people do not pick a President, the State does, and the State defines how they make that choice.  The office of the President is the single point of contact for the union of sovereign States in dealing with the outside world.  It is because that is the intent of the office of President that the Senate is supposed to protect the interests of the States, not themselves.So arguing that not being able to win a Senate election is a non-sequitur because the entire apparatus of *elections at large* and/or popular vote are designed to be manipulated.So it isn't that repealing the 17th would *lock in Senators*, it is that it would make the Senate be the body it is supposed to be and return control back to the States where it belongs.Prior to the war between the States, we were officially referred to as **These** United States.  After the war we started being referred to as **The** Unite States.   We were never supposed to be a single, monolithic nation like France or Germany, we were established as a *Democratic Republic* where the Constitution is intended to limit the authorities exercised by a federal government.  The feds only have the powers specifically granted by the Constitution, and nothing more.  The 10th Amendment re-affirms that point.The power grab we've witnessed over the last 100+ years needs to be reversed, and to do that the States need to step in and reclaim their power as the true authorities in this union.  And that should start with repealing the 17th.","title":"Republicans just won a permanent Senate majority"},{"text":"How are these people seen as tough when they need their mommies to help them get a job.","title":"MAGA Rages as GOPers Quietly Move to Sink Pete Hegseth"},{"text":"Kinda dumb considering the claims adjuster is still out there.

You may be confusing future *acts*, which cannot be pardoned, with future *prosecutions*, which can. In fact, the most famous pardon in US history -- Ford's pardon of Nixon -- was for all offenses he \\"has committed or may have committed\\" during his presidency, even though Nixon had not been formally charged with any crimes. Here's the pertinent text of Nixon's pardon:\\"Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, *has committed or may have committed or taken part in* during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974.\\" (Emphasis added).The text of Hunter Biden's pardon is similar:*For those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in* during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C.

(Emphasis added).If there is binding legal authority to the contrary, I'm unaware of it.

Finally, everything is coming together.It is a more positive story than most from Ukraine at the moment. The day before, Vladimir Putin had launched a record aerial attack across the country, with 188 drones and missiles shot down. On the ground, Russia is making grinding progress in the east.In Kursk, across the border in Russia, Ukraine is doggedly holding on to the pocket of land?audaciously seized in summer, battling Russian and North Korean troops with the long-range Western weapons they are at last C allowed to aim into Russian territory. The?re-election of Donald Trump?as US President, who pledged to end the war in 24 hours, has prompted fears that he will stop US support for Ukraine.But over dinner at a flat in Kyiv, where a Javelin rocket launcher hangs alongside the coats in the hallway, Kamyshin makes a case for optimism. He describes his job as being a kind of fire-fighter. He and the president have a meeting nearly every day, in which Zelensky gets him to focus on one area of concern or another C it could be healthcare, infrastructure, energy, munitions. With an eye on so many sectors, he presents a compelling vision of a post-ceasefire Ukraine that could be a vital part of Europe, a tooled-up, battle-hardened people who are expert at IT, making drones and getting the trains to run on time.Ukraine 2.0 comes with lessons for defence industries, with medicine, with emergency services, with railways, he says. Its not something we wanted to be known for, but we have learned all these lessons. We are open and ready to share what we have learned.Tall and charismatic, with a goatee and long Cossack-style ponytail, Kamyshin, 40, has been a distinctive presence throughout the war. Kyiv-born and bred, he had a career in the private sector, first at KPMG and then as an investment manager, before he was made acting CEO of the Ukrainian railways in 2021.After the full-scale invasion began in 2022, the?*Ukrzaliznytsia*?became known as the Iron Railways, a source of national pride and a lifeline, carrying refugees and casualties out of harms way in one direction, and aid and materiel the other, to the frontlines. At their peak, they were carrying 190,000 people per day, for free, aided by a stripped-back, military-style command structure.They also ferried a succession of world leaders to Kyiv to meet Zelensky, defy Putin and present a united front. None did so more enthusiastically than the then-Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. I know he has problems inside \\\\[the UK\\\\], but for us he was a hero, we loved him, he recalls. When I interviewed Kamyshin two months after the invasion, he said the railway, along with the defiant figure of Zelensky and the surprising resilience of the army, was one of the three most positive surprises.\\\\[We\\\\] are the organisation that has shown it is stable, reliable and works properly, he told me. People trust us. They know that if they can get to the railway station, they will receive tea, food and medical care, and will be safely transported to another city where there is less shelling.So successful was Kamyshin at running the railways that in February 2023 Zelensky promoted him to an even more vital role, as Minister for Strategic Industries, responsible for scaling up ammunition production. Like Lord Beaverbrook during the Second World War, who brought his experience as a media baron to bear on producing fighter aircraft, Kamyshin used his experience in the private sector and running the railways to ramp up production of drones, shells and other weaponry.In scaling up its domestic operations, Ukraine could end its reliance on?foreign munitions?and create a vital new industry. By 2023, production had tripled on its pre-war levels, by the end of this year, sixfold. As well as increasing production of traditional munitions, under Kamyshins leadership Ukraine has developed its own long-range cruise missile system, Palianytsia, which has entered mass production.**Full story:**?[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/06/trump-zelensky-ukraine-war/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/06/trump-zelensky-ukraine-war/)","title":"Zelenskys new strategic advisor: Trump is a deals guy.

A pilot program called \\"My Voice Voucher\\" would be initiated in three states. This program would provide any registered voter in those states to request a $25 voucher from the state which could then be given to any Congressional candidate. A new public financing system would also be established. Small donations, up to $200 per donation, would receive a 6:1 match. It would be paid for by small fees assessed on civil or criminal penalties issued to corporations, corporate officers, and high income tax evaders. All federal election campaigns, both Congressional and Presidential, would be eligible, subject to only a couple large restrictions:* Campaigns must limit individual donations to $1,000 or less, indexed to inflation. * Candidates must raise a minimum amount of funds. For Congressional elections, the threshold is $50,000+ from 1,000+ different donors and for Presidential, it's $25,000+ from donors in 20+ states. Only one party was against this.

An estimated 20% of the *total possible supply* of Bitcoin has been lost permanently, so its actually closer to negative-zero-point-two-sum. Once someone loses their wallet or credentials, there is no possibility of recovery, so that loss percentage can only go up.And the reason most investors can make a positive return on the stock market is that companies (on which stocks nominally base their value) have a tendency to grow. They buy more assets, they make more products, they increase their operational efficiency, and they make more money. Since stocks are (again, at least nominally) derived from the health of the company, these things raise the stock price. While many (even *most*, if were including every startup that collapses in its first year) companies fail, anyone who sticks to aggregate funds that track the market will see positive returns, as long as the economy as a whole is growing.This is not true of Bitcoin. There is no company performance from which Bitcoin derives its value, even in theory. The only source of value is speculation; the only way you can see a positive return is if someone else buys your tokens for more than you bought them for. This is an inherently unstable state - a bubble. The smart move is to avoid being left holding the bag when that bubble bursts. The higher the price goes, the more risky that burst becomes to anyone holding the asset, *and* the more likely that collapse becomes overall. At no point has it ever been rational to invest in Bitcoin; the fact that a handful of people managed to get lucky on a bad bet does not retroactively make it a *good* bet.","title":"Trump claims credit for bitcoin hitting $100,000 as pro-crypto administration takes shape with SEC pick"},{"text":"Ive been considering this.

Pete Hegseth is not remotely qualified for that position. This is a position that goes to heavy hitters, generals, people whove worked in the Pentagon for a long time, U.S. senators with long records overseeing the Department of Defense. And?Trump is trying to hand it off to someone whose TV hits he likes, because he appreciates the propaganda that Pete Hegseth provides for him.?If Republican senators are really going to kneel on that one, its really hard to imagine where they wont.\\n The guy can't run a veterans not for profit group ( kicked out of 2 groups) but he's now going to be head of the Pentagon, 6th in line for the presidency. The other very disturbing fact is that many of Trump's appointments are members of fringe Apostolic Dominionist churches with the main goal being to turn the US into a Christian Theocracy.  Many dictators hide behind Christianity and use it to legitimize their actions, but Trump may have bitten off more than he can chew. These Dominionists are rabid.
