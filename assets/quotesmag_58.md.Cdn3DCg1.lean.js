The radio made in the USA is $12, and goes up to $15.\\nFor a slightly more detailed explanation:Items manufactured from outside of the USA will be sold at a higher price to drive sales for American-made products. Similarly, all raw / natural resources will be given a similar value increase to motivate Americans use and produce their own countrys resources first. Two major drawbacks are:  1) the USA imports lots of raw material worldwide that it cannot obtain naturally, so costs for these items will balloon to match the new tariffs. And 2)  many retailers and manufacturers will be forced to sell their products at a higher price, to offset the costs, which could lead to a financial depression. The NAFTA / USMCA was created solely to get around these price increases, but would mean nothing under the tariffs, unless a deal is reached between Canada/Mexico. So while the cost of locally produced goods may go down, chances are the prices will *rise*, so long as the price is still lower than that of their competitors / outside manufacturers.

But Karma isn't real.I think you are flirting with the edges, but you aren't quite getting it.Here is the truth (and it will be a hard pill to swallow).:  the Republican party messaging is aspirational and is created for people with agency.

Changes to ACA funding means many will lose insurance or have to pay orders of magnitude more for it.  Tariffs will raise the price of virtually every good and service.  By voting for Trump, they have voted for what is essentially a national sales tax.  Let that sink in for a second.  People worried about the price of goods just assured that prices will go up.Trump's tariff plan will mean households will need to spend an extra $2,500+ to get the same goods at TODAYS prices.  It would mean the loss of 600,000+ full time jobs.  It would cut GDP by a full percentage point.So yes...  people are too stupid to realize that they voted for.  They are acting like toddlers instead of taking the time to understand the impact of their vote.","title":"Why Democrats couldnt sell a strong economy, in 3 charts"},{"text":"I think its meant in more of a Montezumas revenge kind of way.

The sports thing, is a scientific mess... god knows how to draw the line on that. I wouldn't want to, but it's clear some kind of line has to be drawn. This doesn't have to be a problem that government solves though. What we can stand up for and should stand up for, is the original winning proposition that led to gay rights being widely accepted - individual rights. \\n You do you, I'll do me, or as you put it \\"let people be themselves\\". That was always a message that resonated because everyone could identify with that (unlike more current discourses).  The 1990-2015 LGBT rights movement that I lived through was probably the most rapid ascendency of any minority rights ever.  We managed to strike a chord with welcoming pride parades, \\"we're just like you\\" rhetoric, and appeals to individual freedom. It was welcoming and positive. Nowadays my Pride parade is an anti-semitic, \\"intersectional\\", anti-police mess (police were kicked out of the parade) and I see LGBT rights going backwards rapidly.It's time to stop thinking that Liberalism is the inevitable long arc of history and realize that people had to continually be *convincing* and fight for it over many, many years.

In that scenario, incumbents can lose. Trump may be completely a charlatan, horrible in many ways, and un-serious about addressing these issues, but his rhetoric is populist economically. The messaging is key. His populist rhetoric cuts through, and the Democrats have a lack of messaging/outreach that can match.For instance, think back to 2022 when inflation was raging. If Trump were president, he would have been shouting 24/7 scapegoating corporations, greedy boards/ceos, and throwing everyone and anyone elitist under the bus he could. Biden on the other hand was tone deaf and blase; almost completely absent in general (and aside from just the messaging/narratives, he should have actually done something with emergency COVID powers to rein in price gouging, even if courts tried to stop him).They need to simplify the message and platform, and get big and bold.

Democrats arent good it critical thinking.  Too many are afraid to speak up and say things like  hey , maybe we should just admit we have a crisis at the border  instead of following the administrations 3+ years of telling the public it was under control Maybe democrats need to actually stop being afraid to point out where their policies have failed while still making voters aware of the policies that are working. But the rational and critical thinking dems are afraid of breaking from the narratives passed on at the top There are dems that dont believe in the idea that biological males should compete on biological female sports but the dems would rather stay as extreme left on the subject instead of pushing the idea that youre intolerant if you dont believe biological men should be able to compete in sports with biological women. Personally Im right center , I dont believe in governments involvement in the personal choices of women and their bodies and I was sure the election was going to be won or lost on that front. But the reality is almost every Harris campaign ad reaching out to women was centered around their bodies from the waist down. Dems have gone so far left they alienated and vilified young white men. Almost a decade of telling men they are the problem and masculinity was a direct threat to democracy and a direct threat to women. Young white men were told they were more dangerous than bears.  They were told by their razor makers that they are toxic. Young white men spoke up\\nBut they did so at the polls. Rural America saw the ads representing them as flannel shirt wearing John deer hat wearing donut holes that have finally seen the light and are voting for Kamala. This was a total misrepresentation of rural America and they spoke up on that at the polls. Dems made the entire election about misogyny while a minority female who is the vice president of the country told us women are being held back by white men. The attack on masculinity , white men , and the pandering to the lgbtq community and the trans community not to\\nMention another year of treating minorities like helpless children and victims swayed the election Blatantly lying to the public about how great the economy is doing swayed the election. Covering up\\nAnd denying bidens rapid cognitive decline until the very last minute swayed the election. Kamala shamelessly switching personalities , accents , dispositions depending on who she was pandering to swayed the election. Even that hideous cackle Kamala just couldnt let go of swayed the election.  Even now watch CNN, you cant go 2 min without the word  misogyny  being uttered .  In 2016 it was a white lash . But for the most part young white males\\nSaid this is enough.  We took it for a while but now its just getting out of hand. They just got fed up with being told they are the problem with the country. Now if Dems deployed some critical thinking at had those discussions internally without fear of being ostracized this election goes another way.  The election wasnt even about trump. Youd think with my reasoning that I voted for trump. I did not. I did not in 2020 or 2016. Hes a buffoon. This election result was the country telling the left the extreme left to stop with the rhetoric and get back to the real issues. They told the left to stop pandering and creating villains. They told the left to start being honest and self reflective.  They told the left to stop\\nSaying theyre helping the black community and actually help them.  The election was lost because democrats ran an entire campaign on fear mongering. At least were not him. If I had to add another reason this election was lost I cant help but recognize the trump\\nCampaign ran a very calculated campaign. A very targeted and smart strategic campaign. The Harris campaign ran on the assumption that they already had the 2020 Biden votes and just needed to hold on to them. They didnt need to gain even an inch of ground they had to just not lose any.  And they lost about 500 yards of ground.  Harris didnt over perform really anywhere. Trump over performed just about everywhere. So what I can only deduce from this election cycle is that next election an even slightly\\nLess flawed and controversial candidate for the republicans may very well win the next 2 elections.  Thats about how long its going to take for the Dems to undo a decade of relying on fear mongering , pandering and vilifying  key voting demographics. White men especially young white men found the counter strike to being blamed for everything.  And Dems cant just do an about face and start pandering to them. Theyre going to have to slowly walk away from these mislead attacks and narratives. Dems strategy of muffling the voice of white America worked for a bit but now they know its going to work against them in the future.","title":"Why Democrats Lose Even When Republicans Are so Endlessly Terrible"},{"text":"Ain't that the truth, 24/7 news killed journalism.","title":"Former Obama adviser: Democrats must realize our democracy angers voters"},{"text":"Bernie sure does love a bullshit talking point with zero to back it up.

Personally, he has been publicly pro choice, pro life, straight-up pro-abortion, pro legalization of marijuana, anti legalization of marijuana, pro border security, pro immigrants, pro invasion, pro war, pro defense, anti military aid, anti military spending, and pro military spending. He has no convictions (outside of the legal ones lol)So, in theory, if the right people anger him (Putin, Bibi, Xi, his staffers, etc.) he *could* violently swing in a direction opposite his party.The light in the dark being, with Trump there's no predictability. He wants to concede Ukraine to Putin and increase funding to Israel *dramatically*. But, if Putin embarrasses him, if Bibi ignores him, Trump could (and realistically might) flip tracts on a dime.   \\nPutin already rejected his first Ukraine deal off-hand, a few more interactions like this and Trump *could* increase our presence in Ukraine strictly out of spite.   \\nSame for Israel. He wants to dramatically increase military exports to the IDF, but if Bibi goes outside of Trump's comfort zone he could (and might) *completely* cut off funding for Israel (something even the Dems considered too drastic).Obviously the whole world knows that as well. And I, unfortunately, don't think that Putin or Bibi (or Xi or whoever) will actually fuck up their political relationship with the Great Cheeto. But maybe.  \\nThat's where my hope exists now.

Thats why people stayed home. They werent given a compelling narrative by the Democrats. The Republicans did.It doesnt matter whats true or good in the age of populism. It matters what resonates with the median voter. Establishment Dems categorically dont understand that. The only surge of excitement we saw among the wider populace and young voters was when Walz was announced and began antagonizing the Republicans. Establishment Democrat advisors told the campaign to abandon that to chase the mythical moderate Republican that no longer exists. For all their effort abandoning aggressive and populist language what did they get?94% of registered Republicans voted for Trump just like 94% did in 2020. And they alienated the young progressive voters and the blue collar working class by saying nothing would change from a very unpopular administration and offering niche specific policy nuggets that no average voter cares about instead of a compelling narrative.Again, it doesnt matter who has the better policies. It doesnt matter who lies. It doesnt matter who is the fascist. When it comes to actually running a political campaign with a largely unengaged and uninformed populace with heavy populist biases what matters is emotionally engaging people. Democrats this time around were limp-dicked about their warnings about Trump and P2025. The messaging at best sounded politically correct, calm and clinical. They needed to be fearmongering and emotionally intense if they wanted to engage people.?Be like the DNC leadership and learn nothing and see how well that continues to turn out.?Liberalism is ideologically incapable of defeating fascism.

For the most part what that battle has looked like is moderates trying to strategically capitulate to progressives in ways that don't fundamentally threaten the viability of the party.

Essentially anyone who wants a job has one, possibly two or more. In any society there will be those who game the system. Game it like a soon to be second term president, for example, and those who prefer to take advantage of our social safety net. So yes, as I said twice before, we need a viable pathway to citizenship for the hard working undocumented migrant population residing here in the States. We don't need to spend over $200 billion rounding them, and their families, up so we can deport them.

Dot com bust.  I remember losing big time there (1/3 value).  The early 1980's was wild.  Interest rates of 12-18%, depending on what you were borrowing the money for.

I couldn't sleep the other night thinking about how much my account was going to drop.  I can pull it out, take a small hit on the cash-out, a large hit on taxes and move that money into CD's.  Not a good financial move.  This would guarantee a 1/4 loss.   I discussed the issue the next morning with my wife and we're setting up an appointment with our adviser to see the true cost of a withdraw.  We will have to then see how much we're willing to lose if everything tanks.

Why the fuck did he forget that promise? Hold a primary, find a person PEOPLE actually like and run them. Instead they pulled a Hillary 2.0. Isnt the definition of insanity doing the same thing and expecting a different result? I have no words to describe how stupid the whole thing is. Trump will ride the low inflation wave. Due to huge inertia of the US economy he has at least a year or even two to do absolutely anything he wants and not see any negative results. Stock market will continue going up, inflation will be manageable. He will parade this as an absolute win and the people will be ecstatic. In two years if the cracks start to show he will find someone to blame and say remember my first two years? This is how its going to be if you elect my guy.

What is going on in Israel is unconscionable, US interests in the Middle East be damned. But what do you think the solution is to that? Sure, you can refuse to vote for a Democrat, but how does that get you any closer to your goal of ending the war? I'd argue, as always, that the primary elections are for putting candidates up there who actually represent your ideology, and the general election is for damage control. I firmly believe that history will prove me right here when I say that the simple fact is that more Palestinian children will die under Trump than under Biden. Obviously we can't objectively see how many would have died under Harris, but it is clear to me that while the Democrats have a lot to answer for, the Republicans embrace it wholeheartedly and unapologetically. Biden at least *tried* to broker peace. Trump has given no indication that he will do so. It seems very clear to me that the only rational action here would be to vote for the Democrat who's not perfect, and next cycle ask some very hard questions of the primary candidates and refuse to help nominate any who cross one or more of your hard lines.how else do you explain Kamala losing to someone like Donald Trump? I don't believe that there's one single factor. Sexism both ways is absolutely a factor--both sexism against women in states that are anti-abortion, and frankly sexism against men in the Democratic messaging that implies men are near-exclusively responsible for all these problems.But you can also point to other factors. For example, it's very plausible that abortion wasn't a winning argument in large part because the various ballot measures allowed voters to protect abortion independently of Trump or Harris, thus freeing pro-abortion voters from the need to vote for Harris to protect their interests in that way.Racism, obviously; a huge part of Trump's popularity can be traced back to a backlash against Obama. Not to mention we're sliding back to Bush-era racism against Latinos.There's also the global trend of pushback against post-covid inflation and cost-of-living issues that can't be entirely blamed on the Democrats (because it's happening everywhere, not just in the US).

But second, the party has to find ways to not be completely subsumed by a demographic that represents 1% of the population. Do we fight for them? Absolutely. But we also fight for demographics that make up 15% of the population. 30% of the population. 53% of the population. The entire population. Etc. etc.The Republican Party succeeded in forcing the Democrats to talk about the transgender issue to the exclusion of many many other issues. Issues that could have won the election. Democrats have to learn not to take that bait. The bait of do you defend this trans issue? Do you defend this development in the trans community? Do you defend this age group getting top or bottom surgery? Do you defend public funds being used for these surgeries? Do you defend public funds being used for these surgeries for prison inmates? And on and on.Yes you have to defend the trans community always always. But no you dont have to take the Republican tactical bait and let it become something you are always always talking about.Theres only so many hours in the day. The attention span that many voters will be giving you is very very short.If all you gave them when you had their attention was discussions about trans issues theres a solid chance they are looking at you as out of touch with their lives and tuning you out.They, or a loved one, may need life saving surgeries too. They may not have the health care they need to make that happen. The money they need to make that happen. They might feel oppressed/depressed too. They might be very poor and look at this entire debate as rich-people problems that they cant even begin to relate to. They might be looking for someone to defend them too. The Party needs to make sure they arent getting stuck in a rut, and failing to represent broader swaths of the electorate in their public discussions and messaging. I think the Republicans succeeded in making the Democratic Party look like a party that is hyper focused on this issue, to the exclusion of much larger voting blocs who also feel they need support.

Outside of leftists bubbles, the idea of men playing in women's sports or being in women's locker rooms or bathrooms seems insane to most people.","title":"Texas Democratic chair resigns after blaming election losses on transgender issues"},{"text":"Debt being issue #4 is wild","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

People arent voting based on logic, facts, or policies. Theyre voting on their feelings. They voted for Trump, not because they like his policies, but because they think having a bully leading the country is a net benefit for them. He sells them a feeling of superiority. He sells them a feeling of nostalgia for a simpler, more prosperous time. He sells them what they want to hear, which makes them trust him. They *believe* hes on their side, policy be damned. If running right was the answer, wed see Democrats shit talk unions, talk about repealing the ACA, or lowering taxes on billionaires. But you dont see that, because those policies  even though theyre staple planks on a Republican platform  are untenable. Capitulating to the right will only ensure that the 40% of voters who actually care about truth and what is right will never be faithful to your party again. To win elections as a Democrat, you have to convince people that you are not just looking out for them, but that you are *one of them*. A politician would make an appeal on healthcare by laying out stats, telling you how much better it is for you or the economy, and detailing a plan to pay for it and how much it will add to the deficit. These are great to know, but voters dont even almost care. In that time period of explanation, youve convinced a tiny sliver that it was definitively a good plan, and the vast majority of people that youre a politician and not like them. Someone running for office who is one of them but not a Republican would sound like, Healthcare is too damn expensive. But the rest of the people on this stage dont even get that  theyre elected federal officials; these folks are getting the best healthcare in the world, for free, for life. Idk about you, but that sounds like a pretty raw deal for the rest of us. I dont think Ted Cruz deserves free healthcare for life, if you dont. I dont think I deserve free healthcare for life, if you dont. Its bullshit, this is America.

However, when it comes to allowing trans people in the military, they break for Harris. I would have liked to see a more straightforward question on this survey. The one here is asking voters whether they think there's too much focus on social issues like trans people relative to problems that the middle class face. IMO, it's basically asking them to rank priorities and grade whether Harris adheres to that ranking. That's different from a question like \\"Harris supports too many changes to accommodate trans people that I disagree with\\".I don't think you should be dismissive of any concerns about how highly that question ranked in people's choice to vote. While apathy is better than outright hostility, it still sucks. Especially because Harris really didn't focus hard on social issues and it seems like Trump hit a goldmine with that one ad. But I think the distinction is important.Americans in general are iffy about certain things like trans participation in sports, but I don't think they are bought into the rest of what the GOP wants to do. It's mostly an optics problem because Reps blow up the specific wedge issues like sports. It doesn't mean we should step away from other things, like their right to serve in the military, to not be discriminated against in the workplace, their right to healthcare, and others.","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

On the left (in the broadest possible sense of the left), people make the huge mistake of thinking that our leaders should actually be leading on issues. The truth is that groups need to do the person-to-person persuasion work down in the trenches until it becomes unacceptable for leaders not to follow them.Politicians have a limited ability to use the bully pulpit to change minds, but its very limited, and requires a persuadable audience. E.g., Obamas pivot on marriage equality probably helped the 2012 ballot initiatives win. But its rare that it works so well. (On that one, it also helped that news coverage of marriage legalization showed lines of boring normies afterwards. Its harder to feel like the foundations of society have been torn asunder when the actual outcome is that Joe from Finance, who did you a solid in the budget negotiations last year, is giddy about getting married.)I think the Internet is a huge problem here too, because every group only encounters every other group through their most strident posters.","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

It is basically the \\"biological sex is real\\" argument (with the dogwhistle being the implied \\"and gender is _not_ real\\") that the anti-trans side trots out. They want to get people to center \\"biological sex\\" in their mind with their messaging- this is why trans women are referred to as \\"biological males\\"- so that they can get biological sex restrictions enshrined into law that ban trans people from public life.

By telling people that things are better even if that's not what they see in their day to day life, Democrats are proving themselves to be out of touch and insensitive to the needs of the public. Trump has told people a simple thing: life sucks, and I'm going to fix it. Many people feel that their lives are not going well right now so obviously they will side with the candidate who agrees with them. On another level, the Democratic Party leadership is guilty of political mistakes on a catastrophic level. Biden promised he would be a transition to a new generation then went back on his word. He prevented a competitive primary from occurring and invalidated the results of the state of New Hampshire in the process because it didn't fit his agenda. He dropped out of the race with three months to go, leaving Kamala no time to establish herself as a candidate. His administration did not prepare Kamala as a successor--she was almost invisible the past four years. He anointed Kamala without a single vote for her in a primary which is frankly undemocratic. Again, there is a theme of dictating to voters how things are going to happen instead of listening to them. Such arrogance in talking down to the voter, dictating to them instead of listening, and telling them that their lived experience is wrong, deserved to be punished. And it has.","title":"I dont understand how Republicans became the party for the working class"},{"text":"Yes.

You have helped elect the modern Hitler and if they are the only ones that die at this point then it will be a miracle. Trump will stop the aid to Ukraine, shift aid to oppressing minorities ( including Muslims in different regions) and if the toll next year isn't millions dead something will have happened to stop Trump from causing/ helping cause it. So if you can't see -42 k &lt; hundreds thousands or millions dead as a , admittedly terrible win, idk what to do. However it's worse than that, we are assuming that we might have only held up the status quo but it was very possible that two branches of government could have been returned to sanity and after much work all three and the assistance to Israel be stopped, Putin be stopped, Ukraine saved etc and taking that into account the shift in possible lives saved vs the extras that will be killed it will be a death toll that I hope hangs on your head for generations ( if it cannot be prevented and you live long enough to see it occur).","title":"Dont dare blame Arab and Muslim Americans for Trumps victory | We did not betray the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party betrayed us"},{"text":"Gas feels higher where I'm at, but that's only because of where I came from.

People blame this 22% inflation spike on the sitting president, Biden, who inherited much of the woes caused by excess liquidity in the capital markets in the US. The popular government Covid spending programs added massive liquidity to the capital markets, as this added spending (like the zero interest rates, $1,400 checks to every citizen, and PPP loan programs during the tail end of the 1st Trump Administration that continued well into the Biden administration) took time to work through the economy. The economic effect of government/Fed intervention is always measured long after the fixes are initiated, as it takes time for the gauges to see the results to show up in our inflation readings (inflation is classically known as a Lagging Indicator). We have yet to see the full effect of the Biden policies on inflation as the IRA and CHIPs act are just starting to get underway.We will never see prices go down to pre-Covid levels, this is not how inflation works. This concept,  deflation, would be considered a very rare isolated event that would only happen in extreme over-supply or under-demand situations that never last long in any market. The government intervention on tap with the next administration (broad tariffs) will also become extremely inflationary and likely result in reduced available supply. This will effectively raise prices on most household necessities we import from foreign countries that are targeted with tariffs.Banks know what will happen, they are already raising mortgage rates (long term loans) to cover their risk, even when the FED has just started to lower interest rates (inflationary)!!! We are at the beginning of a perfect economic storm. Basic economics, buckle up fiscally and batten down the hatches, shit is gonna get dicey in the next fiscal year.","title":"Get Ready for Trump-flation: Trump won the election in part because of a backlash against consumer price inflation on Bidens watch.

It's 100% on the Dem partyIf your take away from my comment is that only the voter can be blamed, you are highly mistaken. The Democrats as a congregation definitely has their own share in this matter.As long as we continue this asinine belief that the only responsibility voters have in this electioneering process is to be courted to the ballot box, this will absolutely not change. This was true in 2016, when voters chose to not participate because their choice was between Clinton and the embodiment of all human vice. This was true in 2020, when voters chose to participate because they saw what this embodiment of all human vice did. This was true in 2008, when voters voted for Obama, a black man, and wanted change.We can absolutely criticize the Democrats for failing to show up, but absolving the voter of any responsibility in an electoral process which requires both voters and candidates to participate is merely avoiding the uncomfortable truth that the electorate at large is ill-educated, gullible, easily influenced, complacent, ignorant, or simply unwilling to commit to their civic responsibility. And if the electorate doesn't change, nothing is going to change. And it won't, because of attitudes like this.Democrats voters must fall in love to vote. The reason this is true because anything less than pure adoration will cause them to not show up. Even when the choice is between a qualified woman and the most heinous embodiment of human vice.The problem with this analogy is you can't please everyone. You can't make everyone love you. Maybe you might be successful if you tried.

I put a lot of faith in the younger generation to vote for what their generation espouses to believe in.  As a Gen Xer, its concerning to see how disconnected many Gen Zers are from the political realities that will shape their future. Growing up in the digital age, theyve been influenced by viral content and memes, but this often overshadows the deeper understanding of issues like tariffs, economics, and government institutions.For instance, when politicians talk about 50% or 100% tariffs, many young people mistakenly see it as a discount. But in reality, tariffs raise prices for consumers, hurt working-class families, and dont necessarily bring back jobs as promised. They also fail to understand the long-term impacts of their votesparticularly when it comes to issues like the Supreme Court, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ protections, the climate and government programs. Many in Gen Z also lack basic civics knowledge. Ask them about the three branches of government, and they might struggle to answer. Without this foundational knowledge, how can they understand the stakes of their votes?Its easy to vote based on who seems relatable or cool, but policies matter more than personalities. Elections have real-world consequences, and if Gen Z isnt careful, they may find their rights and freedoms slipping away due to uninformed choices. Its time to move beyond memes and social media culture and take a hard look at how their vote can shape the future.IMO I think Gen Z they saw Trump get shot as some warrior victim. And the victim mentality is strong in this generation. He saw him be goofy  and that translated as relatable vs ineptness. And as it is trending many did not know Biden was no longer a candidate.

One of the odd things about Obama's parentage is that his father was already married in Africa before coming to the US,  but married Dunham. According to 0bama's wiki, the marriage took place six months before Obama's birth.  That makes Obama's dad a bigamist in the US, despite his being a Muslim. Why Dunham married him anyway is kind of beyond me. Did he claim to be single? Just odd. Then a guy from Hawaii finishes law school and gets a three book contract deal?  And settles in Chicago, not in Hawaii or California, where he went to school or in NY, where he went to school? And pretty immediately gets in with wealthy, politically-connected Ayers and the Annenberg Foundation?  And somehow meets Kissinger protege  Geithner along the way?So, yeah, a charmed life, or who knows what?","title":"Democrats, the Party of Look Good (Virtue Signal) and Sound Good: Part I"},{"text":"Your context is a 30-chapter, 920-page book titled Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative PromiseAKA Project 2025You do with that as you wish.

The $1400 thing was a pilot program that sought to potentially cut costs. But there are also two different programs (allegedly). It seemed like this was initially a program meant to help homeless families. It is a 2-year program that 100 American families were brought into. Then there is a second program. It might be an extension of the first one, it might be a whole new thing. That program, the migrant one, was offered to 10 families (the Mayor said it could cut NYC costs by 20%), but was expected to grow to a similar (I can find numbers that suggest something like 500 people were expected to receive the benefit, but that was only 1 source, most other sources all agree on the 10 family number.) It looks like NYC is ending the program, maybe because more migrants are leaving than arriving. \\nI think that certain outlets were conflating the two programs somewhat. But I can't be certain.So what we have is:1) There is a Food Stamp (SNAP) benefit from the Federal Government, which I think NYC supplements. That's your $200 value.2) A $1400 homeless benefit offered to 100 families (UBI experiment for poor/homeless families). 3) A migrant $1400 a month to 10 migrant families which was an attempt to cut costs by the city but has now ended.\\nINFO NOTE: Trump has proposed cuts to SNAP, so that $200 value is probably going to drop if Repubs win the House (which they are projected to do unless Dems Reps over perform in 3 races).","title":"What the Left Keeps Getting Wrong"},{"text":"Me personally (not speaking for this sub) I dont care for her stances on gun control and outsourcing jobs.

It honestly seems like Democrats weren't being blamed, but rather the Biden admin.The key thing here is that Democrats need better messaging, Clinton and Obama won because they could sell their brand of politics, even though it was just standard third way liberalism.

Shit, even I want to believe that.A lot of the same messaging COULD be applied in left wing messaging, but we dont want to hear that we have to hurt everyone else. Immigrants, the poor, the needy, people with addictions, etc. we recognize that at the end of the day, were closer to being in that boat than we are in the elite class. We want them to do more, contribute more of their share. But we also recognize that we have to contribute, care, make an effort.And making an effort is just not attractive. Theres plenty of people on social media that say we have to work harder as a society, or the elite have too much power. Especially when the people spending money to boost messaging are likely to have a vested interest in suppressing that kind of messaging.Im not really sure what the answer is, but the average chucklefuck is dumb, lazy, and doesnt want to be told that theyre part of the problem. Its sort of like treating someone with addiction. They cant be bullied into treatment, they cant really be negotiated into treatment, they cant be forced into treatment (at least generally not successfully), they sort of have to decide that they want treatment.8/10 if the message is lets hold ourselves accountable to help be part of the solution, or its not your fault, its someone elses, were going with the latter.

I think I know why.Please hear my perspective with an open mind. As a white man with a shit ton of hobbies the far right circle for their pipeline - stocks, investments, crypto, ai, gaming, physical Fitness, entrepreneurship and innovation, I feel like I understand how they operate and how they have such a hold on people, better than most here within the leftist bubble. Its really quite simple, the Republican messaging is more potent, and people fall victim to misinformation easier because \\n1) the republicans dominate social media across a wide range of hobbies. For those of us into politics, we see how democrats dominate the political bubble, but if you play games, or think the new Star Wars movies are crap, or want to use ai, you will come across numerous right wing channels that are the mouth of the pipeline. They push you little by little, and then once you are susceptible to ideas, the algorithm takes hold. However, why are people susceptible to ideas from the right?2) because the leftist position on every single social issue is NOT the common sense position. Its NOT common sense that using ai is evil but using photoshop is not. Its NOT common sense that capitalism is pure evil (its how we build a functional world). its NOT common sense to say that we should allow illegal immigrants to exist in this country (yea yea they help our economy- sorry my fellow brainrots, thats the intellectual position, the common sense position is in the name ILLEGAL immigrants), its NOT common sense to say that trans women should be allowed in womens sports (sorry but there are biological differences between sexes that result in physical differences regardless of how early you start hormones). Its NOT the common sense position to say that a conflict in the Middle East that has been going on for hundreds of years with harm in both sides is just because of the white Zionist Americans. It NOT the common sense position that we can say Black Lives Matter but not ALL lives matter. (I get the intellectual reasons, but its not common sense). Its NOT common sense to say that all men are evil. Its not common sense to say women should be allowed to go toppless (because it ignores the fundamental reality of sexual arousal mechanisms in men). Its NOT common sense to use they as a non-binary person..(for fucks sake it confuses me every time, like whos the group we are referring to ??). Its NOT common sense that minorities are owed reparations, or that established countries should bay hundreds of billions to Haiti or other places as payback.  Its NOT common sense that if your not Asian you cant sell boba (the common sense take is their business was shit and they didnt understand their own market, but of course simu brought race into the discussion). Fuck its NOT even common sense that we need to completely shift to green energy right now (Im a huge environmentalist by the way, and even I can admit its not clear for people)I could go on and on and on, because I have seen every one of these issues push normal people a bit further right little by little, for YEARS. \\nAgain, while some of the above may piss people off, and may get the woke mob to attack me (thats kind of the problem lol), its clear that this is what America feels. And if we, all of us people who believe in social issues and progress want to make the world a better place, we must meet people where they are. So what are we going to do?  Am\\nI going to get downvoted to the end of the earth for trying to acknowledge reality?  Weve already seen people latch onto every reason but the core issue. Theyve identified wounds, and rightly so, wounds that must be bandaged, but they havnt identified the disease. I dont see the far left changing things. Its a cult as much as maga. But rather than have a cult leader at their helm, the lefts cult leader is a chip on their shoulder and hatred for the out group, for the establishment. Ive said this before, in fact, Ive said it all through the election cycle. Fuck the far left. They are disconnected from reality. Dont believe me?  Look at the gen z numbers. The progressive movement as we know it are dead. We must acknowledge that if we still hope to make the world a better place. And if you agree with me, please take this to heart, because as weve just seen in this election -the left and gen z and minorities will NOT get off their ass to help themselves, so its up to people like us, who might be more willing to play the game, to try and achieve real progress. We need a social media and media ecosystem like the right, and we cant do that if we dont meet Americans where we are. We MUST, for example, put ourselves down slightly to connect with people on a real level.  Ill close with a great example. If I watch the new season of doctor who (or Star Wars or anything), and I think that making the doctor trans or bisexual or non binary or whatever the fuck takes AWAY from doctor who, pulls you out of the universe, and is cringe, Im going to go onto social media and type the new season of doctor who sucks.   Every piece of content agreeing with that sentiment will be from the mouths of the far right pipeline. Filled with Conservative leaning influencers who are capitalizing on the anti common sense take, to get views. But then the algorithms take over, and eventually Im recommended a video (how wokism killed doctor who). And if Im not strong of mind, Im sucked in. If I have less exposure to leftist issues or people then I think  wow the left are crazy they must all be crazy. There is NOT A SINGLE piece of content about doctor who praising it, without ALSO saying how its such a big deal and such progress, how representative and diverse. THATS NOT THE POINT OF THE SHOW. The show sucks, the writing sucks, everything got worse, and everyone is saying how its a huge social success, and that makes people on the right, and people in the middle think the left are the wierd ones And this happens with every single issue under the sun (some of which I mentioned earlier). Its time for the moderate dems to play ball, because its fucking clear the leftists wont even lift a finger to vote, let alone self reflect.  Its time for moderate people like myself who feel the same way to stop hiding their views because of fear of retaliation from the far left. All this view hiding in service of progress has left a void, and the conservatives are absolutelt filling that void. We want change? The wounds are the minority vote and the inflation bullshit and the misinformation,the disease is the extreme leftism that leaves a void.

Donald Trump has never in his life had a positive impact on anyones finances, including his own. The man has accrued more debt and failed businesses than some entire nations have managed. On top of that, we already had 4 years of a Trump presidency and he absolutely tanked the economy in that time. He raised the national debt by 8 trillion dollars, he cut taxes for himself and his wealthy friends while increasing the tax burden on the working class and small businesses, and he even used tariffs the first time he was in office to try and offset some of the massive debt he was piling onto the nation and it did exactly what every person with a brain expects tariffs to do: it raised prices on all the goods that were tariffed. Even if you were to ignore the racism, the misogyny, the criminal activity, the constant lying, cheating, and insane rambling Donald Trump would still be one of the least qualified people on the planet to be the leader of the United States. Hell, I wouldnt trust him to be the assistant manager of a McDonalds. Trump has made it painfully clear that Americas system of governance fundamentally doesnt work. If a man like him can become president, commit an insane number of crimes, be impeached twice without being removed from office, go on to commit even more crimes including actual treason, be convicted of 34 felonies, and still be elected as president a second time, what is the purpose of our constitution? The concept of checks and balances is a fairy tale, the idea of a responsible, educated electorate is an absolute joke, and the people that govern us are above the law. At this point the only shred of hope I have in the American political system is that the electoral college will serve the only function it actually exists for: choosing a suitable president when the general population has failed to do so. Perhaps we can have enough faithless electors recognize that 4 more years of Trump is a death sentence for this nation and do the right thing for America, but Im not gonna hold my breath.","title":"These policies for the Democratic party, for starters"},{"text":"Podcasts, get people to move off twitter.

Democrats should again push for passage of the strict border-security bill written by Sen.

He has two years and one mouth, and he needs to use them with that proportion.While Moulton is not the only Democrat to call for a reckoning following election losses  Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats?[said Wednesday](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/06/nation/bernie-sanders-2024-election/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)?that the party abandoned working class people  observers felt Moultons comments were mean-spirited and unnecessary.Moultons comments drew strong rebukes from Democrats and?the LGTBQ community in Massachusetts,?[who have been outspoken?](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/07/metro/lgbtq-voters-reax-trump-reelection/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)in recent days after former president Donald Trump, whod?[made attacking transgender Americans central to his campaign](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/01/nation/trump-makes-anti-trans-attacks-central-his-campaigns-closing-argument/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), won a second term in the White House on Tuesday.","title":"Top aide resigns amid criticism over Seth Moultons comments on trans athletes"},{"text":"Don't have time to dig for it right now, but there was a (proposed?) program in the UK a year or so ago, supposedly focused on helping boys and young men.

Maybe I am missing the point, but the author seems to use the challenges of NYC and what isn't working in its current governing, and extrapolating that outward. However, NYC is a very different city from many of the swing states, and many of these things aren't applicable.I've lived in NYC for 12 years, and South Florida prior to that. Some of these issues are not unique to Democratic governance. For example, \\"the braindead symbolism\\" is something republicans are great at, just look at all the lawsuits Desantis passed against big tech and Disney to spite \\"the woke\\". Also, the state amendment on abortion isn't just symbolism, its added friction incase the federal government decides to pass a nationwide ban. We've seen this exact conflict of state vs federal law before with marijuana legalization. Broken promises are a constant theme of Trump. Border walls, Mexico paying for it, protecting womens rights... this is not exclusive to democrats, and i'd argue a bigger problem with republican leaders.Ill end by saying I highly agree with this paragraph: \\"Democrats are making too many promises;?\\". To be fair, Trump does the same thing, but hes not held to the same standard of integrity and people give him a pass for ranting. He also drives home 1 or 2 points, mainly immigration. I dont know exactly how the democrats failed here, but i think it is clear that poor communication is a big factor.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"I mean it doesn't have to be that way.

It's not like conservatives in California somehow shouldn't get a voice, but with the EC they never will on a federal level.Also I think when people are an opposite voter of their state's majority they know that due to the EC their vote is likely to not matter. Ex. conservatives in MA, liberals in Oklahoma, conservatives in VT. This sentiment definitely contributes towards lower participation in democracy.Additionally rural America isn't some defenseless sheep, they're like 20% of the countries population.","title":"There is no such thing as blue states but there are definitely blue cities"},{"text":"What an amazing father.

We acknowledged that women and people of color were disadvantaged. So far so good! So we enacted some policies - decades ago - to remedy that. And then we took it far.

Now you're saying she got too few votes, which also means election fraud? When every outcome means election fraud, you're just making assumptions.If they could do voter fraud in 2020 so well that there was no evidence linking them to the crime, how is it that they were not able to do voter fraud in 2024? Especially given that Trump was president in 2020. In 2024 the democrats had the advantage of the presidency to hide any voter fraud. I guess they just forgot to steal it this time?Less than 60% of California has been counted so far. Harris is up to 69.2 million now. Biden got 11 million from California in 2020. Assuming Harris did the same (though I know she did a little worse), we could expect about 4.5 million more for Harris from California in the coming days. Add that to other states that didn't finish counting yet and I expect her total to level out at a little over 73 million.Trump now has the power to lay out the case for 2020 voter fraud and arrest the criminals responsible. But I suspect he will never mention 2020 voter fraud again. He got what he needed out of that story just like he got what he needed by telling everyone he was gonna throw Hillary Clinton in jail in 2016. He doesn't need you to believe it anymore so it's getting dropped like a hot potato. If you still believe there was widespread voter fraud in 2020, you should be steaming mad when Trump doesn't investigate it or prosecute anyone over it. But most republicans are probably gonna drop it too. Be honest, y'all knew the strategy the whole time and just played along.As a Harris supporter, you have my heartfelt congratulations. Not only did your guy win, he won fair and square. You showed me his ideas are popular and most Americans think he offers a better path for the country.

After this whole thing settles, there can only be one responsible party: the Democrats.We will just ignore the fact that incumbents have been losing elections globally at unprecedented rates this year, that Harris' margin of loss in raw counts is smaller than most elections this year is smaller than most. The electorate will never take responsibility for their failure to make the sound choice in a moment of critical civic responsibility. And when 2026 comes round and if we have another national election, the same song and dance: what can my politician do for me, and if they're not literally everything I want, I will spite them by not supporting them no matter what they say, because tolerating compromise is unpalatable, even when the opposition supports the most heinous embodiment of all human vice.

Any work on the house is expensive as fuck. Most things are. The difference is that I know better than to place the president who has little control over these things, and I'm just not hurt as badly as many. I can accept this reality and move on.But for many, CC debt and delinquency is up, savings are down. Now you can (and I would) argue that's people spending beyond their means oftentimes - buying a 80k truck they can't afford - but that doesn't buy you any votes. Americans feel entitled to live beyond their means and have for decades. Yet others who did not switch jobs and get an inflation-adjusted wage boost perhaps are truly poorer, but I'd also argue it's their fault for not seeking a raise - and yet that won't win you votes either, to blame them, even if it's correct.I'm also making more money and overall no doubt I'm ahead of what inflation cut into, but I'm still *annoyed*. That's my lived reality, even if I know that it makes no sense to blame the current admin who has little control over monetary police and inflation directly, and did what they thought was best to combat it (and it largely worked). I can't lie and saying paying my Geico bill yesterday didn't annoy me, it's so fuckin' much more than a few years ago.Are people feeling poorer because our facts are wrong and they actually are poorer?They're often not actually poorer but they feel poorer. It's not that foreign to understand, and it doesn't help that key costs like housing, childcare, and borrowing money (big one) are way up. Homes cost 2x the monthly they did 5 years ago. Rent is largely up due to NIMBYs.  Some are poorer, most just feel poorer, but in reality it's the same result - they are mad at the incumbent. Or are they feeling poorer because they're constantly being told that they should be feeling poorer by a powerful media machine with an incentive to push this narrative?Yes probably, most people on the left wing side even bitch about how we're in a recession, I hear it all the time from educated urbanite sorts. You can (and I do) tell them it's incorrect, but they just go \\"well it feels like we are!\\" and that's that, isn't it? Can't argue with people who start with an emotional response.But moreso than misinformation is again that lived experience I mentioned above. That your favorite restaurant cost $40 more this year than a few ago and you're expected to leave a bigger tip is maddening. That a plumber wants $200 to unclog a sink is stupid. But that's where we are. And I know many under 40s who are simply depressed, thinking they'll never be able to buy a home or even a crapshack within 200 miles of their home. And they should be pissed, but again most blame corps, immigrants, landlords, Airbnb, and the incumbents wrongly and not the true culprit - their local NIMBY asshats and captured local gov. They don't even know or care about those things.People being angry and directing that anger/blame to the wrong thing is as American as apple pie, to be honest. It's our proudest, dumbest tradition.
