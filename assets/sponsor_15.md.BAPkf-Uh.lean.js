Enki, who valued humanity as inherently worthy and empowered us through knowledge, contrasts sharply with Enlils controlling, authoritarian approach. Similarly, Jesus focused on compassion, liberation, and the empowerment of individuals, often challenging the established religious and social norms of his time. Like Enki, Jesus preached love, forgiveness, and spiritual freedom, directly opposing the structures that restricted personal growth and autonomy.Where Enlil in Sumerian mythology enforced strict order and punishment, Jesus embodied Enkis compassion and resistance to retribution. He encouraged seeking truth, self-awareness, and inner transformationall values Enki represented as the bringer of knowledge in Eden. Jesus message that the truth shall set you free mirrors Enkis gift of knowledge, suggesting that both figures advocated for humanitys enlightenment and independence from oppressive structures.Now, when we look at the New Testament Yahweh, his character shifts dramatically compared to the Old Testament, aligning more with Marduk (or Amen Ra), who also sought singular, centralized worship and authority. Marduk strove to be the supreme deity, requiring unwavering devotion and redefining loyalty. In the New Testament, Yahweh becomes a singular god of redemption, one whose message consolidates worship and faith around him, reflecting Marduks own push for dominance and exclusivity in ancient Mesopotamian myth.In contrast, Old Testament Yahweh often mirrors both Enlil and Enki, depending on the story. In wrathful tales like the Flood or Sodom and Gomorrah, Yahweh reflects Enlils punishing control and readiness to reset humanity when we stray too far. Yet, there are also Old Testament moments that reflect Enkis nurturing spirit. In stories like Eden, where the serpent (a symbol of Enki) offers knowledge, or in Exodus, where God liberates the oppressed, we see a compassionate, guiding side of Yahweh that aligns with Enkis ideals of guidance and growth.When we consider Jesus as embodying Enkis legacy, a stark contrast emerges between him and New Testament Yahweh as Marduk. Jesus, like Enki, promotes compassion, inner transformation, and defiance of oppressive authorityvalues that seem to counter Marduks demand for centralized control. This interpretation suggests the Old Testament God swings between Enlil and Enki depending on the context, while the New Testament shifts toward a Yahweh akin to Marduk, demanding singular loyalty.In essence, the Bible can be seen as a battleground of Anunnaki influences: Enlils control, Enkis liberation, and Marduks consolidation of power. Jesus embodies Enkis ideals, advocating for love, knowledge, and empowerment in opposition to forces that restrict human potential. This perspective reframes familiar biblical narratives as part of a larger cosmic power struggle, revealing hidden layers of influence on our spiritual heritage.","title":"The Eagle vs. The Serpent: Rivalry(Continued)"},{"text":"THEY'RE EATING THE PETS","title":"Before six months ago, literally no one wanted Harris for president"},{"text":"Because 70+ is too old.

But if you spend two seconds trying to figure out how you should treat immigrants, the result is clear and exeedingly obvious. And yet Christians go the *exact* opposite way with immigrants, valuing our money over their lives. (Ironically their policies would actually make us have less money, not more, but that is a different point.)It is stuff like this that drove me from the Church.

Spend time criticizing others, and photoshopping pictures."},{"text":"Honestly, theres a lot to unpack here, so lets look at a few things.First, on the free loans to bankers during the Obama yearsyeah, its frustrating. The Fed did support banks, but Obama also led the economy out of the 2008 crash with consistent job growth that benefited a lot of everyday people. Corporate influence is a huge issue, but its been around for decades; he didnt create it.On Trumps tax cuts: its a stretch to say they didnt add to the debt. Those cuts tacked on over a trillion dollars, mostly benefiting corporations and the wealthy. The promised job boom didnt really happen; instead, we saw increased corporate profits without much trickle-down to everyday workers.The trade war with China? That hit American farmers and manufacturers hard, leading to billions in government bailouts just to keep some businesses afloat. Plus, U.S. businesses relying on imports saw costs rise, which often means higher prices for consumers. Even if inflation was stable then, the ripple effects of those tariffs are part of the supply chain mess were dealing with now.And on inflationits not just a Biden issue. Inflation is up around the world due to supply chain disruptions, energy markets, and global recovery from COVID. Bidens energy policies might feel like a tough shift, but they aim to reduce our dependence on oil long-term, which most experts agree is critical.When it comes to proposals from Harris (and the Biden administration) versus Trumps approach, economists generally favor Harriss focus on investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and workforce training, seeing them as steps to create sustainable growth. By contrast, experts criticized Trumps policies for prioritizing short-term gains, like tax cuts for the wealthy, over long-term economic resilience. Even on trade, many economists saw Trumps tariffs as disruptive without a clear benefit for American workers or consumers. In short, experts tend to agree that Harriss proposals are aimed at building a more stable, resilient economy, while Trumps policies often prioritized short-term wins but left some significant vulnerabilities behind. Other than the economy, are there other reasons you support Trump? Thanks for sharing your thoughts in more detail by the way.","title":"Endorsement: Kamala Harris for president to put an end to Trumps long con"},{"text":"One of the authors is a current Republican Representative.?

Most of the problems we see now with these predatory companies coming in and swooping up everything with full financial control is a direct result of Obama's policies. Tax cuts did not lead to bigger national debt. Prior to world war 2, there was virtually no income tax. What happens is when you tax incomes, be it for the middle or upper class, it causes wealthy people to hire less and middle class and poor people to work less. If the tax cuts are aligning with GDP growth then it is a net benefit for the economy.The trade war with China did not hurt anyone. People say that but it just didn't happen. Inflation was exactly where it needed to be in an optimal U.S. economy at the time Trump was president. The inflation we see now started with the Biden administration's second year, which was a direct result of excessive government spending and the most atrocious, evil energy policy in United States history. The reason things are even worse are because the Biden administration had no idea how to set controls or limits on anything they were doing, so they forced the hand of federal reserve to hike the interest rates which instantly made everything even more unaffordable and killed much of the hot job market, which we now see in the recent jobs report which shows a net loss of public sector jobs. And all this is before we even get into the disasterous economic results of letting 20 million poor people seeking shelter and resources, some being criminals, into the country.What you're saying just simply isn't true, but I don't blame you because the media sources you digest probably don't even report on it. The record high inflation and terrible job market are a direct result of Biden's policies and people who vote for Kamala Harris are sadly just going to prolong this misery for four more years.","title":"Endorsement: Kamala Harris for president to put an end to Trumps long con"},{"text":"To be clear.

I was in public school until 2nd grade before switching to online homeschooling, where I completed nine grade levels. Unlike many homeschoolers in my agricultural state who need it due to distance, I live in the city, and my mom chose it because she felt local schools didnt measure up to our Asian standards lol.My mother has a degree in education, teaching experience, and even started a school in her home country. She was hands-on, sitting with me daily to help me stay focused, made me do khan academy to get ahead since Kumon was full. My dad helped me with math and history since he's a civil engineer. I went to to playgrounds and libraries and, later, a hybrid program that offered in-person classes twice a week with other online students (hated it). I was extremely gifted in English back then, and ranked 99th percentile often statewide both online and in public school. In middle school, I briefly returned to public and asked to go back to homeschooling, where I could work independently. By then, I could navigate online classes on my own, and I took full responsibility for my studies. When middle school ended, I had some FOMO about the teenage experience and wanted to try regular school. But after checking out a few high schools, I didn't like it and wanted a focused, quieter study environment. I had a solid group of friends, I kept up a healthy lifestyle, volunteered, was student council president, graduated early at 16 in the top 0.1% of an 800-student class. I also scored around 1300 on the SAT, did tons of extracurriculars, and got into a great tech school, though I took a gap year to study my religion in another state. Everyone I knew thought I was private schooled. I have a great group of close friends and a pretty large group of \\"hangout-able\\" friends AKA they're fun to do stuff with but we're never close. This is all while being possibly neurodivergent and a bit of a procrastinator.In contrast, my best friend was homeschooled from kindergarten through 12th grade but she has ADHD and needed structure and social interaction that werent provided. Without parental support to stay on top of her assignments, she often fell semesters behind, then would catch up to it by not sleeping for a week, procrastinate doing her work next time around, and cycle repeats. She also struggled with social cues and just general social skills/making real friends, and didn't get her own phone until recently. Due to this, most kids our age around her didn't treat her kindly. To this day, she wishes shed gone to public school, while I am SO glad I did online.  Im still considering an online university to accelerate my degree, so that I can finish by age 19 or 20 and maybe even get more degrees after. Who knows? I have my whole life ahead of me.TLDR: If the parents are willing to put in a ton of work and mold the environment around the child and their needs, homeschool can be an amazing, perhaps even BETTER option.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Obamas bank bailoutThis falsity.

Schools are underfunded and understaffed with classrooms full of kids that have vastly different levels of ability. Having focused 1:1 time that is specifically tailored to that child can be extremely valuable. I was homeschooled until 9th grade and I'm honestly pretty neutral about it. My mom made the decision when my smarter than average older sister was in 4th grade and being held back by the rest of the class so my mom pulled her out of public school and then homeschooled all three of her daughters. My older sister went to college a year early and then graduated in 3 years at the age of 20. I went to highschool and got straight A's and then got an engineering degree. My younger sister did just fine when she went back at 7th grade and she is now an elementary school teacher. We're all slightly socially awkward but no more than your average person that went to public school so I don't really think we can blame homeschooling on that. Middle school is full of incredibly mean bullying, it's hard to make an argument that that's healthy for young kids to experience. I went to school for band and I sports, I had other homeschooling friends, I was in girl scouts and had friends at church. I fully believe I got a better education homeschooling than I would have at the public school in our rural town in a red state but I believe kids that went to school in better school districts got a better education than I did.

No coops, extracurriculars, youth groups, etc. I spent my days doing school in my pjs, reading books, and playing outside along with my siblings. Could not have asked for a more fun childhood.  \\nFlash forward: I am in my 4th and final year of college graduating with a Bacholers in mathematics with a minor in computer science, with plans on going to graduate school for electrical engineering within the next 2 years. My brother (21M), who was raised the same as me, is also on track to get a math degree and has already had multiple professors push him to do a PhD in mathematics once he finishes undergrad due to how exceptional his grades are in advanced math classes. In all honesty, it is somewhat funny when I hear some people say homeschooling sets kids back academically when these same people probably couldn't pass a semester of basic calculus or chemistry. I want to note too, I am not gifted academically in any way. I was never a prodigy. I just take school seriously and enjoy learning.Socially, I would say I am on par with or ahead of my peers. I've held multiple officer positions at clubs at my college, go out with friends regularly, host parties, go to the gym nearly every day, and have a variety of hobbies. Growing up, I never had to worry about what my peers thought about me and was able to avoid a lot of negative social experiences, so by the time I got to college and the workforce (I worked as a barista for a while), I felt very confident in who I was. Are there negatives to homeschooling? Sure. It can feel isolating sometimes, and you might not know all the pop culture references or shows or movies that your peers do, and going into college can be a bit of a fish-out-of-water experience for the first semester or so.

Its fascinating that even within a single faith, the schisms and denominational disputes keep members so deeply attached to their specific doctrines, resisting anything that might threaten or upend the status quo. Youre right to point out that this isnt a new debate; the early church councils worked hard to silence anything resembling gnostic ideas by excluding it from the canon, creating a biblical narrative with clear lines and limited room for alternative interpretations. That rigid structure leaves little space for anything outside its established doctrines, especially insights that encourage more personal or mystical exploration.I agreesome of the mystical sects within these traditions are already seen as fringe or even heretical, so they might be more open to these kinds of conversations. But within the mainstream? Its unlikely. The mainstream narrative is crafted to be easily digestible and, honestly, immune to questions that challenge its foundations.Outside of these rigid frameworks, its refreshing to see the openness of practices like paganism, witchcraft, and shamanism, where people are encouraged to explore without fear of condemnation or dogmatic constraints. This freedom allows for a far more nuanced understanding of the world, and it leads to a healthier, more balanced outlook.Like you, my path diverged from the strict biblical lens a while ago. I see how it works for those who need it, but the structure is often too binary to tackle the complexities of existence. Simple answers and rigid lines dont hold up in a world that is anything but black and white. When the very foundation is so limited, it cant provide the answers it claims to hold.I would like to add that Christianity can open something deeper for the right person and most people do believe there is something more to this. Christianity and all of the other mainstream religions have perfected the psychological tactics to keep someone indoctrinated. We need to use the same skillset for the truth. Its very clear that a testimony of something can drive an individual to represent anything. Its time to help those who dont have a testimony of reality get one. Its annoying but we need to face opposition at work, home, and abroad just like the old faithful. People really believe the only way to be good is through a higher power, but its really a way to excuse ourselves from the responsibility of choosing and being wrong. Its time for humanity to grow up and become responsible for our own choices. We need to stop blaming god and blame ourselves.","title":"The Eagle vs. The Serpent: Rivalry(Continued)"},{"text":"Propaganda machine has been working overtime","title":"Before six months ago, literally no one wanted Harris for president"},{"text":"We may not look like much but we've got it where it counts.","title":"Kamala Harris takes two point lead over Trump in final must-win state: Poll"},{"text":"Is there a jerk off emoji?

I think there are a few things we could start thinking about and likely many more that I haven't thought of.First, I'd suggest we block all internet traffic from any country that we find has a large amount of propaganda coming out of it.  Namely, Russia, China, Iran, etc...  In the case of China, this would be difficult, but it would hurt them far more than us.  I think we'd likely see Chinese bot farms shut down pretty quickly.  Yes, these countries would (and do) export these farms out to other countries, but that would also likely end with the threat of being cut off from US internet traffic.Second, we need to start treating cyber-attacks as what they are.  Acts of war.  We should be informing these hostile nations that we will retaliate if any such attacks occur and that we will not restrict ourselves to only counter cyber-attacks.  All proportional options should be on the table.Third, we need to start focusing on what freedom of speech means.  It means the ability to voice a fact or opinion without repercussion from the government.  It does not mean an ability to spread lies without limitation.  There is a big difference between stating an unpopular opinion and baldly lying about events.  We also have to codify the fact that money does not equal speech.Fourth, we can no longer give bad actors the ability to cause violence and chaos simply because they are wealthy.  trump is spreading hatred and anger throughout the internet.  It's time to shut this down and prosecute him to the fullest extent.  This means locking him up without bail if he can't control himself during the trial.I'm sure many people can pick holes in my suggestions because there are holes in them.  But I think they're a decent starting point for protecting this country from bad actors in future.","title":"To save our democracy, we must get rid of online anonymity"},{"text":"wait so the guy who wants to ramp up the genocide is the same as the people calling for a cease fire? got it","title":"Bernie Sanders: Trump 'in bed' with Netanyahu, GOP 'far worse' for Gaza"},{"text":"Ann Seltzer predicted Obamas wins in Iowa as well.

And in true mastermind fashion I have started and so I shall finish.50 or so pages in, reading the foreword and the section on White house offices. It screeches of McCarthyism, citing the need to suppress China in this case. The foreword states that they would like to dictate who tech companies do business with, limit the ability to protest conservatives, increase the partisan nature of Govt by actively ignoring non-partisan sources and, my favourite, they literally used the word muzzle in relation to opposing political viewpoints in Govt, elected or otherwise.The section on the white house offices is quite interesting, though each one is ended by stating that the appointed individual should be personally loyal to the president and their interpretation of the constitution rather than the office of the executive, though as I understand interpretation of the constitution falls under the purview of the judiciary rather than the executive.

So as long as they show the other guy for an equal amount of time on any of their broadcast programs, then there's no violation here.  Here's an explanation from the FCC:  FCC rules seek to ensure that no legally qualified candidate for office is unfairly given less access to the\\nairwaves C outside of bona fide news exemptions C than their opponent. Equal opportunities generally\\nmeans providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to\\nprovide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate. ...   TV/RADIO PERSONALITY RUNS FOR OFFICE C If a known personality appears on the air of a broadcast radio or TV show and has achieved the status of legally qualified candidate, this will ordinarily constitute a use for which the station will be required to entertain requests for Equal Opportunities by opposing legally qualified candidates for the same office. However, the\\nstation is not required to seek out opposing legally qualified candidates and offer them Equal Opportunities.\\n https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/political_programming_fact_sheet.pdfI suspect the other guy would never want to be seen availing himself of anything called \\"Equal Opportunity\\".  But either way, he has to request it and they are not obligated to put him on the same program.  Additionally, the other campaigns have 7 days to request compensatory airtime.  The network is not obligated to reach out to those other candidates.  There could only be a violation if they ask within 7 days and are denied.\\nAlso, looks like that FCC commissioner should familiarize himself with the organization he works in.","title":"FCC Commissioner Claims Kamala Harris SNL Appearance Violated Equal Time Rule"},{"text":"Indeed.","title":"So I broke YouGov's AI Chat Bot Survey"},{"text":"I don't think it's suspicious that a woman would want to support a candidate that isn't a rapist.","title":"Jennifer Lawrence Knocks on Doors in Las Vegas for Kamala Harris Ahead of Election Day"},{"text":"We cannot allow Dementia Don to take the helm this year.","title":"Donald Trump's Nephew Recalls Grandpa's Dementia Symptoms as He Warns of Former President's 'Decline'"},{"text":"From the article:\\"Previously, I have been outspoken against verification systems. A decade ago, as a steering committee member of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace and the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group, I fought against the proposed national identity system. It was, I believed at the time, a violation of the individual right to privacy.  Fast-forward to today, however, and user ID verification has become a necessity. True verification is the only viable way for a social media platform to avoid the onslaught of bots, trolls and manipulative human forces hiding behind the curtain of anonymity. The present and future of democracy is at stake. Its also the only way to protect kids. According to the U.S. Surgeon Generals national advisory in 2023, nearly 40 percent of children ages 8C12 use social media. At the same time, adults can pretend to be kids to deceitfully interact with them. Heres the reality check: Our personally identifiable data is already out there. Its in the hands of marketing companies, data brokers, the dark web and governments worldwide. Its time to end the charade and acknowledge that our human and digital identities are known. We should leverage this data constructively, while vigorously protecting our privacy as much as possible. \\" This author brings up good points, but he's putting the burden on the USER to give up their privacy\\\\data, and not on the social media platforms to be responsible with both their user data and their user screening process.","title":"To save our democracy, we must get rid of online anonymity"},{"text":"Hmm, let's say this one out loud.

Biden released oil from our reserves to keep gas prices lower during the big price surge (which he has since refilled). Biden and Democrats passed the inflation reduction act, which has brought inflation down to a normal level. When voters and the party itself was worried about a Biden candidacy, he dropped out and let Harris take over. Harris has been talking almost nonstop about increasing housing development, child tax credits of $6,000, down payment assistance of $20,000 for first time home buyers, and expanding Medicare to include in home care. These are all things that would help Americans with our concerns. You may have had a point 8 years ago, but this hasn't been true for the last 4 years, at least.\\nthey spend the better part of the last decade either trying to impeach Trump or to make it so that he wouldn't be able to runThese are reasonable things to do.

He also increased drone strikes, bombed Syria, assassinated Soleimani, and refused to pull out of Afghanistan (as he promised). These things get no coverage or critical analysis. He says unhinged shit all the time and can barely function and it gets very little media attention.

Youre spot-on about the bias against serpentine symbols like Enki in Abrahamic religions. This bias has obscured Enkis role as a protector and knowledge-giver, especially when compared to Enlils controlling influence. Understanding the Sumerian context before Abrahams time, and the figures like Utnapishtim, sheds light on how ancient myths were reframed, often demonizing wisdom figures like Enki who encouraged human independence.The Tower of Babel story, for instance, wasnt just about languagesit was a strategic reset by Enlil to keep humanity fragmented and reliant. Enki, on the other hand, gave us tools for self-reliance and growth, fostering a bond that views humans as his children, not mere subjects.Today, Enkis vision could inspire us to challenge restrictive power structures and embrace unity, knowledge, and compassion. Reclaiming this ancient wisdom could be our way of breaking free from cycles of control and empowering humanitys future.Its a challenging shift, but exploring these origins gives us a fresh lens on our own journey.

Texas has a younger, more hispanic population, and Trump has been doing well with hispanic men. Georgia has a very high black population, and Trump has been doing significantly better with black men than in 2020. If this Iowa poll is true, Harris wins the rust belt and with that the election, but just because this poll predicts a ~10 point swing in Iowa, that doesnt mean that there would be a ~10 point swing in Texas, Florida, Ohio, etc.The other important thing is that this women-led push for Kamala in Iowa is largely due to Iowa recently enacting a draconian 6-week abortion ban.

There are tweets you can look up of GOP congressmen taking credit for something they voted against. 3. Bidens admin capped insulin prices. But Trump and MAGA genuinely believe that Trump did this.

What's more, Obama had a strong capacity to lead and many ideas, and an efficient team and strong united party behind him when running against Mc Cain. As I said in my post Mrs Harris seems on the contrary to have inherited the political situation. She does I'm sure have lots going for her but if it's implied her ethnicity is in itself progress... Electing someone with such important powers based on ethnicity is something pretty weird considering you have the biggest military power in the world to manage &amp; are facing a zillion of challenges (world order changes, Ukraine, China), the powers of the POTUS being extreme abroad but seemingly quite insufficient to change US society - changing the Supreme Court and having a Congress majority are at least necessary steps to do real change, and then you still have many electoral cycles and constitutional barriers to contend with. But my pov is very \\"foreign\\" ofc, I'm not living in the US. I'm just saying I would not choose who pilot a plane based on ethnicity so I hope it's not just symbolism at play in electoral choices now. About A. Gorman - I'm sure doing very expensive schools is enough to make you stand miles spart from poor kids usual issues. What strikes me is that she gave a speech at Biden's inauguration, a very nice poem, clothed in Gucci or something similar, and I think it may illustrate that your biggest divide is not perhaps the one you think the most about. Poverty means no opportunities for the many kids stricken by it. But for the translation issue I may have been wrong. I remembered it in the way I said. If a translator is not picked on the color of his or her skin, great. I fear the Diversity and Inclusion policies are running a risk of forgetting that not everything is about your identity. It can be nice to NOT be considered according to age, sex, \\"race\\", sexual orientation,  religion,  handicap, etc.  In that spirit and having known a racist regime (Vichy) we banished the State from listing who was what. Does it mean there's no racism ? No. Does it mean racism is ignored ? I certainly hope not and we don't just rely on hope : there are laws, commemorative events,  a justice system that is working still, if not perfectly, to protect against ethnic discriminations. Of course it doesn't mean there's no backclash with for instance immigrants but the rise of Trump shows you have exactly the same issue on that ground, with even harsher words.

In part because of how close the polling has been. All the swing states are within the margin of error, so if there's any polling error one way or the other, then all the swing states could lean the same way and deliver a landslide.For instance, if there's a large number of \\"hidden Harris voters\\" and most polls are underestimating her, then a few extra points across the board could see Harris sweep the swing states and blow it out. This Selzer poll opens the question of whether such an error might be big enough to see a few red states flip as well.On the other hand, if the polls are underestimating Trump, then we could see him sweep the swing states and win in a landslide.It's possible that the swing states will split and deliver a very close contest, but that would require the polling to have been very accurate, which is actually less likely. And a close contest like that favors Trump.

Policy choices don't matter to the voters that actually swing elections. It's all vibes. The candidate with the best vibes, especially right at the election, wins the one with worse vibes lose. Think of every election since the beginning of the 90s. It's all about the feelings around a candidate, not specific policies. Even 2016, there was a close divide on who had the most negative vibes, but Trump got the nod because of being the change candidate.If these Elon comments contribute, it just relates to the general feeling of desperation surrounding the Trump campaign right now. Trump's campaign knows this which is why they are trying to put on the strongest image and saying they will win everything, but the slapdash nature of all of Trump's recent rallies and events has made him look fumbling and weak. Even my family members, who are Republicans who dislike him but would still vote for him, are being turned off by the nature of his campaign. If I had to guess, I would say that Kamala will win the vibes war and thus the election.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk's remark is an October surprise potentially greater than Comey (2016) if Democrats use it"},{"text":"SS: Podesta is a Senior Advisor to Biden and will transition to the Harris admin.

The largest student club on campus was the anime club, second largest electronic gaming club, and they had an annual anime/furry convention on campus. In no way were the majority of students there homeschooled. The majority went to public schools, and almost everyone had stories of being bullied and harassed for being a nerd. I'd rather have my kid mostly socializing with people they can relate to than getting bullied mercilessly at school every day because they don't fit in.

Even the quality of public education varies on the district and location. So, too, the quality of a given homeschool curriculum and the teaching methodology can vary greatly.

Most of us generally don't look into the lives of public schoolers and say, ohhh, he's messed up because he went to public school. No. We'd say he's messed up because his father beat him or whatever else was going on in the home, separate from the educational method that family was employing. When will homeschoolers get the same treatment? Seemingly never.Then, too, virtual public schoolers shouldn't be counted toward your total. And without getting into their school records, you won't know who those people are. Those are public school students who are just doing their studies outside the building, if you will.  Remember the pandemic? That was not high quality education no matter how you slice it! And it was led by \\"certificated\\" teachers and the whole shebang. Again, it's not \\"homeschooling\\".There are also \\"homeschoolers\\" who are not really educating their children at home, but have simply pulled their children with no real intent to teach. Some of these people are actually evading social services. That has nothing to do with \\"home education\\" itself and everything to do with... evading social services. Then, too, you're conflating children who have a social or academic \\"deficiency\\" (your word) with homeschooling causing the deficiency.

I tend towards considering this because I believe the kid could do better and could get a more individual approach that can't possible be provided at schools even if they honestly wanted to. I also disagree with stuff that's becoming part of the \\"education\\" at schools and I believe it leads to conformity and some level of brain-washing. Children who do not have so strong personalities to make their own mind often \\"copy\\" the mainstream opinion. I see in my daily life (and I did even as a kid/student) that many can't think really independently (even if they are very smart and academically doing very well). To avoid going out of topic, I am not going to give examples, I may just very generally say that it may have something to do with issues where the \\"mainstream\\" opinion changed and we accept the current one as the only possible and the \\"old\\" one as totally wrong AND we are not even willing to discuss it constructively with someone, who thinks differently and we rather label this person.On the other hand, I am a bit worried about socialization, but again, it's good and bad.I was the smallest kid in our class. Always, in every class. I didn't really socialize well because of this (and maybe partly because of not really wanting to be untrue to my beliefs just to be more popular - a strategy that many use to follow, either knowingly or even without thinking much about it).So even if I attended public schools, I didn't get a great socialization.With socialization (or just being in a group of other people/kids), bad things come as well. Not just bullying (that's often mentioned) - and by the way, I believe that some softer form of bullying may be for example in sports (not choosing someone - surely I wasn't a good pick for almost any sport, especially not basketball :D ) - but also exposing to hars language (vulgarisms) etc. Then instead of educating a well-behaved kid you have a kid that speaks like garbage and doesn't even consider it any bad because everyone in the class does (some because they see it in the family, others \\"learn\\" it from their classmates), if not even the teacher is (to a lesser degree) vulgar (etc.)But yes, working in groups, solving problems, making friendships and contacts for life may be useful, I am a bit worried that my eventual kid would lose this if I decide to go for homeschooling. But at this moment, I think that the benefits would be greater, especially if I (alongside with the future mother of my kid) could afford it (especially timewise).All in all, I disagree that homeschooling is damaging to the child. It is providing something different than public schooling with its pros and cons. If done correctly by educated parents who could teach (with pedagogy background if possible), it can be beneficial even more than public schooling.P. S. I do think that if everyone was (and could be) homeschooled, it would be great for the society and democracy as well, as we wouldn't \\"create\\" so many people with so similar (mainstream) worldviews but rather people thinking really independently. But it's unfortunately not only impossible (not every parent can teach, either because they can't afford it or they don't know how to do it) but also not in the interest of any system even so called \\"democratic\\" ones.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Trump the one who holds concerts, oh wait that's aerobic dementia karaoke.","title":"Kamala Harris is holding her final campaign rally concert in Philly.

People aren't trying to turn the swastika into something good there, though they are trying to make the Southern Swastika or confederate battle flag which has been an icon for white supremacy for over 150 years normal.  In France there aren't large numbers of the population saying the Nazi's weren't bad to the Jewish population and the Jews in Europe enjoyed being in their camps.  There's no large movement there to rewrite that the Nazi's were trying to fight for \\"German Rights\\" or to rewrite history that WWII was one of \\"French aggression\\".  There are no statues of the leaders of the Reich being built and promoted as heroic.    \\nIn the US just two years ago a state political party voted to continue celebrating Nathan Bedford Forrest with a state holiday.  Who is he?  Well, he was a slave owner and slave trader.  He fought against the US joining the slavers rebellion and slaughtered many of Tennessee's first black soldiers to be able to join the US Army when surrendering.  He then after the war would join a white supremacist terrorist organization known as the Ku Klux Klan becoming it's first leader, and after he left when laws were being passed to prosecute it's leaders would take the names of it's current members to the grave, and be one of the first men in Tennessee to start Convict Leasing, or \\"slavery by another name\\" as it's been called.  He was rightly so, a hero of white supremacists in the US,  That man there got a state holiday over 100 years ago by avowed white supremacists.  And 2 years ago, the political party in the state voted to keep celebrating him.  They don't say he's a hero for white supremacy publicly anymore but they still celebrate the man who did those things.  The largest political party in Texas put out a platform for the midterm elections 2 years ago to repeal the civil rights era voting rights act of 1965.  Literally the nail in the coffin of Jim Crow laws and legal white supremacy.  There was a president recently who stated that very fine people can attend nazi and white supremacist rallies on their weekend as long as they aren't card carrying members of those groups.  We had a black president before all the Southern states that fought in the Civil War to protect slavery would ratify the 13th amendment.     \\nAs for black people using the N word... I don't care.  Many of them believe it's a way to take back the power of that word from the white supremacists who use it.  If as a white person you are really upset you can't use that word, and need to rant about it... well that's on you there.  I get it.  For some people it is upsetting that black people might start making up a similar portion of who they represent in society in the US.  And they believe that the only reason they have been underrepresented historically is the melanin content in their skin holds them back somehow, not that how people view that is the reason.  My thought... meh.  I really don't care that the leader of the Daily Stormer is super pissed.

The impending civil lawsuit forced the FBI to move forward with the investigation/charges publicly. If Kamala is elected, the outcome/evidence can be manipulated, if Trump is elected, it cannot.  On the subject of pardons. Biden is president for 3 more months and still has time for pardons, which would include future convictions. If the 25th amendment is invoked, Kamala can write pardons before Trump takes office, and she can write them if she is elected. Since Diddy biz is now public, she will not be able to make the situation just disappear and some people may end up with convictions.

And homeschooled children score consistently higher on those than public schooled kids. So you are flatly, objectively, verifiably wrong on this. *I have several friends who were homeschooled (only until high school) who either express regrets of their own, or showcase social or academic deficiency as a result; I am sure the negatives outweigh the positives.*Everyone from my homeschool group are programmers with multiple degrees, school teachers, veterinarians. Some of us are blue collar (such as myself), but on average we did better in my homeschool group getting to university than the average public schooler. Your anecdotal evidence is garbage because you don't know everyone.I used to compare my performance to the public schooled kids I took standardized tests alongside, who I consistently outperformed. I also remember in Sunday School a lot of them couldn't read when I was in 5th grade and I was floored by it!*Beyond academics, a key function of school is the social aspect - to expose young children to their peers and social scenarios both positive and negative for them to navigate in preparation for adulthood.*I wasn't aware this was a problem! I'll ask my six or so life-long friends that I made in my homeschool group, most of whom I still speak with regularly, if they or their spouses and children have seen any issues with social interactions as a result of their homeschooling. But you do make a good point! It's a good thing that public schools rarely produce children who are mentally or socially struggling. Thank God we have the public school system as a shining paradigm of children's mental and social well being.All in all, this reads like you've not really thought about it that much. Or met a homeschooler and asked them about it. This reads like you drove by a poster which listed anti-homeschool propaganda.

The homeschooled adults (and children) I have met have progressed so much further in life than their contemporaries on average. They are so much better spoken and socialized. They come off as smarter. They have better life plans and are often more educated in their chosen fields! School is not a natural social environment. Its incredibly institutional. I remember going to high school and feeling the need to pretend to be more mean and tough than I was just so I could survive without being bullied so bad. Bullying is a serious issue that the staff rarely, if ever deal with properly. When I was a child I was bullied so bad that I needed to be pulled out of school for years. I tried again in high school, but like I said, that didnt work out well ether. When I dropped out of high school, I was able to focus more on what I actually wanted to do with my life instead of on just trying to survive in a zoo. It was ridiculous what I went through in school. I was so much better out of school and still had no problems getting into college. The social aspect is so ridiculous. Kids can have better socializing joining different programs, camps, and extra-curriculars. Like I joined musical theatre and ballet for example. I truly believe the modern school system is unhealthy. Any children of mine will definitely be homeschooled and have home tutors. The only other thing I would consider for them would be certain private schools, but even then, I would much rather go the homeschool and private tutor route. A lot of things they are learning in schools too is just factually wrong. For example, someone I know grew up in a different country than I did and we learned completely different things. I dont want my children being indoctrinated ether. Homeschooled children are much more inquisitive and ready to learn even into adulthood. Whereas many people I have met, graduate school and feel that their learning is finished and never study or pick up another book again. School takes love out of learning and is scientifically proven to diminish a persons creativityand I would even go as far as to say that it can harm critical thinking skills.

I can't accept the implication that every person in history has been moderately to severely damaged up until we invented kindergarten. Sure, society has changed a lot, but people are still people. Civilization doesn't need public school. We just found that it helps for a lot of people in this particular place in history.You bring up the political and religious motives as a bad thing, simply stating they are not done for the benefit of the child. Politics and religion are convictions people hold about how to best order society. When parents see the government doing things that they believe lead to a poorly ordered society, the parents care about their kids enough to take time off work, sacrifice half the household income, pay for homeshooling supplies and continue paying taxes for the public school system they aren't using. Homeschooling isn't because people hate government. It's done because parents love their kids. I stress this point because it contextualizes the rest of the conversation.In Canada we had the residential school system. The government decided that it was in the best interest of aboriginal children to be taken from home and placed in government Catholic school system. For the good of the children! There was no way that those kids were getting a proper education from their backward and outdated villages and families. Those kids probably never even socialized either!Our schools today aren't inherently abusive like those were but they operate on the same assumption. We assume government knows whats best for children. Maybe they do, maybe they dont. How do you know? We know because the majority has decreed it! Now lets take aboriginal kids away from their families. You can apply this to Christian kids or Muslim kids or even atheist kids in a theocracy.Your statement about damage comes with assumptions. There are homeschoolers walking among you. You get weird kids from both systems. The two options are prone to different failure modes.\\nHow many public school kids today are depressed,  physically unhealthy, bullied at school, anxious? Being apart from family for a third of your childhood can also be damaging if parents don't take responsibility for their portion. But that's generally a minority.\\nYes, kids will grow up awkward if their parents refuse to make arrangments to get them socialized.\\nDamaged children is not a phenomenon unique to homschooling. It just shows in different ways when the parents do a bad job.I've also met a lot of homeschoolers. I ha e yet to meet a damaged one. I helped out with some high school community programs and saw \\"damage\\" was common. Depends on your sample I guess.Parents have been teachers since the dawn of man.\\nOpposition to homeschooling is opposition to parenting.Edit: I forgot to address the academic aspect.\\nYou made a blind assertion: homeschool kids dont get educated as well as public school kids.\\nYou may have guessed. I was homeschooled (until grade 5). Public school was a joke. I didn't have to try until grade 11. I'm not a genius. I just got really far ahead then went to public school and repeated everything I learned.\\nThis is typical. Theres a reason for the jokes about homeschoolers being smart. Its becuase they focus on learning instead of focusing on building diaramas and noodles art.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"When they insisted the roll of tp was flap down I lost my shit.","title":"Chloe Grace Moretz comes out as gay while endorsing Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"(I'm against dems) But that is a streatch.

In fact, I was the one homeschooled _least_ and arguably I was the one most severely affected by homeschooling out of all of us. Even ignoring my personal experience, the data does not support your point. Homeschooled children actually tend to outperform traditionally schooled children on standardized tests. This is because generally speaking homeschooling requires extra expense and time devoted to education, and families that either can't do that or are unwilling to devote the resources do not homeschool. There absolutely is a selection bias here, but that doesn't change that homeschooling, when done properly, IS effective. You're also employing quite a bit of confirmation bias in your preference for public school. Public school famously has a LOT of failures. Why are we only looking at homeschooling failures and ignoring all the children left behind by the public system? And the same goes for social stuff. It's not like The Outsiders was written about homeschoolers. Literally every media piece about school I have ever seen is all about how every kid feels like an outsider in school. I don't see how homeschooling is any different. And sure, as homeschooling has become popular, we've seen the bar lowered a bit and the academic edge has decreased. But even if homeschooling is only equivalent, that's still a situation where both systems are producing poor outcomes and both are producing successes.

This structure actually fosters individuality by exposing students to a broader range of perspectives outside the family, rather than enforcing conformity.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Its true, the current election would lead you to believe that were taking a step back. But the USA is also on the cusp of possibly electing a mixed race woman as president.  So right now its either a step forward or a few steps back. Trump has used his position to stoke the fires of discontent and division. \\nTrump is an outlier, and very few people could get away with what hes been able to get away with.  But hes managed to capture the imagination of the non college educated-mostly-white-lower-middle-class, many of whom feel left behind by the progress thats been made towards a more equitable society.I believe there is a big difference between how a country like France and the USA (and for the most part, The U.K. and Canada) perceive race. In France, you have a very strong national identity, but at the same time, to my perception, France pretends that race (and on the flip side racism) doesnt exist. Its illegal to collect census data in France, so there is a refusal and inability, to acknowledge a problem exists. The Wikipedia article on racism in France  is a good place to start.\\nI can say that Austria and Germany they have abjectly failed at integrating minority citizens and residents into larger society. Because these groups dont feel like they belong, they dont feel like they have any stake in society. The U.S. model is the idea, that you can have an ethnic identity that is also part of a larger national identity. You can be Black (or Hispanic, Asian, etc) and be part of that culture, and keep that sense of identity, and still be American. It doesnt always work, but thats the goal, and its a good one.The Amanda Gorman situation is not how you report it. For one, she was not born wealthy, she was raised in a single parent household.

Many public schools are, in fact, culturally and socioeconomically homogenous, reflecting the demographics of their local communities. In such cases, public school students may not encounter as much diversity as we might assume.Homeschooling, on the other hand, allows families to seek out diverse experiences intentionally. Many homeschooling families engage with their communities through sports teams, co-ops, volunteer work, and other programs that bring them into contact with people from a range of backgrounds and age groups. This flexibility means homeschooled children often experience social settings beyond a single, uniform school environment, allowing them to navigate a wider variety of interactions.The assumption that homeschooled children are isolated or only interact within narrow circles is outdated. Homeschooling today can offer a rich, varied social life that provides meaningful preparation for the real world, often with more flexibility and intentional exposure to diverse experiences than is available in many public schools.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"White Supremacists gonna White Supremacist","title":"Trump Boasts He Has Beautiful White Skin Right After Slamming Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Durrrr","title":"Many wealthy members of Congress are descendants of rich slaveholders ? new study demonstrates the enduring legacy of slavery"},{"text":"It hasn't.

With widely available curriculum support and teaching aids, that solves the hurdle of maybe not knowing how to structure and teach the information, but if a successful adult doesn't understand the material, then that material should definitionally be at a higher level than is required for a basic high school education.2) \\"Beyond academics, a key function of school is the social aspect - to expose young children to their peers and social scenarios both positive and negative for them to navigate in preparation for adulthood\\"  True, but with the advent of social media, I would argue that children aren't getting good peer socialization at school anyway, and that parents can in fact provide much better degrees of peer socialization, especially if the homeschooling is done in a cooperative manner between several families.3) \\"Finally, the fact that the majority of their peers will have these common experiences will leave them perpetually feeling like an outsider, even once school is well behind them.\\" My response to this is anecdotal, but frankly so is this claim so I don't feel bad about it.  Sure, maybe homeschooled kids won't have shared experiences, but are those shared experiences even worth it?  Plenty of kids who do have those shared experiences would gladly go through a round of electro-shock to get rid of them, and many others feel like outsiders because of those shared experiences and how their classmates treated them.  Most importantly, in my experience, shared high school experiences are irrelevant after just a few years of college and/or real world work experience, because those shared experiences are much more important to adults in the real world than high school, which often varies significantly year to year and town to town anyway.4) \\"Anecdotally, I have several friends who were homeschooled (only until high school) who either express regrets of their own, or showcase social or academic deficiency as a result;\\" Anecdotally, at least half the people I know regret going to public school, many of them having the same deficits you claim are caused by homeschooling.Your entire post seems to be comparing homeschooling to some idealized fantasy of how public school works.  Maybe your school is/was an absolutely stellar place to be educated, but the data is pretty clear that most public schools are educational shitholes that fail to adequately educate or socialize many or even most students that attend.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Phone Ines are low voltage and have nothing to do with your electrical power.","title":"Shock Poll Has Harris Beating Trump in Deep Red State - Presidential candidate Kamala Harris has leapfrogged rival Donald Trump in the Hawkeye State amid fierce campaigning in a neck-and-neck showdown."},{"text":"the \\"anyone but any of them\\" crowd. large and invisible","title":"Before six months ago, literally no one wanted Harris for president"},{"text":"Good work!These chatbots will ruin the internet.

What this means is she has a bachelor degree and 2 years of teacher's college and she can teach kids up to 13 years old. By her testimony, teacher's college provided near nothing that would help actually teaching a kid. She took a total of two courses relating to the teaching of a subject. The rest of the diploma was dedicated to learning how to manage 30 kids at once. So my wife is qualified to teach science having never taken a single course in science. She is as practically qualified as any individual who has a bachelor degree.2) socialization; now, my situation is not universal. But my friends homeschool their kids. Which means the people (and by extension their kids) who we visit, spend time with, interact with, homeschool. Going to regular school will be more likely to isolate my son than homeschooling will. Homeschooling works best for the conforming child but worse for the non-conforming child.  For the conforming child that accepts their community, then homeschooling provides a large number of professional and social connections. There are so many young people in my community who are working for brother's, daughter's, Cousins, etc of other people in the community. I just hired an HVAC because he was the friend of a friend in the community. Of course, non-conforming individuals will likely feel more isolated as near everyone in their community will be like the people they are trying to get away from.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Meanwhile, Trump's been on SNL twice.","title":"It will be nice to have a President again who has a healthy sense of humor like Obama &amp; Biden. ??"},{"text":"I disagree.

And I would consider myself: normal.I would say that there are a lot of truths to what you say.But I will counter that the outcome (socially) for kids coing out of the home schooling atmosphere depends on 3-4 things.1. Engagement - being involved in and engaging with the opportunities around you. Co-ops, public events, team sports, etc... homeschooling more than anything I have experienced is more directly \\"you get back what you invest in it.\\"2. Curriculum - there are a number of these. But the best already assume that the \\"teacher\\" (parent) is not so well versed in everything. This then means that the material itself is well thought out and measured to be absorbed at a pace that both the teacher can explain and the kid can learn.3. Personal drive - the \\"teacher\\" (parent) must have sufficient drive to engage with the material. The lack of teaching drive puts the weight of the learning process onto the kid, and this can create an \\"achievement = approval\\" mental barrier.4?. Personal drive - the kid has to be willing to engage as well. If the kid doesn't engage properly and \\"skates by\\" on the parent trying to be overly helpful, then this is also a poor outcome.\\nTo wrap this all up. I have seen instances of all 4 of these things in my experience as a home schooler. \\n*Kids that are anti-social\\n*kids that have tech addiction in/after high school\\n*kids that are driven by their GPA in college and don't have direction after the school setting is gone.\\n*kids that didn't genuinely learn the material, but on paper, are qualified. Suffer in college and in the workforce. Or don't have a drive to finish school and suffer later because of their own lack of drive.But I don't see these cases being represented at larger than those represented in the public or private school systems.

Plus testing the children more often and requiring all core subjects, because my state only mandates math and English/reading/writing to be taught. If there is a good parent with a teaching background ground and a co-op for other subjects and socialization it can be quite nice for some children because you can get done with your work a lot quicker than if you were at a school.

I follow r/teachers, and have friends/family who work in public schools, and not only are the behavior issues out of control, the pressure to pass kids along means that an unacceptably high percentage of kids are \\"graduating\\" while functionally illiterate in reading and math. I know you've said in other responses that the quality of public schools isn't what you want to debate here, but I think you're starting with a faulty assumption and comparing homeschooling to something that doesn't really exist. Let me say, first off, that when kids are kept home to keep them away from ideas, people, \\"godlessness,\\" etc., I absolutely agree that it is damaging and even abusive. But public schools (even when they work) are like factories, and some kids don't fit the mould.Anecdotally, I have two kids, one of whom is homeschooled and the other started going to \\"school school\\" this year for fourth grade. My oldest (11) is gifted, autistic, and has ADHD. He went to kindergarten and half of first grade before we pulled the plug. The school was great, no complaints, and most of the kids were kind, but he was both overstimulated (lights, people, noise, transitions) and understimulated (physically, intellectually) and spent the entire day either running around like a maniac or hiding under his desk with his shirt pulled up over his head. He was also bullied by a kid on his bus to the point where the school suggested we file a police report. We pulled him out when we realized that he wasn't actually learning anything, and started homeschooling in February of 2020.My younger son (9) is also gifted and also has ADHD, but no autism. He was supposed to start kindergarten in 2020, but my husband was high risk for COVID and remote kindergarten was torturous, so after a week we just switched to homeschooling him as well. I give them both the choice of homeschool vs school each year, and this year he chose to try school. He is well ahead in reading and math (he's always loved math, and we worked through a pre-algebra curriculum last year), easily on-level for the other subjects, and adjusted socially pretty quickly. He loves being around the other kids, and I'm willing to let him coast a bit academically to fill his social needs, but I'm definitely aware that the education he was getting at home was a better fit for his academic abilities. My older son does a weekly STEM program with 9 other kids that explores various scientific/engineering concepts and he goes on field trips to explore and learn more. This year we are trying out Khan Academy online, and he's raced through middle school physics and chemistry, as well as a computer programming class. He's reading full novels, and just got started on Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere. Our philosophy has always been that if our kids were competent at reading, writing, and math, they could learn anything else they are interested in, and so far it has proven true. Homeschooling also gives us time to get him to various therapies. I'm not saying he's great socially, but he wouldn't be any better at school, just miserable.I think you're looking at the best case scenario of public school (well rounded, socially normal, taught well) and the worst case scenario of homeschooling (repressed, abused weirdos) and drawing your conclusion, but both can be good or bad, and what really matters is doing what's best for your individual kid and being willing to be flexible and adapt to their needs. For any kid who is outside the norm, homeschooling makes adapting to their needs so much easier. (Not that it's *easy* to homeschool, but it's easier to customize their day-to-day to fit their needs.)","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Yes","title":"It will be nice to have a President again who has a healthy sense of humor like Obama &amp; Biden. ??"},{"text":"They love punching left.","title":"Democrats have a \\"war room\\" funded in \\"the low seven figures\\" just to track and discredit Third Party candidates, most of all Stein."},{"text":"I'm confident that the US will never payout reparations for slavery.

Entering the era of Jim Crow, African Americans had little to no civil rights, despite being able to serve in both world wars. I think you know the rest.It's not about who should or shouldn't feel guilty, it's about acknowledging the economic advancement of the nation through means of the business of slavery. White privilege exists across a spectrum for both domestic and foreign peoples. Black people couldn't advance (post slavery) in a nation not of their own choosing due to racism and discrimination based in policies and culture.I feel you when you mention the frustration of paying for something you or your ancestors had no control of because that's the plight of african americans and our ancestry. Here's some perspective/questions:1. Can we say that America would be what it is today without slavery? Would immigrants still have migrated here in the same numbers? 2. Black people are still very much a minority, so paying into reparations wouldn't be the end of the world. Let's say money goes to families at a certain income level. Same social programs are ran today for the taxes you pay.3. Last but not least, when do we start talking about the indigenous native americans and how they deserve more attention and resources?","title":"Many wealthy members of Congress are descendants of rich slaveholders ? new study demonstrates the enduring legacy of slavery"},{"text":"I marvel that all Latinos don't take equal offense at the garbage insult.

Socialization can happen through extracurriculars, homeschool meetups, etc.There are also other, possibly more common, reasons to homeschool. Maybe the child has severe anxiety about school, or social anxiety, and needs a different environment to be conductive to learning or to practice social skills in a safe environment. Maybe the child was bullied and transferring to another school isnt an option (Im from a city with a single high school, nearest school is over 1.5 hours away so clearly not an option).

While I am sure that does happen, it is certainly not universal and in my experience is not representative of the typical experience.On the academic side, homeschooling means that the parents take responsibility for instruction, not that they do it themselves. My parents taught most of my elementary/middle-school courses themselves with some lab science and the like at a local private school; in high school as the material passed beyond their expertise they increasingly relied on online and college courses. My physics, Greek, and literature teachers had PhDs in the subject; my chemistry teacher had received a Presidential Scholars Teacher Recognition Award as a public school teacher before switching to teaching homeschoolers. Macroeconomics and Calculus were at William and Mary.In fairness, that was a rather expensive approach to homeschooling and not necessarily the norm. But some form of seeking outside help to fill gaps in the parents education is common; in particular, coops where parents teach their area of expertise are very common.On the social side, I dont think I was particularly underserved. I was seeing people outside my family on a near-daily basis between playing with kids in the neighborhood and extracurriculars; the raw quantity of time in a room with people outside of my family obviously didnt compare, but I do question the developmental superiority of structured class time over more frequent and open-ended interactions with family. When I was in college Id say that almost all meaningful social interaction took place out of class time, and the exceptions were mostly in &lt;10-student classes that I think quite rare in public school. Meanwhile, I had far more out-of-class time with non-family-members than many of my friends in public school because they were too busy with homework to keep up anything close to my extracurricular load.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"If Kamala's America comes at the cost of genocide of my brothers and sister in Gaza, then no version of America deservs to exist.

The reason why school provides technology, access to books and goes over curriculum is to try to bring everyone up to a standard set by a governing body. Evidence of that is shown through the standards set by whatever authority governs schools, be that school boards or higher levels of government and the reaction to not meeting those standards: more funding, change in policy and so on.Rich educated children do not need to worry about it because they have so many opportunities and experiences that will often put them ahead of the learning level of their peers. The wealth not only creates opportunities to access a wide variety of things, it is also tied to having things like support networks and the ability to get support when needed. This creates a cascading effect, I'm putting examples below.  \\n  \\nA first generation immigrant working two jobs will not have to the time to read to their child, especially in a language they do not know.  \\nDuring childhood development, a lack of nutrients can damage children's development. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4373582/)  \\nLow social skills can isolate children which hurts social skills. A lack of these skills can get in the way of learning directly, they can't talk and develop reasoning or language with friends and indirectly, they do not behave in the classroom so they are asked to sit out of an activity or lesson to calm down. (If your next question is why do we suspend kids, it is because we need to prioritize the learning of the class over the one disruptive student and there is not enough time to deal with it.)  \\nThere is a disparity between the exposure of different words depending on the social class children are in. (https://www.npr.org/2013/12/29/257922222/closing-the-word-gap-between-rich-and-poor)  \\nLower socioeconomic households tend to see more violence, which creates problematic behaviours which get students pulled out of learning scenarios.  \\nThis goes on forever. Even things like school lunches, which are often not provided by schools, create barriers for children's learning.Rich people don't need to worry about those things and have the resources to intervene if something comes up. If a child needs medication, they can afford it. They can take more time off of work and/or have more time at home to just spend with their children answering questions or helping them develop skills. The wealthy can effectively do whatever they want because they have the money to fix problems, the poor do not have that opportunity. Finding stats on homeschooling is a fucking mess because people with Phds want to become influencers so they flood the market with self referential bullshit. (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15582159.2017.1395638#abstract)  \\nIf you notice the National Home Education Research Institute has a lot of links that point to success in homeschooling, many by the same Author (Brian D. Ray) who works for the institute and cites his own papers to justify his conclusions.  \\nI got way off track. Anyway, homeschooling numbers will always be broken for a few reasons.   \\n1. It can be expensive to home school. Someone needs to not work. This was less common before people though they could become tiktok influencers and use their kids as props.  \\n2. It will disproportionately show outliers. Most people are aware of the time and fiscal cost of educating their children directly. Two groups of people will not be bothered; those who can afford it and those who do not understand the cost.  \\n3. Homeschoolers are very hard to track. Studies of academic success often come from universities where there is a clear selection bias. If a student does not enter university or finish highschool, it becomes difficult to get find ways to contact those people and ask them. There is already a bias in studies for more educated people to be more willing to participate (https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED491016.pdf)This became a mess but if you need clarification on this word vomit let me know, it will let me put off doing what I'm supposed to be doing.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Wow, all for their right of being able to Kll.

Whenever we learn something, it goes through a period where we suspect something but don't know for sure. If you're learning an instrument or a language, there's periods where you think x means y, but you're not entirely sure. In science, this process from \\"we think x means y, but there's a chance it means z\\" to \\"we know beyond a doubt that x means z\\" takes years, sometimes decades,  sometimes more. A part of that process of becoming sure is a bunch of individual groups of scientists doing their experiments and telling other scientists their results. Eventually you'll get people doing meta analyses of all those experiments,  and at that point you might start to have some results you can feel confident about. The media likes to jump the gun, see a conclusion of a study and report it as TRUTH, as there's a chance that if they're right, they are first person to report something exciting.

(2010). Exploring academic outcomes of homeschooled students. Home School Researcher, 25(4), 1-9. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893891Supports the claim that homeschooled students perform well in college, often achieving higher GPAs than their traditionally schooled peers.

Peabody Journal of Education, 88(3), 284-297. https://doi.org/10.1080/0161956X.2013.796825Addresses the socialization question, showing that homeschooled children are well-adjusted socially.

Journal of School Choice, 9(1), 105-112. https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/Provides an overview of academic and social outcomes in homeschooling, showing that homeschooled students score higher than average on standardized tests and often succeed in higher education.Van Pelt, D., Allison, D., &amp; Allison, P.

Journal of School Choice, 3(1), 45-68. https://cche.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2009EnglishSynopsis.pdf?target=blankExamines the long-term outcomes of homeschooled adults in Canada, finding that they are active and engaged citizens, challenging the idea that homeschooling leads to social isolation.Duvall, S. F., Ward, D. L., Delquadri, J. C., &amp; Greenwood, C. R. (1997). An examination of home school students academic achievements. Education and Treatment of Children, 20(2), 150-162. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ553895Focuses on academic performance, finding that homeschooled students often achieve at or above grade level in core subjects like reading and math.Murphy, J. (2012). Homeschooling in America: Capturing and assessing the movement. Educational Psychologist, 47(3), 165-178. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED534510Explores the growth and effectiveness of homeschooling, noting that many parents choose it for flexibility in curriculum and to meet specific academic or social needs that may not be addressed in traditional schools.Kunzman, R., &amp; Gaither, M.

The racism you see in the US is very similar to racism in Latin America, where it may be even more stratified. The New World European colonies were racially stratified and had slavery built into their very foundations. Europeans back home knew and enabled this racism, they loved the agricultural products slavery provided them, but it was out of sight and out of mind in the colonies. It was much like today how people dont like to think about how their sneakers might have involved child labor in their production.Europe is so much more homogeneous, and racial hatred was historically more directed at neighbors of similar skin color. I think this is still evident in the European nations not really being able to act as a unified front and consequently the EU as a collective not having much influence on the world stage. People didnt start emigrating from former colonies to their European overlords more recently. They were treated more as novelties compared to in the Americas where these racial divisions have been around for centuries. Europe still have its fair share of xenophobia though, and despite all of the anti-immigration rhetoric coming out of the US today, generally has much stricter immigration laws. Even if Turkey had fully Western European style governance, they wouldnt be let into the EU and the real reason for this is racism and xenophobia.I think the problem today is that your average racists person has a platform with the internet and social media that they didnt have before. More racist people existed in the pastthere was segregation and people openly slurring and disparaging other races and those were people who had influence and a platform back in the day. Now everyone has a platform, so you hear every idiots opinion. The far right has existed in Europe far longer than in the Americas, and sure they may be empowered by some of Trumps rhetoric, but its more like they are being drawn from the woodwork than being created.","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"Trump still holds a grudge toward Obama for jokes made during Obama's last Press Dinner as out going presidents did to all incoming past presidents for the past 50 years (??)\\nYeah,?

Gifted children are bored and act out, while those that are struggling, I just don't have time to give them the help they really required.

Summer school would have optional courses, provide opportunities for students to improve grades and strengthen some skills, and provide a structured and safe social environment.  Plus, the benefit for working parents to have their children in a supervised setting.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"That was such an amazing bit.

I went to university, community college and trade schools. I have been in both gifted and AP programs, and remedial, SpEd programs.I was homeschooled from 2nd through 6th grade, and when I re entered traditional school, I was light years ahead of my peers in some ways, and incredibly naive in others- however, looking back, I honestly don't see that naivete as a deficit. It's one of many things that has fundamentally shaped my worldview, my ethics, my liberal politics, my business and my volunteer work.While it did cause me some pain growing up, mostly when I learned that *people can also really suck*, the foundational belief that *people are mostly, basically good, honest and trustworthy,* has guided my life in ways I wouldn't change. I don't think that learning *people can really suck,* at a younger age, would have changed my life for the better.I did go to a homeschooling group, where everyone who was in it was there because they wanted to be there- and I was consistently learning academics above my grade level.I'm autistic, so I have no idea if I would have figured out masking and social skills better or faster had I not spent those years homeschooled. Maybe I would have. Maybe I wouldn't have - I do know that it was much easier to connect with other students in my homeschooling group, than with my public or private school peers.I got a 2050 on my SAT, and a 450 on my Leaving Cert. I've lived all over the world, I have friends on three continents, I own my own business, and I've had a really cool ride.I'm just one anecdote, and nothing I have to say disproves your view that *on average* homeschooling is harmful, but I do think it was a net positive experience in my life. So perhaps I can skew the average just a bit.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"You should know by now.

When the choice is home schooling or have your kid end up in the hospital a couple of times a year because the public schools can't get their dietary restrictions under control, the kids health seems like the priority.Outside of that situation, parents aren't making an aggregate decision about home schooling in general vs public schools in general, they're making a specific decision for their kid and the specific public school their children would attend. If they're pulling their kid out of the top public school in the state, it's going to beat that education. If they're pulling their kids out of a public school that is failing to meet accreditation standards, they could do worse than the average public school and still be doing the right thing for their kids.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"That's the same poll and it's \\"selzer\\"","title":"Shock Poll Has Harris Beating Trump in Deep Red State - Presidential candidate Kamala Harris has leapfrogged rival Donald Trump in the Hawkeye State amid fierce campaigning in a neck-and-neck showdown."},{"text":"I thought so.

They gather students for group classes, field trips and cooperative experiences public schools can't afford or manage with so many kids. They can ensure all the kids get breakfast and lunch and give extra attention to those who need it. Homeschool collectives do not need school shooter drills.

It really is that simple.However, they were the best adjusted for pursuing success, being driven by standards unreached by their peers. They have attained higher goals and have been repeatedly singled out for excellence. One recovered socially in time, with now quite a friend-group, but the other tends to manage only work colleagues and neighbors, with no real close friends.The hybridized ones did better than most of their peers academically and managed to fit in socially rather well. One started homeschooling later (grade 8 and up to graduation), the other did the reverse, going to public school full-time from 9th grade onwards. The first has quite a friend-group, made up largely of others who were homeschooled whom she met through various networking events (homeschool dances, talent shows, theatre groups, and choirs). She is getting her masters in philosophy and is incredibly well-rounded.The other has an unshakable personality that never had to endure the concept of bullying or conformism. He is a leader in almost every setting, with a following and a handful of close friends.Both of these sets (there were two of each) did head-and-shoulders above their publicly-educated siblings. The two who stuck it through the public system managed to learn to settle for a substandard that has so far been their norm. With no real consequences for their incomplete assignments, they manage to coast along freely without learning to really fail at anything.They have had moderate success with friends, but these have tended to be of a lower quality than the older children. It could be a factor of their age/positioning in the family, but they seem to be overall less motivated, less academically-inclined, and harbor unrealistic expectations of what life 'owes' them.Though they have delightful personalities and are warm and loving to a fault, it seems quite obvious that the independence of thought and will that homeschooling provided the other children is significantly absent.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"They wear diapers, tampons on their ears and now garbage bags.

This is objectively true.I'm a public school teacher and I see many homeschool students transition in at the high school level. It doesn't matter what homeschooling background they come from (with a very very small exception of homeschool pods that hired professional educators and basically just created their own mini schools) they did not have the cognition or social skills of their in-school peers. There are so many reasons for this, but simply being surrounded by a diverse group of people and navigating new situations daily is a huge facet of development. Very very very few homeschools prioritize diverse experience and thinking- it is, in fact, the antithesis of the point of most homeschooling communities. I will, however challenge your argument when you are looking at states where like Louisiana and Mississippi where they have accepted factually incorrect curriculum and stymied real discourse and thought. In those systems homeschooling is equal too, and in the case of resourced (notice I am not saying well educated- you do not need high levels of education to provide them for your own children- you can access so much online, and do a remarkable job building a network of likeminded thinkers if needed!) parents they are likely already doing much of the schooling at home as their educational systems are failing.In the end, the quality of the public education vs the quality of the homeschooling is what makes or breaks this argument more so than the overall concept of either - it's just more often true that public schools provide a better education.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Possible in the USA if Libertarians run as Republicans and don't run as the full-blown anarchist version of us.

My dad was a chemistry professor and my mom was a research biologist before she had kids and became a stay at home mom. Unlike a lot of families, I was homeschooled primarily for academic reasons - I was very bright but had a fall birthday and was shy, so the school wanted to hold me back an extra year even though I was testing the best in the district, so my parents pulled me out.I was vastly better prepared for college than most of my peers. My mom was the toughest English teacher I ever had, and obviously my math and science education was just fine.We were part of a home school co-op where once a week a bunch of families would meet up and do group activities / classes. My mom taught biology and led us in doing dissections and other biology labs. My dad taught physics and chemistry labs, using his facilities at the university after hours. My friend's dad who was a preacher taught us public speaking. My brother and I took piano and other music lessons (oboe for me,  trumpet for him), and we played in both the community youth symphony as well as other groups.When I went to college, I had a bit of adjustment to do, but that was about it.

I disagree with this and I assume this is also what you disagree with.?\\nHowever I've also met kids for whom homeschooling was the only realistic option. Namely, I went to college with some 14 year olds. They were taking graduate level physics classes and functionally at what would be 18th grade if college kept counting grades linearly like public schools.?\\n\\"Socialization\\" is important - but socialization between a ten year old and a twenty year old is different than socialization between two ten year olds, but academically they would have been equivalent.?\\nThis is solved by homeschooling. Having the parents teach the kids grades 1-16 on an accelerated schedule but having the kids socializing with kids their age.?\\nPublic school is set up to handle the median. Each kid advances one grade per year. Public school doesn't always serve kids who are capable of doing 3 or 4 grades per year. Socialization in public school largely revolves around class time and it's hard to socialize in a public school setting when you are academically 9 years above other kids your age.?","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"You ain't gotta worry about that, Republicans don't believe in science and evidence based medical treatments.","title":"Ohio Sheriffs Lieutenant in hot water after social posts; I am sorry.

My friend took some advanced math and coding classes in the last few years of highschool through these methods.I will say even with that there are both pros and cons for homeschooling the amount of individual time you can get with your teacher is way higher than public schools as well you're probably going to feel more comfortable and be able to take things at your own pace I definitely feel for simple subjects and lower ages homeschooled children will probably outpace public schools education wise for example.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"I cant believe that there really are average Americans this stupid.

Research indicates that homeschooled students often perform well on standardized tests and excel in college, challenging the notion of academic disadvantage.Socialization is similarly misunderstood. Homeschooling provides children with rich, varied interactions, from co-ops and extracurriculars to community activities, often fostering maturity and adaptability. Homeschoolers can avoid negative social pressures typical in schools, like bullying and conformity, while developing strong, independent identities. Moreover, as homeschooling grows, networks of homeschooled students create shared experiences, mitigating any feelings of being different.Families homeschool for diverse reasons, including personalized education and fostering critical thinkingnot to shelter children from ideas. The broad outcomes for homeschooled students are positive, with many colleges actively recruiting them for their independence and preparation. Studies show they become engaged, successful adults, making the assumption that homeschooling is damaging unfounded.

Vice-President Kamala Harris argues that President Joe Bidens administration has restored alliances, but the biggest beneficiary of recent American foreign policy has not been Americas friends, but its greatest rival: China.\\nThe next president should act urgently to bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to a swift conclusion, and finally focus strategic attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Chinese Communist Party.\\nChina has benefited from a confusing American policy towards it. President Biden said he would defend Taiwan, only to have his own staff walk him back four times on the issue. America is not building armed forces to deny a Chinese attack on Taiwan. It has cut defence spending in real terms, allowing the balance of power to shift in Chinas favour.\\nMore importantly and less noticed, China has been the biggest beneficiary of American deterrence failures and ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. The Biden administration had initially promised to put relations with Russia on a stable and predictable footing and to pacify the Middle East by re-entering the Iran nuclear deal, in order to focus on China.\\nThis approach has led to the opposite outcome. Washington is bogged down in wars in Europe and the Middle East that distract from the China challenge. The administration was not simply unfortunate to have conflicts erupt on its watch. Its policies led directly to deterrence failures.\\nAmerican generals testify that the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan contributed to Vladimir Putins decision to invade Ukraine. When Russia massed forces on Ukraines borders in 2022, President Biden could have deterred the Russian leader by threatening catastrophic consequences. Instead, he reassured him, ruling out a military response and suggesting acceptance of a minor incursion. Mr Putin then launched the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war.\\nNow, American munitions and defence production are aiding Ukraine instead of deterring Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific. The attention of American and allied leaders is focused on Europe instead of China. Lloyd Austin, the secretary of defence, has led two dozen international meetings of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group. On top of that, poorly designed sanctions on Russia prevent Western countries from buying Russian oil and gas, but permit China to snap up energy resources at a discounted rate. The sanctions have transferred billions of dollars of wealth from Russia to China.\\nIt had been hoped that adopting a conciliatory approach would persuade Chinas president, Xi Jinping, to help rein in Mr Putin and prevent a nuclear attack against Ukraine. This week, Americas national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, directed the government to engage China to stop North Koreas troop deployments to Russia.\\nSimilar mistakes were repeated in the Middle East, leading to another region-wide conflagration. Naive attempts to engage Iran and prematurely ease sanctions provided Iran with resources to bankroll terror throughout the region and reduced the chance of a nuclear deal. Instead of renewing economic pressure and fully backing Israels military response to Iran and its terror proxies after the October 7th attacks, the White House restrained Israel and the Pentagon due to overwrought fears of escalation. Undue passivity only invited more aggression. In a historic first, Iran launched massive drone and missile barrages directly against Israel in April and October, and the United States had to spend billions of dollars in scarce air- and missile-defence assets to shoot down the attacks.\\nNaval assets that should be deterring China were redirected to the Middle East, including a two-carrier presence in the region this summer. Mr Biden and Ms Harris have taken some positive steps on China, such as strengthening export controls and establishing aukus, a trilateral security partnership with Britain and Australia, but these have been more than outweighed by the distraction caused by failed policies in Europe and the Middle East. Most concerning is that, with Washington preoccupied in a two-front war, China is opening a third front, engaging in almost daily stand-offs with American allies and partners, such as Taiwan and the Philippines. The world is in danger of a third major deterrence failure, and a Eurasian-wide war against multiple nuclear-armed adversaries at the same time.\\nThe next president must change course. Supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes in a war of attrition against a larger power is a recipe for failure. The next administration should aim, as Donald Trump has argued, to end the war and stop the killing. America can use economic leverage, including lifting the pause on exports of liquefied natural gas and cracking down on Russias illicit oil sales, to bring Mr Putin to the table. If he refuses to talk, Washington can, as Mr Trump argued, provide more weapons to Ukraine with fewer restrictions on their use. Faced with this pressure, Mr Putin will probably take the opportunity to wind the conflict down.\\nHis objective at the start of the war was to conduct a lightning strike to subdue Ukraine on his way toward reconstituting the Russian empire. Fighting a costly war for three years to get to an outcome in which Ukraine remains independent and more firmly anchored in the West would be a strategic defeat for the Russian leader and seen as such in Beijing. Moreover, this plan is superior to the current White House approach, which lacks a stated goal but will end in a stalemate with Russia occupying some Ukrainian territory. The current path will just take more time, blood, and treasure to get there.\\nIn the Middle East, Mr Biden and Ms Harris are calling for a ceasefire that would, in effect, leave Hamas terrorists in power in Gaza, while they prayed that Tehran did not build a nuclear weapon before the election. The next administration should, as Mr Trump argued, let Israel finish the job and get it over with fast against Hamas. They should put a credible military option on the table to make clear to the Iranians that America would stop them building nuclear weapons, and reinstate a diplomatic and economic pressure campaign to stop them and to constrain their support for terror proxies. Washington should maintain a military presence in the region, but with the war in Gaza and Lebanon concluded, it can transfer critical capabilities back to the Indo-Pacific.\\nWith stability restored in Europe and the Middle East, America would finally be able to prioritise China. A new administration should increase defence spending and revitalise the defence-industrial base to make sure its armed forces are clearly capable of denying a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Mr Trump proudly contrasts the peace of his first term with the wars of the Biden-Harris years. By following the plan described above, the next president can end ongoing conflicts and restore deterrence, global stability and peace.","title":"The biggest winner from the Biden administrations foreign policy has been China, say Michael Waltz and Matthew Kroenig"},{"text":"they like...openly dated. not exactly news.","title":"Was P Diddy arrested to get some leverage over these stars coming out in support of Kamala Harris?"},{"text":"It's not going to go anywhere.

Cunt as an insult as opposed to endearment is based on the context of personal relationships. Nigger, it is asserted, can be used in the public sphere without the context of friendship solely on the basis of visible race.

There was never a concept of race based on skin color until the European colonization period, and race is what this post is about, so it's perfectly reasonable to limit our conversation to European colonization right now.One final point, I'm a white American, so I fall under the demographic you think I'm demonizing. I'm not, and anyone who isn't emotionally stunted can understand that. I'm just aware that the history of race in Europe and North America has historically favored me and harmed non-white folks.

They have real political and economic power, the mayor of Los Angeles, for example, is a black woman, and she is not the first black or minority mayor. The same goes for many U.S. cities. You will have many Black, Latino, and Asians that are in highly-skilled jobs, such as CEOs, doctors, engineers, and lawyers. The president of my university was black, and this was in the 1990s.\\nI say all of this because it seems to me that Europeans have this idea that blacks and other minorities are all poor and are all struggling to barely get by. This is not that case.The problems the USA are currently having are dealing with the history of slavery and oppression of minorities in the distant and recent past. The current conversation is how best to deal with the systematic racism and policies that have kept minorities poor. Cities with large (mostly black) populations have endemic problems such as lack of educational opportunities, and high unemployment, mostly due to structurally racist policies.The USA is rapidly changing in terms of demographics, the USA is currently about 58% white with various minorities making up a 42% of the population. These groups are complex and have their own dialogues (such as the use of the n word which is a heated discussion in the black community and not ok with many African Americans)I think the changes in American society are huge and the discussions and disagreements are trying to decide what the USA will be in the future.\\nIts a decidedly different set of problems than what is happening in Europe.

For Kamala Harris, or any Democratic candidate, to win the electoral college while losing the popular vote would actually be a major departure from historical trends. The electoral college generally favors Republicans because of how voters are spread out geographically; smaller states and rural areas have more electoral influence, which has typically benefited Republican candidates, as we saw with George W. Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016. So, if a Democrat were to pull off an electoral college win, theyd almost certainly take the popular vote as well.And while its true that Trump has surprised pollsters before, polling methods have adapted since 2016. Many pollsters are now better at accounting for his base, meaning his previous edge over the polls might be more muted this time around. Add to that his divisive political style, and its challenging to see him significantly expanding his support beyond his core followers.Economic concerns are real, and some voters do associate inflation and economic struggles with Democrats. But recent polling shows that the public doesnt overwhelmingly trust Trump on the economy either. Inflation and global instability arent issues unique to the U.S.; theyre global problems. Voters may be wary of attributing these entirely to one party or administration, especially given that the economys recent challenges are tied to the pandemic and broader global shifts.And contrary to your expectation of low turnout, weve actually seen record-high turnout in recent elections, especially when Trump is on the ballot. Polarizing candidates tend to drive people to vote, not discourage them. While many Americans are frustrated with both major parties, this frustration often pushes them to the polls rather than keeping them home. Independent candidates may attract some disillusioned voters, but history shows they rarely pull enough to change the balance of the electoral college, especially with the logistical hurdles they face in getting on the ballot.Democrats are indeed focusing heavily on swing states, but that doesnt mean theyre ignoring the wider electorate. Campaigns today are highly data-driven, allowing them to target key areas while still making broad appeals nationally. Plus, Democrats have built up a strong mobilization infrastructure over several election cycles, which could be a big asset if high turnout continues. Their attention to swing states likely suggests confidence in the popular vote and a focused push where the electoral college matters most.Finally, demographic shifts in crucial states like Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan are making them more competitive for Democrats, especially in urban and suburban areas. These shifts make it harder for Republicans to count on their traditional rural strongholds to secure the electoral college. If these trends hold, its much more likely that a Democratic candidate who wins the electoral college would also win the popular vote.So, while Trumps base is energized, the structure of the electoral college still tends to favor Republicans. If a Democrat does win the electoral college, theyre almost certain to take the popular vote, too. And given the polarized climate, high disillusionment may actually push more Americans to vote rather than staying home.","title":"CMV: Kamala will win the electoral college vote, Trump will win the popular vote."},{"text":"There.is evidence that Trump went to a party with Epstein (not on the infamous island) but there is also a record of Trump calling him evil and saying he'd never hang out with him again.There is also evidence of Bill Clinton being on the \\"Lolita Express\\" 30 times, he is a well-documented visitor to the island.

Conspiracy theories are commonly rooted in or critical of political events and structures but have been commonly regarded as somehow apolitical - perhaps because they are representative of a supposedly \\"unserious\\" fringe or are ideologically scattershot in terms of their attitude or critique (i.e. both leftists and hardline right might have different reasons for holding the C.I.A. as categorically suspect). Between the 9/11 Truth movement and QAnon it feels like popular conspiracy theories of recent decades are  representative of popular distrust of political narratives *while simultaneously* getting slotted into the Us/Them of the U.S.'s two party political binary. This questioning of an overarching political narrative while positing a counter-narrative is basically mirroring or parallel to the narrative constructions of the two party system: whatever the current events may be there is a Good Guy, a disingenuous Bad Guy, and sufficient spin to create two wildly different interpretations of *literally everything that has happened in the past twenty or thirty years.*Honestly I think the worst thing to happen to the U.S. is the fall of the Soviet Union.

Every rapper, every young person with US street culture seems in a vital urge to use that word on a once-a-minute basis. Yet everyone seems to also think that word is a burning scar that should ban you from social life. It's sort of a Black privilege, like , you know , being Black (blackface issue). Except I don't see many Jews or Gays fighting to be calling themselves by hateful words used to kill and torture them in a not so faraway past. This dichotomy is the specific origin of the word, it carried different meanings depending on who is using it since inception. N* was historically both a category of labour (slave) as well as a category of people (people of african descent). Its specific origin was as a description and in-group reference (often used in slave-songs) of black people for themselves, that didn't know each others languages since they were brought in from disparate african regions. Historian John Thornton contends this common language was a lingua franca that fostered commerceand social interaction between people in the Atlantic world of multiple ethnic backgrounds. Even while a broken English allowed for a common\\nmode of communication between African-descended people and sailors, overseers, and slaveholders, nevertheless, as historian Michael Gomez asserts, this language and its vocabulary was never neutral. Gomez contends that when an enslaver forced an enslaved African to repeat words associated with his captors and embrace concepts which further concretized his condition of social death, the enslaved person came to realize that language was, in fact, a political weapon. As an act of subversion, enslaved people responded by making the cadence and meanings of the masters language their own.  For black laborers the word signaled a flexible discourse that acknowledged the realities of racial identity in the Americasincluding containment and\\nservitudebut also bravado and resistance. N** was a laboring folk hero, one who defied notions of African American ignorance and subservience, and, was nevertheless called n** by the people who admired him most. The usage announced that as enslaved and degraded people, African Americans could take their punches, and still develop a meaningful culture. African Americans appropriated the word n** in the United States, eschewing it as a mere labor category and crafting it into a social identity\\nrecognized by people of color throughout the North and South. **Thus, this self-proclamation was even found in northern slave songs.** Just as African Americans used n** as a way to claim a unique identity as involuntary black laborers, whites developed their own version of n**, the trajectory of which kept pace with the northern transition from slavery to freedom. Significantly, when white northerners used the word, they rarely thought of it as part of their own vocabulary, but instead imagined themselves as quoting, imitating, and ventriloquizing black English. N* thus became an accusation that blamed African Americans for speaking the slur, and therefore, for being selfacknowledged n**. In the early years of black emancipation, the white meaning of n** expanded to include not just enslaved people, but all free people of color and to flag them as backward and beyond redemption.https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=hst_facpubs","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"Whats a MMW?","title":"CMV: Kamala will win the electoral college vote, Trump will win the popular vote."},{"text":"Its true that the U.S. carries a deep legacy of racial inequality, and those scars run through nearly every part of society. From the outside, it might seem as though this legacy has left the country fragile or irreparably divided. However, addressing these divisions head-on is part of building a stronger, more inclusive society. Unlike Europe, where minority cultures have historically been assimilated or ignored to preserve social unity, the U.S. is striving to acknowledge and celebrate diversity in all its forms, even when it requires painful conversations.Its also worth noting that the history of racial inequality in the U.S. is recent, much closer to the present day than many may realize. Less than 60 years ago, racial segregation was legal in parts of the U.S., and in practice, many social systems and institutions still reflect those divisions. The Civil Rights Act, which began to dismantle legal segregation, was passed in 1964within living memory for millions of Americans. This timeline stands in stark contrast to Europe, where legal racial segregation is much farther in the past. Because the consequences of segregation and discrimination are so close to the present, American society is still in the process of reckoning with these systems and addressing their lasting impacts. There are millions of American individuals, still alive today, who in their childhoods were unable to use the same bathrooms, drink from the same fountains, sit next to each other on the same buses, exercise their right to vote, live in the same neighborhoods, go to the same schools, etc. simply because they are black. This isnt some abstract idea that applied to their ancestors. It happened to *them*. When some Americans say, my country has a racist legacy, they arent calling for the countrys destruction but rather urging it to fulfill its founding ideals. Acknowledging this history is essential for building a future where equality isnt just a value but a lived reality for all. Far from creating division, these efforts aim to unify the country on a foundation that reflects the experiences and rights of all its people. The goal isnt to break America apart; its to create a more inclusive and resilient nation that genuinely lives up to its promises.","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"Bro this was funny why the fuck am I crying","title":"Kamala Harris Mocks Donald Trump on SNL Appearance, Urges Americans to Keep Kamala and Carry On-A-La"},{"text":"Eureka stockade is back with more shit thrown at the wall everybody!!","title":"1436/-- Stock Market Myth= 666--- The Mafia Hoax= 666--- Climate Hoax= 666--- WHO Pandemic= 666"},{"text":"I think youre framing is better than mine.

I guess in the US you have a lesser Muslim proportion of your population. You could say in Europe there's a stark left / right divide on the subject of protecting (or limiting harshly) Muslim citizens rights to singularize themselves. It also varies according to the country you're in. Islam, Christianism, are two examples of religions that do not easily let go of political and social influence. They defined European history for centuries, we had many great , terrible, long religious wars...nowadays our societies are torn between atheists and traditionalists. Traditionalists had lost the battle on the Christianity field,  but now we have more Muslim people than ever, and theirs is a very less atheist-ized culture. Religion is very important to many of them. That is the big cultural and political sore point.
