I can't handle the disrespect of Trump's party, lack of ethics, and the flat out lies.I can't handle the democratic party lack of ethics, elitism, out of touch with society.The entire reason a country is strong is because of its unity,  no matter your beliefs as long as they align with the group/country it makes that country stronger.   Having a massive split preventing the ability to work together that we currently have only paralyzes the country from doing anything.\\nHistorically the only time a split in culture is resolved is with a civil war and new countries created.No matter your beliefs, our country is literally forever stuck voting on abortion.  It CAN NOT be solved, instead of voting on issues that actually effect our lives, we are stuck voting on a stupid issue that doesn't effect 99.9999% of us.Think about how rare an abortion is.  Yet people will vote on that single issue.  (Abortion is a example there are a few other big examples).  Republicans and Democrats are both guilty of this, although Republicans started it.  They all make it sound like we have to voted based on this issue.I can go on forever but voting on the issues that have no resolution, simply paralyzes our country, how often has our government been shutdown because nobody can agree.  Or think about how often a party just cock blocks a bill or pick for a position just to prevent the government from functioning.\\nHalf the population is men where abortion will never apply, and most women won't ever need an abortion.  Why does it even matter if it's legal or illegal it doesn't effect you ever.\\nAnd if u wanna protect life, guys I'm sorry to tell you this but we are constantly sending people off to war, executing prisoners and killing animals for food.  Life sucks and death is a part of life infact without death we can't have life.   btw life doesn't start at conception, life started 2-5 billion years ago and has never stopped.  Life doesn't start like a light switch.  It's always going.  I'm getting way off topic but both parties piss me off.  Our country is in a downhill spiral and I understand many people voted for trump because they wanted change.  But his changes are not going to make anything better.","title":"Near 40% of Gen Z Black Men voted Trump according to AP Votecast"},{"text":"Before launching a political crusade against military officers, Trump might also want to review the biography of his own early business lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn, who began his career as the counsel for Sen.

While Depp was found to have defamed Heard due to a statement made through his attorney which claimed an incident in which police were called to the couple's penthouse for DV that was staged by Heard and her friends. A lot of people focus on the first thing about Heard being found liable, but ignore or don't know about Depp also being liable for defamation as well. Basically they're both honestly pretty terrible figures to rally behind and I honestly believe they probably were both perpetrators of DV.It's similar to how people have heard of Lorena Bobbit, maybe not by name, but through her story in which she severed her husband's genitals and threw them on the side of the road.

Biden successfully presided over the return to normal from the pandemicboosting vaccine production/rollout, keeping safety measures going until vaccination levels hit goal targets, etc. Trump wouldve continued his COVID skepticism and, once the pushback to vaccines started, probably wouldve discouraged vaccination. This wouldve kept the pandemic going longer.2. Biden pushed heavily for additional COVID relief, through the ARPA. Trump was done with that, so the economic recovery wouldve dragged longer, if it ever really kicked off.3. Biden and Senate Dems have been able to mitigate a lot of the harm done by Trump and the GOP in the judiciary. Another 2-4 years of GOP judicial appointments wouldve been disastrous.Basically, and 2021-24 Trump second term wouldve better locked-in the damage he did in his first term. Sure, electorally, Dems might have been positioned for big wins in 22 and 24, we dont know.

First of all, Tariffs are hard to remove. Once they're there, and the market has adjusted to them, and they're now a source of income, there's not really any reason to remove them. Especially since China levied their own tariffs on the US because of Trump's tariffs. This is called a trade war, and if the US removed their own tariffs, there's no guarantee that China would do the same. So in short, there wasn't a reason to remove them. And it could backfire on the US if they did remove them.Secondly, Trump's tariffs were targetted. They were specific tariffs on specific materials (i.e. Steel &amp; Aluminium). They weren't great, but they weren't massive enough to have an inflationary effect. Additionally, any inflationary effect by Trump's tariffs would quickly get overshadowed by COVID-19. So it's sort of like Brexit in the UK. It probably did have a longterm economic effect. But because of the COVID-19 shockwave, we might never know exactly what it was.Trump's new tariffs **will** cause an inflationary effect. If Trump effectively shuts off all imports, companies will either pass the bill onto the consumer, abandon their US market in favour of a European markets (for example) or will begin the race to build manufacturing in the US. If they pass the bill onto the consumer, that's rising prices. That is, by definition, what inflation is.  \\nIf they abandon the US market, that'll have less supply &amp; less competition in the US. This'll mean companies have to compete with rising demand (as the customers who once bought a product from Company Z, will now have to buy from Company Y) which'll rise prices. Again, inflation.  \\nIf they build manufacturing in the US, that'll result in higher labour costs (due to the USAs workers protection) which'll make the cost of manufacturing higher. But also, simply building a factory will get more expensive. Construction materials (which often have to be imported) will be more expensive. The equipment will be more expensive. And of course, it takes years for a factory to reach full capacity.","title":"6 things expected to get more expensive if Trump's trade plans are enacted"},{"text":"I called them out several times but okay.","title":"Me arguing with comment section trump troll"},{"text":"The feminism Stans will always treat you as if you are subhuman solely on account of your gender.

Out of all the major 2028 candidates, he has the least amount of obvious weaknesses but Ill give you some that I think he has:1. Maryland is not an ideologically diverse state, in fact being Governor of Maryland is a quite boring position politically. Marylands state politics have been stable for decades now, even when Hogan was governor. The electorate in MD is overwhelmingly center-left which makes Moores job pretty easy compared to his other Democratic Governor counterparts. Even Newsom has to deal with a more ideological diverse electorate, as CA has progressive hotbeds, MAGA country, and center-left places all in one state.2. Very ambitious and has wanted to run for President for a long time. This shouldnt be a weakness in Presidential politics, but the fact is that many voters are turned off by candidates that have obviously positioned themselves for Presidential runs. Wes has been pushed to run for office ever since he was in his mid-20s, and I can see some voters being turned off by that.3. He has the habit of making very flowery, word salad-esque speeches. If it lands, you get Obama comparisons. If not, people will roll their eyes a bit like they do when Cory Booker speaks.4.

Do you understand that $35 TRILLION in debt is approximately $100,000 of debt per person in the United States? How do you think that will ever be paid back, especially when the US is adding another $TRILLION to the total every few moths?At the start of the Great Depression, Hoover raised tariffs to protect American industry. This is popularly assumed to have caused the Depression. However - and this data takes some time to search out - at the same time, the Federal Reserve and the commercial banks worked to reduce the money supply by an unprecedented 20%. That had never happened before, and the results were catastrophic.Most people are unaware of the link between the money supply and inflation/deflation. If you look at no other chart, look at this one: \\\\[US money supply\\\\](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL). Note the huge spike upwards immediately after Biden took office; then you won't have to wonder why prices went crazy for the next year. And note that upward spike was only about 10% of the total. The similar process took place in reverse in 1930. Commercial banks, fearful, stopped making loans, and the Fed did not step in to provide extra liquidity. As a result, the money supply fell by over 20%. Without cash, businesses failed, and the downward spiral began. It wasn't until the war and the massive government stimulus that the US economy was able to reflate. So, I don't doubt that top Dems at the Fed - like Powell - and at the big commercial banks - like Jamie Dimon - would love nothing more than to pull the plug on the US economy and have it go in the dumper while Trump's in power. They don't care personally - they are insulated from the downturn by their own millions - and they will happily see millions in despair and poverty if it gets them their political goals.","title":"What The Hell Is Mike Lindell Talking About?"},{"text":" Today, even my conservative relatives dont.X","title":"Why not Wes Moore in 2028?"},{"text":"I left Twitter as soon as he took over.

Meaning none of their parents were first cousins. When it happens time after time, the risk of defects rises exponentially. Research in Middle East, where generations have first cousins have married and procreated, finds the rate of birth defects rises pretty steeply with each subsequent generation. So while the risk for two random first cousins might be only a percent or two higher the general population, but the time you get to double first cousin marriages (which basically means you and your first cousin spouse have the same set of four grandparents), you start seeing two, three, even four times the rate of catastrophic birth defects. Which makes sense, right? Bc each subsequent generation the genetic pool gets shallower and shallower. This isn't a cousin issue, really. It's a genetic one. In closed communities, like the Amish, where first cousin marriage isn't a thing, the rate of genetic diseases and birth defects is astronomically higher than any two random cousins with no history of genetic overlap. Bc Amish ppl in the community tend to marry Amish ppl in the community. And they're all descended from the same few hundred families that came to America however many generations ago. That's also why families like Whittakers show might higher rates of really significant genetic abnormalities after just a couple generations of first cousin marriages (although iirc theirs was accelerated by a set or two of identical twins.

It is sort of a compromise between a full default, which is where the federal government has been heading towards, and massively raising taxes while simultaneously cutting spending to pay off the debt.

Re-read my words if you need to.  I own no Trump swag and donated no money to his campaign.I seek no argument, yet I've found no compelling argument to change my mind.  His slogan, stolen from Reagan, was \\"Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago?\\".  That question is to the individual.  My personal answer was no.What I've said here, and you can spend your day going through my history, should you so be inclined, is that this dichotomy of \\"choice\\" was simple.  A globalist or a nationalist agenda.  I've instructed the reader to \\"choose wisely\\".On a personal level, globalism consolidates wealth.  Nationalism does, too, don't get me wrong, but, there are more crumbs on the nationalist floor for me to take back to the mouse hole than there are under globalism.  Both have cronyism, but, I will benefit more from my local cronies on US soil than cronies in their evil lairs elsewhere.And, as I've also said, should you so choose to review my post history, that there is motivation for any and all actions that we do throughout the course of our day.  I swing my legs out of bed on the daily to generate revenue.  If I was independently wealthy, I'd stay in bed all day.  But, to have a bed to stay in, I better swing my tired assed legs out of it and get to it.  The mortgage company is unforgiving and without sense of humor.  The first of the month comes approximately every 30 days, along with the \\"please remit\\" payment coupon of almost every aspect of my  life.So, for me and my own personal financial well being (money makes the world go-'round, don't it?), nationalism is my logical choice.  And I walk into my choice knowing full well that the true puppet masters are deep in the shadows.  But, there is tumult amongst their ranks.  They have their own power struggles.  They are far from \\"friends\\", and cohesion.  I'm giving the Trump puppet masters a chance to drop crumbs for me in their gorge at their newly taken seats at the table of bountiful yumminess, replacing a few of the globalist puppet masters that were previously in the chairs.I'm right with my God and I'm right with myself.  I will use this opportunity to hoard my crumbs to be better prepared when the musical chairs song upstairs plays again and the crumbs get harder to come by.  That was my personal lesson.  Globalism is never designed to work for me.  But, I can make nationalism work a little.Let's talk again in 4 years and you can give me your answer to the \\"Are you better off . . . ?\\" question.  I'd only suggest, if you're in the US, that you position yourself to weather the inevitable \\"storm\\" that looms.  Unless, of course, you're a government employee doing a redundant task remotely on my tax dollars, and if you are, it may be time to re-evaluate things.Kayfabe will always have entertainment value.

I think blanket tariffs are a stupid idea from someone who doesnt understand how economics work or at least hopes his voters dont (they didnt) but free trade is a component of free market economics. Tariffs are not a free trade thing. Free trade invites moving manufacturing to places where its cheaper. it can lead to cheaper prices for consumers, it definitely leads to bigger profit margins, but it comes at the expense of jobs here. Even the EU countries have tariffs between themselves, in what I think many Americans probably assume is a free trade zone.Jobs that can support a family, or cheap, disposable consumable garbage.

Whatever it is that they want, what they don't want is more of the same. Anti-establishment sentiment is on the rise, and even if you show them that statistically the situation is improving they don't feel like it and they'll blame the ruling party and anybody they associate with the ruling party. Candidates have to present themselves as new, different, real change. The fact that it's not fair nor reasonable doesn't matter.\\n2. The idea that the majority of the electorate is educated and considers policies carefully before they cast their vote is dead. It's just a popularity contest now, and whoever is better at selling themselves wins. Combine this with 1 and a carefully curated candidate who never says anything remotely offensive or genuine will not win on a federal level, because they're seen as either boring or fake. Again, neither fair nor reasonable, but that appears to be what is needed to appeal to the present-day voter across the states.These are not hard rules, of course, but people are trying to figure out what they can possibly do to improve the situation at this point, and trying something different at the very least seems more promising than doing the same thing again and hoping that this time people are tired of Trump again.Also, for left-wingers specifically there's probably also some level of recalcitrance towards another attempt at winning with moderate candidates. They received a lot of flack about how they should shut up and just close the ranks behind Biden and then Harris for the sake of winning, so now that Republicans have swept everything there's an attitude of \\"Yeah no fuck trying that again.\\"Especially since they've also received a lot of blame for Clinton's loss.

The first presidents of Johns Hopkins and Cornell were both prominent Skull &amp; Bones members. Cornell is also connected to Skull &amp; Bones through the Morrill Bill land grant. And of course, Yale is home to Skull &amp; Bones. Johns Hopkins, one of the [Covid corona simulation party planners](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) and official Covid data compilers, has been connected to The Order of Skull &amp; Bones since 1876.Hopkins first president was Bonesman Daniel Coit Gilman.**If Prescott Bush could become an instant Captain in a regiment with the same number (322) as his fraternity chapter** - then why could not son Bush be favorably considered when medals were handed out?  It is not unknown to allocate so many medals per unit for distribution at the discretion of the commanding officer. ^1THOSE on the inside know it as **The Order.** Others have known it for more than 150 years as **Chapter 322 of a German secret society.** More formally for legal purposes, The Order was incorporated as **The Russell Trust in 1856.**  It was also once known as the Brotherhood of Death.  **Those who make light of it, or want to make fun of it, call it Skull &amp; Bones, or just plain Bones.** ^2The American chapter of this German order was founded in 1833 at Yale University by General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft who, in 1876, became Secretary of War in the Grant Administration. Alphonso Taft was the father of William Howard Taft, the only to be both President and Chief Justice of the United States.**What is the significance of the 322 in Chapter 322?**  William Russell imported the society from Germany and so it has been argued the 322 stands for 32 (from 1832), the second chapter, of this German organization. Possibly a chapter 320 and a chapter 321 may exist somewhere.  And 323 is the designation of a room within the Skull &amp; Bones temple at Yale.Another interpretation is that The Order is descended from a Greek fraternal society dating back to Demosthenes in 322 B.C.  This has perhaps some credibility because Bones records are dated by adding 322 to the current year, i.e., records originating in 1950 are dated Anno - Demostheni 2272.According to the US News &amp; World Report, May 13, 1991, when asked by a reporter if he had news about the rebellion in Iraq? **George HW Bush** answered only with the code-word seven. According to the magazines source seven refers to the fact that, because Skull &amp; Bones has fifteen members, a majority eight vote means yes and seven votes represents a no, lose or fail. The source also reports that when the president was invited to a meeting in the Tomb,... he declined because he could not enter its inner sanctum without his Secret Service officers, none of whom are members. **Bush was then fined  and he subsequently paid  $3.22 for missing a meeting.** ^3322 is the Orders particular, peculiar number, and is on the door and inlaid on the floor of their sanctum sanctorum in the upstairs of the original hall.  What 322 means has been debated for years.  Some say that it relates to the year 1832 when the Yale society was founded and the second 2 meant it was a second chapter of a German secret society. Some say it represents the date of the death of Demosthenes, claiming it was upon his philosophy that Bones was founded.  Others point to the occultic and numerological aspects of the number.  Again there are several differing explanations.  One being that 322 represents the symbolic dimensions for an isosceles triangle with three as the base and the twos becoming equal sides. In an isosceles triangle with the point of the apex representing a Logos, and the two equal sides flowing from it representing the masculine and feminine rays, the horizontal base-line stands for the physical foundation from which the manifested objective world starts into existence.The most visible and recognized symbol of the group is the skull and crossbones.  A symbol of death, that is found on bottles of poison, pirates flags and the Nazi totenkopf, deaths head the insignia of the Nazi Schutzstaffel or, as commonly known, the SS. It has been used in Prussia for elite troops as far back as 1740.**A History of Drug Trafficking**Skull and Bones  **the Russell Trust Association**  was first established among the class graduating from Yale in 1833. Its founder was [William Huntington Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Huntington_Russell) of Middletown, Connecticut.  The Russell family was the master of incalculable wealth derived from **the largest U.S. criminal organization of the nineteenth century: Russell and Company, the great opium syndicate.** ^4Not only did Skull and Bones become a **major force in drug smuggling (the Bush and Prescott families in the 1860s), but in true Hegelian fashion, generated the antithesis, the so-called war on drugs.** This hypocritical policy maintains the price of drugs, controls supply, and puts millions in jail while the gainers, in great part, are none other than the same Bonesmen who pass the laws to prohibit (Bonesman Taft, 1904). ^2**References**^1 Two Faces of George Bush\\nAntony Sutton, 1988^2 Americas Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones,\\nAntony C.

Jim Jones was an alleged CIA asset.Future VP Dan Quayle was invited to Jonestown by his friend congressman Leo Ryan. Quayle declined and Ryan was killed in Jonestown. Quayle and Mike Pence were close with not only GHW Bush, but also OSS/CIA spy, politician and mogul Dr. Beurt SerVass.","title":"George Bush Sr Funeral &amp; the Envelopes"},{"text":"Gurn smiled sympathetically at the warder.\\"Not so bad!\\" he remarked; \\"that's pretty good reasoning for a mere gaoler.\\" And as Nibet was about to press the matter, Gurn anticipated his questions, and made frank confession. \\"Well, yes, I did try to get out,  got as far as the clerk's office last evening, but at the last minute I funked it, and went back on to the roof.

I've never seen Target sell something for 9.99 and 9/10.  Also, gas stations likely provide that discount on gas to increase foot traffic in the store to help drive sales of higher profit margin convenience store items.  But marginally, from a pure \\"cost of the gas\\" perspective, I can't see how the cash discount actually saves them material money.There is a pizza place near me that offers 5% off to pay by cash.  Admittedly some places do it.  But broadly speaking, I've found they're the 'exception' and not the rule.  And honestly, I'm not entirely convinced they do it to help suppress their revenue.  For example, an insurance company will base GL coverage off Sales.  If 70% of revenue is in cash, it's a bit easier to under-report that value a little bit without getting caught.Certainly not every business is doing it, but there are incentives to accepting cash beyond \\"merchant service fees\\".I also appreciate my rebuttal is very biased... happy to have you poke holes in it when you get the time.","title":"Bernie Sanders tentatively pledges to support cap on credit card interest rates proposed by Trump."},{"text":"So we can be racist and just assume that there are no americans working for aljazeera because its name sounds like Islam.

This is more than likely due to the population having a small founding population and expanding from there, thus increasing the incidence of these diseases.Once again, most people don't fit into this category.","title":"CMV: If you think cousin marriage should be illegal, you should believe the same for disabled people reproducing"},{"text":"We need our own truly left populist movement r/newdealparty","title":"Republicans Are Already Trying to Grant Trump Dangerous Powers"},{"text":"If you hate him now, wait til he takes office","title":"Folks regret voting for Trump"},{"text":"Is your view changed to banning marriage altogether then?

Josephson ran into problems with the corrupt Rockefeller Syndicate and AMA. He would go on to write several books aimed at the Rockefeller Syndicate. Josephson also wrote of Weishaupts historical Bavarian Illuminati.  Writing that **the Illuminati merged with European Freemasonry in 1782, and forced the Vatican to reinstate the Jesuit Order.** Nesta Websters earlier work also mentions this. Josephson acknowledges the Rothschilds as more of serving the Vatican/Jesuit/Illuminati. Josephson writes:Several groups of members offered Weishaupt special problems. The Protestant princes and rulers of Germany and Europe were delighted with Weishaupts plan to destroy the Catholic Church, and they flocked to the Order. **They brought with them control of the Masonic Order, in which they initiated Weishaupt and his fellow conspirators in 1777.  Subsequently, at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, they effected a merger of the Order of Illuminati and the Masonic Order. Weishaupt sought and welcomed the powerful support of these rulers.** But he realized that he must not permit them to suspect that, in furtherance of his internationalist goal of One World dictatorship, the Order was dedicated to destroying them also. Weishaupt craftily solved this problem by limiting the princes and rulers to the lower degrees and barring them from the knowledge of the true purposes of the Order, that were revealed, cautiously, only to those in the higher degrees. ^1Renegade Jesuits, whom Weishaupt initially welcomed, then rejected, and finally welcomed once again into the Order, and Jews, who were initially rejected and later were welcomed, also constituted special problems.  Eventually, however, Weishaupt and his successors welcomed into the Order these groups, and all others that could be trusted to be thoroughly discontent with the prevailing order. And it was primarily, renegade Catholics, chronic malcontents and revolutionaries among the Protestants, and Jews who were selectively advanced to the highest degrees and innermost secrets of the Order of Illuminati and its successor organizations.An amusing story is told of the earliest relations of the Rothschilds with the Vatican. The Vatican found itself short of ready cash after almost half a century of war waged on it for the Jesuit Order by one of its unordained members, Adam Weishaupt, to avenge its abolition, in 1773, as immoral and a menace to the Church and the Faith by short-lived Pope Clement XIV in his Papal breve Dominus Ac Redemptor. Weishaupt and his fellow Jesuits cut off the income to \\nthe Vatican by launching and leading the French Revolution; by directing Napoleons conquest of Catholic Europe; by the revolt against the Church led by such priests as Father Hidalgo, in Mexico and Latin America; by eventually having Napoleon throw Pope Pius VII in jail at Avignon until he agreed, as the price for his release, to \\nreestablish the Jesuit Order. This Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret, 1822, Treaty of Verona. (72:8 ;73) ^2The Jesuits thus so completely impaired the credit of the Vatican that no Christian banker would entrust it with a loan of needed funds. Only the nouveau riche Jewish upstarts, who had made their fortune in the latter part of the Napoleonic wars, the Rothschilds, would trust the Church with urgently needed 5 million pounds. Pope Gregory XVI was so grateful to the Rothschilds that he conferred on Kalman Rothschild a Papal decoration. In deference to the Jewish faith of the philanthropic banker, the usual cross in the decoration was replaced by a Star of David. Rothschild was incensed at this discriminatory gesture. He demanded, and was awarded, the decoration with a cross. Ever since, the Rothschilds have been the fiscal agents of the Vatican. The Rothschilds sought to extend their financial and political dominion to the United States, for themselves primarily to serve the interests of their Vatican masters.\\nEdit: formatting **REFERENCES**^1 Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

I get that in theory you're trying to advocate for consistency, which is an admiral goal, but your problem here is that you're collapsing the entire issue into binary properties, as if the only way anyone could think about these things is black and white \\"freedom good/bad\\" and \\"reproductive issues good/bad\\".\\nBut this is an obvious oversimplification of why anyone supports or opposes anything. Having a disability is about who you are, but marrying a cousin is about who you choose to marry there. They're not the same thing, and so you can't make this simplistic appeal to consistency. Similarly, the risks are different. For one thing, his do you even define \\"disabled\\" here. What does and doesn't count is going to be disputed. In addition, the benefit of marriage aren't solely reproductive in nature.\\nWhen people form opinions about things, it usually ends up as essentially a cost benefit analysis. But both the costs and benefits are more complicated than single binary yes / no properties, so the appeal to consistency just doesn't map on cleanly here.\\n?My view is that both cases should be legal for the sake of freedom of choice.\\nReally, I think this should just be the primary part of your view. Ditch the comparison to people with disabilities entirely. I don't personally have a strong feeling about it, but trying to do this 1:1 comparison precludes even talking about stuff like grooming / family pressure as a reason against cousin marriage. I'd probably ultimately come down on the same side as you in terms of just let people do what they want - my objection here is almost entire around the \\"if you think X then you should think Y\\" framing.

If they have kids, there is a roughly 1/4 chance for every genetic feature they share to be passed on to their kids as a double-gene - about 1/32 of the child's 20 000 genes will be two copies of the exact same gene - about 625 genes.That's a problem not just for genetic defects, but for genes that are codominant. Codominant genes are genes in which two or more variants of the gene exist, and will be expressed if you have them - and are best-studied in immune response; where having more different genes tends to make you more resistant to getting sick. That, combined with the number of \\"genetic defects\\" that are helpful with single copies of the gene (see Sickle-Cell trait: one copy of the gene is a minor drawback that makes you all but immune to malaria; two copies gives you sickle-cell anemia which can kill you), means that cousin marriage is still quite risky - enough so that humans, across cultures, recognized the risks of it....In contrast, unless the other parent is a known carrier or has the same genetic disability; the odds of them having the gene for that genetic disability is usually less than 1% - AND, because there's only one defect you're looking at, that risk doesn't carry across the rest of the genetic code, meaning there's basically no risk of any of the kids having the genetic disability.IN ADDITION, at least historically, a person who was disabled but still successful enough to marry and have kids had to have something going for them - which implies an edge somewhere else in their genetic code; something that makes them successful. Which means that, historically, having children with a successful disabled person meant that, even if your children had that genetic disability (which, as noted before, is usually less than 1%), their odds were good that they got the genes that made that person successful (50%) - which on the whole was a good bet at the least.","title":"CMV: If you think cousin marriage should be illegal, you should believe the same for disabled people reproducing"},{"text":" You realize voting IS how you safeguard against fascism right?And now we're past safeguarding into stopping.

But his proposed economic agenda could potentially set the stage for mortgage rates to move higher, some economists and analysts say. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including moves in the yield for U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which lenders use as a guide to price home loans. Treasury yields rose in recent weeks even after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences rates on all types of loans including mortgages. Investors appeared to question how far the Fed should cut rates given the strength of the economy. Then yields surged further immediately after Trumps victory, sending the average rate on a 30-year mortgage up to 6.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. Given what were seeing in bond markets, investors are expecting higher rates under a Trump administration and are starting to position in that direction already, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. So, if overall rates are higher, that would tend to also mean that mortgage rates would move higher, too. **Trump says he wants to impose tariffs on foreign goods, lower tax rates, and lighten regulations, policies that could rev up the economy, but also fuel inflation and increase U.S. government debt  and, say some economists, lead to higher interest rates and in turn higher mortgage rates.**","title":"Trumps economic agenda for his second term is clouding the outlook for mortgage rates"},{"text":"America proving to the world that slipping in education for decades has consequences","title":"Folks regret voting for Trump"},{"text":"That's not unique to Trump, that's every politician.

If we want to truly lose our prejudices, not talking about our gender identity is the way to go. We need to stop labeling people as anything other than people. In fact i would encourage u to stop labeling ur self as trans. Think of it like this. If u truly believe that u are the sex u have changed to, then why call ur self trans in any other situation which is unnecessary. At a dr appointment u might need to admit that ur trans for medical reasons. If ur on a dating site u might need to admit that ur trans so u can be honest with the person whom u might spend the rest of ur life with. If ur at the store there doesnt red to be a mention of it by anyone. I wouldnt bring it up unless others start being hateful. I only say this because I realize that a significant portion of our society is defined by the sexual orientation. However, I am heterosexual and when I talk about myself that never gets brought up because it doesnt define who I am. Just like u being trans shouldnt define who u are. I dont know u but I believe every person has a beautiful person inside. Some of them have locked that beautiful person up in a prison cell in their mind and dont allow it to be seen because theyre too worried about other people. Just be that beautiful person. Stop worrying about what other people say or do.  There will be haters. Let them hate. Because u cant control other people, u can only control urself and ur own reaction to them. Learn not to care about their opinions because they have a right to them even if we dont like them. Once I learned this lesson I became a much happier person. Believe it or not, heterosexuals can go through self hatred also. Once i learned to really love myself and not care what other people thought, I found peace. Hopefully u can find urs.","title":"Hi Im a member of the lgbt community and I voted for trump."},{"text":"Oh that's cute, they still call them voters.","title":"Focus group: Swing voters wary of Musk-Trump relationship"},{"text":"It was the title of his first four years.","title":"\\"People are scared\\": Activists brace for \\"unprecedented assault on human rights\\" under Trump"},{"text":"I really feel like everything thats gone wrong for over a decade now is because of Citizens United.
