No, you cant vote for the people because thats socialism and thats bad. You have to choose which millionaire gets to win! Is one worse than the other? Sure! But both are nowhere near what they should be and neither actually represents the people of the country. Take it or leave it! Just give more! Many Democrats felt this was 100% the right thing to do and I know many Democrats saw the choice as between the lesser of two evils.At this point, its become libertarians in the center, Democrats on the right and Republicans on the far right. We have no leftist party who focuses on the wellbeing of the people above all else. We have a Democrat *light right* wing party who claims to care, only to use that as a way to drain money from the people they claim to care about. If theres ever another election, instead of volunteering, maybe press the candidates to see if they actually represent you and dont simply have their hand out for more money? I have to always remember when Bernie Sanders was running for president against Trump and leading to become the Democratic presidential nominee. Even Trump feared Bernie was unstoppable! That was until the DNC stopped him and chose Hilary Clinton in his stead stating the DNC sees no enforceable obligation in having to run a fair and impartial primary election The DNC attorneys argued the words impartial and evenhandedused in the DNC Charter cant be interpreted by a court of law and there in used to keep things honest. All the people who donated to Bernies campaign were robbed of their money and their hope only to watch Trump become president the first time. Here we are again. Always stand up for what you believe in. Sometimes it IS about the lesser of two evils. At times like right now though, where youve done everything youre being allowed to do, I ask, is supporting this party as it is still worth the effort and never ending demand for funding? OR is it time to demand restructure? What do you do if they refuse? Keep paying endlessly to lose?","title":"Biden gets blamed by Harris allies for the vice presidents resounding loss to Trump"},{"text":"Thank you for defending what I said! I appreciate it.

We are all going along for this ride when we know it's controlled by individuals who want control and power.The very foundation of our society is irrational the opposite of intelligence. An intelligent entity would make decisions that enabled all of life to live in harmony and not in a constant state of war and conflict.An intelligent species would not create an economic system and make profit more important than the well-being of humanity.Since when did money determine your value as a human being? Money has nothing to do with our worth or the respect we deserve. We aren't born with an organ that manufactures money. We've been conditioned to respect people with money when that has nothing to do with whether or not they deserve respect.The idea of money has destroyed our species. It's corrupted our actions and how we live our lives. We've accepted poverty and homelessness as we justify wasting $$billions on invading countries and killing innocent people.What are we doing? We're all complicit. Hitler never killed anybody, he told the people around him what he wanted, and they did it. Because of money, people bow down to tyranny. This society will never change as long as money and profit are valued more than a human life.I'm happy Trump won. He stopped America from sinking into tyranny and communism.

By advocating for increased privatization and partnerships with the private sector in space exploration, Musk could argue that the government could save billions by outsourcing certain projects to SpaceX and similar companies. This approach could reduce the overall budget of agencies like NASA without sacrificing achievements.Investing in Sustainable Energy: Musks focus on sustainable energy through companies like Tesla and SolarCity could translate into federal savings. For example, if government buildings, facilities, or military bases were to adopt solar power or electric vehicles, this could lead to long-term energy savings. Musk might promote policies that encourage government investment in green technology, reducing reliance on more expensive and less efficient energy sources over time.Transportation and Infrastructure Innovation: Musk has been a proponent of infrastructure innovations, like the Hyperloop and autonomous vehicles, which could ultimately lower transportation costs. If applied to federal projects, these technologies could potentially reduce the costs associated with national infrastructure maintenance, military logistics, or public transportation.AI and Automation in Government: With his insights into AI (despite his caution regarding its ethical use), Musk might encourage the use of automation in federal departments. This could streamline bureaucratic processes, reduce waste, and potentially reduce labor costs in certain sectors of government.Defense and Space Contracts: Musk might advocate for a more strategic approach to defense and space spending by emphasizing cost-effective solutions from private companies. SpaceX, for instance, already works with the Department of Defense to provide satellite launches at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. Expanding such collaborations could reduce defense expenditures while still supporting technological advancement.Ultimately, while Musk could have influence through these areas, his role would mostly be as an advisor or contractor. Direct budget decisions and cuts remain the responsibility of Congress and federal agencies, but he could certainly advocate for innovation-driven policies to reduce spending.","title":"Elon Musk says he can cut at $2 trillion from the federal budget once Trump is President.

The democrats pointed towards what they had accomplished in the Biden presidency and let Trump spout the craziest shit anyone running for President has ever said and the people said thats what they want. The people looked at the hate and said yes. They looked at project 2025 and said yes. They dont want Bernie or FDR. They want Charles Lindbergh.?What put Trump over the top was Latino communities finally aligning themselves with Christo conservative values. When it comes down to it a lot of Latino communities are naturally conservative. They heard a man saying they would ban abortion, remove womens rights, and turn America more Christian and got on board. They convinced themselves when they deport people, Trump was only talking about the other Latinos they dont like. This isnt about any of that crap youre pointing out.?In reality, if the Democrats want to win again they will have to drop a lot of issues progressives care about and move towards the right. It sucks but its true. No one gives a fuck about unions anymore. Their members proved unreliable as a voting base. I also imagine a major roll back in workers rights coming.?Not enough people will ever care about the environment enough for it to be a major political issue. Abortion was on the ballot and not enough cared. The destruction of our entire democracy felt like it was on the ballot and not enough cared. Gen Z came out in force for Trump. That tells you about the future. The progressive movement as a platform is dead in America and will never come back. People said trans rights and the majority said it was an example of what was wrong with America. All of which is unfortunate but true.?The way the democrats can win in the future will literally be fighting to get back some of small pieces of major socialist programs that will be ripped apart that people liked and relied on.Social Security and Medicare are about to get sliced and diced. I wouldnt be surprised if Democrats are fighting to keep the age of retirement under 75 and attempting return benefits to Medicare in the next presidential election.Democrats also have to hope Trump does go all in on tariffs and crashes the economy into a depression.

Viviek, Elon, JD Vance (Surprisly is amazing), Tulsi. These people are really good speakers, smart and the things they say come of as understanding and real. Also many of them have MORE democratic values that people are used to than the current team.Democrats on the other hand was a mess. Kamala isnt someone we can be excited about. She has so many contriversies especially not being able to talk for a long time. If she did a 3 hour interview with few people she woulda killed that and shut right up. Also her choice of VP was horrible. Bottom line horrible horrible decisions.IDK overall, this was a no brainer on how it played out hence trump probably getting 300+ electoral votes and also popularity vote.","title":"Donald Trump Didn't Win.

Is that an easily digestible sound bite that makes you feel good? No? Tough. Be an adult and accept that feel good soundbites are junk and the guy pushing them is just looking to reach a hand into your pocket.This election was not a referendum on neoliberalism because you have no proof of what *would* have gotten more folks to the polls. In fact, because Biden (who, if anything, was more neoliberal than Harris) won more votes you cant solely point to policy issues as the reason. The only way Harris could have moved the Dearborn contingent would have been to do exactly what they demanded and even then there is no guarantee given *they voted for Trump*.

And covid ravaged many coutries and cause a lot of economic crisis and then instead of admitting covid was mainly at fault they thought it made more sense politically to say he handled it too poorly and that he was the cause for all of americas problems and sort lf sat back and didnt do anything. They could have made law allowing abortion in every state again or stopped roe v wade from being overturned since they controlled 2/3 sectors of government but just said oh well we tried and failed. And beyond all of that the exit from the war in afganistan is a total embarassment and the fact that it didnt become a bigger issue with most americans yet is beyond me because joe and kamala pulled troops out of afganistan and didnt follow trumps set in place plan to get everything out because god forbid parties work together on something ever. Now you have terrorist extremists parading with their new top of the line military equipment which is absolutely horrific and that whole was was a massive black hole for money that didnt even produce any results besides cutting the head off the snake once just to have it grow a new head. BUT then without adressing any of their own shortcomings they run kamala on a campaign that really seems to be a grab for voters to want to elect a woman, a black woman which i would say is a fantastic milestone to try to acheive, but it has to be organic and that person who will untimately be the first needs to earn it not just be undemocratically inserted as the presidential candidate (that could be concerning to the state of a democracy) along with actually advocationg for no voter id when there is a know illegal migrant crisis ( thats insane and no other country does that) and then run a campaign on giving back abortion rights and trans rights and inclusion and aid to israel and ukraine and not very much else past that which A) does not cover the border crisis B) doesnt even compete with rfk and trump teaming up to make america healthy again which i see as the greatest win of the election and to not try to run on that same idea was a major missed oportunity but theres a lot of big pharma influence that might not allow that with the democrats and maybe even the republicans but atleast they are making an issue of it now and rightfully so as americans have the worst chronic desease epeidemic of most if not all countries of the world.  you have a guy thats not really cool with people getting abortions as far as im aware besides life of the mother etc etc and has talked very poorly to and about women which isnt right but typical of his generation and hes a felon which there are many politicians on both sides that are equally or more deserving of felon status for insider trading etc etc.I think the main issue with the republican party is that religion is in some of their politics and religion and government should stay separate and it has caused some really bad issues for americans and has given the republican party a bad lookBut to answer your question i think that kost of america is pro trump because he is campaigning on actually fixing the countries issues and not just abortion and trans rights which are lesser issues when you have venezuelan criminals being releases from prison and dropped at the american border as they can just walk in and stay, major human traffickking and just an explosion of undocumented population. I think dems are the minority but some dem values are not minorally shared as i think most women want abortion access to exist and i think theres an argument to be made that you you cant just have one late term because you want to you need a cutoff date which is longer than six weeks because you might not even even know you pregnant then and not everyone is ready but 24 weeks might be too long i think theres some scientific research to be done to find a realistic cutoff (with exemptions ofc) but it seems trump as crude as he is really might be the best option.

Trump and the Republicans used the fascist playbook to weaponize rhetoric. They created a fictional narrative about who Trump is, and who he will be as president. As well as a fiction about Harris. Voters either bought into it wholesale. Or in the confusion of all the discrepancies of it, they picked and choose the part they like the best. Or, because the propaganda lies was also designed to create mistrust and sow confusion, they didn't think that the election mattered and sat it out.So it doesn't matter who the candidate was. They would simply have reshaped the narrative. Face it. Tens of millions of people got conned. The fascist playbook works in countries where voters are not vigilant and resistant to it. But if you want to blame someone, blame the media. They have been sane washing Trump for years. Had they called him out more on his lies, and label them fascist whenever he used fascist rhetoric, perhaps enough people would have been more resistant to it.","title":"So here is the thing that I am still trying to wrap my head around the most.."},{"text":"So you understand why legal immigrants would find an issue with people who came here illegally. Having gone through the process (that's easier than immigrating to a lot of other countries, but not the easiest in the world), been patient, waited for the system to move you along only to have someone skip the line and circumvent that process.And also I disagree with your comment about how everyone is literally illegal immigrants here. There wasn't a country when Europeans came over here (they obviously didn't discover it, there were people here already) and there weren't laws in place that had a process for people who wanted to move here that were being broken by the people arriving.I think most people are empathetic and understanding, but just because someone is in a not great situation in their home country doesn't mean they are entitled to come live in the USA without going through the process in place and following the rules. And if they're escaping a \\"dire situation\\" that qualifies for them declaring asylum here, then there's a path for those people too that doesn't involve sneaking in.There are many, many countries in the world where moving there and obtaining a citizenship is way harder than it is in the USA.","title":"How the 'Latinx' label shifted Latinos from Democrats into arms of Trump"},{"text":"Step one.

I think the issue is that most people just block out how awful Trump is on multiple levels... the negative stories don't break through into their echo chambers, aren't discussed on Fox, not what their friends share on Facebook or whatever. They just don't see it.So with that established, you have to figure that The Republican in a swing state is almost always going to get 45% of the vote regardless of who the candidate is and who they are running against. So that's sort of Trump's floor here. Those aren't voters for Trump, they are voters for generic-Republican. So all Trump has to do is find that other 6% that wouldn't otherwise vote and he wins.. and that's what happened. He managed to find conservative-adjacent people who usually don't vote but were willing to show up for him. Perhaps Liz Cheney actually pulled away a few of those traditional Republicans and the floor is more like 42% and he needs to make up 9% but if that's the case, he still found the votes.Also keep in mind that roughly 1/3 of illegible voters can't even be bothered. That doesn't mean they'd vote against Trump, it could be a 50/50 split, but they don't care enough to even participate in the system. So basically the movement we are seeing is driven by only 1/3 of the country, and only 20% of that group are the difference makers in this recent election. That's not a major shift in political winds.The problem, imho, is about combating disinformation and not having a good way to push back on it. Combine that with infighting over wedge issues being promoted by foreigners (Gaza, in the case of this recent election) and it's an uphill battle.I'm really not sure how or where we need to shift on specific issues, the failure is more one of communication. We need a better more consistent ground game, we need better offline social networks. We need to find a way to be visible without being a parody of ourselves that they see when presented through online bros and Fox. We need to be reaching people year round, not just when it's time for the next election.. Democrats are too reliant on smoke and mirrors rather than feet on the ground. To drive home that last point, Trump had at least SIX public rallies within an hour's drive from me, Harris was here once and it was a private event and I don't think she left the airport. I realize that this isn't a place worth her investing time and energy but if you are just going to touch and go then why show up at all? It was more a publicity stunt than an actual visit.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

These Sodium levels are off the chart! Link some election Schadenfreude you found."},{"text":"No.So for example I have four immediate coworkers, three I know voted Trump and a fourth who I believe voted but I'm not entirely sure. Let's use them as a small case study... blue collar and in the trades, rural, Trump's target audience.Co-worker 1: the genuine MAGA among them, absolutely pro-Trump. He's the one with the red hat. Also a big Elon Musk fan, a big FuckTony fan. He spends the entire day watching YouTube videos, that's his source of news and information. He's surprisingly somewhat of a critical thinker, at least when something opposite of his opinion is stated but you spend an entire day watching the same stuff it sticks. He's a bit misogynistic, a bit xenobphobic, less racist but there's hints of it. At times it's muted and at time it's a major focus... it's easy to see why Trump appeals to him, specifically. But he also cares a lot about civil liberties so there's a chance of getting through to him on that topic if I can just get him to see what happens under Trump (for example, random ICE road blocks and citizenship checks on GreyHound buses last time). The hard part is getting through to him, I'd actually have more luck via a YouTube video than talking to him. He's strongly non-religious but not anti-religious. He doesn't do any of the weird Trump cult worship stuff (portraits of Trump, signs in the yard year round, etc.), but he thinks Trump successful and smart.Co-worker 2: I wouldn't call him MAGA, but he's a conspiracy theorist. He's a bit of a flat earther, also spends entirely too much time on YouTube and can't tell an obvious parody from real. Big Joe Rogan fan. Otherwise a smart guy, at least when it comes to job related skill but a bit gullible. He has past drug addiction problems so that may play a role. He definitely voted Trump. I wouldn't call him a Trump fan though, in fact when the debate with Biden happened his take away was that it was a trainwreck on both sides.With the first two, the commonality is too much YouTube, getting their information from unreliable sources and propaganda while thinking everything else is the actual propaganda. I believe both of them vote when Trump is on the ballot and probably can't be bothered when Trump isn't on the ballot. I wouldn't really call either of them conservatives in the traditional sense (i.e. Reagan) but they both fit the mold of what the GOP is turning into.Co-worker 3: Kind of a good old boy, but not political and doesn't want to discuss politics. He votes Republican because he hunts, likes guns, not particularly religious but goes to church on major holy days. He's very reasonable but the problem is he doesn't want to discuss the issues so there's no inroad there. He's a reliable voter that sees voting as a duty but he's just a given R vote every time.. he voted for Trump but that's not an endorsement of Trump. If the GOP continues to get worse, maybe he'll wake up to what's happening.Co-worker 4: Just a sort of typical rural guy with decades in the trades but more cynical than political. He's the type to hear something on social media, even if complete BS, and just accept it as accurate. He often says things to me that I have to correct. But he's not passionate about it or anything. I'm not sure if he voted, I know co-worker 1 was really pushing him to vote. But in fairness, co-worker 1 was not necessarily pushing for him to vote for Trump even if that was strongly implied. So, this one is unlikely to vote at all and is just completely disinterested... if he voted for Trump, it's simply because that's what most of his peers did.So out of the five of us.. you have one reliable R voter, myself (a more or less reliable D voter although there are exceptions), and three voters unlikely to show up if Trump is not on the ballot. Looking at just the five of us it's easy to see why Trump won and why it's also not a reflection of the country's overall mood. What they have in common is low information in terms of the quality of \\"news\\" and understanding of government. They trust no 1 because he's passionate on the topic, passion is mistaken for knowlegable, but they don't really follow politics or have only done so recently. Where they find agreement is on gun control and they are all annoyed by things like gender pronouns being forced.. I can't even say they are anti-woke because one didn't give up his BudLight and the rest of them roll their eyes with me when there's another anti \\"woke\\" backlash.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

It doesn't help that the republicans in the house and senate stonewalled everything that would have helped the country/people because it's \\"Liberal\\" or \\"Socialist\\" or \\"Communist\\" because it's the democrats bringing the legislation up.

Democrats were dealt a bad hand, but they also played it abysmally. Voter turnout stayed consistent for Trump this election, the same cannot be said for Democrats. The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect on.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. As I'll probably say again, the onus was on Democrats to help Americans make those politically informed decisions.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, Biden was supposed to be a transitional candidate. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and oversaw an economic recovery. Republicans exploited these situations for political gain.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats played their hand terribly.While they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whomever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized above all else and drove home the message that Trump was, in fact, *not* better for the economy, and his economic policies for his next term are even more disastrous.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.The national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions to that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively.He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations. Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades*!*All of these things contributedto inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a tragedy too! He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.Oh, and on immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears and appealing to grievances while proposing extreme, non viable, disingenuous \\"solutions\\" instead of more practical, economically considerate, humane ones.Most Americans don't know this stuff! And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise. And if Harris was ever going to have a shot, despite rolling in at the last minute, her campaign was going to have to articulate these points, emphasize them over and over again, so that the low propensity voters just tuning in might get the picture.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":"Trump wins Nevada, capturing a state he lost in both 2016 and 2020"},{"text":"What was the other?","title":"Illinois governor on Trump win: You come for my people, you come through me"},{"text":"Yep. \\"Margie sanger?

They are mad that he and his wife dressed up to celebrate May the Fourth with all the nerds because he is not so larger than life that he can't have some goofy fun with the nerds. They hate him because he got the reproductive Healthcare act done in 2019 which enshrined a woman's right not just to abortion, but over her body as a whole, including birth control because he actually DOES care about women's rights. And hey, while he was at it, he legalized medical and recreational cannabis because he is in touch with reality and does understand the racially biased history of the drug war in America and started pardoning low level cannabis convictions that prevented over 11,000 people from fully reintegrating back into society for a crime that he took off the books. That was also because he is more interested in what independent science has to say when it is contradicting corporate funded scientists. And you know what?

A 20% tariff on all imports, especially at a time when we have really low unemployment, will send prices skyrocketing. Even if we assume it's gradually ramped, and we offer tax incentives, there's simply not enough labor to staff everything. Businesses will compete, which will drive wages higher, which in turn offers many benefits, but will likely fuel inflation.Add in mass deportations, and suddenly the available labor could start shrinking even more rapidly. A lot of the jobs undocumented immigrants are taking are jobs Americans really don't want to work. Of course, pay people enough and they'll do the work, but rising wages again will contribute to inflation.In this case, sorting out the immigration mess and offering temp visas for documented workers and employers who go through a proper process, could provide the needed labor and help tamp inflation with immigrant workers largely taking jobs Americans don't want to work. Targeted tariffs, especially against bad faith actors, which arguably China is, can be used to counter imbalances created by intentional market distortions caused by bad faith actors. My guess is that Trump is going to go this route.It'd also be interesting to explore near-shoring. So long as President Xi is in charge of China, their lone wolf attitude could prove detrimental to the United States and many other countries. While the focus is on creating jobs in the United States, if we could create lots of jobs in Latin America with near shoring and bringing crucial supply chains closer to home, in countries with governments more friendly, or at least more likely to enjoy mutual benefits and prosperity. More jobs in Latin America would ease pressures driving migrants to migrate illegally.","title":"Trump wins Nevada, capturing a state he lost in both 2016 and 2020"},{"text":"Nice thanks","title":"Election Deniers Went Suddenly Quiet When Trump Won"},{"text":"I think he knows better than anyone you shouldnt trust Harris.","title":"Do you think Biden voted for Trump?"},{"text":"Yes.","title":"Surge in Americans Seeking Visas to Move Abroad Following Trump Win"},{"text":"See, I was always under the impression that fascism was the merging of corporation and state.

Democrats were dealt a bad hand, but they also played it abysmally. Voter turnout stayed consistent for Trump this election, the same cannot be said for Democrats. The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect upon.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. As I'll probably say again, the onus was on Democrats to help Americans make those politically informed decisions.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, Biden was supposed to be a transitional candidate. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and oversaw an economic recovery. Republicans exploited these situations for political gain.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats played their hand terribly.While they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whomever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized above all else and drove home the message that Trump was, in fact, *not* better for the economy, and his economic policies for his next term are even more disastrous.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.The national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions to that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively.He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations. Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades*!*All of these things contributedto inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a tragedy too! He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.Oh, and on immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears and appealing to grievances while proposing extreme, non viable, disingenuous \\"solutions\\" instead of more practical, economically considerate, humane ones.Most Americans don't know this stuff! And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise. And if Harris was ever going to have a shot, despite rolling in at the last minute, her campaign was going to have to articulate these points, emphasize them over and over again, so that the low propensity voters just tuning in might get the picture.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":"Trumps Unprecedented and Powerful Mandate Is a Lie"},{"text":"Also: covfefe","title":"Trump wins Nevada, capturing a state he lost in both 2016 and 2020"},{"text":"Maybe someone should check this guys computer...","title":"Trump ally  who could be AG  warns NYs Letitia James to back off president-elect: We will put your fat aC in prison?"},{"text":"I didnt.

I also wish he'd talked a bit about the Virginia democrats who seem to have done very well this cycle, and  tried to highlight some examples of why they appear to have broken the trend.One of the difficulties in explaining the positive impact the Democrats did have on the economy is being able to \\"Disaggregate\\" your commentary. Some parts of America are objectively worse off under the Democrat administration! And some parts are better off, including what I would call the aggregates as a whole.Ideally, Kamala's campaign would have had the time + space to be able to make this point in a nuanced way. Some were better off, and some were not. That isn't good enough, but Kamala had built the *foundation* for ensuring everyone would benefit under her administration - and here were some clear, specific policies on how she would do that.That would have let her more clearly differentiate herself from Biden. Ideally of course a longer democratic campaign and primary (Biden not stepping down earlier + having a concrete succession plan was the biggest 'Democratic' Mistake of this overall for me) would have given the Democrats even more room to move on this by running a primary and letting them run against Biden's record.However, all of the above is about nuance, it's about having an adult conversation where the Democrats sit down with the median voter - they have a give and take. They admit wrongdoings, and in doing so (law of repocriation) they also *push back* on some of the messaging about how America's become a lot worse. I think that conversation is doable - I think the Democrats could and should have had it. It's the equivalent of the fireside chat - authenticity still counts for something. And in some ways, Kamala was handicapped in terms of being authentic because she wasn't able to differentiate herself from Biden.However, think one has to acknowledge the utter domination of the alternative media space makes this so much harder of a tightrope to walk. When the other side's media firehose is a 24/7 screaming ocean of piss that allows no compromise or nuance, you're swimming uphill. Again, I think the Democrats still win this election if they play their cards right, and I think all of Josh's points in this article are valid. A lot of them echo frustrations I've made in my post history, especially the idea of the Democrat [everything bagel]( https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/democrats-liberalism.html) and tariffs. However, the media environment makes a big-tent Democratic wipeout *incredibly* difficult.We do need to keep the role of the media war in mind. The Trumpian alternative media did an exceptionally effective job of narrowing the language / scope of what the Democrats could talk about, and the nuance with which they could do it. This is an area the Democrats badly need to improve in.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"And then JD Vance takes over.

When you view them as deplorables. When you treat them as the dim stooges of demagoguery, the playthings of powerful men. When you brand them low information and chortle in your coffee houses about how Donald Trump is preying on their hazy understanding of political affairs. What happens is that they dont vote for you.The past 24 hours in the United States have been nothing short of extraordinary. This is the revenge of the deplorables, to borrow the slur Hillary Clinton used in 2016, the first time Trump rose to power. Half of Trumps supporters belong to a basket of deplorables, she infamously said. Theyre racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, she sniffed. Voters rose up against those elitist defamations in 2016, and they rose up against them again yesterday.That Clintonite disdain for the lower orders has infused so much of the discussion of Trump voters these past eight years. You see it in the haughty media sending its reporters to mingle among Americas low information voters. You see it in the claims that Trump is tapping into the masses deep-seated fear of racial otherness. You see it in the idea that he is preying on low-information voters. Shorter version: hes exploiting you cretins.You glimpsed it in those smug celebrity endorsements of Kamala Harris, which always came with the subtext that no decent person in full command of his mental and moral faculties could ever vote for a monster like Trump. You saw it among the complacent centrist dads of the new podcast empire who were certain Kamala would win because they cannot conceive of the existence of human beings who think differently to them.And you saw in the commentariats enormous folly of calling Trump a fascist. Not only was that bandying around of the f-word ahistorical and juvenile, a temper tantrum disguised as analysis. It was also a sly indictment of the millions of good Americans who were planning to vote for Trump. It implied that they were either so dumb or so wicked that they were willing to usher Hitler 2.0 into the White House just to own the libs.Kamala herself played the fascist card, breezily unaware of what a grotesque slight it is to the voters of the working class to depict them as the brainless or heartless facilitators of a new Nazism. Deplorables, easy prey, fodder for a fascist C they really thought such Ivy League gloating over the low information little people would be a vote winner? It seems they did.Alas, it was not. Of course it wasnt. The Kamala camps seeming desire to consolidate a new bloc of correct-thinking graduates, ethnic-minority voters and those parts of the working class still willing to take a punt on the lame Dems appears to have fallen flat.She may have won over the credentialled elites C more than 60 per cent of voters with an advanced degree went for Kamala, as did more than 50 per cent of those with a bachelors degree. But she lost huge numbers of Latinos and even some of the female voters who went for Joe Biden last time. And, of course, the non-university educated, which is to say the working class. Just 37 per cent of those who never attended college voted for Kamala, while 62 per cent went for Trump.This is a rebellion of the subaltern, a ballot-box insurrection against the turbo-smug coastal elites and their patrician ways. Ignore the mournful tones of every BBC reporter today. Never mind the noisy weeping of centrists on social media. Be sceptical of the million thinkpieces coming very soon that will write off this vote as white man rage, or the reactionary yelp of the unenlightened, or mass misogynist fear of the prospect of the first female president.No, this is people saying: We matter. Our voices matter. Our communities matter. Our families matter. We are not deplorables, we are not idiots, we are not rednecks. We are citizens and we matter. The only question now is whether the complacent establishment will double down on its mockery of working people and damn them for falling for demagogic trickery all over again, or listen to them for a change. I hope its the latter. But something tells me it wont be.","title":"Donald Trump and the revenge of the deplorables"},{"text":"Top comment is eye opening.","title":"\\"For people who voted Biden in 2020, but Trump in 2024, why did you switch?\\" --- Interesting thread."},{"text":"Moved to the east coast from CA and 3 years later I still miss it.","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"Me, a gay man, having sworn off women for years: ??","title":"Trump win spurs interest in 4B, fringe South Korean movement to swear off men"},{"text":"I think his point is that Trump milked the wall for four years while accomplishing basically nothing.I think it's foolish to count on it, but there's plenty of precedent for Trump just stirring shit and never doing anything concrete to deport people in the volume he claims.\\n \\nIn any case, I have no doubt we'll see more heinous treatment of migrants detained crossing the border.

Instead her campaign focused on moral superiority and issues that the majority of the American population either care very little about, or have outright disdain about even hearing about because they either dont like gays, BIPOC folks, etc. or theyre just sick to death of hearing about BLM, etc. It doesnt affect them directly aside from stressing them out to be bombarded with those issues all the time. That is unfortunately the vast majority of votersthey only care about issues that directly affect them. Aside from abortion, which is still a hugely divisive issue in the US, as demonstrated by how many states have voted on that issue since Roe was overturned.

One of the questions really stuck out like a sore thumb because it was one of the few that was largely fact-based, and the difference in response showed that there are two completely different worlds in America.  The question was \\"How do you believe the economy is doing currently?\\".  Over 90% of people who voted for Harris responded that they believed the economy is doing good or excellent, while over 90% of the people who voted for Trump responded that they believed the economy was doing poorly or terrible.  Note, this is *not* \\"do you think Harris is better for the economy, or Trump\\", it was simply \\"How do you believe the economy is currently doing\\", and by any metric, it is currently doing exceptionally well.  Unemployment is nearing record lows, inflation is at historic averages, GDP growth is at historic averages, the stock market is at or near all-time highs.  Added all up, it's objectively provable that the economy currently is doing at least \\"good\\", yet somehow 90% of Republicans believe it is doing at least \\"poorly\\".  Even if you say \\"well for some of them, maybe they've had a poor year, maybe they just lost their job and they're having a hard time finding work\\", and sure that could be true, but that can't account for 90% of them.  A good chunk of them must have gotten a raise sometime recently.  If they're business owners, they know that both revenues and profits have been up over the past year, while inflation has returned to normal.  How is it possible that that many people have an incorrect view of the economy, unless they legitimately do not have a fucking clue about the state of the economy, either through general lack of knowledge, or through being lied to by their information sources?","title":"Victims of Disinformation Tended to Go with Trump"},{"text":"POTUS Newsome and VP Ferguson in 4 years. \\nPin it.","title":"Washington state prepares to push back against Trump"},{"text":"There needs to be a separation of the president from interfering with federal monetary policies, Trump tried it in his first term and couldnt intimidate PowellStand Strong Jerome Powell","title":"Powell Says He Wont Step Down as Fed Chair If Asked by Trump"},{"text":"Heres why: companies have to pay Trump to pass policies, and they pass that fee onto consumers.

Here's some other takeaways:The temporary work visa program through which Trump's companies have sought the greatest numbers of workers, H-2B, brings in mostly workers from Mexico. Mexicans made up more than 80 percent of the 104,993 admissions to the United States on H-2B visas in 2013. The Trump companies have sought at least 850 H-2B visa workers.The H-2B program, which receives little government oversight, is used by companies in sectors ranging from hospitality to forestry to hire foreign workers for temporary jobs. Companies must prove that the jobs are seasonal - and that they tried and failed to hire Americans.U.S. government watchdogs have criticized the H-2B and H-2A programs over the years for failing to protect foreign and American workers alike.In 2003, the Labor Department Inspector General said: Abuses of these programs may result in economic harm to American workers and businesses, exploitation of foreign workers, and security risks associated with aliens who are admitted to this country by fraudulent means.This year, the Government Accountability Office published a report saying that workers in the country on H-2A and H-2B visas have experienced abuse, including being charged illegal recruiting fees, substandard housing and low pay.The Mar-a-Lago, a luxury resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has sought the most foreign workers of the nine Trump businesses: 787 workers since 2006, according to the data.If the flock were not religiously devoted to the Republican Party, Trump's abuse of the immigration system should have been politically disqualfying in the fucking Primary for 2016, but as we've found out since, *nothing* is disqualifying for The GOP candidate. **Nothing.**My first thought when I read this post, before reading the article, was whether there may be some trafficking connection, given Trump's historical years-long friendships with multiple serial sex traffickers/abusers.Two of his companies, Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC, have sought visas for nearly 250 foreign fashion models, the records show.Draw your own conclusions.","title":"Trump says his mass deportation plan has no price tag as he prepares to boot millions from the country"},{"text":"Actually.

In fact, that's pretty sad. I was a lifelong Democrat until Trump ran, then I flipped parties. I'm now a very proud (heterosexual female) republican. There is a saying going around, something to the effect of, \\"I didn't leave the left, the left left me\\". And that's resonates with me and my decision to leave. However, my entire family are Democrats, so of course, I'm a target of their rhetoric and sarcastic remarks. Nothing I can't handle, but it really validates for me why I left the democratic party. It was really getting hateful and divisive. With that said, I'm just happy you're with us and, you're welcome here.  My *religious* beliefs don't exactly line up with the typical republican party (I'm not Christian - nor religious). I'm spiritual. I'm an astrologer, into numerology, and pretty much check off all the boxes that *wouldn't* fit with being a republican. But, here I am! And, I'm happy to be amongst those whose ideas fall in line with mine - such as the economy, immigration, running our country more as a business than a charity, etc., etc. I honestly think there's a shift taking place in the republican party. I think we're more accepting of people as they are as long as their core beliefs for our country, and for the future of it, fall in line. You've found your tribe.

To add, while there are multiple reasons, this is perhaps the biggest one. When it's easier to vote - more people vote. There's a reason why there has been a concerted effort to make voting more difficult in certain areas. In 2020 we got a glimpse of where voters actually stand. You have to consider many factors when it comes to voter turnout. For instance, if you are working a job paycheck to paycheck, you're more likely not going to be able to vote. Add to that the long lines to cast your ballot in certain communities, and you have the recipe for low voter turnout. After all, if you're working a couple low wage jobs just to get by and have a family to take of, voting isn't your first priority, your family is the immediate concern. Yes, one could argue about the importance of casting your vote and how it will affect your families future, but when you have only so many hours in the day, those immediate responsibilities are your priority. Millions of people are forced to make tough decisions on election day between making sure their kids get dinner, did their homework, have food for breakfast and (in some cases) lunch the next day, and then knowing they have to do it all again the next day. So while they would really like to participate, they simply are unable to in many cases. There are people who struggle with this problem every election, and it's a damn shame. Yeah, some companies allow their employees an opportunity to go vote, but there aren't many. The vast majority who aren't given this opportunity are low-wage employees who provide \\"essential services\\", yet are the same people who are considered unessential when it comes to them having a voice.

Meanwhile on the journalism end they have one person staffed to cover the topic and it's cherrypicked to max sensationalism. The letter was written right after particularly egregious cherrypicked data were covered.I also think this piece misses the mark on why Harris lost the election, which was 1) a poor economic environment by the lower class, consistent with what was happening abroad that led to incumbent parties losing, 2) an inability to formulate a strong economic and domestic structural positions because the administration she was attached to was unpopular, and 3) a lot of wealthy business people got angry at some of the details in Biden's handling of businesses, including a vastly unpopular FTC chair, which led to considerable effort by the wealthy people in the country to see that administration discontinued. Maybe, there's an argument to be made that the complete alienation of men in the campaigning of Harris also led to the loss.So, while I agree that liberals in general go on about so many problems, I'm not sure anything mentioned in this piece has any impact on changing an election.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"You think Josh could be a president or VP candidate one day","title":"Who will replace Mitch McConnell as Senate GOP leader?

As a Gen Xer, its concerning to see how disconnected many Gen Zers are from the political realities that will shape their future. Growing up in the digital age, theyve been influenced by viral content and memes, but this often overshadows the deeper understanding of issues like tariffs, economics, and government institutions.For instance, when politicians talk about 50% or 100% tariffs, many young people mistakenly see it as a discount. But in reality, tariffs raise prices for consumers, hurt working-class families, and dont necessarily bring back jobs as promised. They also fail to understand the long-term impacts of their votesparticularly when it comes to issues like the Supreme Court, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ protections, climate and government programs.Many in Gen Z also lack basic civics knowledge. Ask them about the three branches of government, and they might struggle to answer. Without this foundational knowledge, how can they understand the stakes of their votes?Its easy to vote based on who seems relatable or cool, but policies matter more than personalities. Elections have real-world consequences, and if Gen Z isnt careful, they may find their rights and freedoms slipping away due to uninformed choices. Its time to move beyond memes and social media culture and take a hard look at how their vote can shape the future.IMO I think Gen Z they saw Trump get shot as some warrior victim. And the victim mentality is strong in this generation. He saw him be goofy  and that translated as relatable vs ineptness. And as it is trending many did not know Biden was no longer a candidate. What they yet get is SCOTUS and how that works. That if they rely on any lunch program, have a friend here illegally, want to marry a same sex person, become pregnant, is LGBTQIA+ they voted for the wrong partyAnd when they need government benefits food, housing, educational grants, medication. They will realize they screwed the pooch.","title":"Yes, Trump improved with young men.

She was a tool to take our eyes off of Biden."},{"text":"That's exactly how people tried to rationalize that Hitler wouldn't be so bad when he reached this stage.His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei?em und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaosand it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \\"the greatest actor in Europe,\\" and wrote to a friend, \\"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childishhe would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \\"prodigious amounts of cake\\" and \\"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\\"He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \\"half-mad rascal\\" or a \\"man with a beery vocal organ.\\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.","title":"Your body, my choice: Women report rise in online misogyny following Donald Trumps victory"},{"text":"The aura on this man","title":"January 20th Isnt Even Here Yet ??

Trump is constantly talking about how the dems are letting MS 13 and other violent gangs into the country and how they are terrorizing Long Island residents (which the second part of that is partially true). They play videos over and over of mobs of thieves running into high end stores and robbing them in California. They went nuts with the story about the Venezuelan gang that supposedly held up an entire apartment building in Colorado. It doesnt help that crime in NY and Cali has increased. We cant ignore these facts. Although Im not sure why. My mom went to NY last weekend and said all the stores had every single item locked behind glass. As far as socialism, Cubans dont like that Obama worked with Cubas government and got rid of the wet foot dry foot law, and opened up tourism to Cuba. The moment Obama repealed wet foot-dry foot, we lost the Cuban vote forever. And anything to them that even reminds them of socialism, they are phobic to. Trump shut down tourism to Cuba during his reign to show them that he wont work with their government and Cubans ate it up. They hate when the US shows any willingness to work with Cubas regime.Ironic being that Trump is Russias puppet and Russia and Cuba are communist bffs.Venezuelas trauma is even more recent as they were a rich and prosperous democratic country not that long ago until socialism took over. Any whispers of socialism will make them run. All Trump and his people have to do is say the dems have a socialist agenda, and talk about us raising taxes and what not to convince them. Which theyve been saying since 2016.So what I am saying is that democrats need to start listening to what the other side wants judgements aside.

With some basic sociopolitical understandings, anyone with half a brain will know that gas prices arent indicative of government performance. Once we start to wise up, they double down by saying we got it all wrong. This is how fake news took over. This is why trump voters are okay with voting for a twice impeached convicted felon, because they genuinely believe in their hearts and minds that he wasnt actually impeached and that the conviction is phony. This is how trump can get away with all the lies, because these people just say thats not what he meant whenever he says or does something they dont understand.  They are so used to being talked down at, that they default to whatever mental gymnastics is needed to come to some sort of acceptance of the situation. I hate to say it but democrats need to cash in on this, but in good faith. We are like dogs in this way.
