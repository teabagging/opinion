And of course, the media and establishment are acting like Trump is already president as they continue to desperately divert from the fact that we have had and *still have a vegetable in office.* The lack of discussion and outrage around the matter is batshit insane.This is of course four whole years after being called a sexist, racist piece of shit for saying that people should be debating Harris vs. Trump as opposed to Trump vs. Biden because Biden was clearly on a significant decline and probably wouldnt be fit to serve out his term.Twilight Zone indeed.","title":"Due to Bidens age and mental decline, he was unfit to run for president.

People, put their faith in returning to what they thought was a more traditional and stable political leadership when about half the country suggested they have had enough of Pres. Trump after the first go around.However, that was not the case. They failed to deliver on a lot of fronts.Fringe issues and ideas (something Democrats especially on the progressive side of the left are known for) were taking a main focus. The current administration was not communicating well with the public and operating very quietly, especially post a major pandemic. We were being told that everything was fine and presented data to back up those claims. Especially on the topics of illegal immigration, our countrys economic state and public safety. Yet every claim has now been questioned for accuracy and then undone due to inaccuracies to what most Americans already knew was wrong and incomplete data. All the while, it was being presented by our own government as reliable and concise. Professional major media outlets continued to double down on the administrations messaging using articulate arguments to tell the educated well read public that none of these concerns were factual but merely psychological tactics used by Republicans. Including, the controversy of Pres. Bidens mental acuity due to age.Also, our exit from Afghanistan was a total embarrassment to our servicemen/women (and allied support) and to the innocent people of Afghanistan, who cooperated with their lives by aiding the US in our operations and helping them nation build. It all fell apart in a matter of a year after nearly two decades.And there are two active wars that the US has to navigate that has a profound effect on our own interests and allies security. Not to mention, a tech race with China and instability brewing in the Middle East (again).So yeah, it makes sense why Trump won. Im a Gov. DeSantis fan. Ill be honest though. Trump speaks a lot of rhetoric and has personal controversies. But keeping in mind, hes not a formally trained politician still and he doesnt speak eloquent on political matters, he did identify correctly a lot of issues the country is facing. Whether he can amend those matters we will see. I am personally interested in seeing what DOGE is truly capable of and of Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Homan.But yes. He was the better choice, based on our current scenario and available candidates. I wouldve been more concerned that continued leadership then under a Harris presidency would be a weak showing US and would allow our enemies or anyone looking to start a fight to test us and our allies further.","title":"Why did you vote Trump?"},{"text":"Rich considering Biden pardoned his son making you are all hypocrites.","title":"Trump Pardoning Jan. 6 Insurrectionists Would Endorse Attacks on Democracy"},{"text":"he prepared the path, blackmailing judges and prosecutors","title":"Trump to be sentenced for his crimes before inauguration"},{"text":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/04/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-limits-trump-intl/index.htmlIs this what they wanted?","title":"After reading many headlines about people already regretting their vote for Trump..."},{"text":"Fuck everyone who supported this con man.

Outside, in the streets, in the general community, everyone is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, Its not so bad or Youre seeing things or Youre an alarmist. \\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you cant prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you dont know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent toto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait. \\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. Thats the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shockedif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in 43 had come immediately after the German Firm stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in 33. But of course this isnt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D. \\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.","title":"Nancy Maces Capitol Hill Bathroom Ban Missing from House Rules Package - Mike Johnsons assurances from November that the controversial ban would be included appear to have fallen through."},{"text":"All campaign long, these people talked about if they didn't win our blood would be in the streets.

Its really sad to see this - I guess its true in a way, that if you dont heed the lessons of history, you are bound to repeat its mistakes. and unfortunately the education system (more in the US, but also in Europe) isnt moving in the right direction to remedy this.

Every religious institution is tainted by malevolence, I agree, but Id say thats because its always composed of people who are tainted with a sinful nature. A nature that chooses evil rather than good. A nature that chooses to love self over others.

Discworld quote sums it up best. Take the entire universe, run it through a fine seive, and you will not find an ounce of justice, a grain of liberty.  \\n  \\n These are man wrought ideas. If the creator wanted a pain free universe, we would have it. We would draw power from the stars like plants do. If the creator wanted no slavery, there would be no slavery. This is a predator and prey universe, because both have lessons to teach and lessons to learn.In his mighty benevolence he gave us the most important gift of all, free will. That is why violating it is the most heinous thing you can do in all of existence. Kill if you want, murder if you want, rape if you want. I have murdered and raped as many people as i have wanted in this life. For me, that number is 0. I genuinely think source/god is okay with it. But, the real question is, are you okay with yourself after doing such committed acts? Once you leave your mortal shell, would you not feel horror at your actions?I do not condone it, personally. But, we have the free will to make that choice. We all came from one divine source, we will all return there eventually, and in the mean time, we are all fragments of god, experiencing itself. What you do to others you are doing to yourself. When you call out for help, you are calling out to your inner divinity. To me, the hardest part in my journey was not forgiving humanity the sins they committed against me, but the ones i committed against myself. The more you weigh yourself down, the harder it is to acknowledge your divinity, and since perception creates reality, you start to live in a hell of your own making.There is no objective truth beyond all are loved. Even the ones tainted beyond belief. i genuinely think no religion is right. I think every religious institution on earth has been compromised by malevolent forces, whether man and his greed or spirits and their need. You need to develop your own relation with the divine within you, the original source, imo. There are teachers and guides everywhere, for those who want to follow others. Im not saying Christianity is wrong in its precepts. But im not convinced its right.I would love to learn in person from jesus, but i would never worship him.

On one such occasion, in the spring of 2021, a national security official explained to another aide why a meeting needed to be rescheduled. He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so were going to address this tomorrow, the former aide recalled the official saying.Yes, Musk and Zuckerberg were proponents of the Tiktok ban. Facebook has been attempting to [stitch Tiktok up for years with lobbying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory/) rather than wider regulations across all social media platforms. The Biden administration specifically went after it claiming election interference despite the [FBI saying they had no evidence of such](https://theintercept.com/2024/03/16/tiktok-china-security-threat/). The reality is that videos of a compromised Biden were widely circulated on the platform and his administration was constantly attacking them for \\"being out of context\\" while they were coverning up his cognitive decline.The bill, which must still pass the Senate, would force TikToks China-based parent company ByteDance to sell the app within 165 days, or face a ban in the U.S. Several Democratic lawmakers, one Biden campaign official, and one intelligence expert tell *Rolling Stone* the election meddling and misinformation arguments presented to justify the legislation were not strong enough.?Speaking with *Rolling Stone* after voting no on the bill Wednesday, Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) says, The threats that we were told about were things that could be done on any platform  it was not actually about the ownership model of the platform. I think the existing national security threats regarding TikTok will not be solved by and do not warrant this very broad cudgel of a bill.Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) also voted no on the bill. He says that concerns about the app potentially being used to influence elections are not unique to TikTok, explaining: We saw similar issues with other social media in the last presidential campaign. This is something we need to address for all social media. I think targeting TikTok specifically with this ban is not good policy.More than a third of the population of the US uses Tiktok, with an *average* use time of almost an hour a day.

The elephant in the room, this brutal truth, remains unspoken. The reality is clear there are different levels of justice in this country, depending entirely on who you are, what you represent. Racial lines, economic class, gender, these all form the arbitrary boundaries of privilege and punishment. The same rules do not apply to all.For those who have been marginalized, whether by the color of their skin, their gender, or their socioeconomic status, the truth is undeniable. Its a truth that society pretends to be blind to, but for anyone who has lived it, its a burning conviction within. And yet, these so-called think tanks, these academic groups, these well-meaning voices just speak in circles. They shout about the reprehensibility of the situation, about the moral failings of this system, but they never act. Awareness is raised, but the rot persists. No agency, no power, no revolution of thought, no action to remedy the disease that eats away at the very soul of what this country claims to represent.The problem isn't a lack of intelligence or morality in the people who recognize the injustice. It is the lack of will to dismantle the machinery that perpetuates it. The ruling class, the powers that be, continue to reign, indifferent to the cries of those beneath them. They have built their empires on the backs of the oppressed, and no matter how much we speak, no matter how many facts we lay bare, nothing changes. They control the narrative, they hold the power, and they continue to disregard the real American ideal: equality for all.And while this country prides itself on its institutions, its laws, its democracy, there is no true democracy when the system is rigged, when the rights of some are sacrificed at the altar of profit, of power. Its a fa?ade. A broken, feeble system propped up by those with the means to ignore, or worse, to profit from the suffering of others.This is not just a critique it is a clarion call. Until we tear down this farce and replace it with something just, something truly fair, we are simply spinning our wheels, stuck in a system that does not care for justice. It is a shame, a grotesque failure that has been allowed to fester far too long. No one cares how moral or intelligent you are if your words are not met with action. And unless those with the power to change this begin to act not just speak then this injustice will continue to suffocate us all.","title":"Judge orders Trump sentenced on Jan. 10, signals no punishment for conviction"},{"text":"Elon reminds me of a blob fish","title":"UK Right Warns Trump Allies That Musks Posts Have Gone Too Far"},{"text":"Nada.

Jesus said there is coming a day when hes going to return, separating his chosen, the believers apart. The dead will be resurrected and the universe will be reconstructed, sin and death fully destroyed. The believers remain in the new heaven and earth (universe) and the unbelievers cast into judgement in what seems to be a parallel dimension we call hell.

I'm disappointed in where my life is, I feel insecure about my level of intelligence and lack of education, and too many people are doing better than I am.  Yet, I have no interest in learning anything new or improving myself. \\n The only way to make up for this is if I can look down on other people and feel superior to them.  I'm also afraid of change and things I don't understand.  I need people to all be just like I am and to think the way that I do.  I don't like 'others.'  They're weird and scary.So, I can't vote for someone that threatens any of that.  I need someone who makes it okay to stay racist, homophobic, and misogynistic.  I can only feel worth anything if other people have fewer rights than I do so that they feel like less and I can be superior to them.  I like being able to be myself without people telling me that I'm rude, hateful, and outdated.  I'm afraid if I let go of what little power I think I have, then the world will pass me by and I truly will be the lowest of the low.Trump makes it all okay that I feel that way and he will clearly protect my interests while keeping the 'others' in their place.

Fair.I could point out that it would be a little on the nose for a Russian troll to literally name an account \\"ImmaRussian\\", but because we apparently live in a time when on-the-nose is in vogue, which makes that a fair question, I'll also direct you to my 2013 cake day, and tell you a story about how I ended up taking a couple Russian classes in college.I took the AP German test in high school, and tested out of needing to take a foreign language in college. Those \\"AP Credits\\" just became part of my transcript at the college I was attending. Then I transferred colleges, and my new college left it ambiguous exactly how far they considered me to be. So I had no idea how high they considered my last course level to be, but whatever it was, it was apparently good enough that they said I didn't have to take any more to graduate.Then my whole state switched from quarters to semesters... And like... I got to watch as they took all my previous credits and tried to sort them into a completely new course organization scheme, and like; they clearly had zero clue what to do with all the German credits, because they didn't even try to assign those to specific classes, they were just like \\"Based on your previous transcript, we calculate that you have like... A stupid amount of German credits.\\"\\"Cool. Can I like... Get those counted as specific classes?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"... Um... Great. Well I still have enough language credit to graduate, right?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"... So let me get this straight, you will attest that I've successfully completed like a hundred credit hours of German instruction, but you will *not* attest that I've completed the equivalent of your first two basic German classes, which would be 8 total credit hours?\\"\\"That is correct.\\"\\"... Ok, so if I want to take German, I can just take *one* sufficiently advanced course, pass it, and that'll count, right?\\"\\"No. And since your German credits no longer count towards specific classes, you'd actually have to start at German 1 again.\\"\\"... WELL OK THEN, FUCK YOU VERY MUCH TOO.\\"Then I was like... \\"I could take German 1 and 2 and easily pass, but I'd basically be paying tons of money just to get a rubber stamp again for something I already know. If I'm going to pay for a class, I want to at least learn something new from it.\\"So... I ended up taking a couple semesters of Russian.

The sole reason Trump is still a free man is because his wide ass was staining a chair in the oval office bright orange and he couldn't be prosecuted about any of it because of presidential immunity. The kicker: right wing news spun the narrative that Meuller was a left wing schill and the report exonerated Trump, which just shows how idiotic his base actually is. I read that report. There were myriad paper trails implicating Trump as both knowing exactly what was going on and ordering his staff to see the conspiracy through. The reason most of it failed to take off is because everyone involved was an idiot. The even bigger kicker: Trump attempted to rig the election a second time four years later and not only did right wing media make the lofty claim that Biden stole the election, but now we're here in 2025 and no one on the left side of the aisle is questioning whether the guy who attempted to rig two elections unsuccessfully may have successfully rigged the third.

Pointing out that all humans can be tribalistic and thus racist isn't (or at least shouldn't be) some great revelation. When people dunk on \\"White\\"/Western nations for being racist, they're not doing it just because they're mean to immigrants/non-\\"white\\" people. They do it because those nations have a long and storied history of extremely racist practices and legislation, to the point where it can be argued that the level of wealth and influence they enjoy as opposed to the rest of the world is largely because of their ruthless exploitation of the ancestors of their diverse population.Yes, other nations have some serious work to do when it comes to how they treat people from other cultural or ethnic backgrounds. However, it's arrogant AF for anyone from a \\"white\\"/Western background to be the main one pointing the finger. Western \\"diversity\\" was not always voluntary, the immigrants were not always welcomed, the ones deemed undesirable or inconvenient were culled, and systems were consistently put in place to ensure that true power stayed with the \\"white\\" majority. And now that the deeds have been done, those same nations tend to try and mask their pasts behind a veil of either championing their diversity (ex. the US) or hiding behind their homogeny (ex. the Netherlands, especially the Dutch).","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"Glad I dont live in one of those 1950s states","title":"[Serious] Why do you think so many Republican/Conservative politicians in the United States want to regulate online porn websites with state ID verification checks and age determining face scans?"},{"text":"They sweep in 2026.

Which would mean that needing legislation to enforce Section 3 would essentially be a ridiculous loophole that a simple majority Congress could simply choose not to enforce a provision that would otherwise require a two-thirds vote to remove. So in effect the simple majority can remove the disability by simply not enforcing Section 3?That makes no fucking sense.But wait... there's more. \\"Congress shall have the power\\" suggests that they *can* enforce **the provisions** by way of legislation but legislation by its very nature cannot override the Constitution so logic would suggest that Congress can enforce the 14th only within the bounds of what is already explicitly states as that is and always has been how the Constitution works. There is to my knowledge no example within the Constitution where it says something to the effect of \\"Here's the law but Congress can completely ignore or override it if they want to\\" no bitch that's literally the opposite of why the Constitution exists. If the rights and law laid out within it can be undone by a simple majority of Congress then what the hell is the point of it even being in there?Basically if you want to override the Constitution there is a process for doing that and the threshold is a lot fucking higher than a simple majority vote in Congress. Yet that's what SCOTUS is saying. That nope even though 14AS3 explicitly states that an insurrectionist is disqualified but that the disability may be removed with a two-thirds vote in Congress they can completely side-step that by just not enforcing it. Like what the literal fuck. Also, it isn't even the Congress that is supposed to execute and enforce laws, it's the executive. So putting it on Congress to legislate a provision within the Constitution when it already states the enforcement is just ridiculous.I get why they came to the conclusion they did but it doesn't actually make sense and I can guarantee if the shoe was on the other foot they'd have ruled in the complete opposite way.","title":"14th Now: Thousands expected to convene in nations capital to demand Congress bar Trump from office"},{"text":"Two semi-random events intersect and the orange shit gibbons upset.

Racism is much more than the presence of ignorance or prejudice. Racism is a systematic, institutionalized process by which one group extracts benefits for itself from another group *using* prejudice and ignorance. All predominantly white countries have that as part of their historical legacy. Most predominantly white countries also have at least some policies and social movements that oppose racism. That is a positive development that should be recognized, appreciated and supported, but there are zero cases among western countries where racism has been dismantled. If you doubt that, you merely need to look at the disparity in wealth between white and non-white people in western countries. In the United States, white households have accumulated almost [ten times as much wealth as black households](https://www.pewresearch.org/2023/12/04/wealth-gaps-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20typical%20White,%2427%2C100.). Much of that wealth is generational. Most generational wealth in the United States derives from home ownership since World War II. Home ownership was systematically manipulated to extract wealth from neighborhoods and transfer it to new white home homeowners. *That* is racism. It's not about people saying mean things, it's about how money and power are used to accumulate money and power along racial lines. Japan has prejudice and ignorance. It also has a historical legacy of colonialism. So, in some respects, several of the same problems exist. However, Japan is definitely not racist in the way that the United States is. There is no systematic program to extract wealth and power from me or from people like me and transfer it to ethnic Japanese people. There are plenty of points of friction, but insofar as I can tell, those points do not function like racism. Housing is a good example. It is often difficult to get approved for a lease if your Japanese is not excellent, and sometimes non-Japanese people have trouble anyway. This is an example of prejudice. It is illegal, though it is difficult to do anything about it as an individual. However, it is not an example of racism, because property owners who behave this way take significant damage to their own financial interests. It is a loss for everyone.Such systems used to exist. During the imperial period, Japan exploited the heck out of Korean and Chinese people. The consequences of that exploitation are still around, and could definitely use some more attention. However, the systems and institutions under which the exploitation happened were ripped out by the roots decades ago. This was possible because Japan's imperial period was quite brief in historical terms, and because its implementers and beneficiaries belonged to a very narrow portion of Japanese society. Those folks should definitely have been made to take responsibility in a more meaningful way, but we can thank the United States and it's myopic Cold War realpolitik for abandoning that project.The United States has scars from the past too, but it also has fully operational institutions of racism. Slavery was dug up and repotted to make Jim Crow, and then after the Civil Rights movement, Jim Crow was decorated in distracting financial tinsel. Racism was given a less ugly appearance, but it still performs exactly the same function : it extracts wealth from black Americans and transfers it to white Americans by stripping them of personal and political agency. Today, that looks like private prisons, prison labor, bogus fines and fees, traffic stops, over policing, red tape at insurance companies, credit reporting, proprietary algorithms behind in bank loans, service area maps for broadband, myriad local taxes, and a thousand other things that by \\"some strange coincidence\\" end up squeezing vastly more money out of black folks than any other group. In every decade since 1776, you see black folks laboring for white people under the threat of violence. The law, moral justifications and institutional structures have changed radically, but the situation has not.So yes, people ask a lot of awkward and inappropriate questions when I drink at a pub in non-white counties like the one where I live. It's a drag. I wish it would stop. But, it's also pretty superficial. There is a big, big difference between widespread casual rudeness and highly organized systematic predation.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"I agree, but that's why they delayed it so long.

Black Americans may only represent 10% of the US population, but had a massive influence on American culture. Pretty much all forms of American music derived from black culture. They've also been a part of American society since the founding of the nation, and had a much more storied history in America than any other minority group (outside perhaps the native Americans), so they're obviously going to have more stories and representation in American media.There's also massive bias in films like \\"crazy rich asians\\" which dont show any of the south asian origin citizens of places like singapore, instead focusing only on east asians. And before you say \\"there arent a lot of them there\\" they make up around 10% of the population and plenty hold high posts in the government (including the current president of singapore).So? The writer is of east asian decent. Most writers write of their own experience. He probably socialized more with east asians and understands that aspect of Singapore a lot more than the south asian side. Why should he shoe-horn us into his movie to make it aligned with the exact demographic breakdown? And if we're talking about ethnic representation, why do I never see dark-skinned people in Indian cinema or TV? Or the Indians with east asian features?Theres terrible slums in the phillipines (an entire underclass of people that are forced to live among graveyards for example) yet i dont see that being the main portrayals of the country.Here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV7R0c4TIMI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV7R0c4TIMI)Furthermore, while there are a lot of reasons which people will pick on India over say Iraq or Brazil is because many poorer countries are also either pure authoritarian and don't allow any access without military/police escort to ensure you don't show anything the dictator doesn't want, or their favelas are run by deadly gangs. The price of democracy and free expression is that you are much more open to criticism. Would you rather live in a dictatorship?The real root cause of all this bs today is the fact that brown people constantly question and put each other down for the smallest things, without even trying to see the point that the other person is making (and you're guilty of that yourself).Here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t511c/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t511c/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t3x87/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t3x87/)That's me defending Indians against racist comments.

Aquino flies all over the country, and has victimized people in numerous states and military bases. Michael Aquinos programming is standard military-type programming. Aquino puts in his own spirit guide into people. He likes to use his own version of Star Wars, with himself as Darth Vader, for his programming scripts. He programs in sexual and death (suicide) programs--such as the Rivers of Blood suicide protection program, and all the rest of the various types of programs. His Temple of Set functions as a programming vehicle. The rituals are designed to break the practitioners grip on reality and logic and take them into the world of visualization, and creativity. Two of the most ruthless programmers on the West coast are Jerry Lee Lewis and Michael Aquino. These two men are as cold blooded as they come, ranking right beside Mengele in their ability to torture. Michael Aquino, because he was in military intelligence, was in a position to pass on his diabolical programming abilities to dozens of military officers. His wife works with him, her name is Lilith Sinclair. Michael Aquino has travelled all over the U.S. doing mind control programming. Michael Aquino used Cathy OBrien as the star victim in his training video which teaches military officers how to create Monarch mind-controlled slaves.*?- [Fritz Springmeier](http://www.whale.to/b/sp/for1.html)\\"*In November 1986, San Francisco police had begun investigating claims of sexual abuse centering around the Army's Child Development Center at the Presidio of San Francisco. During the investigation, in August 1987, one of the girls ran into her abuser while on a shopping trip with her father. She froze, pointed to a person named Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, and identified him as 'Mikey'. Mikey, with help of a member of the child day care center staff, had taken her off site to be abused at his home. During the following investigation, the girl could accurately point out the house of Aquino (282) and describe some of the interior details (283). In October 1987, news of the Presidio molestings hit the local news and it was reported that at least 58 of 100 children who had visited the day care center showed physical and mental signs of sexual abuse (284). Some of the details that came out were that children had been tortured with needles (285) and that some had been forced to drink urine and eat feces (286). The parents sued the day care center for more than 60 million dollars (287), and as time went on, more and more claimed there was a cover up of the facts (288). Aquino was under investigation for a while, but never officially charged with anything (289). The case died a quiet death.*\\"- [The reality of protected child abuse networks](http://www.whale.to/c/reality6.html)\\"*The child had identified Aquino as 'Mikey' and his wife, Lilith, as 'Shamby' after she sighted them at an Army PX on August 12, 1987. She told her mother that 'Mikey was the blood man because he had put blood on her and licked it off.' The CID investigators showed photographs to the child: 'Photographs do show a number of items that corroborate Kinseys and other childrens descriptions of the house where they were taken.' The investigation of Lt. Col Aquino, a very wealthy man, and his wife, Lilith, involved multi-jurisdictions and several children interviewed identified him from photo lineups as their alleged abuser, but the identification of Lilith Aquino was not persuasive. A child stated that during their abuse 'Mikey' was dressed in womans clothes and 'Shamby' was dressed in mens clothing. On March 15, 1989 the CID interviewed a child victim who gave details of that childs sexual molestation in the context of satanic rituals by members of a 'devil worship club', during the years 1985-86, which the child said involved Lt. Col. Aquino. The child described the children being forced to chant that they 'Hated God,' and 'Loved the Devil,' before and after being molested which was filmed, in addition to providing detailed descriptions of murder and cannibalism.

The story told by Monarch victims--one of whom was Paul Bonacci--is that they were tortured for the purpose of creating 'multiple personalities' within them,' DeCamp continues from his book. 'These multiple personalities could then be programmed--as spies, 'drug mules,' prostitutes or assassins'...An article by Anton Chaitkin, quoted in the book, states that 'professionals probing the child victims of 'Monarch' say there are clearly two responsible elements at work: the government/military, and cooperating satanic (or more exactly pagan) cults. These are multi-generation groups, whose parents donate their own children--who are proudly called 'bloodline' or simply 'blood' cultists--to be smashed with drugs and electric shock and shaped. Other children are kidnapped and sold into this hell, or are brought in gradually through day care situations...Paul Bonacci and other child victims have given evidence in great depth on the central role of Lt. Col. Michael Aquino in this depravity,\\" continues Chaitkin. 'Aquino, alleged to have recently retired from an active military role, was long the leader of an Army psychological warfare section which drew on his 'expertise' and personal practices in brainwashing, Satanism, Nazism, homosexual pedophilia and murder.'*\\"- [John DeCamp](http://www.whale.to/b/the_franklin_cover-up_-_john_decamp_-_ebook.pdf)I have a large amount of further information, files, and books [saved in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fccli2/large_conspiracy_research_library_books_documents/).","title":"Whats in Fort Bragg?"},{"text":"Imma fly mine fully erect!","title":"As usual, Trump took a tragedy and made it about himself."},{"text":"I don't get that either.

The two of them were very active in ritualistic sexual abuse. And they deferred funding from this government program to use this experimentation upon childrenwhere they deliberately split off the personalities of these children into multiples so that when theyre questioned or put under oath or questioned under lie detector, that unless the operator knows how to question a multiple personality disorder, they turn up with no evidence. They use these kids to sexually compromise politicians or anyone else they wish to have control ofthey were taken to be used by professional pedophiles.

He has testified about sexually-abused males selected from Boy's Town in Nebraska and taken to nearby Offutt AFB, where he says they were subjected to intense MONARCH programming, directed mainly by Commander Bill Plemmons and former Lt. Col. Michael Aquino. After thoroughly tormenting the young boys into mindless oblivion, they were used (along with girls) for pornography and prostitution with several of the nation's political and economic power-brokers. Bonacci recalled being transported from the Air Force base via cargo planes to McClelland AFB in California. Along with other unfortunate adolescents and teenagers, he was driven to the elite retreat, Bohemian Grove . The perpetrators took full advantage of these innocent victims, committing unthinkable perversions in order to satisfy their deviant lusts. Some victims were apparently murdered, further traumatizing already terrified and broken children.*\\"\\"*One of our primary mind control programmers was Lieutenant Colonel [Michael Aquino](http://www.whale.to/b/aquino.html). He was with the psychological warfare division of the US Army and founder of the occult 'Temple of Set' that is proliferating on our military bases under the guise of a religion. He doesn't have any religious beliefs that I ever saw, but he used occultism as a trauma base for mind control. The only Satanic power that I ever experienced by Aquino was in the form of a stun gun. The high voltage that he administered to both my daughter and I, compartmentalized memories of programs for later access by certain government leaders and ClA-sanctioned drug lords that had the codes, keys and triggers to that program...Military mind-control was fast, effective, and highly technological, but it was the NASA programming that launched me as a 'Presidential Model'. Even though Aquino instilled my programming on both military and NASA installations, he had access to the latest technological advancements and techniques through NASA. These included mind foolers such as sensory deprivation tanks, virtual reality, flight simulators, and harmonics. By the age of two, Kelly had already been subjected to Aquino and his programming through these latest technological advancements, which shattered her fragile young mind before her base personality had a chance to form. Rather than use occultism on Kelly, Aquino traumatized her through sexual assault and high voltage tortures of the mind and body. She, like I, to this day carries numerous scars from this 'non satanic' abuse base. I know, from years of research, NASA technology and Aquino's programming, combined with the Project Monarch standard sleep, food, and water deprivation and high voltage, made Kelly a subject of state of the art genetically multigenerational MPD/DID psychological mind-control engineering.*\\"- [Cathy O'Brien](http://www.whale.to/b/obrien_b1.html)**[NASA connection - heavily involved in child torture, Nazi mind control programs using advanced technology, trafficking, and much more](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1feq0r7/overview_of_nasa_highlevel_mind_control_slave/)**\\"*What is Michael Aquinos interest in Australias Pine Gap Facility and why is discussion of the Bases use and purpose inadmissible within Australias polite society and media?

Never any low skill work.  The program should be heavily audited and any employer found to be committing fraud or mistreating an employee should be barred from it permanently (and fined severely).  It should also be required for the employer to offer the job at a higher wage to domestic candidates first.  Say 20% more.  And, if that still fails, they must give that higher wage to the TFW.

One more doesnt seem like much of a stretch.Regarding Catalan independence, the most important point to make is that Spain is not the United States. The refusal of another government to acknowledge an independence movement within its territory has exactly zero bearing on the U.S. governments response to a similar referendum. It seems like the Scottish independence vote in 2014 would have been honored by London if it had passed. Does that mean the U.S. government would respond the same to a Puerto Rican independence vote?","title":"CMV: The territories should be given either 1 voting member each or a at large voting member to the US House of representatives"},{"text":"MAGA cult are fucking asshat dickwads","title":"Trump supporters think Trump should.... use nuclear weapons to stop his hush money sentencing?

I've been backpacking in Latin America for almost a year now, and while people aren't very \\"PC\\" about topics of race with me, it doesn't usually come off as malicious and seems like a genuine part of the Latin culture to be curious about where everyone's from. I do get kids making slant-eyes at me (and everyone calling white people gringos, including us), but the same kids would also ask to take a picture of us and address us formally too. Institutionally, I have no idea about how they treat us, but I do know that there's a lot of regional gripes between Latin countries. And of course, being a white Spanish person here is going to give you a much easier life than being indigenous, and being white is also a beauty standard here just like in Asia.I definitely think the US has come a long way around this topic in a way that most other countries are still unwilling to take steps on.

I was asked to hop on a call on how to secure massive datasets(PBs on PBs) from tampering.\\nWhy? I figured out there were representatives from various federal agencies on the call. It was climate change/weather data. They had a legitimate threat to all their data sets since they're government hosted. The incoming administration wanted to poison data sets so that any model built off of it they could easily discredit based on bad data. They were fucking panicked.\\nThat was in 2017 before they were sworn in. This isn't even close to a \\"both sides\\" issue. One wants to light the world on fire for profit.Also, not the gotcha you think it was:\\nBut many other papers have been published from the wider N.I.H. project, including a 2023 study of older transgender and nonbinary adolescents who took estrogen or testosterone to aid their gender transition. After two years on hormones, the volunteers showed improvements in life and body satisfaction, and patients taking testosterone showed declines in depression and anxiety. (Two of the 315 patients died by suicide, a rate much higher than the general population.)Dr. Olson-Kennedy noted that doctors clinical experience was often undervalued in discussions of research. She has prescribed puberty blockers and hormonal treatments to transgender children and adolescents for 17 years, she said, and has observed how profoundly beneficial they can be.Although the N.I.H. studies are large, she said, these are minuscule compared to the amount of people that weve taken care of.","title":"Scientists debate fleeing America because of Trump  or risk their research being censored"},{"text":"Can anyone actually provide any evidence that Routh visited Ft.

While these are not typical voting representatives they do exist to represent those territories in Congress. The RC serves a four year term (double that of Representatives) - while participating in debates and voting in committees - but cannot vote on the house floor.  The NVDs serve two years, participate in debates and vote in committees, but also cannot vote on the house floor. While I agree that this level of representation is not on parity with full representation of the States it is more than a complete lack of representation.Some in territories see benefits in remaining a territory.  These include lower federal taxes (no federal income tax), greater legal autonomy (less Federal oversight compared to its oversight of states - less mandates such as minimum wage enforcement, less pressure to standardize things where the other states have standardized). Why should increased representation be given while these benefits of being a territory instead of a state remain?EDIT to add this:  Why should American Samoa have such representation when at birth they are classified as US Nationals not US Citizens. As such they can live or work in the US without a visa but cannot vote in federal elections unless they naturalize. As a US Citizen, a person cannot just go buy a house in America Samoa either - land ownership requires 50% or more Samoan ancestor.  US Citizens going there to visit, live, or work, need permits.
