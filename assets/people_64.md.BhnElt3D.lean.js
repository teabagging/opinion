Historically, there was a definite ceiling to their popularity that was well below what you'd need to take power in a democracy. The same was true for authoritarian left wing movements.The problem was not that the fascists became popular, but that the supposedly moderate right, having run out of road due to their failing (and therefore unpopular) socioeconomic policies, tried to co-opt them. They invariably saw making common cause or, as they would see it, making use of the fascists as preferable to compromising with the social democrats on the left. The reason for this was that the people bankrolling them, the rich oligarchs and the media barons, thought the same way. Ironically, the politicians got the short end of the stick (they were replaced, and sometimes killed once they were no longer useful), whereas the business owners got what they wanted (no more organized labour, no more minimum wage, ...).Another indication that fascism isn't actually popular is in how it changes its aspect as soon as it comes to power. It stops being about revolution and street violence because those things scare the people that tend to form the bulk of their supporters, and replaces them with a system of political repression through the law and the security apparatus. It's the same violence, but it happens out of sight and people who aren't directly impacted by it can pretend it doesn't happen or only happens to other people.","title":"Why Isnt Trump Running Away With This?"},{"text":"I don't care for this type of post. it's very misleading.

The Electoral College is in the Constitution, so requires an Amendment to remove.The Bayh-Cellar amendment came close to making it through the Senate (assuming Bayh was correct and all the Senators not in the Capitol would've voted in its favor), but in the end he had only 53 votes. Even if it had passed, he'd then have needed 38 states to sign off on it. I couldn't find the Senate vote roll, but assuming each Senator was voting the way their state's legislature did, a bare majority of 67/68 votes would only translate into 34 states, requiring another 4 to approve it.And that was back in 1970, where Democrats and Republicans were closer on many issues, including being pro-Democracy. After 1970, it became part of the GOP mindset that the EC benefited them, meaning basically every GOP senator and legislature would vote to block such an Amendment. As of right now, we have 49 GOP senators - assuming they don't pick up any seats this election (which seems unlikely) we'd need to convince 19 GOPers to vote for cloture, and then another 7 to vote for the Amendment. Even then, it would go to the states, where Republicans control 29 of the legislatures, and one (Alaska) is shared between GOPers and Democrats. So, assuming you could convince Alaska to support repealing the EC, you'd need to get 17 (over half) of the GOP-controlled state legislatures to sign off on it.","title":"I followed Harris and Trump round North Carolina.

Or just doesnt like reading? The president, any US president, is somewhat of a figurehead that has to agree with what the consensus says. Consensus is figured out in think tanks and CEO board rooms and agreed to by CIA and military. The president has to generally go along with the plan. No one who really disagrees with the capitalist plan gets into power. Trump isnt really an outlier as he makes himself out to be. Hes not a lifetime politician, but that doesnt mean he doesnt have the same basic overall perspectives. He says things like drain the swamp, because he knows its appealing to his base. But also he does mean it. Like if he wins and if he does put Musk into the position hes saying he will, thats actually scary. They both love to hate workers and are billionaires who think being a major assh*le as a boss is good business. If they cut government expenditures (of course not the pentagon) and the agencies that manage government spending, I fear we will be living in an even more dysfunctional system. We think the roads and infrastructure are awful, wait till its HUD, welfare, and social security thats dysfunctional due to major cuts. Not that they havent been cut already, but things can get worse. I dont see him as an outlier at all. Hes them, he just speaks the truth out loud. Like the US has been a racist nation, including the politicians, he just blew their fake facade. Hes a capitalist just like they are. So hes going to come to similar decisions. You cant bring the jobs back to the US because capitalism needs cheap labor so the profiteers can make their profits. Wars and poverty are necessary collateral damage of capitalism. No dem or R are going to fundamentally make our living conditions better. Conditions here will continue to worsen. The US has moved right my entire life. Meaning Rs and dems have both moved right. You keep moving right and you get authoritarianism and fascism. The only way to make things better is a radical shift to the left. So far, thats not looking like its happening. Debating about the individuals of government seems like a waste of time and energy. Theyre all in on the same overall bad plan. Trump is awful. Yes. So its Biden and Harris.

It will be difficult for those who have made this their identity to ever let go of it. Many will never. I think psychedelics might help people to break out of the cycle they find themselves in. I believe they will be an important tool in the chest. It is ugly, hateful, morally repugnant and existentially repulsive. I want to believe that in many Trumpers, a part of their subconscious knows how bad it is, but the inertia of it all is far too great to disperse without help and tools. Scared as hell, I am.

Voting is just one of the many things a responsible adult will do. No one will agree with a candidate 100% in our crappy 2 party system so no one expects voting for anyone to carry connotations of endorsement or agreeing with things that you dont agree with.Being a responsible adult just means understanding that change will take time and that we are in a giant boat together as the United States. We cant all be asking what can others do for me because that is a selfish and childish. The question should be what sort of society do I want for myself and others and what incremental steps can be taken to get there.Children want to blow things up because theres an adult who will deal with reality for them. Adults understand that theres no one else. Its on their shoulders to create that better world regardless of what pain they must deal with on that journey.I do feel for the Palestinians who are essentially being asked to vote while attending a funeral for their loved ones, but there are others who are going through their own shit as well. Women are dying in hospitals. Children are getting shot up in schools. There are massive problems the country faces and there is no one coming to save us.We are the worlds leader.

The example vantage gives is that historically Senate and Presidential voting are highly correlated, and polling has historically reflected that, but this year the Presidential polling is completely uncorrelated to the Senate polling.We're also seeing massive turnout pretty much everywhere, which historically is good for Dems, and the GOP has outsourced their canvassing to paid groups which are imploding.

Trump is almost certainly not a financial capitalist. In our current era I think Marx would conclude that the 'industrial' capitalists are Petty Bourgeoise. He almost concludes as much in Vol 3:   Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a **mere manager**, administrator of **other people's capital**, and of the owner of capital into a mere owner, a mere money-capitalist. Even if the dividends which they receive include the interest and the profit of enterprise, i.e., the total profit (for the salary of the manager is, or should be, simply the wage of a specific type of skilled labour, whose price is regulated in the labour-market like that of any other labour), this total profit is henceforth received only in the form of interest, i.e., as mere compensation for owning capital that now is entirely divorced from the function in the actual process of reproduction, just as this function in the person of the manager is divorced from ownership of capital. As far as the US yanking Israels chain, I have no idea what youre saying. Israel is essentially a US aircraft carrier. Israeli does what the US wants. Israel is the dogs tail not the other way around.This a one sided way to look at the relationship. The amount of control the US exerts over Israel has waxed and waned over the years. Right now it's at its lowest point. The Biden administration has been pleading with Netanyahu to keep a lid on things until after the election, and Netanyahu told Biden to go fuck himself. They're even leaking Israel's plans in Lebanon to the New York Times to throw a monkey wrench in it. It seems to me that the US government is doing exactly as it pleases. How much longer will it last?? Thats the question.We've *already* past that point IMO. After all you do go on to say that the US is getting desperate.

In Germany the Nazis forbade female party members from giving orders to male members. In a speech in 1937, Charles Vallin, vice president of the French Social Party, equated feminists with insubordinate proletarians: It is not with class struggle that the social question will be resolved. Yet, it is toward a sort of class struggle, opposing the feminine proletariat to the masculine capitalist, that feminism is leading us.De Jouvenel equated women with hedonism and hedonism with decadence. Europe, he wrote in 1938, had grown soft and feminine from pleasure seeking, becoming like a woman who had just escaped a frightening accident. [She] needed light, warmth, music. According to de Jouvenel, an atmosphere of facility corrupted everything, and people had become increasingly unwilling to take on painful tasks. In short, he believed the feminization of Europe had been its downfall. In a similar vein, Drieu La Rochelle claimed that educated women undermined his manhood. He characterized political movements he disliked as feminine and those he admired as masculinefascism, for him, being the most masculine of all.","title":"Trump claims he will protect women  women need to protect themselves from Trump"},{"text":"America is a fickle object of faith.

It got decidedly lower-brow when the station was sold in the late 90s, because it basically became a hard right propaganda station.

I've even been hearing it from various Catholic and Protestant church leaders. They go on about the importance of \\"truth\\" and all that.Of course, the right wing starts it all off with the gender stuff, and the context is that only through Jesus do we have \\"truth\\", but their language and argument styles for it are all straight from university philosophy classes.Then there's people on Reddit and social media who've started to put on a show acting like they know how to recognize structures of people's arguments and how to refute them.I know just from simple observation that some kind of massive, nationwide intellectual upgrades have occurred among the political right.

Another one telling me that they have spent an enormous amount of time talking to campaign advisers, trying to get Donald Trump to focus on the economy, to focus on inflation. They believe these are the matters that voters actually care about.These allies are a bit slow on the uptake.  The man is not smart. He's tasted the power of being in a top position of a nation.  An entire country.  He wants that back.   He doesn't want to fix anything.   We also know he's declining in his mental and physical health. His father had Alzheimer's.  We've seen this \\"Let Trump be Trump\\" then they wonder why he's being such a dickhole. A majority of this country or those paying attention are also exasperated.

I was just trying to frame the discussion only by what I heard in pod save America.They went through some cross tabs and talked about various scenarios.This was a couple weeks ago when Harris bleeding minority support was a concern. The story was that the swing states have been losing white non college rural voters and replacing them with college educated white and minority support. Harris was doing better than Biden with the first group and needed to do as good or within reach of Biden on the second group. Given the demographic shift, it would be good for Harris since the group shes doing poorly with is shrinking in the swing states.","title":"Harris leading Trump by 34 points among Latino voters in Pennsylvania: Survey"},{"text":"I think Harris sweeps the rust belt and Trump sweeps the sun belt meaning Harris wins 270-268. All of this talk by both sides of flipping other states seems like wishful thinking. I do think a landslide victory would be better for the country even if it might be a harder pill to swallow for the losing side. Itd be hard for Republicans to put up much of a fuss if Harris does indeed flip Texas, Florida, Iowa, and Kansas and then sweeps the swing states (thats their dream scenario). Im sure many republicans would be very surprised by those results, and Im not saying it will happen, but I would think that there will be no talk of election interference if thats the case.On the contrary, if Trump sweeps the swing states and is in fact able to flip bluer/purplish states like VA, NH, NM, and MN then that would leave many democrats dumbfounded as how could America possibly show up to elect an evil tyrant in such massive numbers, but theyd have to accept it. A landslide pretty much means the losing side will be too busy looking in the mirror wondering where things went wrong in their campaign for them to complain about the other side doing some shenanigans. A close election likely means it gets dragged out for weeks if not months and I dont see the losing side giving up that easily. Nevertheless, I want Trump to win, but I just dont see it happening. Personally I think Roe v Wade will drive many people to the booth for Kamala despite her not being able to do anything as president. I also think there are a lot of Americans with January 6th and Trump getting charged with 34 felonies fresh in their mind so in their eyes they cant possibly support Trump, ergo Kamala is the better option for them. I know a decent amount of people who voted for Kamala because of that philosophy.

Hes actually pretty smart, just awful as a human and terrible politics. How anyone could think thats going to top Obamas assassination of Bin Laden, I shake my head, no one would think they compare. I mean to the US, bin Laden was close to the Devil - the mastermind behind 911. Bush and Cheney chased him for years. The US - both dems and Rs - celebrated his gory death like the Romans joyed over the gladiator games. Half the US population probably didnt know about the drone strike that killed Soleimani and the other half couldnt care less about his death. Im sure Trump didnt see it as a comparison and simultaneously didnt know who he was. I honestly cant say why he decided to do that. It was extremely foolish and brutish, but the US government has been wanting to start a war with Iran for decades, so maybe he wanted to be in on that action.

Reading through slave narratives or of what happened to people of color 100 years ago is just horrifying to see.  Even hearing the stories of those still alive today from the Civil Rights Era or more recent.  My mom applied as a nurse in the late 70s to a North Florida hospital and the hiring/HR director when she started said in passing \\"we have our ni&amp;&amp;ers here but they know their place\\".  How many black nurses do you think they hired there... I'd say it might be stagnating.  You see a lot of those same white supremacist arguments made just behind a bit of a curtain while taking the overt white supremacy out of it and that being more accepted in some groups.    For example years ago white supremacists complaining about Juneteenth would overtly.  Black people were better off enslaved, they got uppity with freedom, they try to use white only parks to celebrate, etc etc.  Now it's  \\"I don't like Juneteenth because it's not the perfect day in my mind as all slavery officially ended on this day instead\\".   And that just lacks any sort of logic when the person hasn't made one complaint about Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, or the 4th of July and those dates being chosen.  But if you take out the blatantly white supremacist reasoning, no matter how unsound a different reason that's created is, there's some people willing to keep accepting the same old story.  Or the idea of embracing white supremacist/white nationalist ideals, but pretending to not know where they come from.  It's tough.  Like I said, born and raised in the South.  It's better from the days of my youth, but still kind of shocking how many hoops someone will go through to embrace that stuff without being overt about it.","title":"CMV: US society is probably becoming more racist"},{"text":"Puerto Ricans are fantastic at holding a grudge in a fun way too.

You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, theyre going to behave, Trump said on May 14, according to donors at the event.When one of the donors complained that many of the students and professors protesting on campuses could one day hold positions of power in the United States, Trump called the demonstrators part of a radical revolution that he vowed to defeat. He praised the New York Police Department for clearing the campus at Columbia University and said other cities needed to follow suit, saying it has to be stopped now. Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years, he said, according to the donors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail a private event.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/27/trump-israel-gaza-policy-donors/FUCKING VOTE.","title":"'Trump is even worse': Bernie urges pro-Palestinian voters to back Harris"},{"text":"The orange man will be history in less than a week.

Next, he doubles down on Israel wiping out Palestine.  Further inflaming Arab/Muslim hatred of America.  Hes also made it clear hed like to further disable Iran which makes Iran more likely to keep supporting terror organizations instead of working to normalize their behavior.

It would also be great to have Iran as a regional balance against the Saudis, because fuck the Saudis.  Now countries like Japan, theyre dependent on exporting quality products to the American market.  Tariffs drive up the cost of not only Chinese imports, but Japanese as well.

Trump is a very good conman. He does - even if he's lost it with age and expanding narcissism - have a knack for winning people over (see example below). But Trump has only ever conned for the benefit of himself. For money and power and ego. He's never had a broader goal to impact society beyond his own house. That's where big-vision bodies like the Heritage Foundation and Christian Nationalist politicians (Pence, Cruz, etc) come in. They see Trump as a Trojan Horse. They can climb inside his larger-than-life persona and his large-scale grifting network, and gain entry to the most powerful building in the world. From there, they'll steer Trump, not the other way around. *(Example, as mentioned above)* I remember listening to a podcast in 2016 about Trump's affiliates courting the big money donors for Trump's campaign. (I'm going to get some details wrong I'm sure) The Koch brothers  had already refused to meet Trump because they knew the kind of person he was. But a friend of theirs was considering a sit-down with Trump. Charles Koch warned the friend (let's call him \\"Friend\\") not to because Friend was opposed to Trump's political stances. But Friend went anyway. After the meeting, Friend called Koch in a kind of a daze. Friend said Trump knew all about him and spent their time together praising Friend and referring to the history and accomplishments of Friend and saying why he was vital to Trump's campaign. Friend was blown away, mesmerized by the way Trump made him feel like the most important person in the world. Koch said that was WHY he didn't want Friend to meet Trump. Because he knew Trump's ways and how persuasive, manipulative, and effective they are.","title":"What if Trumps campaign is cover for a slow-motion coup?"},{"text":"You think Mexico gives a shit about Tariffs?Go ahead.

It advocates for \\"leader less resistance\\" (3) in which cells function in small or singular groups. No more than 2 or at absolute max, 3 members. Any more than that, and it is guaranteed someone has flipped. The OKC bombing was carried out using The Turner Diaries formula. Hundreds of peoples lives were changed forever that day. Kids in the daycare were murdered and McVeigh basically chalked it up to collateral damage. The bull horn of radicalization is blasting right now.

Granted, Dorner wanted to call attention to injustice, and he is not a perfect 1 to 1 comparison, his methods can be easily replicated.

(many stories of older women who are voting for the first time as their husbands die off too)Another thing has been both enthusiasm and get out the vote efforts.Trump took over the RNC, sucked money from the RNC and downballot to his coffers, and then mostly took that money and used it for things like his lawsuits. For a number of traditional tasks like Get-out-the-vote efforts, he's outsourced from volunteers to paid companies via PACs like the one Elon Musk runs. As every article has come out about, these have been horrendously managed, and are being run on the cheap without any passion. Compare the Harris effort, which is much more organic. In a close election, ensuring voters come out is far more important than nearly anything else. A few models suggest in 2016 that rain in a few key locations probably depressed turnout sufficiently enough to make a difference. Lastly, unlike 2016, its no longer rhetoric to say if Republicans Win, Abortion gets taken away. It happened. And it's caused democrats to consistently overshoot. The polling numbers are mostly funny because they're trying to hedge against hidden trumpers like 2016 and 2020 to appear credible, but that means putting a finger on the scale.

Most polling orgs are correcting their samples using recall votes. A process generally known to be bad.

For every election prior to this it's been a bad move. And would have made the polls less accurate. Herding likely explains the lack of movement in the polls.
