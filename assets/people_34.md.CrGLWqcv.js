This means meeting people where they are, across all communication mediums (radio, TV, podcasts, live streams, etc).

But those things together dont add up to what we saw happen. I think people who oppose fascism need to consider that the Democratic Party may be a broken vehicle for democratic ideas. Too many people see them as captured resistance and  as effete elites who think neoliberal tinkering is preferable to systematic changes. Voters are turned off by a party establishment that feels entitled to the votes of minority groups and yet constantly fails to take aggressive action on their stated goals. Is that feeling fair and totally anchored in reality? A LOT of democrats are sitting around saying fuck no to that question right now. But the reality is that they lost, apparently fair and square, and the party needs to figure out how it is going to build an active coalition going forward. Its not going to be by propping up slimeballs like newsome and Shapiro and fetterman who spend their time and energy browbeating activists and courting conservatives. If that was going to work, Hil-dawg wouldve won, and so would kamala.","title":"Biden speaks to nation after Harris' loss to Trump: \\"We accept the choice the country made\\" - CBS News"},{"text":"The thing is that what made misogyny sexy to those kids was that it showed men having lots of sex.

A complete stoppage of effort to combat climate change. We may have already been past the tipping point, but if we aren't already, we sure will be soon. Ecological collapse across the world will lead to famine and weather events that will kill tens of millions. This will pour gasoline on the fires of worldwide conflict even further.  \\n8.

In the promises they want him to fulfill category goes a better economy, and a crackdown on immigration, and putting \\"America first\\". But do those who chose him over Harris really want the whole regressive and toxic Republican culture war agenda and Project 2025? I don't think so. Do they want the abolition of the Department of Education? I doubt that they've even given that any thought. Do they wish to see the Affordable Care Act eliminated if it isn't going to be replaced with something better? Nope. Are they in favor of further undermining the reproductive freedom of women? I'm sure that the majority aren't. Do they really desire to see him pursue his vindictive agenda, to punish everyone he's threatened to punish? I would be surprised if they're onboard with that. Do they really want his economic America firstism, his tariffs and trade war, if it turns out that they're going to be adversely impacted? Of course not. So I wouldn't read too much of a mandate into his win. Many of his voters were just motivated to cast their ballot for him because they have the naive idea that he gave the country a better economy when he was president and will do so again. They're not really gung-ho for his entire platform. They're also only half of the electorate. The popular vote was 50% Trump, and 47% Harris. That's pretty close, not a landslide that represents an overwhelming popular mandate for the whole shebang of Trumpism.","title":"Trump wins the White House in political comeback rooted in appeals to frustrated voters"},{"text":"Oh you think?

At some point the practice changed and now banks are free to hold onto vacant housing, keeping it off the market, most often not even renting it out, causing a shortage in the housing supply which drives prices up, until they rise to a point that the bank can sell it for a profit.

You would then also need to stamp out enacted fascism as you go, such as politicians or justices that should be impeached and removed from office, individuals that enact violence or unlawful behavior. We saw many trumpers get some of the blame for Jan 6th, but not many of the ringleadersThen we are left with the issue that a huge demographic is inherently fascist and not just switched onto it. Ideally they quiet down and foment in smaller and smaller circles, but there actually needs to be better education to help halt its spread in future generations. This would also require better tax plans that force the rich under heel, namely billionaires looking to carve a spot in the burgeoning oligarchy. This may and should include indictments and charges for any illegal or unlawful behaviors, such as price gouging, racketeering, but only if we can pass better legislation en route to holding the elites accountable We also need to contend with the fact that Americans don't care about how respectful or by the book you are. They also don't mind if you're a convicted criminal and rapist and message fascism as long as they perceive that their lives are or would be better with the fascist, at least so far as their leaders are concerned, so taking a high road is pointless and often appears to Americans as cowardly.

They view the Democratic Party as the establishment, and people are increasingly suspicious and resentful of the establishment. This is true regardless of age, race, gender, or background. The Harris Campaign did a catastrophically horrible job of trying to address this. They did not highlight the work the Biden Admin did for working people; recognize the very real economic pain middle and lower income families face due to inflation; and refused to take every chance she was given to criticize the Biden Admin.There have been successful efforts to keep the far right from taking over governments in France and Mexico recently because the left-leaning governments at the time made an aggressive push to pass reforms and advocate for itself, and promise to change. This worked, and any critical effort to fend off Trump would have recognized this. I heard Bernie himself highlight these efforts as what the Harris campaign should model around the DNC.But the Harris campaign did not do this. They instead adopted the recently successful campaign style of the left-leaning Labour Party in the UK, which elevated center-left candidates and said, Well, Im at least not the other guy. You can highlight the reforms, cooperation with unions, and the picket line photo-op all you want, but I saw almost none of this in her campaign rallies or speeches. I hardly saw any of this in advertisement. It really felt like the campaign ultimately settled on, well, at least Im not the other guy. That was a foolish mistake. This only worked for the Labour Party because **they were not the ones in charge**. The conservative Tory Party was, for over a decade, and they were the ones who initiated Brexit, mishandled COVID, lost the people billions of dollars, and failed to address inflation. In the US, it doesnt matter if so much of the current pain was caused by Republicans and Trump's lingering policies. It doesnt matter if the Biden Admin cant directly regulate the federal reserve. It doesnt matter if Trump's economic plan is going to make things worse. None of that matters. People hear these as excuses to not help them now, and an adherence to institutions they no longer think benefit them. Polls and focus groups have said this for months.

Because if you step outside the Reddit circlejerk you'll find the war is going fairly bad for Ukraine right now, and has been for awhile.

They've  largely learned to mitigate their weaknesses &amp; play to their strengths. They've been making steady territorial gains and more importantly they're vastly outproducing the West in munitions, especially in artillery shells which have proved decisive. Factor in Ukraine's manpower woes..  Ukraine isn't going to win a war of attrition with, they just aren't. If the status quo continues with aid occasionally trickling in it'll maybe prolong the war but the outcome won't change. You can meme about NK all you want, but more expendable non-Russian cannon fodder is a huge boon for them.For Ukraine to stand a chance NATO as a whole would have *drastically* ramp up arms production and alter the rules of engagement, maybe even consider some form of direct intervention.

Over two dozen women have accused him of sexual harassment or assault, and last year, he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in the E. Jean Carroll case. These allegations arent just rumorstheres a whole Wikipedia page cataloging the claims, which speaks to how serious and widespread these accusations are.Then theres the documented corruption. Trump refused to divest from his businesses, which led to countless ethical violations, from profiting off government officials staying at his properties to using his position to steer business to his personal ventures. His presidency was filled with conflicts of interest, making it one of the most self-serving in modern history.His behavior also undermined basic democratic norms. He made repeated efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, ultimately leading to the January 6th Capitol riot. This disregard for democratic processes was unprecedented and shows he was willing to put his own interests above the countrys. Combine this with his constant, childish name-calling, inflammatory rhetoric, and divisive behavior, and its clear he was more interested in creating conflict than unity.Finally, Trumps history of lying is staggering. Independent fact-checkers have estimated he made over 30,000 false or misleading statements while in office, covering everything from COVID-19 to election fraud. The sheer volume of misinformation alone makes him one of the least trustworthy public figures in recent history.Trumps record of unethical, divisive, and outright harmful actions goes well beyond any single criticism. Its not partisan to call out these behaviors; its about expecting better from someone who once held the highest office in the country.","title":"Theres No Denying It Anymore: Trump Is Not a FlukeHes America"},{"text":" Mostly new arrivals.

Respectfully, thats a narrative I mostly saw discussed within this subreddit and in conspiracy-focused channels or Discords. I also noticed posts pointing out that both parties have celebrity connections, with photos circulating of both candidates in situations that could be perceived as questionable.For most Democrats, the issue is less about individual controversies and more about wanting a leader who embodies inclusivity, something they feel aligns with their values and way of life. Similarly, the majority of conservatives are focused on preserving their way of life, which they see as grounded in their own core values. Both sides are driven by a desire to support what feels like an authentic representation of their beliefs and priorities. And then theres those on both side just there to casually fuel the flames. I mean this from the bottom of my heart: the only way we move forward as Americans, and not as Conservatives versus Democrats (which, as I said, I very much agree with in your last statement), is by actually carrying the burden of responsibility and acknowledging when we, as AMERICANS, are wrong.As a Democrat, I will never leave this sub because it truly is one of the few places on Reddit where I see open and free discussion on issues that get downvoted in more popular threads. I acknowledge that our extremists (like you saw in those MAGA deportation posts on ULPT) have made the divide that much harder to bridge, but I will always want to hear what you all need as a society. For example, I fully embody most of RFKs health stancesas someone going to school to practice medicine, I religiously read through many of the concerns you bring up here about vaccines, food quality, Big Pharma, and so on.Unfortunately, I dont expect to get an answer here that acknowledges OPs point about this political tension being relatively peaceful outside of internet wars.

The second thing I will say is I could give a fuk about our current MainStream Media which is totally owned funded and controlled by Capitalist Interests.  The third thing I will say is I will never again trust the will of the people as they can't be trusted.  They can't be trusted, because the MainStream Media who could care less about Democracy failed at its mission to protect and educate our society and our Democracy long ago.  The will of the people can't be actually trusted without a MainStream Media. that isn't controlled by Capitalist Interests.  This is the simple reason why for example that Presidential endorsements in major newspapers for or against Candidates are  so important in America. Headlines are a smart easy quick way to sell a product, without those headlines products would fail to sell.  This is the number one reason a convicted felony and rapist named Trump was elected and was able to circumvent the Constitution of the United States with the help of the Supreme Court.  Because the MainStream Media Sane-Washed Trump in the eyes of America which is the same thing as an endorsement.  This is the exact opposite of how they have treated Bernie for years by Mad-Washing him as the opposite of an endorsement.  Blame no one for Trump's election except the MainStream Media and American Capitalism as they brainwashed the American public, into getting everyone to vote for who they wanted you to vote for.  They can already get you to buy everything they want you to buy, by sane-washing the products they want to sell, and mad-washing others.         Remember I said this four years from now when the carnage from the disaster of the Trump second term has already settled onto us.  End-Stage Capitalism is just beginning.  In as little as two years the Democrats will be campaigning again.  Before then they need to launch a free in-depth national digital Democratic news platform highlighting Democratic Economic Reforms, based on Modern Monetary Theory, not on Trickle Down Economics, spoken in plain language, covering all aspects of how the Democrats plan to govern, we should called something creative, maybe Project 2029.","title":"Donald Trump Won.

I already know how things are going to go in this country because Ive been living it.Let me add quickly before moving forward that most of my friends and acquaintances are Trump supporters and I am not the person that sees you guys as enemies nor will I tolerate being seen as an enemy. I just dont think like that and I never will so I wont even go there. We are a human family and we all bleed red at the end of the day. We should all be able to have intelligent conversations and educate each other and talk to each other. The family court system here is anti-woman,  anti-democrat, anti-non-Christian. That has affected my life and my childrens lives and more ways and I could even begin to explain here. Had I moved to New York and gone to family court there I would have full custody of my children, and so much more I cannot even explain here, but will if someone asks. The UK and other progressive states have come very far with adding coercive control to the domestic violence qualifications for child custody and divorce. Trump has made great effort to go backwards with that. This affects women greatly. My outcome in a state that allows coercive control laws to be in place versus Florida which doesnt are night and day. I have been more controlled by my ex-husband since leaving him than I was during my marriage to him, but that wouldnt be the case in New York State or California or the other states where coercive control is considered domestic violence. I would have full custody of my children and acknowledgment of abuse. Donald Trumps decision to change definitions of domestic violence and sexual assault has rolled back womens rights by half a century- this already happened in 2019. \\nThe Trump administration quietly changed the definition of both domestic violence and sexual assault. Medicaid expansion went away in Florida along with 11 other Red states, making it nearly impossible as a single person to survive without healthcare and a 9-to-5 job to give me insurance, which was not possible. Statistically it is the mother who stops working to care for her child when they have cancer treatment and in a two person household that can work but not single. And in a majority female single parent country, you are shit out of luck if you have to quit working so your child can have cancer treatment. This is what happened to me.My child will have side effects from cancer treatment for the rest of their life, and if the ACA is taken away, he will not be able to afford insurance and will either have to go on disability or make sure to get into a career field that allows him to afford $2500 a month Insurance premium. This is not an answer to your question because this isnt about how it affects women. I just wanted to express this. However, I am looking at having to move my children and I to New York State so that my son lives in a state where he wont have to be homeless to afford medical care. This feels like a single mom issue to me. I also will not be able to afford healthcare due to pre-existing conditions. I shouldve moved back a few years ago for this reason, sadly ripping my children from their home. Instead I sacrificed myself to stay here and not take my medications, which has drastically affected my quality of life and my childrens.I live in a state where an educated woman is perceived as a threat, and a single woman is perceived as a threat due to the extreme Christianity in my county and state, but definitely my county. That is only getting worse and being perpetuated.For a single woman, childcare is nearly impossible to afford in Florida versus a blue state. I know plenty of women in Florida who have done the math and cannot leave their abusive husbands here. If they lived in New York or another blue state, they would be supported in getting away. In Florida, family court laws have changed in the past few years and lean towards supporting the father or the parent who has minority custody, which is statistically the father. Men pay less child support for seeing their children less. My ex moved out of state and was no longer 50/50 and is 80/20 but actually doesnt see them at all. My child support went down.Overall, its nearly impossible to survive as a single person in Florida. To make it here you need to be married, in a relationship, sharing rent, or with a roommate. The unspoken truth here is that old outdated values like Christian marriage and no divorce are being perpetuated. You can survive here as long as you do it their way. And there is absolutely a judgmental atmosphere and a scarlet letter put on those who are not married or Christian.As a single woman living in Florida, I have massive amounts of debt and cannot really see myself ever getting out of poverty at this point. Had I moved to New York State or another state a decade ago or even three years ago, would have zero debt and optimal health and a lot more support. When people say that Trump\\nIs anti- women, they are not talking about all women. They are talking about single women and minority women and women who dont have the luxury of reaping the benefits that come from being married or being married specifically to a white man due to the Republican Party taking over. We are lost. We are going backwards. Those other women will be fine unless they leave their husbands and have children to take care of.Im sure theres so much more, but I am tapped out from typing this into my phone with one finger.

All were trying to do is be entertained from their movies and TV shows but were getting preached to from their woke agendas.Dems preach to us about identity politics when Kamalas campaign never had one except providing abortion. Maybe theyre the ones who no longer have an identity. Bernie seems to be saying Dems lost it more than Trump won it. Perhaps? They had the football and dropped it at the 1-yard line. Dems really need to pick a different identity than their woke, metoo, DEI nonsense and stop acting like social justice warriors.All the lib tears from young females is a repeat of 2016. The girls who were probably 10 in 2016 are now 18 and need to record themselves just for the clicks. Back in 2016, TikTok wasnt a big thing yet. TikTok started to get more popular a few years later circa 2019-2020. These young females want to have abortions that can range from $500-$800 while most Americans cant afford groceries each week. Tell your man to use a condom or pull out! Use birth control. Damn. The 18-29 females who voted Kamala just want to be slutty like her 30-40 years ago. You can start doing the creampie finish once you start using birth control, you liberal skank.Reason why I dont buy Trump gear even though Ive been wanting to since 2020 is the fear of some random libtard with TDS waiting to vandalize my home or car. It only takes one. And I live in a city and county full of Trump supporters. Its almost like if we wear Trump gear, we are wearing a Nazi sign. Doesnt that suck? See how racists and bigots theyve become? But if they tell us theyre homosexuals, we need to accept it because were homophobes if we dont. Its ok to show gay pride but not wear Trump gear.We need to accept them for the freaks they are but they wont accept us if we support a so-called Nazi named Donald Hitler. DEI = Diversity, Equity, Inclusion. Dems give us none of that if we show support to Trump. We are not included. We will be censored, banned, suspended, ridiculed, attacked, vandalized, or fired like Gina Carano if we show any hint of supporting Trump.I ?? Mel Gibson. Im aware of his fall from grace. Said the n-word in his drunken tirade although hes still very good friends with Danny Glover. Went on an antisemitic tirade that got him blackballed in Hollywood which were started by Jews. But I love that he supports Trump.Maverick (1994) is one of my favorite movies of all-time and Im thinking of putting it No. 1 on my Letterboxd list thanks to Mel saying Kamala has an IQ of a fence post! My No. 1 was The Shawshank Redemption or Back to the Future Part II, but Tim Robbins and Lea Thompson have been against Trump. Zemeckis is a conservative from Illinois but who knows if he likes Trump? Jodie Foster is probably a lib too being a lesbian, but Jodie is still very close to Mel since filming Maverick over 30 years ago.Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel were blackballed from Hollywood after Mel did The Passion of the Christ and after as his drunken antisemitic tirade. Catholics like myself have been oppressed by American Christians who are mostly Protestants and Jews who control the media and entertainment industry.Ive seen Am I Racist? which was produced by Ben Shapiro. Matt Walsh basically pointed out that these libtards are a bunch of DEI grifters using race as a way to extract money from people. One happened to be a white lady writing books about racism. Racism only exists if you keep talking about it which the libs obviously do.As for illegal immigrants, how is that racist if Trump mass deported them? The keyword is ILLEGAL immigrants. Latinos for Trump INCREASED. They get it. How would you feel if a bus full of random strangers went to your property and decided to live there? We have immigration laws for a reason and they need to be upheld.Libtards have no education with the ins and outs of politics. Its like they watch ABC News, MSNBC News, or CNN for 10 minutes listening to them trashing Trump and they think they already aced their civics class in high school.![gif](giphy|EqMmW66tIke7bIGK6q|downsized)","title":"Its so f*d up that Democrats are calling Trump Supporters Racist but no one is giving any reasons!?"},{"text":"You know what...# I'm not fuckin leaving","title":"Powell Says He Wont Resign If Trump Asked Him to Leave"},{"text":"I think Democrats should just let Republicans do whatever they want so long as it doesn't involve voting rights.

Anyone that tries to take that away should be fought. Yeah they can try to pass them, but that doesn't mean they will pass. You get people to side and vote for you by winning them over. Some tactics and approaches work better than others. The fact that Trump won with an increase in nearly every demographic tells me that the left's approach isn't working with people. People knew what Trump is about and still voted for him. People don't like to be blamed and shamed for things they don't feel responsible for. So instead of thinking of changing tactics, liberals are currently doubling down on blaming and shaming? Agree or not the US just said that's not going to work for for them in the long run, time to change tactics. Just your comment implied that I voted to take rights away from people being able to use the bathroom. I assure you I have not and never have, not even adjacently as I didn't vote for Trump or any Rep. I don't like or agree with him Reps or MAGA but I can kinda see their perspective something the left has totally lost the ability to do at large. You keep grouping people together. Your questions implies I have no feelings for empathy. Even though I don't support Trump, let's say for a moment I did vote for him. Exactly how is your response supposed to win me over? How are you changing my mind in any other way than implying I'm just the same as other horrible people?No sexuality is not a lifestyle but you can make it a lifestyle. I was in the military. To me it was just a job. Now if I flew military flags, I always wore military pride clothing, played military games and attended military pride events, wanted to be thanked for my service and shamed anyone who didn't I'd say that's a lifestyle. Some people might not like or support the military and I should be ok with that. They also shouldn't take away my rights for being a vet. Being gay or trans isn't a choice, but it's a choice to make it your entire identity and public ally announce that. No one could tell my sexuality from my fashion or hobbies. There are also people that are gay that you would never know unless they told you because it's not their entire identity. It's fine that it is but just like some people don't agree with the military they also need to know that not every single person would agree with that which is their right as long as they aren't taking other's rights away.The left needs to wake up and wake up fast and realize this approach to enacting and keeping change is not working with now over half this country as far as the social and economic issues go.

It very well could be twitter/X.  But even biblical writings talk about comet's as messengers.  This isn't a normal comet either, it literally was a second moon (blue STAR) for the time period it has been here (which includes not just the switch to \\"Red-Man\\" but includes us all displaying our moral compass during the talk of dividing us all).  This ia awesome though.  It's wild as we get more advanced, that we have focused our \\"advancements\\" towards the material on this planet, and the moral advancements have been left behind.  I believe Rudolf Steiner also predicted this time frame as the test for humanity against ahriman, who is an ancient zoroastrian (sorry for miss-spellings and typos) idea that represents materialism (and is the opposite evil of lucifer, who is the representative of G_d's \\"moral purity\\" and became the accuser who even Michael said nothing to defend himself against accusations by him, or even Yeshua (our salvation!) stayed quiet during the accusations thrown against him on the cross.  But lucifer is I believe what we see the secret societies (checkered board clubs) pushing behind the scenes, while materialism is pushed in the front scenes.  But we must learn to balance the two evils that are the two separate worlds colliding with Earth, and we must walk in between them as he did.  I've tried reading as much on different culture prophecies that point to the same thing as I can, so this post is awesome.  If I understand it correctly, we will be / are being tested between the material and the moral (body and spirit).  Jesus showed us the way to do this by remaining away from material possessions, but also was able to question morality by showing love and mercy as being the highest forms of morality that can overcome all (when he said the priests had cleaned the outside of their cups but the inside of the cup was unclean).    This is a side note that is my own thoughts, but I also think the Red-Man myth being a material path is fascinating when you consider that no human has put their name on as many bricks and buildings on this planet than Red-Man...a fitting tribute to materialism if there ever was one, especially considering all the passages about how inportant having a name on a brick in heaven is for the lampshades of Earth, I would imagine putting your name on a brick on Earth has some unknown implications, but again, this is more my thibking than anything I can directly point to.  Best of luck in your moral quest!  It is very difficult to walk the minefield of traps right now.

If you are watching that much tv that you know which phrases are currently trending amongst whoever, it implies you steady pay attention to it (which is ironic for someone lecturing other people about their potential media habits).I dont own cable. I dont use apps to access those channels either. Most everything I watch on TV is free, and mostly consists of reruns of mindless old school sitcoms like the golden girls. I rarely even watch tv in the first place. Sometimes if something is happening in society, Ill look at what various outlets are saying but I dont rely on it. If you have an opposing theory or opinion, thats cool; you can share it without projecting what you assume I watch, or read, etc, etc. I posted the theory because I was interested in varying opinions and view points. Like yoursbut, youre wrong in your projections because I rarely even watch YouTube. Ill refer to it if it has a clip of something that I want to reference; in this case, I linked to Trump because I quoted his words and used the video as a citation to that.  I appreciate your opinion and view, but why express it in a way that comes off like you are attempting to gatekeep critical thinking skills? You share your opinion but then wrap it up under a few statements that seem to lecture me on how to think - without knowing virtually anything about me or my lifestyle, likes, dislikes, habits. Attempting to act like a gatekeeper of critical thought is an odd behavior.Your views are interesting, parts I agree and parts I dont. I can have conversations about that 100%. But your intuition about my lifestyle, habits, train of thought, exposure to Fox or CNN, or whatever, isnt on point; not even close. And I never referenced those things either, you just disagreed with my conclusions and then made up an inaccurate profile about my unknown variables to justify yourself. If you want to promote critical thinking and anti-media influence type values, thats cool, Im down with all of that. But you contradict yourself a great deal when you start projecting false traits onto other people in order to justify why your opinion is better or more valid. Just saying.

Before I get downvoted, I want to let everyone know that I follow all social media and news outlets for both parties. Im really big on education and critical thinking, and I oppose the extreme sides of both political parties. Okay. Moving forward. I do think its interesting how many people actually dont do research on both sides. It is true that Trump wants to leave this up to the state level. That is fantastic. Now, how do I answer this in a way that shows my open-mindedness and doesnt trigger anyone?  Im not sure. Florida is the blueprint for MAGA. We have already been enduring what the entire country will begin to go through now that Trump is president. We are ahead of the curve and understand how things will go. This state is a state that did not pass the abortion ban. If any of you reading this also like understanding both sides and are a part of the Harris thread and the Democratic threads, etc., go ahead and go to the Florida Reddit group. Theres some info there.Politics is such a strange thing, and the reality is that voting Republican is more beneficial for men and particularly white men while voting Democrat is more beneficial for women- most women, but not necessarily women married to white men.To dive into that more deeply and understand why that is would take too long here in this response, but anyone can look into this. I really enjoy learning about politics and have appreciated this group and the many other groups that have helped me understand the opposing party. This is my understanding so far, but if anyone knows any different or has a different viewpoint, definitely share it with me so I understand that side of things. Thats very important to me.Im going to add some links to resources for my answer after I press send. Thank you!Edit: I am not allowed to post links. Just got popped by a Mod.

We're going to control the House by the same margin as we do now, maybe even slimmer, and it took us forever to agree on a Speaker only to end up with Johnson(who has drank the BLM kool aid).I'm glad Trump won but have never been under the illusion that a second non-consecutive Trump term would be about huge changes.

Consider all of the demonstrably and objectively verifiable false information he spouts, and the length his followers will go to to triangulate between \\"he tells it like it is . . .\\" vs \\"what he really meant to say was . . . \\"So the problem this leads to is that calling out bullshit is effectively pointless - because the truth value was never the aim. Now those statements get amplified, and rebound around the social media sphere, and engagement metrics ensure that bombastic content will travel around the world thrice before the fact check get's its shoes on, and it becomes virtually impossible to meaningfully engage with what is objectively nonsense (eg. Haitians eating dogs and cats).So combatting this requires, I would argue, at least 1 of the following options 1) a set of \\"captured\\" social media personalities who can keep the message foregrounded regardless of the (tv and newspaper) news cycle, 2) the willingness of the party to effectively lie, or simplify topics to the point of virtual nonsense, to capture low-engagement or low-information voters, or 3) voters not demanding ideal (or sometimes even good) candidates and enthusiastically and consistently voting for the least-bad option.","title":"Harris Tried to Win Over Republicans.

He's a convicted criminal and there's literally no doubt that he committed these crimes and even more.Voting for him last time could be chalked up to an attempt to try something new.  A different kind of candidate.   But after witnessing January 6th and being given insider information about him from people on his own team.  After watching people who are even worse than him hitch their wagon to him because of his clout and pull.   How is HE specifically so appealing/?Why did he win over Tim Scott or Vivek to Gabby Tulsi  who are ALL  Republicans and conservative but DECENT versions of it?No contact is 100% the way to go.   Absolutely.   And cutting off financial support,  YES.   You know why?    Because people who are fans of his are so stupid economically I can guarantee you what is going to show up after he takes office in January.      Many government workers and teachers etc who get government funded paychecks will file their taxes in February.   And so they will get their tax refund early.  I guarantee you 100% that these idiots will suddenly see an influx of cash in their bank accounts and  say \\"See,  once he got back in office my fiances improved.\\"I know someone I'm cutting off for exactly this reason.

So now they turn around and vote for him again?    No problem.   I'll just keep my money for me then.A lot of us have realized that trying to talk reason into someone who is willfully ignorant and votes for  HIM specifically,   is pointless.   They are also usually selfish people.  So the only way they are going to LEARN is to personally feel the effects of voting for him.

I already saw people on subreddits like r/financialindependence or r/fire (subreddits created by rich people for rich people who wish to retire early because they can) panicking about ACA going away.Imagine you live somewhere in America. You have a paid off house, 1 or more paid off cars, and have $4 million in the market. You are currently 40 and making $250 000 a year. Unfortunately, you have a chronic illness that requires you to take very expensive medications (that are currently covered by your employer plan). With the ACA, you can probably quit your job, take $160 000 (assuming a 4% return) as your income that your family will live on because while you were making that high salary, you saved very hard.With a household income of $160 000, any household comprised of 5 or fewer people would have exceeded 400% of the Federal Poverty Line (hence, they don't get advanced premium tax credits). Even then, if Trump and his Republican extremists successfully repeal the ACA, it is no longer a matter of how much insurance premium you will pay, but whether you will have insurance at all. You could be excluded due to pre-existing conditions, or the medication you use is so expensive that within a few years, you hit a lifetime cap.So yes, while ACA going away will hurt anyone on (expanded) Medicaid and anyone receiving subsidies on the marketplace, just because you don't qualify for these things doesn't mean you won't be affected.","title":"What a 2nd Trump term may look like for health care issues including ACA, abortion"},{"text":"Meanwhile, $DJT is on track to lose 20% of its value today.

And keynoted the conversation withYou take a solid flu vaccine  you dont think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona?Which the experts obviously said \\"no\\" to, but that closed the interview with the attitude that a vaccine maker thinks vaccine won't make an impact on COVIDAnd as soon as he left office he was calling COVID a hoax, implying at various times that it was either gone (thus no need to vaccinate), made up (you wouldn't vaccinate against a fictional virus), or mild (so not worth the intervention.) and spoke about increased vaccination and declining mortality as a hoax to try and make the Democrats look good. Undermining the utility.\\nAnd he's surrounded himself with antivaxers who are left to push their message under his camp without challenge. If he was pro vax he'd either contradict their messaging or instruct them to knock out off, or remove them from his platform. Not to \\"bring Hitler\\" into this, but Hitler didn't kill the Jews, he didn't open a gas valve, pull a trigger, arrest a family. He was just the party leader at the time, but it was his officers doing the genocide, he wasn't pro genocide at all, he even had Jewish heritage. You and I both know that statement is absolutely untrue.His VP elect, a man who's very likely to inherit the oval office, was spouting off about how vaccines do more harm than good during the campaign trail. And cited an unnamed mystery senator who's permanently injured because they recently took a vaccine.\\nAnd Trump has campaigned on a promise to remove funding from schools that require childhood vaccination... Those measles vaccines were real important when he was pandering to a community ravaged by measles, but suddenly they're unimportant.\\nAnd he's campaigned to ban adult vaccine mandates... Which aren't a thing outside of occupational hazards (eg TB tests, which end up being an innoculation, for elder care/hospital employees if they'll have direct contact with the sick/vulnerable)As recently as July he's repeating that vaccines cause autism.To his credit in 2019, he did sign an EO that ensured access to flu vaccines, and told parents in a high measles outbreak area that it was important to vaccinateAnd early in the COVID pandemic described the on development vaccine as \\"basically a flu shot\\" and when asked said he got his flu shot. And he's been reported to say in private that he's proud of warp speed developing a vaccine so fast but that he doesn't talk about it publicly because it's bad for the party. So truth be damned, party before public I guess.But that's on top of YEARS of shit talking vaccines...If I said \\"vaccines cause autism, vaccines are dangerous, vaccines hurt people, vaccines are full of terrible things, vaccines are safe, vaccines shouldn't be trusted, you shouldn't vaccinate\\" what was the tone of my message? Apparently you think I just said \\"vaccines are safe\\" while I read that as antivax.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"Marshalling resources and allies to the defense of a sovereign European nation beset by a war of conquest was a massive geopolitical success that reaffirmed the system of alliances set in place by the United States.

Housing prices are a function of supply and demand and the cost to build. Believe it or not, rent control and stabilization laws are theorized by many to inhibit new construction for fear of becoming part of the program, which the inflationnof operating costs outpase ability to raise rents to cover the inflation, causing a shortage in housing with open units jumping up the prices. Also, easing the ability to evict for non payment and recover damages would help as well. Some places, like where I live, it can take a year to evict people who aren't paying rent, landlords take that into consideration and jack up prices to make that risk worth it and cover expenses if they're stuck with a bad tennant.The harder way would be to fix the economy. Inflation has killed the buying power of the dollar. The price of housing isn't crazy when compared with gold, but the amount of gold your dollar buys is constantly dropping, making it more expensive to buy based on your salary. Stabilizing the value of money will help that, reducing unemployment would also drive up wages faster than inflation, making buying more affordable basedTennant. on your level of income.Also, rural communities in America are beautiful and often dirt cheap. Making moving to rural America more attractive will reduce the demand in cities, reducing the price and allowing people willing to move get cheaper housing. I'm looking for a second home in rural NY. I see a TON of houses in shrinking communities for under 125k. If you're willing to do some work, I see a reasonable amount under 75k. That's very affordable. It's just not in NYC or Boston or Chicago. We can start programs giving grants to purchase or renovate houses in towns or counties under a certain population, helping to stabilize communities and get people cheaper housing.None of that requires a recession","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"Ah, the classic 'we're angry for you because you don't know any better' approach.

Maybe part of the difficulty is the insistence that some things are inherently masculine and some things inherently feminine? Like everything I keep thinking to write here applies to both. A man defends the one he loves. And so does a woman. A man leads by example. And so does a woman. A man is emotionally available and honest with himself and others about how he feels. And so is a woman. And so forth.There are of course societal and practical differences between men and women, but saying a man has a penis isnt a personality trait like a man is kind to animals or a man is brave, both of which also apply to women (and to anyone who doesnt subscribe to gender norms, too).So maybe I should amend the Ted talk.

If they want to vote by mail, they can fill out their ballot and drop it in the mail or an official ballot box. If they want to vote in person, they have to surrender their ballot at a polling location. If they don't plan on voting at all, just throw it away.Of course, none of this will ever happen because Republicans rely on voting to be as difficult as possible; otherwise, they don't win.

As the greatest generation and baby boomers get closer to the end of their lives, more existing homes could become available. (2) Many of these houses were built before modern standards and building codes were in place, especially septic system placement, heating standards, etc. which were introduced in the 1960s and late 1980s. Whereas before then, a house could be built on top of a septic tank and an oil tank could be buried in a backyard, rules have gradually been introduced which do not allow that. While older houses with these structures were grandfathered in, buyers and sellers  are discovering they need to remove these old systems to be compliant with the new building codes. Rebuilding the waste or heating systems costs money and sellers will tack it onto their selling prices, others buyers will have to pay for it themselves after purchasing. Similarly, the Biden administration suggested a phasing out of gas stoves. Rejecting new building codes or allowing old systems to be grandfathered would allow the supply to remain high or increase. (3) Building materials became scarce during the pandemic, which increased housing costs for new builds. (4) In order to get a loan to build a house in America, you generally need to already be a builder or involved as an investor in a planned community. (4a) Banks and the government do not want to lend money to homeowners who do not know how to build a home as there are too many risks to insure. The federal government could offer specialized loans for new construction to non-builders. (4b) More land could be set aside for planned communities. If there is a planned community, it resolves the building insurability issue and the mortgage issue, as licensed builders are doing the actual building and homeowners can get a mortgage to pay for it.Demand problem: (1) Covid caused a lot of people to prefer to move out of cities and apartment buildings. Now that it is over, demand for existing urban housing could snap back. Similarly, a generational shift in attitudes could change the perception of which housing is most desirable. (2) I mentioned how important builders are to actually build housing. We need more of them and the federal government could incentivize their education through grants or subsidized loans. (3) Along with the building supply issue, we have access to a lot more timber than we have of lumber. Timber is fresh, unprocessed trees. They need to age for a year, get baked in a kiln, etc. before being processed into finished lumber. The government could incentivize the construction of new lumber processing plants or build government facilities and sell them off later. They could also invest in next generation projects such as Cross-Laminated Timber, a sort of cross stitched layered wood product which is stronger than steel. By incentivizing new lumber production facilities, they could increase supply, reduce demand, and limit price increases on new buildings.","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"70% of Latinos in north America are religous.

Now, about 40 percent of seniors do  mostly because they have other income that boosts their earnings above $25,000 per year for an individual or $32,000 per year for a married couple. Trumps idea is costly: it would reduce revenue by about $1 trillion over 10 years, according to estimates.

I certainly wouldn't say it's necessary for someone to make that choice, only that it's understandable and I can't blame someone for making that choice. If you cut them off, essentially you're forcing them to the other side, and unless one or the other extends the olive branch later, you've created a forever enemy.I don't really buy it.I certainly agree that there need to be *some* people publicly advocating for any cause, engaging in debate, etc. - I'm not disagreeing with that. I don't know how much it matters on an individual level what a given person's friends believe. And for the fraction of people who *are* available to be persuaded, I'm not convinced that in some cases, being cut off isn't that much less effective of a message than anything else.I can imagine someone refusing to associate with me over something I believe, perhaps something that I don't think deserves to be takenthat seriously. But if that did happen, I wouldn't react by saying \\"You're forcing me to the other side; you've made a forever enemy of me.\\" - at least not seriously. If I believe something, if I'm staying on one side, that's my choice I'm making; no one is forcing me. Maybe I'm not really reasonably available to be persuaded on that particular subject, and in that case it hardly matters whether that person would have cut me off or not. Or maybe I *am* reasonably likely to change my mind. In that case, yes, *someone* needs to be out there explaining why I'm wrong for me to listen. Like I acknowledged in the previous paragraph, that's important. But if I'm reasonable enough to be open to persuasion, I'm not going to say \\"Oh, this other person cut ties with me once so I'm never going to abandon my belief because of that.\\" If I have an attitude like that, I'm probably just determined to keep thinking whatever it is I was already saying, and just looking for some way to assign blame for my own choices.","title":"CMV: Cutting off family/friends over who they voted for is valid"},{"text":"If most of the European countries are so united to fight for Ukraine.
