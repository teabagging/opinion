The issue with that black and white thinking is that a lot of immigration is actually grey areas. For example: asylum seekers. These are not as Trump so often likes to refer to as escaped patients from a mental asylum. These are people fleeing violence in their own country that have a legal right and protection to enter our country for their safety awaiting results of their legal immigration that can take months or years to process. Under every previous administration and elsewhere in all of Europe those seeking asylum can remain in our country for their safety until a decision is made. Under Trump they have to remain in Mexico or lose any hope of asylum, and the border camps for those waiting are worse than slums. Rape is a daily occurrence. Children go missing. Another example: [Most illegal immigrants arent crossing the border under the cover of darkness, they are overstaying a legal visa.](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/686056668/for-seventh-consecutive-year-visa-overstays-exceeded-illegal-border-crossings) These are legal immigrants that are hard working, assimilated into society, and still pay more taxes into the system than they take out.

Thats less than 5% of the cases in their database, total. The remaining cases all involve U.S. citizens.What do those 68 cases tell us? First, it demonstrates that proven cases of noncitizen voting are incredibly rare. Even an organization engaged in a major effort to document voter fraud produced fewer than 70 proven cases of noncitizens who voted in elections in the last 40 years. Given that over one billion votes have been cast over that period in thousands of elections, the incidence of proven noncitizen voting is below 0.0001%.\\"Yes, 68 total cases, since the 1980s.

Does anyone actually think that this would somehow have overturned the government? no.Got it, you don't know the facts. You don't know them even through Trump openly and clearly stated exactly his intentions on Jan 6th in his speech. Trump and his personal lawyers, not Whitehouse lawyers, concocted a scheme to create false elector slates in 7 states. These fraudulent electoral votes were cast in order to deceive. The plan had been on January 6th to have Pence receive both slates of electors from 7 states. 1 declaring Biden, 1 declaring Trump. Pence would then throw out the votes from that state and continue counting. The result would be neither Trump nor Biden would reach the 270 votes required to win. This would mean the vote would be thrown to the state delegation, where Trump had the majority and would win. We know this from numerous internal documents, open statements made by Trump, John Eastman, and Rudy Giuliani as well as Mike Pence and his team of Whitehouse lawyers and may other internal personnel. The crowds had been there to \\"pressure the state delegation to do the right thing\\" and vote Trump despite him losing. This was a very clear attempt on our democracy. Now, what ended up occurring? Trump sent an angry crowd to the Capitol with the mission of we need to stop the steal and make Trump President. Trump likely didn't intend for them to break into the capitol, however, once they did, he didn't do anything to stop them for hours. Not only that, he directed them at Pence. AND he and his lawyers were calling party leadership trying to stop the certification and delay it further so he could have more time to... do what? Change the result of the election. \\nThis was an attempted coup. That's what occurred. The absurdity is the inability to understand that's what was happening. \\nbecause that is not how our government works. there are too many checks and balances for me to believe that anyone there seriouslyThe checks and balances fail when one party controls all the balances and decides to MAKE UP new Constitutional theory in order to give Trump immunity from the crimes he committed.","title":"CMV: Trump pardoning 1/6 rioters is proof that Trump and other MAGA leaders knowingly lied to the public about Antifa being responsible."},{"text":"Disgusting.

Let's look at just a few of them:1. Daniel Lewis Lee (January 31, 1973 C July 14, 2020) was an American white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and convicted felon. In 1999, Lee was convicted as an accomplice to Chevie Kehoe in the 1996 murders of William Frederick Mueller, Nancy Ann Mueller, and their young daughter Sarah Elizabeth Powell, during a robbery at their Arkansas home. While Kehoe was found guilty of the triple murder in a separate trial and was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment without parole, Lee was sentenced to death. Lee had previously served prison time for assisting his cousin in the 1990 murder of Joey Wavra.2. Wesley Ira Purkey (January 6, 1952 C July 16, 2020) was an American convicted murderer who was executed by the United States federal government for the January 1998 kidnapping, rape, and murder of 16-year-old Jennifer Long. Purkey confessed to the crime while serving a life sentence for the murder of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, whom he beat to death with a claw hammer in October 1998.3. Lezmond Charles Mitchell (September 17, 1981 C August 26, 2020) was a Native-American criminal who was executed by the United States federal government for the 2001 murders of a woman and her granddaughter in Arizona. The murders were committed during the course of a carjacking, and since this is qualified as a federal offense, Mitchell was tried and convicted in federal court. His case sparked controversy as the Navajo Nation tribe he was a part of openly opposed the government's plans for his execution, along with Mitchell himself maintaining he was involved in the murders but was not the mastermind behind them.I am happy that these people were executed, it is a good step of justice for the heinous crimes that they committed.","title":"So much of this seems vengeful: alarm as Trump recommits to death penalty"},{"text":"All societies [eventually collapse](https://youtu.be/uqsBx58GxYY) and either disappear, or rebuild in someway or another.

And the end result of our conceit and penchant to overrate our own abilities to know whats is fact from fiction, is that we have allowed fascism to creep its way into our systems.  Weve allowed it to corrupt the institutions in our country.  And it will continue because people, by nature, hate to look at themselves in the mirror and give an honest assessment. This country fought against fascism less than 100 years ago.  Direct children of those who fought are still alive.  And they, along with their children, have forgotten our principles.

Freedom of college meant no more Mass. I knew the routine. I figured if there was a God, and I was a good person, it doesn't matter what bureaucratic nonsense I followed. I was already a bit skeptic.In the decade+ since, among the the sex abuse scandals, Christian nationalism, evangelical influence, and blatant hate and hypocrisy, the Church as an institution served no purpose in my life. Seemed to me that most people who still go to Church did so for peer-pressure/cultural reasons anyway. When studying history, you see how clearly the Church was a means of control and power rather than one of commitment to ideals. There are definitely churches and people of faith who practice what they preach. Non-denominational, Episcopal, UCC, places like that. I walk by them and can see how welcoming they are. Half tempted to check them out for a boost one day. But in my eyes they're the exception to the norm.

From my first and second hand experience, I will offer you a unique perspective on why this is the case.Major genetic anomalies typically present after the second ultrasound, which happens between 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. The average person thinks that down syndrome is the worst case scenario in terms of fetal anomaliesthis couldnt be further from the truth. There is an entire class of cases which are referred to in the medical field as genetically incompatible with life (which includes cases where babies might actually survive several months or years in acute care, but will never go home), in addition to fetuses missing major organs like lungs or kidneys,  the list of problems that can be diagnosed at this point is essentially endless. And let me ask you this: is abortion a better moral option than forcing a mother to carry a fetus to term, only to endure months of invasive NICU care and inevitably be forced to elect to withdraw care or have two physicians sign off to do it without parental consent? Is that a better moral option? If the answer is no, abortion must remain an elective procedure through viability (at least 22 weeks, generally 24). The amount of suffering that infants, families, and providers endure because of religious parents or uneducated parents that chose to deliver those kids is unfathomable. My wife came home yesterday and said, and I quote: it was a tough day. The providers were basically torturing a kid we shouldnt be keeping alive, but the parents wont withdraw care. The parents were Catholic.

That's a huge upgrade from FPTP, which penalizes people for voting their conscience, especially when there's a wider variety of better options. I don't like some of the weird RCV outcomes that can potentially result from polarization, like the possibility of a popular 2nd choice candidate getting eliminated too early for not being enough people's 1st choice. Still nowhere near as disappointing as the crummy outcomes FPTP produces every time.Also, people are familiar with the concept from numerous existing examples of elections where you can e.g. \\"vote for up to three\\" candidatesAnd finally... it's almost impossible to \\"spoil\\" ballots with approval... users might make mistakes, but those mistakes can't make a ballot any more invalid than mismarking existing FPTP ballotsBefore this conversation, I was actually undecided on which of the 3 alternative voting systems I think is best.

They just say shit, shit that's obviously wrong or directly contradictory with the thing they said immediately before, and will say immediately after, it doesn't matter to them at all. Jan 6th gets to both be the FBI setting a pernicious deep state trap for true patriots, an ANTIFA coup attempt where they dressed as MAGA to fool the media, and an event where beleaguered innocent Americans simply tried to make their voices heard, a moment of true democracy in the face of a woke dictatorship. They say ANTIFA is responsible because it would be convenient if it were true in that very instant. Over the last few years, I think this narrative has died down considerably, as conservatives have mostly rallied to the idea that J6th was actually really cool and good, but it could be occasionally employed if speaking to someone with a low opinion of both ANTIFA and J6th. Think to holocaust denial, the deniers generally know they're lying and tend to believe something approximating 'the holocaust didn't happen at all/as stated by (((historians))), but it would be really awesome if it did.'

Some people are religious and find it to be a moral question, other faiths and other people do not see it the same way. There is some consensus of course, I think most people agree that we should avoid late-term abortions as much as possible, though some disagree on the exceptions. But on the matter of whether a fetus is a human at conception does not enjoy wide consensus and is practiced only by certain religions.   \\n  \\nWith this in mind, where there is not a moral consensus, I think there is still an obvious choice here. There is one legal option that uses the state to force people to do something that is against their wishes and moral framework, and a legal option that allows everyone to choose the option that aligns with their wishes and moral framework, and a third legal option that sort of compromises between the two. So to me the choice is actually pretty easy. Things like murder/theft etc aren't a useful comparison...because they already have wide consensus regardless of faith and also because they have pragmatic applications for society in general. A nation-state arguably needs to outlaw murder and theft in order to function. I do not think the same argument is as strong when it comes to unwanted children. Laws and ethics tend to overlap a lot, but I really hesitate to advocate using the law to enforce morality...when we are talking about a secular state the focus should be on providing a safe and stable society for people of any spiritual background. I do not believe we need religion to have morals...there are plenty of philosophical basises for morality as well. For these reasons, abortion should not be strictly regulated by the state.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"Lied and cheated and tried to steal everything?

The foundational beliefs that you're trying to use to come to a conclusion are intentionally designed to cause that dissonance. If you assume that the inherent value of a human being is derived from a soul and is blessed by God from the moment of conception, then abortion will always be wrong. If you hold that belief as objective, unwavering truth and consider everyone who doesnt recognize it is going against the natural order, then nothing will change that.Most of the questions you're having all come back to that conflict in some way or another, but they all have different specifics of how they relate so answering them all would be incredibly difficult. So instead, in order to change your mind, I will encourage you to recognize that your belief system is one of many and that they cannot all be true at the same time. You can absolutely choose to use those principles to guide *your* life, but do that as a matter of choice of which option you'd rather build your life around rather than because you believe it to be the objective truth. Other people have equal right to do the same, so when judging their actions, base your judgements of factors that are shared between all beliefs rather than relying on ones specific to your own. In other words, for any question where you have to rely on an assumption specific to your belief system (the existence and moral value of a soul) to judge the morality of someone else's action, you're looking at the wrong thing.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"Why are you playing the victim card al of the suddenBtw your free speech is not impacted you do know that right?

Turner, 48 U.S. 283, 461 (1849): **It is the cherished policy of the general government to encourage and invite Christian foreigners of our own race** to seek an asylum within our borders, and to... add to the wealth, population, and power of the nation.Even Justice Harlan who was unduly sympathetic to the plight of African Americans was extremely bigoted: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121505\\n For a century, the vision of racial equality expressed in John Marshall Harlan's dissent in *Plessy v. Ferguson* has captured the legal imagination in a way matched by few other texts. Even today, the symbolic power of Harlan's rejection of segregation of African Americans and whites in New Orleans streetcars is rivaled only by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech and Brown v. Board of Education.  **There is a tiny fault in Harlan's Plessy dissent, a slip**.  # After arguing that the government should guarantee \\"equality before the law of all citizens of the United States, without regard to race,\\" the next paragraph begins like this: \\"There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But by the statute in question, a Chinese can ride in the same passenger coach with white citizens of the United States, while citizens of the black race [cannot]....\\"  This essay explores Justice Harlan's attitude towards Chinese Americans in this and other cases in an effort to contextualize his *Plessy dissent*, and concludes that **his anti-Chinese attitude was reasonably consistent. Many scholars ignore the anti-Chinese language** in *Plessy* and other cases, making no effort to square his words with the idea that Harlan's view is worth following today.","title":"22 states, including IL, WI, MI, challenge Trump's executive order cutting birthright citizenship"},{"text":"This is trump weaponizing the government.","title":"A Trump Executive Order Sets Out What Could Be a Road Map for Retribution"},{"text":"This.

Look at it pragmatically: is there a option other than allowing abortion that's morally superior?First, lets take the following for granted, if you disagree with any of this then my argument won't work:1. Every pregnancy carries a risk to the mother's health, whether physical or mental\\n2. Rape is wrong\\n3. The government shouldn't force people to do things that put their health at risk.3a. This doesn't mean that a person who takes a risk (consensual sex) that they weren't forced to shouldn't be forced to live with the result of that risk (pregnancy). In this case the risk to the mother's health happened when she willingly had sex, the government didn't force her to have sex.4. People lie.5. Punishing an innocent is worse than allowing a guilty person to go unpunished.With that out of the way, and assuming you agree:What happens when a woman is impregnated by a rapist? We have to allow the abortion here, because otherwise we're forcing the mother to risk her health for something she didn't consent to. Maybe we can charge the rapist with murder (of the fetus). What happens if we can't identify the rapist? Still have to allow the abortion. What happens if the mother lies about being raped? How do you prove that she's lying? Even if the mother does a rape kit and they find semen in her, there's no way to prove it wasn't consensual, so it seems to me the only way to move forward is to both allow the abortion and also not punish the \\"rapist.\\"So then, the question on the legality of abortion isn't really a question of \\"do we allow abortion,\\" it's \\"do we allow abortion when the mother was raped,\\" because if rape-abortion is legal then all unwanted pregnancies will be referred to as rape-pregnancies by the mothers.Forcing a mother to go through with a pregnancy where she was actually raped seems extremely evil to me, though, and it seems impossible that a mother could go through that without any mental harm. It could be argued that a woman forced to carry her rapist's fetus to term is a psychological punishment being enforced by the government on an innocent.Now, God knows if the woman was actually raped, and He knows if the mother or the doctor or the rapist or all of them or none of them are guilty of murder, but I'd imagine that He's more than capable of punishing them justly and doesn't require the US government to do it for Him.It seems to me, that even if you're pro-life, the best course of action would be to allow abortion and let God sort out the details of fault and punishment, since He has a more complete picture of what happened and won't accidentally punish someone for something they didn't do. You could probably get away with an extra murder charge for a convicted rapist that causes a pregnancy that gets aborted, but I don't think that'd be able to change the legality of the abortion itself.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"I am not saying they are disrespecting my personal religious morality, I just think they have misunderstood the nature of my post.

I have never considered Antifa to blame, though I did see plenty of agitators in the course of the events. I am unwilling to say that this was anything more than a crowd that was pushed by social/group effects that eventually devolved into a riot.2. how long is the appropriate sentence for someone that:   \\nwas there  \\nfollowed the crowd into the capital  \\nwas not found to be violent by any evidence presentedBecause I think 5 years is plenty long enough.How about if they were shown to have been violent?  \\nShould they get more than 5 years? why?So this point is clearly that justice was not served and that even at the time of Trump's inauguration there were people who had still been jailed without trial for Jan 6th. which should be frightening to everyone.3. I have a hard time feeling like pardons for Jan 6th people are such a bad thing when I see constant cases where a violent criminal gets a lighter sentence than what most of these people have already served. 4.

I mean, if that's not fascism, what's missing? The trains?

Abortion is the early termination of pregnancy in which the pregnancy does not end with live birth. Abortions can be spontaneous or induced. A spontaneous abortion is what non-medical people call a misarrange. This creates one of the first problems with outlawing abortions, as sloppy and ignorant drafts can result in the outlawing of miscarriages, which would require additional stresses of requiring people greiving the loss of a wanted pregnancy only further heartache. Now, an induced abortion is the procedure most people think about, but even then it's misrepresented by anti-abortion groups. If the fetus dies, but is not expelled or is only partially expelled, the pregnancy continues. The fetus is again, already dead at this point, and now it's continue presence is endangering the life of the mother as it can easily turn into sepsis. Not to mention, the whole ordeal of delivering fetal tissue can be a traumaic experience in itself. So we can do an induced abortion to remove the deceased fetal issue. Which rasies a good point, if \\"abortion is murder\\" how could we be \\"murdering\\" something that is already dead. The reality is more that the \\"abortion is murder\\" line is a sweeping generalization meant to evoke a strong emotional response rather then accurate explain what abortion is. Now the difference between an \\"elective\\" and \\"emergency\\" procedure is that you can schedule an elective. Even if a procedure is needed to address a major life threat, as long as you can schedule it, it is considered elective. So often as when opponents represent \\"elective abortions\\" what they are leaving out is they are proposing that abortions only be acceptable if we wait for the last minute for a woman to die before we can try to save her. If we wait for that moment, there is a strong chance of permanent damage being done. There is no \\"risk-free\\" pregancny. Every pregnancy carried a potential risk to the mother's life, and while a pregnancy may seem uncomplicated throughout the months, there are a number of spontaneous complicatiioins that can occur during delivery. If a woman wants to continue a pregnancy, I am all for supporting her and giving her the resources to mitigate as much risk as possible, but we should respect it is her descion on how much risk she will tolerate.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"If he's anything like Trump's last USAO for DC, he won't bother prosecuting crime in the District, either. \\"Party of law and order,\\" my ass.","title":"Trump Installs Stop The Steal Booster To End Cases Against Jan. 6 Defendants"},{"text":"Not sure what fairy tale youre talking about butok","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"So suck his dick AND cradle the balls?

That's the debate here. It's not about religion. It's not about morality. It's not about the exact moment at which life begins. It's about women, and whether or not they want to be pregnant.

There are a great many non-religious people or people who have religions that do not oppose abortions where there is no moral issue so it is only morally wrong according to your interpretation of your religion. There are many situations where abortion IS necessary, regardless of your feelings on the matter. I for one (31F) have recently had to deal with an ectopic pregnancy. A fertilized egg implanted itself in my ovary and ruptured, causing me immense pain and put me at risk of death. I had to have an abortion to prevent myself from dying, there was no chance the fetus would ever have a chance to live no matter what happened. This is just one situation that highlights how dangerous and complex pregnancy is. But women are dying in similar situations to me because of religious morals being imposed. There are a great many people uneducated on the risks of pregnancy and the complications that arise in both the fetus and the mother that seem to think their morals and feelings on the situation are more important than people being able to make a choice for their health or safety. Also, logically speaking in a situation where some people believe in something and others do not, the best policy is the least restrictive. Allow abortions and those who do not want them can refrain but still have them available in case of emergency.

Believed as you do. I used to think a woman who pursued an abortion was selfish. \\nIn the subsequent years Ive reflected heavily on the core tenets of Christs teachings separate (as much as possible) from the dogma of Christianity far removed from its source. My ultimate thought on it is this. Jesus preached love above all else. Love for others even unto an unjust death. Each &amp; every person who has relied upon abortion felt that they had no other choice. It doesnt matter if other choices actually existed for them. At that time, they could not see any other option. They made a call that forever impacted their life, their own future. They carry that choice with them forever, sometimes painfully, nearly always secretly. Who am I, a simple human just like them who has also made impossible judgment calls, to judge them? They suffer just as I. They live just as I. It is a more loving response to recognize the difficult decision they made and simply sit with them in their uncertainty than it is to judge them and further isolate them. More than this, and on a more simple human level, abortions are a fact of our existence. They have been with us since the beginning and will be something we struggle with till the end. It is a more loving response to ensure bodily safety and security for the human we see than to judge them over a decision we did not. Only G_D can know a mans heart. It is a more loving response to ensure that the most impossible choices remain as safe &amp; protected as possible. To do otherwise is to force those decisions into closets, back alleys, &amp; dubious drugs. This invites more death, more suffering, more shame. More than this, we humans (according to the Bible) were given free will. Who am I, a man, to tell a woman that my free will is more right than her free will? Again, none of us can truly know the heart of another. I am not a woman and I cannot know the tremendous difficulty of her life, regardless of a choice like abortion. All I know is that it is a hard life for me, a man. If you are seriously trying to develop your heart &amp; mind (i.e. a bad-faith troll) I encourage you to forever work to shrink your personal pride &amp; ego and to replace it with love. Wherever you feel judgement for another human struggling to make their way through life, analyze that judgement. Turn it back on yourself and examine your own heart. It is, after all, the only heart you can truly know. Ultimately, the universe must lean toward love &amp; connection, otherwise love &amp; connection would fail under the withering influence of hate. We see hate attack love all around us and yet it survives. Meanwhile, do we see love go on the offensive against hate? I do not believe we do. Instead, it simply sprouts again between the cracks in hate. Focus on that. I fully believe that it is better for one of us to sacrifice ourselves for the rest, whether they deserve it or not, than it is to sacrifice others for our own betterment. Thats what Jesus did, after all.Edit: I made an assumption about your religion by speaking of Jesus. If I was off base I apologize.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"That's for you to decide, and I hope you would be willing to allow others the same privilege of deciding for themselves.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"He never will be respected by society as a whole, ever.That's just not happening.

I know it's a popular approach but it doesn't make any sense to me. Let me explain. \\nLet's assume that a fetus is equal to a fully fledged human being. If a human is not able to keep themselves alive, we do anything in our morals capacity to keep them alive. For an adult this means life support and potential organ donation. Let's assume the logic people use to argue that abortion is immoral is used for a person who needs an organ donation otherwise they'll die. \\nIn this line of argument, anybody who is a potential donor match should be forced to donate that organ since it's needed to keep that person alive. If that puts the health or the donor at risk, their living situations because they need medical leave after the donation etc. shouldn't be an argument, since it will save the recipients life. Their right to live should override the donor's right of freedom from bodily harm and their right of bodily choice. \\nBut we don't do that. We acknowledge that if nobody wants to donate to that person, even if they could, they cannot be forced to do that because that would be immoral. \\nThat is the true question of mortality when looking about abortions. Is it moral to force a person to donate their organs/health to keep another person alive? And if so, why do we only apply it to this specific circumstances where the donor is a women and the person needing it is a fetus? Why do you think that a fetus has more rights than any other human in its position? \\nIf it is truly about morals, then why isn't more effort put into finding a solution that doesn't depreciate any moral principle that is important? \\nWith enough money and effort, I am sure there could be a way to abort the fetus from the women's body without killing it and keeping it alive through medical intervention until it's viable. But nobody is asking for solutions similar to this. Instead billions of dollars are pushed into propaganda to tell people that women's basic rights are not as important as that of other humans. But only if that human is not viable because somehow in that case, we apply different morals then we would in any other comparable circumstances with an adult human. So is it truly about the life of the fetus?","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"He also Tweeted that the first thing he's going to do is buy guns.

Most would agree that babies deserve the same moral weight as an adult, so I guess that leaves us with a big grey area in the middle, sometime between conception and birth, where the embryo's potential for life is important, but not as important as the actual life of their potential mother.And there's the sticking point. How important is bodily autonomy? Certainly important enough to consider, weighing the pros and cons of whether abortion on the whole is immoral. You've got to find the line that makes sense to you.Just don't make the line conception. A fertilized egg is not a human being. Not even close. About a quarter of fertilized eggs simply fail to attach to the uterine wall, but I don't think you'll be crying about all the lives lost whenever women menstruate. Or if you want to talk religion, those little embryos in IVF test tubes don't have souls. There's no way.PS: You're not talking about laws here, but I feel like pointing out that laws banning abortion entirely are immoral anyway. Even if you believe that abortion is immoral, letting a potential mother die as a non-viable fetus rots in her womb is just wrong. You at least have to allow the doctors to make the medically necessary choices.","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"It's sad to see Theo fall in with that crowd, coming from where he came from.

Most women don't carry a baby for 7 months and then decide they don't want it anymore.  The only reason for an abortion at this point would be finding out the baby is a) already dead, or b) will not live for long (or in pain) if/when it is born or c) carrying the child will put the mother at risk (although at this age, they could probably be safely removed.)","title":"CMV: Abortion is morally wrong"},{"text":"I'm sorry.

I dont know your specific religion, and I dont want to make baseless assumptions, but if your holy text states that abortion is wrong, and you consider yourself a devout follower, then this view becomes immovable. Thats one of the challenges with deontological ethics.I can, however, share the reasoning Ive come to after being against abortion myself in the past. My stance now is based on the following principles:1. **Minimizing human suffering:** Reducing suffering as much as possible should be a priority.\\n2. **Uncertainty about fetal consciousness:** We dont know when a fetus becomes \\"human\\" or starts experiencing consciousness. Claims like \\"it happens at X weeks\\" often lack scientific consensus and can feel like Lokis wageran argument where the line is drawn arbitrarily without sufficient evidence.\\n3. **Acknowledging potential humanity:** While a fetus *might* be human, we cannot draw a definitive line. This uncertainty, again, aligns with Lokis wager.Based on these points, to fulfill the goal of minimizing suffering, we have to prioritize the life we know to be fully conscious and human: the mother. We are effectively weighing a potential life against a definite one.

The United Nations resolve to have Palestine partitioned into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem to remain as an international zone to be enjoyed by all religious faiths. This transfer is scheduled to take place on May 15th, 1948. However, just to put into perspective who controls the United Nations (UN), please be aware that the UN had no right to give Arab property to anyone, as indeed even though the Jews owned only 6% of Palestine at that time, resolution 181 granted the Jews 57% of the land leaving the Arabs who at that time had 94% with only 43%. Terror attacks against the British in Palestine continued. In fact during the summer, three Jewish terrorists, Jacob Weiss, Meir Nakar, and Avshalom Habib found guilty of an attack on Acre gaol on May 4th, were to be hanged. At the same time, the Irgun terrorist gang headed by future Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, were holding two British sergeants, Mervyn Paice and Clifford Martin, as hostages for the three Jewish terrorists. Indeed Begin stated, We will hang the British sergeants at exactly the same time as our men die. The executions of the Jewish terrorists took place, and the British sergeants were found executed also, hanging from two eucalyptus trees. Captain D. H. Gallatti of 23rd Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, cut down one of the bodies only to be seriously injured by an explosion. Unsatisfied with killing these British soldiers, the Jews had booby trapped their corpses.Interestingly, a popular British newspaper, the, Daily Express, carried as their lead story, a large picture of these soldiers strung up in the trees, but this front page has now been deleted from the Daily Express archives.

Hes repeatedly advocated for open border policies while the Vatican remains protected by a large wall.

If it's an incest baby, for example, with a high chance of birth defects from inbreeding. Would you rather the baby live in pain with a chance of death for as long as it exists?  \\nOr, one of my personal views, let's look at relative morality. yes, it's a specific example, not to be applied in all circumstances, but a valid one nonetheless. What do you do if a young girl of 12 is raped and now pregnant? She cannot take care of the child, and has to live with that trauma. Would you force the girl's family to adopt it, knowing the baby is a reminder of that experience? or would you put it into foster care, which is already overfilled and underfunded, to have it grow up without knowing its family, possibly stuck in a system that will never give it what it needs to thrive.

To me the entire question of abortion being moral or not relies on when a fertilized egg becomes a human being.The bible has passages that infer this happens during birth - the bible talks about the \\"breath of life\\" and implies that a fetus becomes a person during birth. There are verses that talk about God knowing people \\"before you formed in the womb\\" which is brought up by pro-lifers often, but \\"before\\" doesn't explicitly mean \\"after conception and before birth\\", just \\"before\\", as God knows what will happen.There are also passages that give instructions for an abortion to be performed in a temple (the trial of the bitter water) if a woman is suspected of cheating, she is supposed to drink water with sweepings from the temple floor. The idea is that if she is faithful, the baby will survive and if the baby belongs to another man than her husband, it will die. This is to be performed by the priest in a temple so definitely not seen as amoral.Even if we do go along with the idea of life beginning at birth, if we are strictly talking about biblical morals there are times when children were killed in mass by God himself. During the plagues of Egypt, the firstborn of everyone (even cattle) was killed by God. Another time God sends a bear to maul 40 children for making fun of a bald person.  \\nI think trying to get \\"abortion is murder\\" from a biblical perspective is tricky and not really clear cut.

Its now full on the Gilded Age 2 but this time the government has also turned to fascism. Anyone who speaks out against the ruling class is at risk of retaliation or gods forbid even worse if we do end up going full Nazi State.Unlike the Guilded Age, we just may well be looking at the official death of democracy. There may never be another vote to attempt to bring in a progressive president. That will eventually leave us only one choice. Once 95% of people are suffering, and can longer hide behind social media, TV brain numbness. Sports addiction and all the other little self-centered distractions people use to ignore politics and the evil things going on around them;  and it becomes obvious that the current state of corruption and greed is leading to the direct deaths of more than 10% of the population, the people will finally be shaken from their apathy and our only option will be civil revolution and or rebellion.It will require solidarity in a way this country has never really known. We could end the oligarchy today if people learned to be selfless for the short term in  exchange for the greater good down the road, but Americans dont think that way. American culture is about the Me and What can I get for the Me. It would require scores or even hundreds of millions of people to stand up and strike across the board. Shut down the nation. Force the oligarchys investments to tank. Destroy their businesses from lack of labor, lack of sales, lack of logistics. If even half of Americans could work together in a unified general strike we could bring the oligarchs to their knees and force the redistribution of wealth.A step beyond that is true outright civil war. The rise of a rebellion meant to destroy the assets of the wealthy. The eat the rich movement.

He did such a catastrophically poor job he lost the 2020 election because of it.Trump didn't have to deal with the supply chain crisis.Trump didn't have to deal with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the corresponding increase in the cost of goods by corporations (how that's not seen as a form of war profiteering I have no idea). The fact that democrats actually tried to do something about this and Republicans shot it down should've been criminal.Trump didn't have to deal with extremists literally carrying out an insurrection and maliciously undermining democracy for four full years.Trump didn't have to deal with extremists literally creating a false reality based on a lie, forcing tens of millions of Americans to believe it, and then force policy through based on those lies to directly undermine American democracy. There are literally states in the union that have laws based on Trump's lie about winning the 2020 election. These people live in an actual fantasy world and are forcing other people to believe in it. How insane is that? Like truly truly insane.Trump didn't have to deal with the fallout of a previous extremist president padding the Supreme Court with three extremist nominations, one of which was literally stolen from Obama and the last one was railroaded through the week before a presidential election. This court then enabled a corrupt ex president and allowed him to get away with actual crimes Scot Free.What trump did have was he inherited a good economy from Obama and had it easy. Just like he was born with a rich daddy and got everything he wanted  There is no fair comparison here. Republicans have notoriously short memories with extremely specific things they like to remember, while conveniently forgetting the sea of bullshit we all waded through together.Edit: Furthermore the fact that Biden is being held responsible for the increase in the cost of goods while corporations are literally making record profits is both infuriating and astounding. The fact Republicans worship these god damn corporations that are wildly taking advantage of them blows my mind, and is further proof that decades of Republicans gutting education is paying off. These people are too stupid to understand they're literally going after the wrong people, but still do it anyways.

Since then, Martin seems to have mainly done one thing: inform D.C. federal judges that the Justice Department is withdrawing charges against Jan. 6 rioters whose cases remained in the pretrial phase.\\n \\n Martin brings a deep involvement in Jan. 6 denialism to the job: Hes spent the past several years as a vocal advocate for freeing Jan. 6 defendants. He served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, a nonprofit that held fundraisers for Jan. 6 defendants, sometimes featuring President Trump. Hes also spread a popular right-wing conspiracy theory about the attack, accusing the FBI and Antifa of playing a role in storming the Capitol amid Trumps attempt to block his 2021 departure from power. On the day of Jan. 6, surveillance footage released by House Republicans shows Martin approaching the Capitol grounds, giving him full view of the unfolding insurrection. Around the same time, he posted on social media that he was at the Capitol. Rowdy crowd but nothing out of hand. Ignore the #FakeNews, he wrote. Theres no evidence to suggest that Martin crossed into a restricted area or into the Capitol itself.\\n \\n Now, Martin is in the unique position of being able to effectuate his project of the past several years by implementing Trumps blanket pardon and bringing the prosecutions of Jan. 6 rioters to an end.

I hurt a lot of people in turn as I grew older it was less overt, but still always boiling under the surface and I was constantly miserable, but that was frequently paired with cognitive dissonance in that as result of the abuse I was strong, and resilient. The only thing that changed anything was the birth of my daughter, in the months leading up to her arrival it wasn't uncommon for me to spend hours lost in thought. I questioned all of my beliefs, forced myself to relieve any instance of being smacked around over petty shit and asked myself when if that was my daughter and I was my father would I do the same, now that I knew the price that was paid?I decided that the only reasonable course of action was to become the father I had needed when I was a child. i can count on one hand the number of times I've raised my voice in anger at my kid, and I've apologized for every single one, and promise to to better next time... and actually do better next time.I've received comments about how well disciplined, thoughtful and respectful my kid is from people who then turn and tell me that I was far too permissive when they asked me how I did it.  My parenting philosophy is stone simpleEstablish reasonable boundaries, proactively instill the notion that actions have consequences and that one should always be mindful of how their behavior impacts others and that if I ever discipline, or reprimand her I would always thoughtfully explain why. (and i do mean thoughtfully, shit like \\"Because I said so\\" or \\"My house my rules\\" is fucking lazy, counterproductive and bad parenting)Beyond that I chose my battles carefully and allowed her to be a kid,  if she ever thought i was being unfair I told her she was free to challenge me and that we would have an actual discussion regarding the matter. The end result is that she can effectively police herself, because she was able to form a moral compass at a young age. She's not perfect mind you, she makes mistakes but in most cases all I need to do is glance in her direction with a look of slight disappointment and she will usually course correct on her own without further intervention. End result is she is a kind, thoughtful young woman, who isn't afraid to come to me with her problems or stand up for herself. TL:DR If you let kids be kids and treat them with kindness and respect, odds are they will grow up to be kind and respectful adults.

It is this big battle, but I dont think they realize that when they win this battle they just end up losing the war.What I am saying is, congratulations you have removed the voice of your crazy opponents where the fence sitters and centrist can no longer easily see just how nuts some of them can be. In doing so, you built an echo chamber that devolves into the most insane people on your political side posting their crazy thoughts on display for the entire world to see. It becomes so bad that it just makes the winning side of the censorship battle look a bit unhinged. Now your side just looks nuts because people can only view the mainstream political opinions of the other side that seem rather tame compared to what is said by anonymous users on social media.I dont agree with it at all, but if these big social media companies start censoring your political side just know that it will devolve into a megaphone for the absolute fringe lunacy of the other side.

I'm not saying any of this is right or wrong, I'm just saying what's happening and what some people are like.**Some people see politics as an extension of values. e.g. they might think that if you vote for a particular person that you share the values that they believe that person is espousing. And I think most people see a person's values as a core part of a person's identity. Politics in the US has gotten to the point where this is just a blanket assumption now made on both sides. If a blue state progressive leftie finds out someone in their personal life voted for Trump, to them that can mean that they have very very fundamental disagreements on not just politics but also core values that are central to one's identity as a person. The same in reverse can be true if a blood red evangelical Christian encounters an atheist. I think most people want to make friends with people who share similar values.You might have voted for him for reasons that you don't think have anything to do with your values (maybe you just thought he'd be way better for the economy for example), but to some people it's going to be enough that he didn't repulse you. If you want to maintain your friendships with these people, you need to understand that they might not think that you agree with them on what they might consider (unfairly or not) 'the basics', they might think you fundamentally disagree on extremely core values and that might make them uncomfortable with you. You'll need them to feel like you share the same values that they do and you'll also need them to feel like you've genuinely thought things through in making your choice at the election. You might not ever be able to convince them to be honest and if that's what happens you might need to find new friends that are more similar in thinking to you. I'm not saying this is fair or unfair, I'm just saying that if you're committed to trying to maintain these friendships, that's what you will have to do. You have every right to just not do it and cut them loose instead.I think the era of politically disagreeing while remaining friends (in the US) is coming to a close unfortunately. The left and right are increasingly not just disagreeing on how to solve problems, but even what is and isn't a problem. They are not just disagreeing on what to do with the facts that they are given, they are disagreeing on what the basic facts are.","title":"Feeling Judged by Friends After Voting for Trump"},{"text":"Including fucking treason and a coup.","title":"Axelrod: Trump learned from last four years he can get away with anything"},{"text":"Indeed.","title":"Musk's 'Fascist Salute': U.S. Jewish Establishment Failed Its First Test With Trump 2.0"},{"text":"That was quick.

They kept giving him more chances to \\"correct\\" it but I doubt that they ever got the entire truth out of him. In the transition period for both his first and second term, Trump and his people kept using unsecured email servers and phone lines. Trump definitely continued to use unauthorized  phones. He also wasn't cooperating with archiving rules and often had private conversations in person and on the phone with people like Vladimir Putin (who is fluent in English, so no interpreters needed) and refused to report on what was discussed  Presidents are supposed to keep their staff informed about private conversations with such people and involved in the discussion if possible.

It sounds like youre frustrated because, despite all the posts pointing out the wrongs of Trump and his administration, they dont seem to actually sway anyones opinion. It looks like youre feeling that these posts may just be feeding the divide, rather than making real change. And I hear thatit can feel like nothing is moving forward when were just pointing out the same things over and over again.But, if I may, it seems like there's a different way to look at it.1. Outrage Posts Arent Just About Changing MindsIt sounds like youre thinking that these posts should directly change peoples minds, especially those who support him or his policies. But, maybe its not just about convincing them. I get that it might seem like people who already support him arent listening to these posts. And you're right, they likely wontat least not right away. However, these posts do something else: they offer solidarity to others who feel the same way. It feels like these posts create a sense of shared purpose, reminding people that theyre not alone in their outrage. That feeling of unity can be powerfulit keeps people engaged and ready to keep fighting for change, even when it seems like progress is slow.2. They Build Momentum Over TimeI can see why it might feel like these posts dont change anything in the immediate moment, but maybe its not about instant results. It seems like theres a bigger picture here. Every post, every comment, adds to the conversation. It looks like, while one post alone might not change someones mind, over time, they build a broader awareness. It feels like these posts contribute to the larger movement, raising important issues and keeping them in the public eye, even when things feel overwhelming. Perhaps the power isnt in one post, but in the collective impact of many.3. Change Takes TimeI understand why you might feel that these posts are just venting frustration without seeing immediate change. It sounds like you're frustrated because it feels like its not making a difference, especially when everything is happening so quickly. But the thing is, political change often takes timesometimes a lot of time. Its hard to see that in the moment. Im sure it can be disheartening when the posts dont seem to lead to immediate results. But, in the grand scheme of things, these posts help keep the conversation alive and contribute to the long-term momentum that eventually leads to change. Its not about seeing a quick win; its about consistent effort over time.4. The Bigger PictureI know it might feel like these posts are just pointing out flaws, and it could seem like thats not enough to actually fight back. I can see how it might feel like all this outrage just fuels the divide, making things worse rather than better. And you might even feel like some people on the other side are enjoying the outrageliberal tears and all that. Its frustrating when it feels like its just a game to them. But heres the thing: these posts arent just about ventingtheyre part of something much bigger. Theyre a way to speak out, stay engaged, and keep pushing for change. It feels like these posts are just one part of a larger strategy. Theyre not the end goal, but part of the necessary steps toward shifting the narrative and building momentum for real change.In ConclusionI hear that youre questioning the value of these posts, especially when it seems like theyre not changing the immediate outcome. It can feel like its just an endless cycle of outrage that doesnt lead anywhere. But what if these posts are laying the groundwork for something bigger? Change doesnt happen overnight. It takes time, effort, and consistency. And even though it doesnt seem like much now, these posts are part of a long-term strategy to raise awareness, mobilize people, and shift the narrative. The real value might not be in the immediate results, but in the collective effort over time.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Let me just look up this guys background annnnnd hes a conservative columnist lmao.

They just went in there to yell shit and take pictures because someone told them they should be mad.I think the maga crew is trying to become some new woke group or something like that when they talk about all this corruption and try to deconstruct the methods of oppression they face. But theyre a class that hasnt faced much oppression in the past and is scared to learn from those who have, so theyre misguided and easy to manipulate.At the end of the day, if one half of the country is trying to murder the politicians from the other side, its never going to end well. Only when the people have connection and community to fight their oppressors hand in hand then there could be actual change.Losing an election and throwing a tantrum about it isnt that revolutionary. Killing the ceo of a company who has caused pain and suffering to thousands of lives is.

Approval is every \\"one person\\" getting exactly one vote (\\"yes or no\\") on each candidate for the office. It also has the advantage (aside from simplicity of explaining the outcome) that existing voting infrastructure doesn't have to be significantly changed in order to implement it.Also, people are familiar with the concept from numerous existing examples of elections where you can e.g. \\"vote for up to three\\" candidates. And finally... it's almost impossible to \\"spoil\\" ballots with approval... users might make mistakes, but those mistakes can't make a ballot any more invalid than mismarking existing FPTP ballots. But yes, there are arguments in favor of anything other than FPTP. Sadly, RCV still incentivizes dishonest rankings in some cases... which I find problematic. I'm much less happy with RCV since the recent French election fiasco (using a system functionally equivalent to RCV) that required a weird \\"pseudo-gerrymandering by party agreement to withdraw candidates\\" in order to reach a sensible outcome.

Ali handles the packaging and fulfillment for the latter. They also handle freight consolidation, both to the USA and for the final mile insertion to USPS. The volume of packages being handled almost certainly entitles Ali to have a negotiated rate with USPS.Lastly, some non-Ali sellers in China (possibly primarily on eBay) have been seen playing games to get cheaper shipping and to dodge any USA tariffs. I've observed packages being entered for shipment from countries which are listed as [least developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_countries).

This agreement is not selectiveit applies to everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community. If we truly value the principles of liberty and equality, then we must uphold the rights of all people, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.The social contract requires us to protect each others freedoms, even if we dont personally agree with or understand them. By failing to uphold the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, we violate the very principles that allow us to live in a free society. The suppression of one groups rights creates a dangerous precedent that puts everyones freedoms at risk. Today its the LGBTQ+ community; tomorrow, it could be you.Furthermore, the governments role under the social contract is to safeguard individual freedoms, not to legislate morality or enforce conformity to societal norms. As long as the actions of LGBTQ+ individuals do not harm others, their rights should be protected just as much as anyone elses. To deny them equal treatment is to reject the fundamental tenets of the social contract: justice, fairness, and the equal protection of all citizens under the law.In short, defending the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals isnt about agreeing with their choicesits about upholding the social contract and ensuring that the principles of freedom and equality apply to everyone.

As he wryly observed in December, [In] the first term, everybody was fighting me. In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. The president-elect was referring to the ever-growing list of technology CEOs who had made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home. But he could just as easily have had in mind the #Resistance media luminaries now seeking to mend fences, the swing-state Democratic senators backing immigration-enforcement measures they once deemed anathema, or the anxious foreign emissaries hoping that he can be talked out of walloping their economies with tariffs.Why do so many of the great and good now want to be Mr Trumps friend? One explanation is that his victory in 2024 was broader and more convincing than the one in 2016. This time, he won the popular vote by drawing in more working Americans of all racial groups, Hispanics in particular. Moreover, urban areas that were once Democratic strongholds gave him significant support.This broadened coalition, though, represents a change not just to Trump voters, but to Trumpism. To win in 2024, Mr Trump adapted his ideological formula just enough to capture a vitally important segment of the American elite.Thanks to surging inflation and illegal immigration, and with Mr Trump growing more moderate on key social issues, many socially liberal voters found themselves mugged by reality, as the conservative intellectual Irving Kristol once put it. Business leaders, investors, Silicon Valley moguls and academics who once considered Mr Trump beyond the pale began to reconsider his virtues. The result is a new Trumpian synthesiscall it Neo-Trumpism.This is a stark departure from Mr Trumps first bid for the Republican nomination. Then, he made restricting immigration the centerpiece of his domestic agenda. He jettisoned the free-trade internationalism of George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in favour of frank protectionism and a more overtly transactional approach to Americas global leadership. Whereas prominent Republicans such as Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan had pledged to reform old-age entitlements, Mr Trump promised to leave them untouched. To win over religious conservatives, he promised to advance the pro-life cause.Call this Paleo-Trumpism, both because 2016 is now ancient history and because this ideological synthesis bore a strong resemblance to the paleoconservatism of Pat Buchanan, the Republican rebel who campaigned on protectionism and isolationism in the 1990s, when neoliberal globalism was ascendant on both right and left.This first iteration of Trumpism fused together the GOPs evangelical base with the disaffected, secular working-class voters who swung Mr Trumps way. His ideas were also almost perfectly designed to alienate the educated upper-middle class, including Country Club Republicans. Perhaps inevitably, Paleo-Trumpism sparked a backlash from the progressive left, which consumed elite institutions and transformed the political landscape in sapphire-blue districts. At the height of the covid-19 crisis, censorious wokeism seemed to become Americas new civil religion, and Democratic presidential contenders raced to the left on policing, immigration, taxes, health care and the environment. Although the comparatively moderate Joe Biden ultimately won the nomination, he made common cause with socialists, Green New Dealers, anti-monopolists and racial-justice activists to form the most left-wing presidential administration in decades.The progressive overreach of the Biden years created an opening for Mr Trump, but an opening that was markedly different from what came before. He could shift his focus from appealing to the traditional Republican basewith whom his alliance was always uneasyto affirming the centres anger over Mr Bidens overreach.Take Mr Trumps efforts to moderate the Republican stance on abortion, a blow to the pro-life coalition. The Supreme Courts Dobbs ruling, which let states set their own abortion laws, buoyed Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections. As many had predicted, the end of Roe v Wade meant that pro-lifers now found themselves on the defensive, even in the reddest states. Increasingly, pro-life social conservatism has been giving way to a softer cultural conservatism that focuses on, for example, the excesses of gender ideology or the perils of social-media addiction.Then there was the Biden-era surge in illegal border-crossers and dubious asylum claims, which moved a large majority of Americans in a restrictionist direction. Though you might think this would be a boon for Paleo-Trumpism, what incensed most Americans was lawlessness at the border and the strain on social services from unvetted migrants, not the ethnic character of the newcomers per se. Indeed, much of the backlash against irregular migration came from first- and second-generation Americans living in overburdened urban neighbourhoods.The spike in inflation that followed the budget-busting American Rescue Plan revealed the limits of fiscal expansion and reminded American voters of the downsides of unlimited welfarism. Swing voters werent suddenly clamouring for entitlement reform, but they were more worried about the rising cost of groceries than the need for more transfers.Finally, Hamass October 7th attack on Israel served as a vivid reminder of the threat of terrorist barbarism abroad and, closer to home, the extent of anti-Israel, anti-Western sentiment among American leftists and in many immigrant communities.Paleo-Trumpism has thus had to make room for Neo-Trumpism: a more pragmatic, less ideological tendency that emphasises law and order, pro-growth economic policies, an assertive foreign policy, a more selective approach to immigration and vigorous opposition to the entrenchment of intersectional leftism in schools, workplaces and cultural institutions.On the campaign trail, these tendencies can coexist. When it comes to governing, however, there will be hard choices ahead, as evidenced by the ferocious row over H-1B visas that recently pitted Elon Musk and his Silicon Valley allies, who embrace skilled immigration, against MAGA social-media influencers, who vehemently disagree.There will, then, be pressure to abandon Neo-Trumpism, but Mr Trump would be unwise to yield to it. Not only is it what put him back in the White House. By expanding his coalition, and increasing its respectability, Neo-Trumpism gives its namesake an opportunity to forge a lasting ideological legacy.","title":"Trumpism is becoming more pragmatic, argues Reihan Salam [The Economist guest article]"},{"text":"and, have a constant stream of foreign visitors over, bonus points if they are from hostile regimes, and also bonus points for having a heavy duty copy machine in the room.  \\nJust don't you dare accept that $20 gift card!","title":"Trump grants temporary security clearances to officials who have not been fully vetted"},{"text":"Remember when they separated immigrant children from their parents and lost 1488 of them?","title":"Musk's 'Fascist Salute': U.S. Jewish Establishment Failed Its First Test With Trump 2.0"},{"text":"And speaks more coherently.","title":"Donald Trump Demands Apology From Bishop Who Hurt His Feelings"},{"text":"Who are you again?

I am neither a GOP'r or a Dem.  Unsure what \\"everything\\" entails.  Do you truly believe that only conservatives believe much information should be hidden?    have you been watching?  check out the votes on both side of the aisle on the \\"Patriot Act\\" since inception.  Long version, if interested:I'm not a blind category, as both the left and right want to put forth.  I believe in fullest transparency when possible.   I lean socially liberal, fiscally conservative, and believe in an Austrian economic model activated through Friedman-esque execution.  I believe crony capitalism coupled with soft socialist creep since the New Deal have impeded the free market in America.  I think the government getting into the student loan business in turn skyrocketed tuition.  I'm old enough to remember Bill Clinton (for whom I voted twice as a kid) stand on a dais and tell America that we were going to become an \\"Information Society\\" only to watch the earmarked education funds evaporate into inefficient entitlement programs while we offshored the information age - to the benefit of shareholder value and at the expense of two generations of citizenry. I understand and support the difference between biological gender and gender identity, and have no concern for one's sexual preferences so long as they are consensual and non-predatory. I have seen in real time what decades of orchestrated attack via drugs and the back-handed slap of the \\"great society\\" programs have done within my own family and communities of color at large. I think we should fix our legal immigration process, yet make it merit-based with limited opportunity for asylum, somewhat like Canada.  I would love to know the truth about JFK (and LBJ's involvement), and hope we receive full disclosure about alien life. Working globally in security I steadfastly believe China is our most dangerous enemy nation state and should not be a critical part of America's supply chain.  Also, I think all should have a meaningful conversation with someone who lived under communism as a citizen to understand why we don't want it, and why America made so many of the poor decisions it's made to try to stave it off.  I also support the oxford comma.","title":"Trump really going after Big Pharma"},{"text":"Yes but only half of those half that voted want to be Americans.

And the kid says, \\"I want a Coke, and if they don't have that, I want Dr. Pepper, and if they don't have that, I'll take a Sprite.\\"And explained it in a different way in 2 sentences:\\n RCV is saying, \\"I most want candidate A, but if they're eliminated, then I'll vote for candidate B, but if they're eliminated, then C.\\" And your vote will always come down to one of the 2 most viable candidates, unless you choose not to vote for either by not ranking them.Compare to approval voting: You can vote for multiple candidates. The candidate with the most votes wins.I'm not opposed to approval voting or STAR or RCV. I do have some minor questions or criticisms about all 3, but they all seem significantly better than FPTP. I tend to advocate for RCV just because it's already the most widely adopted and seems the most achievable step from what the US has now. People are automatically suspicious of a completely new process, even if it's infinitely superior. They sometimes use the \\"1 person, 1 vote\\" mantra to justify vote suppression tactics or to criticize alternative voting systems. I find it easy to explain that RCV doesn't actually challenge their deeply held belief in the fairness of \\"1 person, 1 vote,\\" but Approval and STAR have the more difficult task of getting people to let go of that belief, or maybe replace it with \\"1 person, 1 ballot.\\"","title":"Cmv: that USA should adopt preferential voting"},{"text":"So Trump is Fanta Orange?

Govt cannot be in the business of recognizing some categories and not others. We don't have any specific religious laws that protect BCAM for Buddhist Christian Atheist Muslim. We include all such affiliations under Religious Freedom. We might need a convention between parties to arrive at a consensus on how to word the Civil Rights laws to include \\"sexual rights and beliefs\\" but leave this generic to cover all beliefs including pro or anti LGBT. Public institutions cannot discriminate against people for their Beliefs, but can refuse to participate in activities. So if LGBT is recognized as a form of Belief then it is included under laws against discrimination by creed without having to name or recognize every type of creed. As for govt policy, the objective category of M or F as biological sex is based on neutral science. There are 6 karaotypes and these can be legally classified as predominantly M or F. Govt can make policy based on provable science, but the subjective internal affiliations and identity are personal decisions that belong to individuals outside govt jurisdiction. Govt cannot force anyone to recognize LGBT identities, any more than forcing people to endorse Muslim, Buddhist Atheist Christian or other affiliations, but can bar public institutions and businesses with public storefronts from discriminating against people based on creed including beliefs about LGBT, either for or against.","title":"Trump promises US gov will only recognize 2 genders.

I basically chose the most demanding field I could get into to land a good job once I got out.Part of this initial screening was ensuring you had minimal debt, because the concern was if you had a lot of debt, and got a job with a clearance, you would be susceptible to giving up sensitive information for money from malicious actors.And America said \\"hey this guy that owes an insane amount of money to the Russians is a good choice to have all of our secrets\\" not only once, but now twice.If I so much as took the wrong form home, no matter how simple it may have been or how little information it could have had, you'd bet there would be a very swift investigation at a minimum, and potential jail time in a military prison.

They are utterly unconcerned about the fact that the vast majority of CSA occurs in and around the home, typically by a family member or someone close to the family. They also don't care about the real CSA issues within the church, at all. Their opinions on childhood sex ed, which is one of the only ways children are given the tools to be able to communicate the abuse they might experience, should also speak volumes - they want to leave it up to the parents, who could very well be the perpetrator of csa. Would you trust a pedophile to give their victim the tools to communicate the abuse to others? They only care about children insofar as it advances their agenda of absolute control. Further evidence can be their screeching on about abortion and the life and welfare of the unborn 'child, ' and then at best they are silent on making sure that child is cared for once born.","title":"Tuberville says trans kids should live in fear of their parents after bishops Trump remarks"},{"text":"She was saying this before she got out too","title":"Convicted US Capitol rioter turns down Trump pardon"},{"text":"He was saying that his heart goes out to you as he places his hand on his heart and then extends his arm as if giving it out.","title":"It is just me, who doesnt think Elon is evil just autistic?"},{"text":"Federal agencies are under the executive branch, although there are some checks from Congress (sometimes by law, sometimes by norms).
