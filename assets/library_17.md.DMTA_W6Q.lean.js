The defense managed to derail the trial for an entire year with a motion to dismiss in Oct of 2023. The judge denied it, they waited the max amount of time possible to file for an appeal. In Dec, Smith requested SCOTUS hear the appeal instead on an expedited schedule, SCOTUS declined. The appeals court ruled in the prosecutions favor at the beginning of Jan. The defense waited a month and a half to request SCOTUS hear the case, they accepted and set the date for 2 months from then.

Learning to call a friend by a new name or pronoun can be a minor inconvenience. Its a bit laughable to think of this as  a Motivation, but I wouldnt discount it.Secondly, I think the human part of our brain that evolved to make decisions has such a heavy bias on having those decisions confirmed by the group. We desperately want others to validate our choices. That tribalism comes through in our brand, loyalty, sports team loyalty, etc. I have to believe to some extent that is at play here, watching any other people not adhering to the societal norms we do makes some people incredibly uncomfortable, because of questions whether those people have made the correct choices, picked the right life etc.Also, I suspect you get a notion of what a fair situation is as a child, and from that point, anyone getting any new rights or privileges is guaranteed to seem unfair at first glance, even if it is simply rectifying an injustice.

They don't have cash on hand.  They can't afford things now.  That's why the market's been flat or down for the last couple years.  If we're talking major price spikes, we're talking a further reduction of buying power, a further reduction of consumerism, a further reduction of sales of goods and services, and not just stagnation like we've had for a couple years, no, we're talking a full blown recession.Covid was a bitch of a time for companies.  Tariffs, ones like Trump's touting, will be worse.  It'll be worse because he's pushing the need away.  At least with Covid demand was always high, always pushing companies back into production, and there were sales on the back end of that production. With tariffs, there isn't.  There aren't customers who have cash.  Plus tariffs work both ways because foreign companies usually counter with tariffs too.  This means exports are hit, and again a reduction in demand, which is the opposite of what Covid had to push the market back together afterwards.  Trump is pushing economics in the opposite direction.  Companies can only raise prices to counter low sales to remain profitable.  So this becomes a 2x price hike, well, 3x technically.  One, they feel they need to pre-buy and hoard inventory which is wasteful.  Prices will go up.  Tariffs hit and continued buying is at higher prices, so sell prices go up again.  Lower sales due to customers not having cash to even buy anything pushes sell prices up again.What do you do as a consumer when everything's +50%, +100%, or +150%?  How do your spending habits change?  How do you afford anything?  THIS is the chaos Trump brings with these stupid ideas.  This is what, unfortunately, the poor of the society voted for, a man that's about to tariff your buying power out of existence, a man that's going to take all your money in...taxes, that precious thing you voted against.  \\"Stop taking my money!\\"  He took your money the first term.  He was estimated to have privately pocketed more than $8,000,000,000 (that's the right number of zeros) through the first and second campaigns and during the presidency.  His original tariffs forced you to pay billions a year, every year since, on goods.  His terrible choices during Covid help pushed the epidemic worse and drive up costs of goods by +100% or more.  And now he's talking mass tariffs which is TAXATION, a money grab pure and simple.  The man is a grifter, a con man, and all he ever wants is your money.  Well now he's in a second term ready to take everything you've got left.Because it's not just income based hardship.Housing and healthcare are big cost factors too, sometimes the biggest in a person's life.  While Kamala and Biden have been pushing down drug prices and Kamala was running to continue that and to improving housing costs, acts that could have saved you $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 personally, each, in around 25-30 years, Trump wants no such things for you.  Trump and Republicans are pushing to re-privatize healthcare, making costs and insurance skyrocket.  Trump has no interest in improving housing and rental situations, nor fight foreign investors like Kamala, so that's just going to keep getting worse for you.  In comparison, right now, it's estimated Trump's actions will cost you around $1,000,000 in the same 25-30 years.  Kamala was literally handing out a winning lottery ticket to everyone.  Trump is looking to take everything you've got.I really, really hate the stupidity of ignorant people, just throwing their livelihood away voting for a con man, gleefully.  Wow.

Trump did not happen in a vacuum. Trump did not by himself incite the people who rioted  into action  on that day, but he was an undeniable part of it for his entire presidency and being that he was president it is entirely reasonable  to gather that \\"give them the kind of boldness the weak ones need to take back our country\\" might have some deeper implications than a simple peaceful protest. Which it did. Trump incited a riot. Fox news helped incite a riot. Foreign disinformation campaigns that the Trump administration knowingly undermined the knowledge of  inspite and to spite US intelligence helped incite a riot at the Capitol.Trump might not be particularly intelligent but he knows he can't say storm the Capitol  with rifles and take them by force  to stop the destruction of our country by radical liberals. There is no deniablity. There is no way someone who self identifies as not a Trump fan as you do to come and defend that rhetoric as a protest. Trump not only incited  a riot at the Capitol to override the election but he enabled it during  by not stepping up or stepping in, actively interfering with the response as much as he could, then later downplaying the event, and his responsibility for it,  denting it with various inherently contradictory, mutually exclusive  or outright fabricated narratives. Such as, That it was a peaceful protest, an antifa false flag, fake news, not that bad compared to BLM, a day of love, a rightful and just  act due to a stolen election.It was not a protest. It was a largely  impotent but still meaningful and dangerous   attempt to overturn or obstruct the election because it did not go his and \\"their\\" way.This doesn't even touch on the fact Trump and the right wing  media behind him, preemptive to his now on some level impressive and  to many unexpected victory in 2024  already prepared and primed many people to question the election results and frame it as being stolen or cheated without any evidence or results for that may yet, for the prior conspiracies. Nor does it touch in the other ways Trump tried to overturn the  2020 election results, like calling the secretary of state of Georgia to pressure him to \\"find\\" votes to flip the state.Trump has never shyed away from aggressive and borderline if not  outright  violent rhetoric. It's only gotten worse, but he did win and so I suppose on some level Americans don't consider it a big deal or they support it. You don't get to send a mass of people to the Capitol during the certification of the election as president , based on an entirely fabricated narrative of radical extremists rigging the election  and hold no responsibility for the violence that resulted. You do get to be reelected as POTUS though.

I was just giving my opinion which is just that an opinion. So I apologize! See I grew up in an extremely strict dispensationalist church. That form of organized Christianity made me dislike God. I toally understand. I ran away from God as fast as I could but He never left me. It got dark and I saw things that made me believe in Jesus even more, but I still strayed. Just in the last 2 years I chose to give my heart to Jesus after I should have died 3xs but didn't. I decided to read the Bible for myself. Man was I shocked. They leave out so many things in churches. I actually don't go to church myself. But I do believe in going and that not all are bad, but I have a \\"scar,\\" let's say. I went to church more in those original 8 years of my life than most people their entire lives. What it's hard is my Dad is still in this \\"church.\\" I try not to say cult. The people were amazing...it is the doctrine that is so crushing. So maybe I can get defensive and I apologize for that. See having other Christian's condemn you and then people who don't believe too. Well I just try to stand up for my faith. If it wasn't for Jesus my life would be darkness and death. I just wanted to point out the Bible is more than they made it out to be and that some pick and choose what to believe from it. However when I read it I saw it completely different, especially Jesus. He died so that we all could be saved that is very important to me.I also don't back state mandated Is(not)real. The Bible talks about the Israelites ALOT and what they did. When I truly understood who crucified Jesus I was like WHAT!?!?! So I like to recommend reading the Bible to Christian's as well bc many of them just believe what they are told it says. The Bible also says to test the spirits and if they don't fall in line it isn't Biblical. Many churches don't do this either. So my last opinion is that man corrrupted church and the Bible teachings for control. The whole system in America has corrupted almost everything. If anyone does choose to read the Bible, there study tools like Bible Hub. Online or the app, it's got all translations including the Greek and Aramaic. Anyways, thank you for taking the time to respond and again I ask ya to forgive me for stepping on any toes. I get worked up about it. Have a blessed day to you and any who read this!

Human history and our species development can almost single-handedly be credited to our partnership with horses. Do we want to be a species that uses something up and throws it away when it no longer serves our purposes? Is that really the wisest thing to do? And if so, what does that say about us, as Americans, and as human beings? I get that this isnt a popular opinion, but basic morality isnt popular these days. We dont even have a consensus reality anymore. But we know so little about our world and we think we know so much. Many tribal nations maintain that horses are a keystone species and considering how our science consistently seems to be aligning with oral histories, I think we should listen to them.","title":"Do you agree with Trumps decision to legalize the sale and consumption of horse meat when he returns to office?"},{"text":"More unemployment.","title":"Trump reportedly plans to kick trans troops out of the military within days of inauguration | The Independent"},{"text":"Which is why he was never fit to lead America","title":"Donald Trump Thinks He Wont Have Enough Power"},{"text":"Trump campaign broadcasts were COVERED with ads for shifty meds.

A lack of any conviction is enough for these people to say \\"well I guess he was innocent else any of the trials would have gone on and shown him guilty\\" as most people don't understand and aren't on top of all the legal hurdles with the appeals and SCOTUS rulings.

As a president, Biden was much more effective than Carter, he made sure Ukraine had the funding they needed and stood up to Russia, passed a huge infrastructure bill, inherited an economy ravaged by COVID and turned it into one that outpaced almost all of Europe in terms of growth, partially with his stimulus. Passed the largest climate law in world history, protected marriage equality with a law, passed the first gun law since Clinton, nearly passed bipartisan immigration reform, correctly called out trump as an authoritarian and fought for a womens right to choose, capped insulin at 35 dollars, and did a ton of small executive orders.For comparison, Carter achieved almost nothing despite controlling both branches of congress with bigger majorities than Biden had and failed to deal with a hostage situation.Also thanks for actually addressing the point about Carter.

He went through an energy crisis and a recession, and there was a hostage crisis and a failed military operation. These are all things he theoretically had the power to deal with better. If you compare against Biden - well, economic performance is pretty great at the moment. Sure it still sucks for lower earners, but it always does, and Biden never promised to fix that.

There's also the Safer Communities Act for background checks for gun ownership, which is very popular in the anti-gun violence lobbies.The only problem with Biden is many of his successes are just very boring, like the infrastructure investments he's committed to. They're not exciting like hostage crises. They're just quiet, competent moves to a better America. They don't get much coverage in the news, but they help millions of people.If your biggest criticisms of him are Jan 6th, which had basically nothing to do with him, and Roe v Wade, which was a deliberate partisan move to attack democrats and women by Republicans, using the Supreme Court which Biden literally cannot influence, then I think you need to reassess how you're researching and judging your politicians.Good politics is boring.

Similarly, the revitalization of NATO in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is all him and all upside. The flailing alliance struggling for a purpose and filled with nationalistic idiots unified and expanded under Biden's guidance. And they did this while turning one of their two geopolitical rivals into, as the joke goes, the second best army in Ukraine.All of what you said is true, but Ukraine can still lose. Ukraine's manpower is limited, and the military aid they're getting is at the mercy of donor nations (who could decide to reduce or stop it).

It was orchestrated by his predecessor before he became president and he had no leadership role in the count. That would be like if historians had blamed Abraham Lincoln for James Buchanans inaction during the civil war. The point about the debate is true, however historians will probably still view him as a decent president, that was a failure as a candidate and not as potus, generally historians are pretty good at separating someones lives outside of their job from their administration (hints why historians rank Clinton so favorably). There are other criticisms of Biden like the Ukraine war, but he united congress and Europe around funding Ukraine and punishing Russia. If historians dont blame Truman for the Korean War starting while he was president why would they blame Biden for the war in Ukraine when he didnt cause it. We had been in Afghanistan for 20 years and most people seem to think that we needed to leave. The failure of that war will factor more into George Bushs legacy since he created that mess and left every other president in a no win scenario. Biden just pulled the plug on that conflict when trump and Obama wouldnt. I dont really think him likely being incapacitated in office will be as big as a stain on his legacy as people think it will, Woodrow Wilson had a debilitating stroke that stopped him from operating at full capacity and yet historians rank him well. FDR who is ranked the 2nd or 3rd greatest president by historians died of illnesses that he hid from the public and made it impossible to work full days towards the end of his life. Additionally, its possible (but far from confirmed) that Reagan had mild cognitive issues at the end of his term and he is ranked well by historians. As a president, Biden was much more effective than Carter, he made sure Ukraine had the funding they needed and stood up to Russia, passed a huge infrastructure bill, inherited an economy ravaged by COVID and turned it into one that outpaced almost all of Europe in terms of growth, partially with his stimulus. Passed the largest climate law in world history, protected marriage equality with a law, passed the first gun law since Clinton, nearly passed bipartisan immigration reform, correctly called out trump as an authoritarian and fought for a womens right to choose, capped insulin at 35 dollars, and did a ton of small executive orders. For comparison, Carter achieved almost nothing despite controlling both branches of congress with bigger majorities than Biden had and failed to deal with a hostage situation.","title":"CMV: As someone who would have voted Democrat if I were American, Joe Biden's historical legacy will be like that of Jimmy Carter, if not worse."},{"text":" This administration has turned this world upside down, so now Im being attacked, Homan said.

The only places where it showed any benefit at all are areas [where there is a high prevalence of parasite infection in humans](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/18/ivermectin-may-help-covid-19-patients-but-only-those-with-worms), third world countries where a lot of people have worms.     \\nThe conclusion that doctors and scientists came to is that treating a person's worm infestation helped them with their Covid infection only because it was a comorbidity - if you reduce somebody's co-infections or address their other health problems of course it'll help them get over a virus faster. There is SO MUCH real &amp; valid information available now about these so called cures that Trump was touting back in 2020 - the scientific community has done their due diligence and proven that these things are NOT effective and can even be dangerous.    \\nI wish these people would STOP listening to self proclaimed health gurus and conspiracy theorists on YouTube and try reading a medical journal written since then instead.","title":"26 tweets of Trump about hydroxychloroquine.

Why would the government have more interest in straight than gay marriage without there being a biased agenda?You say \\"their interest was focused on relationships that supported reproduction, family stability, and the economic system\\" but what if heterosexual couples didn't want (or couldn't have) children and what if homosexual couples had (for all intents and purposes even if didn't create themselves) children, what if homosexual couples looked after children with better stability and economic systems than heterosexuals? And what if the government didn't care about any of there things?Your argument is flawed under the bias of a) assuming that heterosexual relationships are better in these aspects and b) making assumptions about what the government cares about. Furthermore, governments in democratic societies are generally formed by their peoples opinions and not entities with separate agendas - the society as a whole contributes their interests to government. Legal recognition, therefore, implies social recognition and vice versa.Why should the state reward heterosexual marriages with privileges like tax benefits, inheritance rights, healthcare provisions, and other legal benefits but not homosexual ones? How is that equal? How is that fair? You dismiss these things are bonus benefits, when they are essential important things to living a happy and healthy life - basically considered human rights.You also say?they always had the 'right to pledge love and fidelity' to each other as if that's what they wanted the whole time?

But, also, you're forgetting the extreme violence and discrimination against homosexuals who did indeed do what you ask by just pledging their 'love and fidelity' to each other.

Most Indians stayed in one area.   A few tribes in the southeast were overwhelming agriculture, but for most Indians hunting and gathering was a mainstay.  They did not do animal husbandry, which allowed Europeans to live on far less land. Many tribes had so called *hunting grounds,* their larder.  If you compared 500 European colonists and 500 native Americans, the latter needed about 20x as much land to live on, except in places like the Pacific NW next to salmon runs.  Indians got very territorial to other tribes, e.g. \\"Pass through our hunting grounds... you better do it quick...if we catch you hunting, you're dead.\\"   Hardly unique to native Americans, most tribal peoples were like this historically.  Papua New Guinea's tribal peoples are still fighting.  So tribal peoples might have been light on the land, but they were rough on each other.

Because they're different things. A couple becomes de facto automatically generally if they've been living 3 or more years together (depending on where are) but recognition and rights of it vary depending on where you are. Most de facto relationships are considered to have lesser rights than marriage. Whereas marriage generally provides legally clear and protected tax benefits, inheritance rights, spousal support, legal protections, and more.Furthermore, marriage (which requires a formal ceremony and legal registration) provides a level of social and cultural recognition that the automatic de facto doesn't. It is also an active commitment and decision, whereas de facto is something that accidently automatically happens regardless of whether you want it or not.If you argue the point of it for same-sex marriage, then why not argue it for heterosexual marriage? If you argue there's no point in marriage for same-sex couples, then shouldn't it be the same for opposite-sex marriage? Then your argument should be more about marriage as a concept being entirely pointless rather than targeting a non-heterosexual group? Your point about friendship and polygamy is ridiculous too, they're both very different situations to marriage (or even de facto) between two people who romantically love each other and are physically attracted to each other. Homosexual marriage is far similar to a heterosexual marriage in substance than it is friendship or polygamy.","title":"CMV: the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage is fake"},{"text":"White people in military ads, we getting conscripted fellas","title":"Anyone notice the increase of propaganda ?"},{"text":"They just re-bleat what they've been told to.","title":"This is why I like Trump"},{"text":"But...why?","title":"Donald Trump to kick transgender troops out of US military"},{"text":"Same sex couples were denied privileges by the state that were granted to straight couples forming the same types of committed, loving unions with the same ranges of goals and intents. This is discrimination purely on the basis an individuals sexual orientation, which I object to on a human rights basis. The recognition by the state should be equal and offered the same way for gay couples as straight couples. I agree, the question of heterosexual couples without kids is irrelevant because the state doesnt make that consideration at all when formally recognizing their marriage or granting them benefits for that recognition. You brought it up though, so I wanted to make it clear that gay couples get married with the same intents to start families as straight couples, so even though you mention it it is not a legitimate basis to exclude gay couples from state recognized marriages. Finally, just to make my point crystal clear: I believe that a state discriminating against people based on sexual orientation is a violation of human rights, thus a state refusing to recognize the union of gay couples that can be identical in every way to a straight couple EXCEPT in the gay/straight dichotomy in the same way the state would recognize the union of the straight couple IS a human rights issue and is morally wrong.Edit: and to pre-empt a counter-argument: I also consider anything remotely resembling a separate but equal doctrine (i.e. whatever alternative method gay couples might go about trying to enshrine their partnership with weird contracts you keep alluding to) a clear human rights issue/violation as well. They must have access to THE SAME legal processes,  protections, and benefits straight couples do.","title":"CMV: the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage is fake"},{"text":"big fan of the dude, sadly gone","title":"John Mcafee website update"},{"text":"uh excuse me sweaty - have u not heard of deflationary spirals?? ??","title":"44% think Trump will make food and grocery prices go down"},{"text":"TrUmP hAd NoThInG tO dO wItH PrOjEcT 2025 !!1!!1!1","title":"Trump taps Russell Vought, key Project 2025 architect, to lead budget office"},{"text":"I live close to the German-French border and here, its pretty normal to eat horse meat.

I think what most people are really pointing out here is that marriage is institutionalized by the state and that it has legal and economic factors tied to it. Now, as someone who is in a same-sex marriage, I would say that ideally any material benefits should just be extended to people regardless o of whether theyre married. But the reality is also that marriage is institutionalized and it does confer material benefits. And Ill be honest, based on the tone of your post, it sounds like you want marriage to be a legally privileged relationship but one that can only be between a man and a woman.?Now, you gripe about activists forcing their position onto the rest of society. But this is how political battles are won. At the end of the day, youre not actually against the fact that marriage has to be redefined legally but that it is being redefined in a way that you dont like. Moreover, human rights are political. Often, whose rights get protected and whose do not reveals the political nature of human rights, whether nationally or internationally.?What constitutes rights and who gets them has always been politically contested and probably always will be. The mistake you are making in arguing that human rights are apolitical is that certain conceptions of rights have become so societally engrained that they are viewed as natural or neutral. Instead, this was a matter of extending privileges to communities that historically did not serve the same societal functions as heterosexual marriages.??Here you seem to be referring to having children. And while marriage has been important for the purposes of reproductive labor, marriages have often occurred for political reasons (alliances of some kind) or for economic reasons (childbearing has often been about economics and property). This was not a fight for rights but a fight for the redistribution of privileges, calling into question the fundamental justification of this false fight for equality.I don't really understand why this is an issue. Aren't concepts like equality or equity all about the redistribution of privileges so that more people have access to what was initially granted to a select few? Given how you are talking about this, you could apply it to other things, like voting (at least in a US context), which at least initially in the United States was a privilege only afforded to white, landowning men.","title":"CMV: the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage is fake"},{"text":"A rare sign of a functional brain.","title":"AntiTrump Resistance Movement Facing Post-Election Disillusionment with Activism"},{"text":"Trans Rights Activists/Activism.","title":"How are we enjoying being back on The Trump Cycle?"},{"text":"Shouldn't they have already done that for her security clearance?

What they lacked was formal recognition by the state, which historically had its reasons to recognize heterosexual marriages, reasons that varied across cultures and centuries but were ultimately tied to societal priorities like reproduction, family stability, and economic order.The point isnt to debate why the state historically recognized heterosexual unions, only to note that this recognition was based on its perceived societal utility, not as a validation of love or commitment. Same-sex couples, like all individuals, were free to form relationships and even use legal tools to formalize aspects of their lives together, such as property agreements or inheritance rights. What they didnt receive were the additional privileges and incentives tied to state-recognized marriage, which were designed to encourage a specific societal structure.The mention of heterosexual couples without children is irrelevant. Those unions still fit within the traditional framework of marriage that the state prioritized. Same-sex relationships, by contrast, were not excluded because of individual circumstances but because they fundamentally didnt align with the traditional rationale for recognition.This wasnt a denial of human rights. It was an exclusion from institutional privileges, which reflects political priorities, not a breach of fundamental freedoms. The fight for same-sex marriage, then, was about forcing the state to recognize something it had no reason to recognize, not restoring a right that had been withheld.","title":"CMV: the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage is fake"},{"text":"Trump promised these same things earlier this year in [his interview with Time magazine](https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/) about what a second Trump term would be like.

If Christianity were truly different than what the masses believe in or what you call  \\"organized Christian religions\\", it would be inconsistent with the nature of God to intentionally obscure it. According to Christian doctrine, God desires for all people to come to know the truth and be saved. Why would He create a religion that misleads the majority, only allowing a select few to grasp the \\"real\\" Christianity? If the real truth was hidden for most of the world, it would contradict God's nature as loving, just, and desiring all to find salvation. Because most people are born into this \\"organized Christian religion\\" and don't know any better or have not seen any better.2: I said it in the end of my post, I believe the elite worship the devil. Therefore they have to mock God. That does not prove the existence of God. If I have person A who believes Cats are Gods and person B who thinks dogs are Gods and they get mad and stab each other for it it doesn't mean any of their beliefs are true. I think they're mocking God because the Christian and Islamic God did such a good job at shaping peoples morals they want to reshape them again.3: again what I said at the end of my post, they worship the biblical accurate devil. But worshiping something doesn't prove it's existence. Maybe they actually believe he exists, but that doesn't mean he does.I don't feel the need to answer the rest as I don't believe in the Bible so using biblical stories to defend your claim doesn't do much to a non-Christian (me).

Marriage as a concept is fundamentally about two people pledging love and fidelity to one another, and that doesnt require the states validation to exist. A couple can live as married in every practical and emotional sense without government involvement. So, to say if the marriage isnt recognized, it isnt a marriage is just wrong.The rest of your points hinge entirely on the idea that legal recognition creates marriage, but thats just not true. Formal recognition is about granting legal benefits and privileges, not defining the relationship itself. Yes, shared bank accounts, tax benefits, and other perks are tied to formal recognition, but those are institutional incentives, not the essence of marriage. They reflect what the state finds useful to promote, not whether a relationship is real.And about kids being born out of a non-marriage relationship, what difference does that make in a practical sense today? Legal recognition doesnt change whether two parents are committed or capable of raising a child in a loving, stable environment. What matters is the relationship between the people, not the stamp of approval from the state.Ultimately, your view puts too much weight on the states role. People can and do live meaningful, committed lives without the government stepping in to officiate it. Legal recognition is just that - recognition, not validation.","title":"CMV: the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage is fake"},{"text":"Welcome to four years of threads with this shit. \\nYou voted for it.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene threatens funding cuts to sanctuary cities and NPR with DOGE committee"},{"text":"We have been in total propaganda immersion in America since I was old enough to remember.

Many states formally recognize two peoples rights to select each other as a partner for life and have their union formally recognized by the state. It also grants certain benefits to that union to facilitate the sharing of the two peoples lives together. Many gay people fall in love and pick a partner the same that straight people do, and many, myself included, believe they should have the same rights to have the state formally recognize their partnerships as us straight people do. In regard to relationships that facilitate reproduction, if thats how you feel the state should recognize unions then the state shouldnt recognize any unions until they take shared custody of a kid. Many straight people get married and never have kids. Should they be hit with fraud charges if they do? What about old people getting married or remarried who are too old to have kids? If the only reason the state recognizes marriage was for the purpose of starting a family (its obviously not), shouldnt the state only confer those benefits once they have the kid? If you want to say the state also sees benefit of being able to settle down and get the benefits to prepare to start a family, gay people most often settle down with the same intent to start a family as straight people either through surrogacy, sperm donation, or adoption. The same rationale applies to gay couples as it would straight couples here as well, either way you slice the cake.Before you comment with another stipulation, objection, or distinction you think is relevant, try to think whether or not it actually is one. Gay couples settle down with a virtually identical range of intents as straight couples.Edit: heres an exercise I would pose to you. Define your proposed restrictions or reasoning as to what you think should qualify two people to get married without mentioning sex or gender, then we can have a conversation about whether or not your proposed criteria are overly inclusive or overly exclusive of people you would/wouldnt want to get married. OTHERWISE, it seems your objection IS to same-sex people getting married, and youre looking for a post-hoc rationale to justify it rather than coming from a first principles approach as to who should have their unions recognized by the state that happens to exclude gay couples.","title":"CMV: the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage is fake"},{"text":"Captain obvious over here","title":"Top Biden adviser warns of chaos if Trump raises tariffs and guts IRA"},{"text":" \\" Wait a minute, was that mic on \\"?","title":"By IQ Gap, he means stupid (in case Republicans need it translated)."},{"text":"Market's been wrong on most things since covid","title":"44% think Trump will make food and grocery prices go down"},{"text":"I wonder who will decorate Putin's office in the West Wing?","title":"[The Economist] Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard are coming for the spooks: The president-elects intelligence picks suggest a radical agenda"},{"text":"Questions:1.

But they went through the legislative procedures and had the necessary super majority to push it through parliament. Since the constitution was very open especially to emergency powers, there was no legal challenge to it - since the legislative procedure was lawful. You see it with Orban and even Putin: To create at least some sort of legality is Important to consolidate power. The mantle of legality will put the enforcing agencies firmly in the hands of these dictators. They never come in guns blazing restructuring everything at once.

I directly responded to you by saying people should understand why the economy is the way it is, as its otherwise easy to blame things for it that arent even related to it. For example, the largest part of why the economy is the way it is, is post-COVID recovery. Trump would have ran into the same issues and his current plans would suggest he would have done as bad or worse than Biden if he remained in office. Even as a Democrat, I would give Trump a pass in this scenario. However, Trump has been able to capitalize on peoples emotions by blaming stuff like immigrants on the economy. Educated voters know this is ridiculous. Uneducated voters love to have that villain to attack. Trump also promised tariffs to fix the economy, which if actually implemented, would make everything worse. Anyone who is informed, on either side of the political spectrum, would agree with this. Uneducated voters, however, hear quick fast solution, and since they dont know why they are in the current situation theyre in, they say sounds great, lets vote for it. The current system allows candidates to manipulate the uneducated by giving them overly simplified solutions to complex issues. If you cant follow why this is bad, I have no more words. Stop being intentionally obtuse about what Im saying, or saying Im not answering your question. Stop blatantly ignoring what Im actually saying, actually read what Im saying. Its ignoring to have to explain the same thing over and over How about a statistics agency? Just give questions based on statistics. If your candidate is lying about everything, its to theirs and your detriment, as questions like Did illegal immigration trend upwards or downwards this year?, Select the number below that best represents the number of post birth abortions performed this year, or Select the number below that corresponds to the number of verified cases of immigrants eating pets. Incredibly simple questions if you have any basis in reality and dont blindly listen to some scumbag who only wants your vote and is willing to say whatever they want to get it.Im probably not going to respond to you again as I feel this conversation has been in poor faith on your end.

With respect to domestic policy positions, we see the rentier extractive nature of the neoliberal oligopolist oligarchy on full display. The drive will be to cut all government expenditures that do not benefit the oligarchs and to utterly trash the regulatory state that is designed to hold back the worst excesses of capitalist sociopathy and greed.He may have been an opponent of the US Deep State, but many of hus appointments remain quite questionable at best, if not outright bad.The problem for the US oligarchs is that they are faced with an incredibly effective and efficient Chinese development Party-state, which utilizes a mix of state intervention and free markets (much freer than the oligopoly and monopoly dominated US domestic markets) to drive economic development and technological upgrading. As I have covered elsewhere, China is already in the process of passing the US in the vast majority of critical technologies while the incomes and quality of life of the average Chinese person continue to improve year after year. ...The Chinese Party-state should be very happy with these Trump appointments, as it confirms a doubling down of the policies of the last 40 years that deindustrailized the US and threw away its technological leadership. So nice of the US oligarchy to cooperate in the destruction of its domestic strength, all due to its blind rentier extractive greed. This is how empires fail, collapsing under the weight of a self-serving short-sighted and incompetent elite.I suppose that bad appointments make the Chinese goals of surpassing the US easier. Trump had an opportunity to appoint anti-Establishment pro-working class candidates, which he mostly failed to deliver.The Establishment is worried and that is a good sign, but it remains to be seen what Trump will deliver for the American people, in his second term. These appointments are not encouraging.","title":"Note to Trump: Financially Destroying Average Americans &amp; Trashing the Administrative State Wont MAGA | Rentier, Extractive Capitalism Destroying Its Own Social &amp; Economic Base"},{"text":"youre missing the point entirely.","title":"Sarah McBride on bathroom issues: 'It is an attempt to distract' by Republicans"},{"text":"Your cousin is an absolute moron","title":"Trump reportedly plans to swiftly eject trans troops within days of inauguration"},{"text":"I think you'll find that whatever energy and emissions policies are put forward by the Trump administration will solve that problem in due course","title":"Trump's tariffs will be paid by the exporter and not the consumer"},{"text":"youre missing her point. civil rights are important, which is why they use it as a smokescreen. youre so focused on trans rights that they just replaced the DoD with trump loyalists without you noticing, and have eliminated the ACA.

Please defend your stance.","title":"Denver mayor threatens to deploy cops, 50K residents in Tiananmen?Square moment to stop Trumps mass deportations"},{"text":" Judging from what has been pushed thus far, there are several legal measures most likely to be used once Trump returns to Washington. One would be deporting foreign college students in the U.S. on a visa after theyre found to have openly advocated for Hamas or another U.S.-designated terror group, Advocacy itself should be protected speech.  or after they participated in an unauthorized campus protest and were suspended, expelled or jailed.If an immigrant is here on a Visa to attend a university, and they are expelled from that university, isn't the Visa invalid? I don't actually know how that works, but it would seem like you are no longer fulfilling your purpose for entry. Jailed or suspended are really low bars. You don't even need a valid legal reason to be jailed. If the University/college is the institution being wronged by the unauthorized protest, I don't think the government should be coming in and deporting the student when the university isn't even willing to expel such person.  Another measure would be to pursue federal prosecutions of demonstrators who block synagogue entrances or disrupt Jewish speakers at events. This is really fucking stupid. What is the Federal criminal offense? Also, are people just blocking synagogues?  A third approach is to charge protest leaders and nonprofits that aid in fundraising for protest groups with failing to register with the U.S. Justice Department as an agent of a foreign principal. And a fourth avenue is to open investigations into protest leaders who are in direct contact with U.S.-designated terror groups while advocating on their behalf.Are these not essentially the same thing? To be an agent of a some entity, don't you have to be in contact with that entity at some point to establish the agent relationship? If somebody is providing material aid to, or is acting as an agent of a terrorist organization, I would think that would be an actual crime, as well as grounds for deportation. Like, if somebody was acting on behalf of Al-Qaeda within the US, we'd be at the very least monitoring that. If they sent Al-Qaeda material aid, that would be a criminal offense (also possible treason). Obviously we aren't at war with Hamas so not treason, but still I would imagine providing material aid to terrorists is a no-no.","title":"How the Trump administration and congressional Republicans may crack down on pro-Palestinian protesters"},{"text":"No that is \\"filling up with Project 2025 Authors because he blatantly lied in order to get elected, and we the press reported those lies as gospel even though he had an extensive history with them, his name was in the document more than 300 times, he literally gave speeches in front of them promising to impletment 2025\\"The media now is reporting this as \\"gee what a surprise oh well\\" and you know what stop clicking their links with Trump's name in it.

Kennedy.Larsen had been informed through associates that the English satanic group had recruited Charles Manson to murder Tate because of information she had learned about RFK's assassination.The contention is that members of the English cult had invited Sirhan Sirhan to LA parties and one such party took place at Sharon Tate's residence, where sexual and ritualistic rites occurred C along with heavy drug use.According to an Immigration and Naturalization Service report, the English Satanist group had commissioned Manson to kill Sharon because of 'something that she unfortunately overheard that she was not supposed to overhear either in regards to Sirhan Sirhan or about Sirhan Sirhan'.Whether or not Sharon knew something about the Robert Kennedy assassination remains unanswered.\\"\\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3383946/How-Roman-Polanski-forced-wife-Sharon-Tate-threesomes-make-home-sex-videos-friends-refused-sleep-got-pregnant-wanted-abortion.html","title":"\\"I will not tolerate any criticism of this Great American Patriot Sen.
