Where his friends and contemporaries Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, while authors of substantial works, were best remembered for holding high office, Huntington was essentially an academic, a Harvard professor who worked incidentally as a consultant for the State Department, the National Security Council and the CIA under the Johnson and Carter administrations.A cold war liberal with a conservative cast of mind, he tossed highly personal ideas around like confetti. Some were wild and, for many, pernicious; others have come to be seen as wise and prescient. The Nuremberg war crimes trials prosecutor Telford Taylor summed him up as a man whose \\"store of iconoclasm\\" was \\"virtually inexhaustible\\".Huntington aroused heavy criticism for each of his major books. The first, The Soldier and the State (1957), saw him compared to the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. It was seen, perhaps unfairly, as a glorification of the military profession. It certainly praised the West Point military academy as Sparta surrounded by the American Babylon. A second, Political Order in Changing Societies (1968), became the subject of a furious academic debate, with Huntington denounced for describing apartheid South Africa as a \\"satisfied\\" state.His most famous book, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order (1996), started life as an article in the establishment journal, Foreign Affairs. In it he argued that the conflicts of the future would not be between ideologies but between \\"civilisations\\" defined by culture. He enumerated seven or eight of these, in the manner of an Arnold Toynbee: the west, Islam, orthodox Christianity, Latin America, the \\"Sinic\\" (Chinese) civilisation, the Hindu world, Japan, and perhaps Africa. He predicted that the most likely conflicts would be between the west and Islam or China. Departing from his (critical) support for the US in the Vietnam war, he said: \\"Western intervention in the affairs of other civilisations is probably the single most dangerous source of instability and potential global conflict in a multi-civilisational world.\\"The book set off a thunderous debate in American academic and intellectual circles between Huntington's supporters and those of his former pupil, Francis Fukuyama. Where Huntington predicted divisions in which the west would be only one of several competing civilisations, Fukuyama (who has changed his mind since) saw the collapse of communism as marking the triumph of western and especially American ideas, \\"the end of history\\".Huntington's last book was perhaps the most controversial and certainly the least well received. In Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity (2004), he predicted dire consequences from Hispanic immigration. The US, he argued, is defined '\\"in large part by its Anglo-Protestant culture and its religiosity\\". Spanish-speaking immigrants would transform America into \\"a country of two languages, two cultures, and two peoples\\".Most reviewers and many readers shared the opinion of the New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani that it was \\"a crotchety, overstuffed and highly polemical book\\", and \\"pockmarked with perplexing contradictions and curiously blindered \\\\[blinkered\\\\] observations\\".Huntington was born into a white, Anglo-Saxon protestant, in his case Episcopalian, middle-class family in Queen's, New York City. He was precocious. He went to Yale University aged 16 and graduated in two and a half years (instead of the usual four) before going into the army. After the second world war, he earned a master's degree at the University of Chicago and a doctorate from Harvard, returning there as a tenured professor in 1962 and remaining for 45 years.He was an influential teacher, though hardly because of his presentation. He delivered his lectures monotonously, hunched up, blinking and squinting. But he lacked neither moral nor physical courage. He joined in academic controversy with spirit and determination. And once, when he and another Harvard professor were attacked by muggers, he downed his opponent and went to the rescue of his colleague.Huntington was in several respects typical of the American academics who used mathematical or, as their critics said, pseudo-mathematical political science to support their personal theories and the liberal nationalism known as \\"cold war liberalism\\". He claimed to be a disciple of the great protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, but showed little evidence of sharing Niebuhr's awareness of the tragic moral dilemmas of American society. He was a natural target for the 1960s left.When he was put up for membership of the National Academy of Sciences in 1968, a Yale mathematician, Serge Lang, led a bitter onslaught on his credentials. Lang objected to the academy \\"certifying as science\\" what were \\"merely political opinions\\". He sharply criticised Huntington's suggestion that apartheid South Africa was a more stable state than France, on the basis of \\"equations\\" based on the number of telephones and other randomly chosen numerical indications. He concluded that Huntington had given \\"primary evidence of professional incompetence and defective scholarship\\".No wonder the heavyweights of political science leaped angrily to his defence. He was, after all, by the 1980s the most cited political scientist in America on international relations, and several universities made his works required reading. But would be a mistake to dismiss him as no more than an establishment mouthpiece. Even his most problematic ideas were usually balanced with a willingness to see other sides of a question.","title":"Y'know...

People don't need to get poorer.Hardly anyone buys polos because they cant afford it, then guess what the company does? They dont order anymore and manufacturing produces very few products because the demand is low. Manufacturing lays everyone off and so does the retail company.Then people will buy something else, shifting demand to new companies and industries. This happens all the time.The classic example is pop. Let's say Coke doubles their prices for whatever reason. That lowers demand for Coke which leaves a market gap for competition which will all gladly take that business and expand production. Same consumption, same jobs, just moving around.If all pop companies doubled their prices, that leaves an even bigger market gap to be filled by a non-exploitative product or alternative products, like water.

Like so many others, I would have voted for Bernie Sanders pet rock over Donald Trump. If she had won, it would have meant quite a lot about growing as a society to so many-including myself. There was not much time for her to develop her own strong policy stance since she stepped in and ran a last minute campaign. I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for her to accomplish all at once. Also, I do sense that she is a good person with a lot of empathy and love for other people, shes very sharp, and wants all people to succeed and prosper-I feel the same about Waltz. I know that she planned to keep our civic safety nets in place and she supported a womans right to life. The Grocery and Pharmaceutical industries hold major political influence and they are actively price gouging consumers. Kamala wanted to stop that from happening. Our CPI was high like 7% or 9% for under a year and now its back to around under 3% and the prices are still just too damn high and people say they will never come down.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"Definitely not.

And yeah, a lot of them are right that he isn't a career politician, he goes off script and he speaks what he actually thinks, which is refreshing to Americans because politicians like Kamala don't convey any actual humanity, just a team of writers and coaches and gimmicks and statistics on buzz words to say and groups to pander to etc.On top of that, Kamala's never been able to convince anyone she's capable of heading negotiations with other world leaders, or being in charge of making calls on foreign politics or military affairs. She can't even do an interview without a strict script unfortunately, so no one could ever believe she could hold a conversation in person without a script as well.","title":"Trump win Pennsylvania!

Just shortly after 3 AM when they called PA for Trump I hear a VERY long train passing by, headed South towards Palm Beach County.  Now, trains pass by all the time, but what struck me as odd was the extra loud rumbling emanating from the tracks across the street.  It almost sounded as if the train cars were heavier than usual, MUCH heavier than usual, and with an usually large number of cars on them.  At first I mistook the sound for someone outside in the parking lot listening to some thumping Rap bass on their car stereo.  Then I realized it was a train.  Then I started wondering what was inside the train cars that made them so heavy, and why there were so many of them.Anyway, this just shows how uneasy the election results have made me.  I am already feeling a bit hyper sensitive and paranoid.  I'm sure long trains have passed by at that hour of the night before.

He wants your approval, he wants you to hear what he's saying and to agree with him. He wants to be a people's man, a successful man, a man of the masses. In his ideal world every American would vote for him, even Krooked Kamala and Washed Walz (or whatever he calls them), who would get on their knees and beg for forgiveness. He would grant it, for he's a magnanimous man, and he would rise to his position with the adulation of millions. All his decisions would be universally beloved, and he and the populace would walk in lockstep towards a better and brighter future. Kamala Harris does not want your vote - she wants you to trust the experts. Her view is that competence, not popularity, should decide your position in life. She wants her plans to be as good, contingencies to be as thorough, and staffers to be as dedicated and experienced as they can. In her ideal world an algorithm designed to find the ideal president would point to her as the most suited leader, most deserving leader, the one most capable of providing the most to the most. She is a little insulted that she needs to play this popularity game at all, that she needs to lower herself, a woman proven by years of service, deserving by virtue of who she is and represents, to the level of the unwashed masses and appeal to their vulgar needs. Donald is delusional. His ideal world has nothing to do with our own. Kamala's is perhaps closer to ours - it is right that she's more competent, more deserving, more experienced, and would have better policies. She would not be the best at any of these, out of all Americans on the planet, but between her and Donald there would be no comparison. But they face off in a contest of popularity, not ability. The American public reads Donald as a man who obeys the spirit of the elections (\\"I should win because people want me\\"), despite his many vices and crimes. They dislike Kamala as a cheater in spirit (\\"I should win because I am *better*, no matter what the idiot populace thinks\\"), although she does everything by the book. Donald Trump wins.","title":"Trump wins the election, to become the 47th President of the United States."},{"text":"Or maybe between Harris and Clinton the Democratic Party threw 2 unpalatable shills at America and America collectively said no?

Can't do both without killing the services we will need for unemployment or low wages to help (food stamps). ICE workers have already said it would require a budget close to the DOJ to do so. Farmers are going to suffer hard. They unfortunately rely on undocumented immigrants for work because they can't afford a 15+$ wage people would require on top of health care for a worker.Tariffs are going to hurt everyone that aren't in the tech industry or a corporate job.Chips ACT to become the leader of micro chips in case Taiwan is invaded maybe dead, dunno if Microsoft is going to do something to save it.","title":"Trump vows new 'golden age' for America as he nears clinching presidency"},{"text":"Trump won the female vote btw","title":"How Donald Trump Pulled Off the Greatest Comeback in Political History"},{"text":"The democratic party might as well dissolve right now.

While youve heard of very many car accidents, this is undoubtedly one of its kind. Apparently, the man was too drunk to drive, let alone close his door. So, when the vehicle lost control, he fell out, with the vehicle rolling over his leg. The Ford pickup rolled on and crashed into a house and injured a woman who was sleeping at the time.The incident happened in Orlando at the Dancers Royale Club. The man, later identified as William Edwards, 28, had had enough of the party and decided it was time to go home. A security guard, seeing the man stagger to his car, warned him he had had too much to drink. Well, as expected, Williams just brushed him off and sat at his Ford pickups wheel. The man didnt care to close the door, who knows, he might have wanted a little breather. So, he started driving and before long, he lost control.Before he knew it, the vehicle started wobbling, which made him fall out. The car then came rolling toward his direction and for lack of powerful reflexes, William let the car run over his leg. He couldnt do much at this point and when the pickup crashed into a home, he could only think of fleeing to his home on foot.The 28-year-old followed his intrusive thoughts and immediately fled, which added to his penalties. Instead, he should have reported his mess and probably had a few things to deal with. But he left his ID in the truck, which led the cops to his house and later made it so easy for authorities to track him down.","title":"Tonights results make me wonder if in fact the 2020 election was stolen"},{"text":"Kamala was the least popular VP ever so im.not surprised","title":"Donald Trump Defeats Kamala Harris, Wins Back The White House"},{"text":"Says the white guy","title":"Donald Trump Defeats Kamala Harris, Wins Back The White House"},{"text":"Why do you want Putin to win so badly?","title":"Trump defeats Harris to become the 47th POTUSA!!!"},{"text":"Sorry stupid European here.

Last time Hispanic Trump supporters were crying because their spouses were deported..\\"I thought he meant someone else. I thought he meant the bad immigrants.\\"     Massive numbers of Cecescue style orphanages filled with infants lying in their own filth in Jesus' name because abortion is illegal and Republicans won't pay for services - go for it. Who fights for those services? Democrats . Muslims who think Trump loves them, good luck. Last time trump refused to let them in the country.  Who helped these good people caught up in Trump's madness? Democrats. Jewish people who forgot the tiki torches and both sides - living under a Christian Nationalism that will be happy to watch the middle east implode - because it means Jesus is coming and all of you will convert. Log cabin gay Republicans still looking for acceptance while throwing trans brothers and sisters under the bus - wake up. When gay marriage is destroyed, your marriages won't be grandfathered in. Feminists who got in bed with the GOP, enjoy the patriarchy. Tariffs, massive deportations, giving in to fawning dictators, turning the presidency into a personal yard sale, have at it.

The economy was rocked by Covid, but post-covid we expected everything to return to how it was.  Energy prices were low prior to Covid, but post-covid they went up and never came back down.  This had a systemic effect on the price of all goods and services.  Anytime people would complain, \\"My groceries are expensive, gas is expensive, my power bill was high\\" instead of getting sympathy from Democrats, people would get very patronizing.  \\"Food is cheaper here than other parts of the world, gas is cheaper here, power is cheaper here\\"  and \\"Look at the DOW!\\"  You can only minimize peoples struggles for so long before they get mad.  Mad enough to be convinced that you're not lending a sympathetic ear.  So they seek out someone they think will listen to them, and parrot back their complaints to them.  \\"Oh yes, groceries are expensive, gas is expensive, your power bill is sky high!\\"  A lot of people want to polarize this race into \\"Good vs Evil\\" but when you're just trying to make it in this world, or raise your kids, it's not that simple.  Sometimes picking a side and sticking to it doesn't put food on the table.  That's the reality.Taking this a step beyond my generation (X) the generations that come after us have it horrible.  I feel so bad for them.  Living at home till you're 30 is now the norm?  Not owning a home is now the norm in the US?  Working until 67?  People under 50 are furious right now.  I can't blame them.  When one person is telling you \\"I represent hope\\" and the other person is telling you \\"I acknowledge the problems you're facing, and I have the magic solution\\" people go with the latter.

I think Kamala lost because nobody wanted her to win. I mean, don't get me wrong, but that's what i concluded by reading various articles. People were not Pro Kamala, they just were Anti Trump. This was not a US election. This was a Trump election. There were only two kinds of people, those who wanted him and those that didn't want him. How many of u voted for Kamala because u genuinely liked her manifesto? Or did u vote just to make sure Trump doesn't win. I believe the majority of the first-time voters went for Trump just because his entire manifesto was about economy and immigration. Kamala was keeping her entire politics around him. I even saw a few people claim they don't know who she is, but are voting for her just because they don't want him to win. I wanted her to win, but I genuinely didn't think she would. Nobody knows who she is. This election should have ended as a Democrat win. It didn't just because they decided to endorse Kamala Harris as a last-minute replacement for Biden. This was not Trump's victory. This was Kamala's loss. Anyway, these are my two cents.","title":"Trump wins the election, to become the 47th President of the United States."},{"text":"Oh yeah I forgot about how pathetic incel conservative rednecks reference cucks in all of their communications!

You're celebrating your victory right now but I think, over time you might come to sorely regret your choice for presidentWhen trump starts deporting millions of people, leaving farmers without workers to pick the crops, work in hospitality ete and food prices soar due to the trade war he starts with china and the EU with his 20% tariffs on every good entering america and 60% tarrifs on Chinese goods, It will wreck the economy.There would be no time for farmers to hire Americans to replace those lost jobs even if they could pay them enough to pick crops for 12 hours a day instead of the $7 an hour they pay to illegal immigrants. Crops will rot in the fieldsYou won't believe me when I, like all reputable economists from both the left and right say that his tariffs (which importers pay as a tax to the government to discourage said imports because that's what a tariff is) will make everything you buy including gas and food more expensive (since Trump will deport the people harvesting crops). It will take decades for domestic alternatives to pop up if ever.With all of the illegal immigrants who are contributing to the economy being deported (as they buy food and pay rent with their wages) and the trade war combined, there will be a recession, even Elon Musk admits that Americans would face \\"temporary hardship\\" from Trump's policies. Except they won't be temporary because you can't undeport people and as we've seen from the 2008 recession, the Richest and the 1% benefited the most from the crash and not you.I know you will never believe me, you only believe trump but I will be proven right and just remember, when it happens that you did this to yourself","title":"Trump wins the election, to become the 47th President of the United States."},{"text":"","title":"I left this comment upon seeing Trump Dominating and.."},{"text":"You can say that again.

You're celebrating your victory right now but I think, over time you might come to sorely regret your choice for presidentWhen trump starts deporting millions of people, leaving farmers without workers to pick the crops, work in hospitality ete and food prices soar due to the trade war he starts with china and the EU with his 20% tariffs on every good entering america and 60% tarrifs on Chinese goods, It will wreck the economy.There would be no time for farmers to hire Americans to replace those lost jobs even if they could pay them enough to pick crops for 12 hours a day instead of the $7 an hour they pay to illegal immigrants. Crops will rot in the fieldsYou won't believe me when I, like all reputable economists from both the left and right say that his tariffs (which importers pay as a tax to the government to discourage said imports because that's what a tariff is) will make everything you buy including gas and food more expensive (since Trump will deport the people harvesting crops). It will take decades for domestic alternatives to pop up if ever.With all of the illegal immigrants who are contributing to the economy being deported (as they buy food and pay rent with their wages) and the trade war combined, there will be a recession, even Elon Musk admits that Americans would face \\"temporary hardship\\" from Trump's policies. Except they won't be temporary because you can't undeport people and as we've seen from the 2008 recession, the Richest and the 1% benefited the most from the crash and not you.I know you will never believe me, you only believe trump but I will be proven right and just remember, when it happens that you did this to yourself","title":"Trump claims victory in the 2024 presidential election"},{"text":"Diddycrats sitting on the toilet crying and pooping with their pants still on.

I just don't see Vance being as beloved by the GOP like Trump, especially since he has no charisma. I feel like if Trump dies, Vance becomes George Dubya Bush 2.0 especially getting blamed for all of Trumps shit in his second term.That was a huge reason why Obama won in 2008, even in red states like Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina because he won alot of those 2004 \\"buyers remorse\\" Bush voters, once everyone turned on him after the 9/11 invasion of Iraq honeymoon phase wore off.Also if Trump doesn't die in office, I think Vance wins the next GOP primary at least due to being the \\"sitting president\\" and especially due to Trump squashing his competition like Little Marco Rubio, Lying Ted Cruz, Meatball Ron and Nasty Nikki.","title":"How do we get back on track?"},{"text":"Stop the cope.

This is the final death of the Obama coalition. In 2008 he brought together college-educated White voters and racial minority voters, who are both located primarily in the major cities and their suburbs. Since then the Democrats have really consolidated the college-educated demographic, but Black and especially Hispanic voters no longer behave as homogenous voter blocks. Non-college-educated minority voters are now behaving like non-college-educated White voters. Those people have always been socially conservative, except for their opposition to racism. America has become less racist in the last 16 years (despite perhaps becoming more xenophobic), so opposition to racism no longer overrides other concerns for those non-college-educated racial minority voters.There's no way the Democrats are going to abandon socially progressive policy, and shouldn't. They need to bring in another coalition partner. Ideally somebody in rural areas. I think focussing on massive economic investment in infrastructure in rural areas is the way to go. I don't think people are actually afraid of socialist policies, they're just afraid of their taxes benefiting someone else instead of themselves. Urban populations are already locked down with social policy so we need an economic policy tailored to rural voters.Edit: I know this is r/neoliberal but my desire to retain my basic human rights overrides my critiques of socialist economic policy.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"Reddit doesnt reflect real life; it tends to be a left-leaning echo chamber.","title":"Trump claims victory in the 2024 presidential election"},{"text":"He won the popular vote as well, this is amazing to watch.","title":"Trump claims victory in the 2024 presidential election"},{"text":"Did they?

Dems have focused on welcoming women/lgbtq+ (rightfully so), but in doing so young males who are very insecure in their masculinity have found a safe space in toxic alpha male ideology through right wing podcasts and social media. Republicans have hammered that stereotypical weak liberal image over and over again through all social media avenues. Male Latinos had a +18% swing from democrat to republican. As a Latino male myself, its very hard and lonely trying to be accepted and respected in this country. Latinos tend to be very catholic and 2nd and 3rd generation Latinos dont want to associate with immigrants, so they can be swayed to vote republican. Sadly voting republican doesnt change the color of your skin or earn peoples respect. So i think the combo of there not being a space or avenue for young males to be brought into the fold along with a rising identity crisis of Latino men assisted in putting us in this place.","title":"Trump Wins 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"You're absolutely right about the first part. They will try to blame this on not only sexism; but also racism, and the \\"Left.\\" This is where I'm going to disagree with you. The left is no more responsible for this than sexism. This defeat can be laid directly at the feet of Kamala Harris herself and the Democratic party, which is not a left wing party but a center-right one. She and they ran a campaign that berated her allies for disagreeing with her, while also insulting her enemies. It couldn't have been calculated better to lose the election. If this sounds familiar that's because it's the same tactic used by Hillary Clinton in 2016. I think you give a pretty good analysis of the problems within the Democratic Party right now. But that is not a good description of the American left. The left were the people calling for an actual primary both when Joe Biden was running and when Harris replaced him. The Left were supporting and voting for candidates that more closely aligned with our values or refraining altogether. They were told that they would cause Trump to win for this, and they'll continue to be berated for this for at least the next 4 years. The Left isn't perfect. Some have, unfortunately, taken up that moral superiority and attacked rather than argued. But most on the left are open to dissent and willing to engage with those we disagree with. Unfortunately that is not a good strategy for the current state of American politics. Sexism didn't lose Kamala Harris this election, neither did the left. Harris lost not only the election, but the popular vote to a Republican for the first time in 20 years. As things stand as I'm writing this you could take every vote from every candidate who isn't Trump or Harris, give them to Harris, and she would still be losing by more than 3 million votes. This happened because Harris ran one of the worst campaigns in American political history. TLDR:\\n1: Neither sexism nor the \\"Left\\" is to blame for the result of the election. Harris and the Democrats are at fault for their own failure tonight. \\n2. Your description better fits the Democratic Party than the actual American Left wing. Disclaimer: While neither sexism nor racism caused this loss, they both played a part. Considering that all 3 Democratic candidates that have faced Trump used basically the same strategy, and the only one to beat him was a white man. It's also true that both racism and sexism play a large part in Trump's rhetoric and many of his supporters like that.","title":"CMV: dems will blame republican win on sex"},{"text":"I am moving out of the country.

Amy Coney Barret fits this notion, for instance.

When they do it though? Perfectly rational and normal, excused by phrases like \\"reality just has a left wing bias\\". Did you not watch how leftist discourse switched from being utterly apathetic and disinterested in Kamal to treating the 'Queen' with adamant fervor almost over night after her candidacy? Or how for years they outright turned a blind eye to Biden's cognitive decline and dismissed it as a 'conspiracy' right up until the debate - literally a few hours before the debate a CNN column discussing the 'conspiracy'. It's wild to watch the left, their herd mentality is fascinating - 'sheep' would be a accurate descriptor if it wasn't so tired and overused.

I think after the first few weeks or even the debate, people who would consider those top issues already made up their mind on who to vote for, so Harris Campaign shouldve turned their attention to the issue that voters really care about: $$$.I think focus on the next 2 elections should be pinpointing any economic problem that might arise/remain under Trump Admin and attack that in a way the general public think theyre a lot worse off.(2) Another reason to avoid focus on abortion for the foreseeable time being is to regain Latino votes (~30% swing toward Trump). Many Latinos are religious and socially conservative. Best option for abortion legalization are through state referendums at this point, unfortunately but realistically.(3) Speaking of Latinos, a lot of them that I talked to really did not like Venezuelans who crossed the border and took a similar stance as Trump in basically stereotyping them as criminals (a lot of them comes over to their countries too). I really think Democrats as a whole should be really hawkish on the border and immigration enforcement while encouraging legal immigration to highly skilled workers (Republicans old platform).(4) People were growing numb to all of Trumps rhetorics to a point where theyve been basically ignore them, but Harris Campaign spent a lotta time talking about it (I mean they were low hanging fruits, but still). Bottom line is that Dem needs to be significantly tough on the border issue and focus on economy without sounding too elitist (most people are dumb, eli5 what you will do)","title":"How do we get back on track?"},{"text":"Putin.
