I mean, they are the worst.  There isnt much transparency about how decisions are made at the top of the power hierarchy, and I dont know if its malice or incompetence, but I see no reason to defend the Partys choices.  Ive always voted Democrat, and I identify as a progressive.  Ill vote for the lesser of evils.  But Democrats as in people\\nwho vote for Democratic candidates arent in charge of the strategy (though you could probably blame the liberal elite inner circles for being a bunch of out-of-touch windbags).Even saying voters just wanted to give someone not connected to Biden a shot, because of high prices and cost of living, does not let them off the hook, because they should have anticipated that.  The issues with Biden running again were also obvious.The point that a LOT of people dont follow politics, and dont feel particular affinity for any politicians right now, is important.  Of course, you do have to appeal to people who actually care about issues, too, who will mobilize other voters, in the best case.  If you have a strong positive message that resonates.The one thing I get stuck on is, even people who dont know much about politics know enough about Trump to know that, non-politically, Trump is a total piece-of-garbage human being who should not be in charge of a paper bag, whether you look at it rationally, morally, or practically.  Whether you overlook, or dont, his phoniness, his dishonesty, his lewdness, his buffoonery, his poor speaking ability, his criminal acts, his lack of qualifications, his hate speech, the fact that hes a menace to the women around him, the fact that hes\\na bully who emboldens bullies, from the playground, to the locker room, to foreign dictators; he loves Russia and Putin and doesnt believe in core American institutions like fair elections.  He openly wants to enrich the rich and crush the poor.  If you want to give voters the benefit of the doubt somehowand try to let them off the hook for what I suspect was an extremely poor choiceis it really enough to say, well, they are just simple folk who dont know much?  They know enough.Leaders shape culture.  Kids look to our leaders.

Its not disinformation either.  Dems just ran a bad campaign and there is a load of baggage that has accumulated over the years.Its far beyond just politics.  Its crept into media and movies and games and etc.  Basically an ideological pressure has been slowly applied with increasing force to the US that did not actually align with the values of the average US citizen.  For awhile people just kind of got out of the way or accepted it because people don't wanna become social pariahs or lose their jobs or get dox'd and attacked by social media or etc.And eventually enough was enough.  People didn't change their views to match waht was being pushed onto them.  They simply laid low and stayed out of the way and at some point most of them had enough and they didn't show up on social media or polls or etc, because those are dangerous, but they did show up to vote.The kind of stuff that pushed people to vote Trump.\\\\- The stupidity in movies and games where every mediocre product gets defended via using identity politics as a shield.  Be it Star Wars or Dr Who or Captain Marvel or Ghostbusters 2016 or Dragon Age Veilguard or etc.  I still remember when I called Captain Marvel a 7/10 and got told I hated women.  That kind of thing eventually puts a chip on people's shoulder.\\\\- Ideologues and activists not creating their own works but instead taking over old works and inserting incompatible ideology into them, compounded by poor writing on top of that.  This is related with the above point.    \\n  \\nFor example there are good ways to discuss identity issues in the Dragon Age IP.  Its a universe with in lore hooks you could use to talk about it.  Shapeshifting magic exists.  You could have many nuanced takes on things subtly in the background that are just a natural part of the lore but deeply address or speculate about some identity stuff.  But instead we get top surgery scars, pronouns, and modern language/ideology.  It was such an easy win, the universe had all the tools needed to craft some great stories.  And instead we got something that doesn't fit in universe, talks down to the fans, and also quite frankly is not in line with the core demographic of the series.\\\\- The false morality.  Example: Biden will not pardon his son because he stands for the law unlike repubs!  Turn around:  Biden pardon's his son.  Lots of stuff like this where Dems claimed the moral high ground and then threw it away.  \\\\- Just flat out lying/being wrong.  Every time you say \\"we definitely got him this time\\" every time your local late night talk show is wrong about what's gonna happen in some controversy or legal thing, every time the polls are flagrantly wrong, every time something is exaggerated/created or otherwise proven untrue.   People stop trusting you.  And if you say \\"well Trump lies too\\" I got [a relevant George Carlin clip for you.](https://youtu.be/d005h78r-jU)  \\\\- The demonization of white people.  Who knew that making one of the biggest voting bases in the country your enemy by constantly talking down to them and treating them as evil for shit they didn't do would backfire?  Nobody wants original sin.  Nobody wants to be discriminated against.  And some poor fuck barely scraping by who sees other people getting initiatives to help them that they don't get does not for a second believe you when you tell them they are privileged.

I do not know a single person that fits your description of \\"people that don't want to be sold\\".  I live in small town USA with an enormous pool of Republican voters.  Those people you describe represent such a small percentage of voters it's flat asinine to even bring them into the conversation.  You assume we voted for tariffs, don't understand them, believe China will pay them.  Then you say within a month we have been rightfully educated on tariffs and all of sudden have changed our opinion to how it will help manufacturing.  Man, for a group that doesn't want to hear facts we sure do listen to those facts when you tell us and boy do we believe them because we flipped our opinion on the perceived benefits of tariffs!  Tariffs are not the smoking gun you think they are.... You've got to be a complete idiot to pretend like Biden didn't keep Trump's tariffs from his first term and in some instances increased them... So if they are so bad for everyone, you must be admitting to how terrible Biden has been right?  I'm sure you're not talking about those Tariffs though, those Tariffs are good because Biden kept em, it's the new ones Trump has been talking about right?  You act like nobody has the mental capacity except a Democrat on Reddit to understand tariffs.  News flash, we know what tariffs are and how they are paid.  What you don't seem to have the mental capacity to understand is the benefits of tariffs.  They are great bargaining chips, they curb unfair trade with other countries, and do encourage American manufacturing.  Even so, tariffs are such a small percentage of the reason we voted for Trump... Again it's flat asinine you even bring them into the conversation.  The funniest part of your comment is the whole \\"we voted against our best interest just to hurt other people\\".  Jesus Christ man, are you seriously that delusional?  You sincerely believe that we voted for Trump just to hurt you?  That hands down is the most moronic coping mechanism I've seen this week.  Truth is, you are neither morally or intellectually superior to Republicans.  Our country did not like the direction we were heading under Democratic leadership and voted for a change, a change that historically benefited us back in 2016.  None of us have buyers remorse.  Nobody wishes they could change their vote.  Nobody is getting their face eaten.  We are happy and optimistic for the future of our country.  I sincerely hope that you and the majority of your democratic friends can't understand any of that, because it just means more conservative leadership/policies in the future.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"To further simplify for people, because the incoming admin wants the dude dead, now we cannot trust justice.

The corruption runs deep and across party lines. We see this in times such as when McConnell backed the Democrat in AK. We see it in the omnibus crap package budgets that are submitted with no time for review on the eve of shutdown. This corruption runs throughout the government, from the FBI and its manufactured Trump/Russia collusion ploy, to the Justice Department refusing to look into influence peddling of the White House, to the White House telling social media what to censor, to vaccine mandates on low risk children to boost big pharma bottom lines. The corruption is about maintaining power and profiting at the public expense. The Cheneys who profit off of war have their way of war profiteering life threatened by a President who seeks peace. Those with corrupt ties to China have that lifestyle threatened by America first and tariffs on China. Those who are creatures of big pharma which profits off of ever expanding vaccine mandates are threatened by RFK Jr. It simply is corruption which puts many of the political class at odds with Trump. But they are losing influence. The public tires of their corruption. The lies are so onerous and frequent that they have lost public trust.

Welcome to President Trumps 47th Presidency!!!"},{"text":"I couldnt get much past your first few paragraphs, because I think youre making a fundamental mistake with your sources. By that, I mean that if you are speaking to people who think that democrats lost the election because most of the American electorate is redneck, inbred, etc. then you are speaking to a vocal minority who like to blame others for their failings. Which basically just means you are speaking to what leftists like me lovingly refer to as a shitlib. So lets start from the start: democrats lost the election for many of reasons. Here are some of the biggest: - After ignoring everyone screaming for Joe Biden to give up the nomination for way too long, they then ignored everyone screaming for an open primary and undemocratically **appointed** an unpopular candidate as the nominee. - They have been funding a genocide that is extremely unpopular among the American electorate. - When the Joe Biden dropout honeymoon ended and their polling numbers started to slip, they desperately appealed to, of all people, republicans who werent quite sold on Trump, flaunting their endorsements from the Cheney crime family and refusing to look to the left during even their most desperate times. - They did nothing to change the trajectory of the country after being voted in, even having a full legislative majority for 2 years. Roe v Wade was overturned, campaign promises for no new drilling were broken and then lied about, they made labor strikes *illegal* at one point, the wealth gap continued to increase, etc. - They ran on almost no policy, and certainly not any policy that anyone gave a fuck about. Their entire campaign was tripping over themselves to scream VOTE FOR US CAUSE TRUMP BAD! We were all fucking aware that Trump is a fascist clear back in 2015. We all heard of Project 2025 the day it was released, not when democrats suddenly started caring about it because they cant run a competent candidate. We didnt stop caring about the concentration camps on our southern border just because Trump left office, and we all saw how they remained open after he did. And some smaller reasons: - They continued with their undemocratic tendencies by kicking 3rd party leftist candidates from ballots in multiple states, primarily swing states. - They continue to allow the fucking disgusting Clintons to run the party, even letting their resident rapist go to a swing state and explain to ground zero of the uncommitted movement that its okay that theyre killing civilians in Gaza cause theyre being used as human shields, days before the election. - They allowed the sundowning president to get on TV and call half the electorate trash a week before the election. \\nAll of these points are important, but its very important for you to understand that *progressives do not need to change their messaging* if they want to win elections. 60% of this country (plus or minus a few percentage points depending on the year) want universal healthcare. Do the democrats literally ever talk about that? 70% of this country wants free subsidized public college. Do the democrats literally ever talk about that? I dont even know what percentage of the country wants weed to be legalizedlike 75-80%? Do the democrats literally ever talk about that? Maybe theyll deschedule it MAYBE. 75% of the country wants way more swift action on climate change. And I can keep listing majorly popular positions that the democrats never mention. Because the democrats are capitalists bought by their lobbyists and my fucking god are they tone deaf. They run ancient, out of touch, unpopular candidates. And the hardest theyve ever worked was to desperately keep the only left-of-center candidate to ever near the nomination, Bernie Sanders, from receiving the nomination. This entire sentiment that democrats are losing because theyre too left or too brash or that progressivism is inaccessible is, simply put, bullshit. They lose because they are rainbow fascists and boosting Nazis as their opponents so that they can run on the platform of vote for me cause Im not them doesnt fucking work. The longer democrats continue to blame voters for not liking their unpopular positions and moral grandstanding bullshit, the more elections theyll continue to lose. Younger generations reaching voting age are astronomically more likely to be leftist.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Biden already blocked that deal.

Welcome to President Trumps 47th Presidency!!!"},{"text":"So progressive *ideas* are broadly and consistently popular -- Medicare for all, increasing minimum wage, raising taxes on rich people, universal childcare, etc.And candidates who run as populist progressives also tend to do very well -- that is how Obama ran, and he won handily (sadly, that wasn't how he ended up governing, but it was electorally effective for sure).The problem is that the Democratic party leadership resists this as much as possible, even though they keep repeatedly losing.Now, I'm not completely sure where you sit politically or what you mean by \\"progressive\\" and \\"wider electorate\\", but in *my* view the policies I outlined above constitute \\"progressive\\" policies and are broadly popular among both Democrat and Republican voters, which would seem to constitute the \\"broader electorate\\".The obstacle has been leaders in the Democratic Party itself...ie a rather *small* part of the electorate. Not ignorant rednecks and racists, but rather aging elitist professionals who think they know better than everyone else and who still have PTSD from losing 49 out of 50 states to Reagan and thus compulsively try to run to the right whenever they encounter opposition.Bernie Sanders figured all this out before, and that remains a winning strategy. It just keeps getting shut down by Democrats in leadership because they don't want to win that way (either because they are still fighting the last war against Reagan, or because they know their donors don't want progressive policies enacted and thus make sure they never allow them to go to the ballot).And this problem will persist no matter *how* you message to voters, because the issue isn't even necessarily with the electorate -- it's with the gatekeepers who control what ideas and people are allowed to go forth to the electorate. If you want to run a broadly appealing working class campaign, your chief opposition and the main people you'll need to convince won't be the average voter -- it will be Democratic party insiders.If you want to get even more sinister about it, I think on some level the elite professionals who make up most of the Democratic Party leadership like feeling smarter than the common rubes and thus have no desire to appeal to them. Like, the Democratic Party would *much* rather the working class not vote...that way they can focus on fighting with the Republicans amongst a much smaller, richer subset of the population. So they *want* regular people to get apathetic and just drop out. And the *last* thing they want is to have a bunch of poor people realizing they can actually solve some of their problems, like food and medicine and housing and so forth, by *voting* rather than working for very little and hoping they get a lucky break someday.Lastly, one other thing I'll mention: I'm not sure what you mean by \\"working class\\" , but in *my* understanding \\"working class\\" is just everyone who makes most of their income by selling their labor rather than owning things. That does *not* appear to be what Democrats or political writers more broadly mean when they use this term...and certainly isn't the people that Trump appeals to.And this is important, because while I agree generally with appealing to the working class as I have described it, if you seek to the appeal to the \\"working class\\" as Trump describes it, you *will* enable fascism... because Trump does *not* appeal to the material working class.Trump appeals to, for example, car dealership owners who believe they work way harder than their lazy employees and so consider themselves \\"working class\\" (even though they're not -- they're bosses and owners collecting income off of the stuff they own). He appeals to boomers living in enormous McMansions in the suburbs and collecting a mixture of government benefits and investment / rental income who used to work in a factory and thus consider themselves \\"working class\\" (when though they're not -- they're owners collecting income off of the stuff they own).Trump does *not* primarily appeal to, for example, renters working at Amazon fulfillment centers. Or Walmart employees. Or other such people whose income comes *entirely* from their paychecks rather than anything they own/investments/rental income. And to the extent he does have support among these groups, he gets it not by appealing to their economic circumstances, but rather to their bigotry.So in order to do what you're describing you kind of first need to reclaim the language you need to even make the case. Because right now the popular story is that Trump is the candidate of the \\"forgotten working class\\" and the Dems are the party of Wall Street. This is not at all the case, but the *actual* \\"forgotten working class\\" is so forgotten that neither party nor media even really remembers they exist. They don't even talk to Amazon fulfillment workers or other such people. To them, the \\"working class\\" are boomer homeowners, not poor renters.And so long as that is the case, you won't be able to leverage the strength of progressive politics , because you'll still be chasing elite owners (some of whom don't think of themselves that way but absolutely are in material terms).","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Every time they open their mouths they lie.","title":"Republicans stood behind Obama when he won?!

But whether it's a single individual vote switching isn't really proven by this. The electorate is not static and individuals don't vote consistently in every election. [https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/)So to change the framing a bit, it isn't that the decision points are: Democratic, Republican, Third Party. But rather, Democratic, Republican, Third Party, or Don't Vote. It isn't that people are switching from Obama then Trump, but that Obama turned out low proclivity voters that lean left. But, Clinton didn't, and that Trump turned out low proclivity voters that lean right. ?In my opinion, Democrats need to start running candidates who can speak working class.\\"Here's another crux - Sanders, for instance, has tried to run on the theory that \\"working class\\" is a cohesive identity demarcator and people will vote based on membership in this class. What is missing is that the New Deal coalition was built on a \\"working class\\" that were primarily manufacturers and government intervention - whether by creating the job through job programs, or giving protections - helped them. The \\"working class\\" today range from a hair dresser that essentially owns their own business, plumbers etc., for whom government interventions are red tape and confusing and not needed. But I dont see much enthusiasm among the Democrats base for this approach. Am I wrong? Can anyone change my view?It comes down to your fundamental understanding of how elections are actually won. The Republican Party - who have created their own information ecosystem - have a theory that *mobilizing voters that are likely to vote for me and suppress those who are unlikely to vote for me* is how you win. So, that means their strategy to do so is a ton of negative partisanship. All the time. Outrage. We know that it works because they win. For instance, in the 2010s, they put $30m into state legislative races and bombed Dems out of the office via negative partisanship. What did was they won a majority of the 107 local races they entered in 16 states and let them draw really favorable congressional district maps. People talk in narrative form about politics \\"The Tea Party rose because Obama did X\\" or \\"Dems messaging was X\\" - in reality the Dems in 2012 got 1.3m more congressional district votes and lost the chamber because of how the maps were made. Sometimes narrative doesn't really matter as much as we think it does. Mobilization is what matters. Lastly - I wanted to touch on your assumption that \\"progressives\\" are the Democratic base. The progressive left is one of the smallest parts of the coalition. [https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/)That's why candidates like Warren and Sanders can't win because it just isn't a big enough bloc even for primaries. But your thesis for why Harris lost was because she was \\"too left\\" just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. She was campaigning with Liz Cheney for god's sake.

Remember people who voted for trump voted for authoritarianism not the economy or lower inflation.A new study, however, suggests that the main threat to our democracy may not be the hardening of political ideology, but rather the hardening of one particular political ideology. Political scientists Steven V. Miller of Clemson and Nicholas T. Davis of Texas A&amp;M have released a working paper titled \\"White Outgroup Intolerance and Declining Support for American Democracy.\\" Their study finds a correlation between white American's intolerance, and support for authoritarian rule. In other words, when intolerant white people fear democracy may benefit marginalized people, they abandon their commitment to democracy.the GOP has increasingly been embracing a politics of white resentment tied to disenfranchisement. \\"Since Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy, the GOP has pigeon-holed itself as, in large part, an aggrieved white people's party,\\" \\"Social intolerance isn't just leading to GOP support as we know it and see it now,\\" Miller says. \\"It's leading to preferences in favor of the kind of candidate the GOP ultimately nominated and supported for president.\\" In embracing the politics of white identity, then, the GOP made a Trump possible  and is likely to make more Trump-like candidates successful in the future.  https://archive.ph/GvO5M","title":"Why Trumps next presidency poses a new global threat to womens health - Women who had no say in Trumps election could lose vital reproductive health services because of his policies"},{"text":"well said yup I am tired of people falling for this rage bait crap! do not let them divide us! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q34Qxl5HINg","title":"Trump suggests that Canada should become 51st US state"},{"text":"The voters endorsed Trumps definition.

He is REALLY good at campaigning - in fact I think he is a once in a generation talented politician. I really don't like anything he stands for and I think he's a populist con artist strong man, but he knows what he's doing. The way he completely took over the Republican party and got the entire right wing media ecosystem to kiss the ring is some shit that will be studied in history books. You also add on to that the aspect of inflation and how incumbent parties across the globe are losing. The way the parties are currently aligned, the Democrats are a big tent party that have a broad appeal but the support doesn't go very deep. The Republicans are basically just the MAGA party and it's a populist cult of personality. The appeal isn't necessarily very broad, but the core base is essentially a cult, and it's big enough that it gives Trump absolute power over the entire Repubican party and right wing media. It's hard thing to defeat because they will rally their voters no matter what, whereas the Democrats more so just need the economy and living standards to be good enough (if they are incumbents) or bad enough (if they are the opposition) for the outer circles of their big tent to show up to vote. Having better candidates and better campaigns obviously helps a lot, but tbh I think the Dems were fucked no matter what this election cycle. Unless they had a truly charismatic politician like Obama, they had no chance, and there is nobody in the Democratic party who was up to the task. The Dems could have done everything you suggested and they still would have lost tbh. I think it's really just a perfect storm between the state of the economy, social media, and an extremely talented populist con artist like Trump.

Specifically, I think it informs a lot of resentment over perceived loss of status within larger society, which is a big contributor of the \\"divide\\" with the working class folks. My dad is not an ardent racist by any means, but he also does not consider non-white folks as part of his \\"community\\" or \\"class\\" and he's definitely reachable by people like Trump, who play a lot on his sense that everything is going to shit and that \\"real Americans\\" are the ones paying for it.

Racism and misogyny can't be ignored, either.Regardless of reasons, the election wasn't particularly close. Every state saw more Trump votes than Harris votes as compared to Trump v. Biden. Turnout was a big issue for Democrats; lots of guesses have been made as to why.The hard spot for Democrats is that they are trying to be everything to everyone. They want Wall Street donors and Silicon Valley donors and unions and Main Street voters and activist organizers and civil rights supporters and celebrity validators, etc. I just don't think that's possible in this political climate. For example, the DNC decided this cycle that it's staying pro-Israel. Fine, it's a strategic decision, I get it. But then they act surprised/angry when pro-Palestine voters go to Jill Stein (and some, inexplicably, went to Trump).

Exit polls show those who cared about the economy most went for Trump. Seems pretty clear to me.  Remember trump cant win when he runs against men, only when he runs against women.He lost to covid more than he lost to Biden. Most people agree Biden would have lost to Trump this election, which is why he dropped out in the first place. Also it is not the fault of both political parties for backsliding into authoritarianismIt is absolutely also the fault of Democrats for not responding to voters. You have to prove democracy works if you want to keep it. Ignoring that voters want to hear about changes instead of the status quo for decades, even after they want change so badly they chose Trump, is a choice. Democrats are responsible for that.","title":"Why Trumps next presidency poses a new global threat to womens health - Women who had no say in Trumps election could lose vital reproductive health services because of his policies"},{"text":"Remember when this guy was so scared of a lady knocking on his door that he threw an absolute tantrum and then had to go hide at his parents?

They are traitors imo they deserve much much worse. Every single human that went inside that building was a part of the terrorists actions even unknowingly about the electors rioting into a capital while everyone next to you is chanting hang Mike pence might be a good time to leave right? Nah they just entered and \\"casually\\" shit all through the offices. Oh, and I think you think that Trump did not try to prevent the riot from happening, here is the evidence he offered the national guard's assistance in advance but the capitol police refused the offer:https://tucson.com/news/national/capitol-police-chief-resigning-after-rejecting-multiple-offers-of-federal-help-to-quell-pro-trump/article_a2ad5947-5ffa-5014-b913-0bbedf5ae41e.htmlhttps://apnews.com/article/capitol-police-reject-federal-help-9c39a4ddef0ab60a48828a07e4d03380https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/08/gen-kellogg-trump-did-request-natl-guard-troops-on-jan-6th-asks-congress-to-release-his-testimony/https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955548910/ex-capitol-police-chief-rebuffs-claims-national-guard-was-never-called-during-riWhich is IMO an other sign it probably was a \\"false flag\\". I have no clue if I can change your view but at least you now know my opinion, which is more common as you may think.Yes the national guard and the police fucked up. That's without a question they let terrorists break into the capital. But again trump absolutely knew of the plans or he wouldn't have been trying to fake the electors that day and demanding his vice president to officiate them. It's like you fucking people don't look at anything but 30s clips and make up your mind. It was planned and orchestrated by trump without any question of a doubt. It was planned and orchestrated by the proud boys. These 2 parties at minimum should be in jail for treason. My question for you is how can you just lie yourself? How can you not see this was a planned attack? Why did they choose that day, that hour? Why did 14 elected officals agree to trump to fake the electors? Possible because they didn't want people to chant to hang them","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"/u/BluePillUprising (OP) has awarded 6 delta(s) in this post.All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1h5tte6/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_progressives_need_to_become/), in /r/DeltaLog.Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"We were totally gonna behave and not do anything bad, but now Biden has forced our hand.

A tumor is made of living cells, but we still remove it for the wellbeing of the host.The question of whether or not a fetus is \\"alive\\" is irrelevant: the answer is obviously yes, and we are indeed killing a fetus by removing it.The question that really matters is whether or not a fetus is a \\"person\\": which, if answered, would also answer the question of whether or not killing one is \\"murder\\".The problem is we all know that at some point in human development, we go from being a cluster of unconscious, undifferentiated living cells to a conscious individual with unique thoughts and feelings. At what point *exactly* this happens is literally unanswerable; biology occurs on a continuum, while humans draw lines, create categories, and write definitions in order to make that continuum understandable to ourselves. Lines, categories, and definitions are created for the sake of utility. There is no single, identifiable moment in which a fetus goes from unconscious cellular material to a conscious \\"person\\". It's up to us to draw that line somewhere, and draw it in a way that provides us utility.What utility does drawing that line at *conception* afford us? Yes it's impossible to know at what moment a fetus becomes a person but it's DEFINITELY not at conception, when there isn't even the slightest sign of consciousness. What utility do we derive by preventing someone from terminating a pregnancy for their own wellbeing, whether that be from a financial, emotional, physical, or mental perspective, in order to save the life of a being that isn't even conscious yet? You could make an argument that the beginnings of consciousness likely occur in later stages of pregnancy (even Roe had some restrictions on late-term abortions relating to \\"viability\\"), but certainly not at the moment of conception. Why would you take the choice, the autonomy AWAY from an already conscious, thinking, feeling, born person to force them against their will to use their own body to sustain a not-conscious, not-thinking, not-feeling, not-born *potential* person? All this does is restrict freedom and cause undue suffering and harm for no benefit.The only \\"utility\\" one could argue restricting abortion access provides must come from the assumption that anyone who has a uterus is morally obligated to stay pregnant if they happen to become pregnant.

Treatment for this can include hormone therapy and/or even breast reduction surgery.  Both of these would be 'gender affirming care,' even though they aren't transgender related.  If the law is worded to ban transgender care for minors, then the number of those who cannot seek this treatment is increased.Similarly, a number of people will go through early puberty.  This typically is something that is more prominent in females.  A treatment for such is hormone/puberty blockers.  Again, this would not be related to transgender care and yet if the law is worded in such a way these cisgendered young people could be denied care.  In both these situations, they might be denied care as doctors exercise extreme caution to avoid running afoul of any law.  Point being is that these procedures are something that are not exclusive to transgender people and are generally considered safe procedures.  We have generally allowed patients and their families, at the advice of medical professionals, to make decisions on whether or not these are appropriate procedures.I personally think these laws are ridiculous and harmful, even moreso considering that they are intended to target a minority.","title":"What it means to prepare for the future of trans health care under Trump"},{"text":"There are so many opinions about Democrats should do this and that for the working people, but a lot of times these working people are privileged morons.

He kept up rallies. He tweeted a bunch. He took visits to places and barnstormed. He made headlines every day and sought out cameras at every opportunity. I should clarify: Trump actually got remarkably little accomplished in his first term. He sucked, and will probably continue to suck, at making policy. But he was super active and used the bully pulpit to great effect. Most Trump voters from 2016 came away thinking that Trump accomplished a lot and fought for them every day. A key thing being that they think Trump actively made the economy good.Is that the way politics should work? A do nothing grifter getting the credit for doing a whole lot because he's good at PR? No, but it does work. But Biden made a bet on the theory that people were pissed off at Trump for being in the headlines for 4 years. In hidsight, I think only Democrats were mad about it. Republicans loved it and independents thought it projected strength even if they think Trumpnis a bad person. Biden faded into the background of his own Presidency (which was fantastic from a policy level) and as a result never got credit for his wins and got a ton of blame for things he had nothing to do with.And you know this playbook. The GOP had been campaigning against Clinton for years before 2016. They were campaigning against a second Biden term since 2020.

And that goes hand in hand with creeping authoritarianism.For all the complexities around the ebb and flow of abortion rights, a simple formula holds surprisingly widely.

You have it exactly backwards.  The Tenth Amendment specifically allocates to the states jurisdiction over issues not allocated expressly to the federal government.  *Roe* justified federal jurisdiction over abortion by making several leaps of logic from the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure, which is why it's always been a legally weak case.  In its absence, the federal government's only jurisdiction over abortion is in the realm of crossing state lines to obtain it, which is under Congress's role of regulating interstate commerce.  In other words, the only abortion access ban that would be upheld by originalists would be a prohibition on crossing state lines to get one.

Are soldiers sometimes wild childs? Yeah, that can happen, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) told NBC News on Monday, the day after The New Yorker reported that Hegseths problematic behavior led two separate veterans groups to force him out of his leadership role.Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) added that hes known Pete for a while, so in my experience with him has always been positive. In a Monday post on X, formerly Twitter, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) wrote that Hegseth is an outstanding choice for Secretary of Defense and that she is confident he will bolster our military and make an excellent addition to the Trump administration.The wave of support came as Hegseth, a former weekend Fox News host, has been meeting with the Republican senators who will decide whether hes fit to lead the Pentagon. The senators currently backing Hegseth are largely staunch Trump supporters, and their public praise of Hegseth may be an attempt to pressure more moderate members of the GOP caucus to similarly write off the allegations against him..Trumps team is doing similar work. When it comes to Pete Hegseth, there arent any concerns, Trump adviser Jason Miller told CNN on Tuesday. We feel very good about his positioning for being confirmed by the Senate.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/pete-hegseth-allegations-team-trump-gop-senators-1235190499/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/pete-hegseth-allegations-team-trump-gop-senators-1235190499/)","title":"There Arent Any Concerns, Trump Adviser Says of Scandal-Ridden Hegseth"},{"text":"I thought he was gay?","title":"Trump Mind Virus Ep#2"},{"text":"And the 3rd Amendment.","title":"Blue States Will Not Be Safe in Our Corrupt, Clownish, Authoritarian Future: The Trump administration will seek vengeance against any state that tries to resist the spread of crony capitalism."},{"text":"Then adjust your own schedule.","title":"No more daylight saving time?

I never fully bought into the idea, but I'm not fully against it either. I do think it's more of a concern in some areas versus others. Dead Internet theory really shines true on dead platforms. Or platforms that don't encourage deep discussion. I think we see it a lot on Facebook, YouTube, heck Tinder too. But they are often weird? Like all those bots saying AMEN! on Facebook or here on reddit all these weird bot product reviews on niche markets. It sometimes takes a minute to suss them out, but if you look  for them like  you might spot a phishing scam it helps. I remember bots and trolls when Russia first invaded Crimea in 2014, they were easier to spot then. It's harder now, but you still can figure them out by listening and deconstructing their points. Most Russian disinfo comes from the same sources. Like all government engagement they have a pretty standard copy paste repeatable element to them. The real problem is when regular joes get caught up in that and repeat it, then it becomes hard to figure out if your talking to a person being fed disinfo or a direct spreader. That's often my own frustration. Your right the Internet doesn't represent reality anymore. 100% but it is something we all use. It's the well we all draw from. So being able to listen to people, watch videos, talk to people in public it helps. You have to draw from multiple sources anymore to get an idea. It's super frustrating and long and drawn out. But it's possible to gauge sentiment that way. Not in a quantifiable or publishable sense, but I do think in a broad sense. You can start to get a grip on the issues, simply by seeing what everyone is repeating and what lines are favored. But it is only a piece at the end of the day. I do think the Internet influences all of us heavily. And maybe that's the real problem overall, we shouldn't listen to any of it and should all just unplug. I honestly don't think that would be so bad TBH.","title":"Donald Trump didnt win by a historic landslide.

The courts explicitly did not find that the federal government cannot have a say on abortion. They very narrowly determined that it was not an inherent protection under the right to privacy which is what roe was determined by. This fully allows the federal government to make federal laws over abortion access. The supremacy clause in the constitution also specifically allows for this. There is nothing constitutionally inherent to states rights about abortion, those are extremely limited like how states hold state wide elections, and are specifically outlined. Theres is absolutely nothing in the ruling or in the constitution delegating abortion rights, neither explicit nor implied, to the states. Where are you getting your information from? Because republicans said so? The only reason republicans are making a stink about states rights here is because they want to overturn federal precedent. They have done this numerous times before when attempting to overturn federal precedent in the courts. They claim states rights and then shortly after attempt to pass a federal law. The only time they argue for states rights is when the precedent is set by the courts, not law.","title":"Why Trumps next presidency poses a new global threat to womens health - Women who had no say in Trumps election could lose vital reproductive health services because of his policies"},{"text":"I pulled my back out this morning.

This is lifted from a post on here awhile back that I cannot currently find, but makes excellent points:Here is the Republican viewpoint on everything of importance:1. We Republicans can tell people what to do, and we can do whatever we want.2. Other people cannot tell us what to do, nor can they do whatever they want.This often gets mistaken for hypocrisy, but this is the basic formula.You've watched the Republican Party champion the idea of \\"freedom\\" while you have also watched the same party openly assault various freedoms, like the freedom to pardon whomever they want, the freedom to vote, freedom of women to make their own healthcare decisions, freedom to marry who you want, freedom of trans people to exist, and so on. If this has been a source of confusion, then your assessment of what Republicans mean by freedom was likely too generous. Heres what they mean:1. The freedom to tell people what to do.2. The freedom from being told what to do.In other words, when Republicans talk about valuing freedom, what they actually mean is only people like them should ultimately possess it.Viewed through this lens, it's not hypocritical - in fact they're very steadfast at sticking to the principle that the freedom to make decisions and tell people what to do is theirs and theirs alone.","title":"Trump not only pardoned Kushner's father, he selected him to be the US ambassador to France.

Name a US President who hasn't abused the pardon power in the last 20+ years.Unfortunately they've all done it. As much as many Republicans might like to make as big an issue of this as possible, it wasn't so long ago that Trump pardoned his campaign manager, his son-in-laws father, Stephen Bannon and Roger Stone.If you don't like Presidents abusing their pardon power that's fine. But trying to pretend this is anything new is disingenuous.As for the OP, a term limit for the Senate cannot be created or enforced by a sitting President. That would be an enormous violation of the seperation of powers for a start. Getting it done would require a consitutional amendment, so you would need 34 states to agree to a constitutional convention, and 38 to agree to pass it.","title":"Fox News: Hunter Bidens pardon sets troubling precedent, risks politicizing Justice Department, critics say"},{"text":"Of course they do.

He said hed deport the immigrants and institute tariffs, and hed give tax dollars back to people that were being used in ways he calls ineffective.

She never clearly answered what she would do differently than Biden after being asked multiple times.So they voted for change instead of supporting a status quo with some vaguely good sounding social programs that doesnt change much.","title":"A Connecticut town that swung toward Trump offers clues for Democrats"},{"text":"I wouldn't want to do that to Colorado and New Mexico.

Basically every demo group moved against Harris uniformly (other than Latinos who moved more than the national average), which supports the idea that the big, national issues predominanted here over any smaller, community-specific concerns. As opposed to an election like 2016 where Republicans gained, but that gain split unevenly, with certain demographic groups moving left.And that makes sense. Inflation hit everybody about the same. Biden's administration basically tried to maintain support by appealing to union members, black people, and women, all groups that ended up breaking against the administration due to economic issues. In a world where the Dem coalition is fraying and there isn't any particular type of person who feels good about the President, there really isn't a way to claw back support and flip a county no matter how unique that county is. This *was an atrocious performance by Democrats,* but the real issue wasn't Harris. It was a failure by Biden to govern and maintain his coalition support while doing it. 2021-2024 saw massive gains in GOP voter registration and party ID in polling, and the final margin was basically the same as what the polling said pre-debate when Biden was still in the race. The conditions that set up the results of this election were set in stone years ago. One thing Trump does really well is that he ran his White House like a camapign. He never lost sight of the fact that you need to show up and show how you're delivering for your voters while in office. Biden's theory that people wanted a President they could safely ignore was pretty disastorusly wrong.Harris threw the kitchen sink trying to find any type of voter who would break for her, but she was set up to fail.

The sun, not the clock, dictated farmers schedules, so daylight saving was very disruptive. Farmers had to wait an extra hour for dew to evaporate to harvest hay, hired hands worked less since they still left at the same time for dinner and cows werent ready to be milked an hour earlier to meet shipping schedules. Agrarian interests led the fight for the 1919 repeal of national daylight saving time, which passed after Congress voted to override President Woodrow Wilsons veto. Rather than rural interests, it has been urban entities such as retail outlets and recreational businesses that have championed daylight saving over the decades.https://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-daylight-saving-time","title":"No more daylight saving time?

Let's just check on the old Wiki for a second.Anti-union stanceIn 2019, Portnoy tweeted a threat to fire \\"on the spot\\" any employee at his blogging company who sought advice on forming a union. The New York State Department of Labor released a statement saying, \\"We say no way, no how to intimidation, threats and union busting. It is illegal to take any unfavorable actionincluding terminationagainst employees for union-related activities under the National Labor Relations Act. New York is a proud union state.\\" U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted in response to Portnoy, \\"If you're a boss tweeting firing threats to employees trying to unionize, you are likely breaking the law &amp; can be sued, in your words, 'on the spot.' ALL workers in the US have the protected freedom to organize for better conditions.\\"[37] Portnoy later agreed to an informal settlement with the National Labor Relations Board where he did not admit guilt but deleted his anti-union tweets. He also released a T-shirt with his face on it that read \\"Union Buster\\".\\nControversial commentsCritics allege that comments on the site by Portnoy and others normalize rape culture. Comments that have sparked debate include a post on a 2010 blog in which Portnoy said \\"[E]ven though I never condone rape if you're a size 6 and you're wearing skinny jeans you kind of deserve to be raped right?\\"[40] When confronted with his statement by Lisa Guerrero of Inside Edition, Portnoy said: \\"Correct. I stand by that. I think it's a funny joke.\\" Guerrero asked, \\"Do you know how offensive that is?\\" He responded, \\"No, I obviously don't.\\"[41]In 2020, multiple videos of Portnoy surfaced that showed him using the N-word or joking about blackface.[42] Business Insider reported that Portnoy had made multiple \\"unprovoked, personal attacks online\\", including frequent \\"sexually harassing comments\\" toward Deadspin's Laura Wagner. Portnoy has defended himself from allegations of sexism, saying: \\"I gave two girls their own radio show. We have hired girl after girl. They say it's a great place to work.\\"[43]Legal issuesPortnoy has twice been detained in NFL-related incidents. On May 12, 2015, he was arrested after he and three Barstool employees handcuffed themselves to each other on the floor of NFL headquarters in Manhattan and demanded to speak with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to protest Deflategate.[6][44] He was arrested again in 2019 when he was placed in a holding cell at Mercedes-Benz Stadium for a portion of Super Bowl LIII after creating fake passes to attend a press event the day before. He was prohibited from attending the game.[45][46The National Labor Relations Board investigated Portnoy in 2019 for threatening to fire his workers if they unionized.[47] That December, Portnoy reached an informal settlement with the Board, which required him to delete his threatening tweets and remove any potential anti-union material created by Barstool Sports. The settlement also noted that the Twitter account originally encouraging employees to unionize was actually owned by Barstool in an attempt to out labor organizers.[48][49]In 2004, Portnoy filed for bankruptcy protection after large gambling losses.[10] He owed $59,000 to credit card companies and $18,000 to his father.[10] In January 2020, a tax lien for $11,795 was filed against Portnoy by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[10]Sexual assault allegationsIn November 2021, a Business Insider expos alleged that Portnoy had engaged in violent and aggressive sexual encounters with three women and that he had filmed the women without their consent.[50] He claimed the sex was consensual.[51] Portnoy called the article a \\"hit piece\\", claiming that Business Insider tried to find evidence of wrongdoing by him for approximately eight months.[52] In February 2022, more sexual assault and harassment claims by young women were published in a second Business Insider article.[53] After these new allegations were made, Portnoy announced a lawsuit against the publication. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in November.[54][55] Portnoy filed an appeal of the dismissal. In February 2023, he dropped his appeal.[56]","title":"Trump not only pardoned Kushner's father, he selected him to be the US ambassador to France.

People I suppose wanted lower prices &amp; change from the incumbent administration (like most other countries at the moment), so were back to trying tariffs &amp; deportation of labor. Neither of which will lower prices (obviously).Will probably just ping pong back and forth. Neither side will cut spending and neither side will raise taxes so we just march towards the fiscal cliff. As more voters are persuaded the economy doesnt work for them - eventually theyll vote by a wide margin to blow up the entire system with probably no understanding of the ramifications.","title":"Donald Trump didnt win by a historic landslide.

Because any other nation on Earth would have responded to a single rocket attack from inside their own territory as a justifiable reason to wipe the terrorists out.And Israel has been dealing with daily rocket attacks and terrorism for decades now.Meanwhile, the Gazans have nothing to offer the world. In every nation they have migrated to, they have proven to be nothing but a huge political problem. They are their own worst enemy now.And, finally, Israel (under intense worldwide pressure) gave autonomy to Gaza in 2006.

If the person dies of natural causes and does not leave a will expressly stating their intention for the use of their body post mortem, the next of kin are responsible for the body. If they are able to donate the body to someone who can use it, and make a little bit of money in the process, I see no problem. 2. If the person dies, and has left a will expressly stating their desire to not give their body to science, or for any part to be used in any capacity, their wishes should be honoured. 3. Same as 2, but they say that you can donate their body to helpful causes. Then you are well within your right (in my mind) to donate the body to whichever organisation you choose and if you can make a profit, I, again, see no issue. 4. This is where it gets darker. A person is given a small percentage chance of living from a doctor because they have a fatal illness, but they're trying their best to get better. It's possible someone might try to push this person to the brink of suicide to get the money for their body parts.

He accused AfD politicians of reproducing National Socialist rhetoric verbatim.Anyone who described Germans who took part in the war of plunder and extermination as heroes was quite openly turning perpetrators into victims, he told Die Welt.Seperately, Ursula Haverbeck,?Germanys most prominent Holocaust denier, was reported on Thursday to have died at the age of 96.

I don't have my Excel open but that's like 0.17% or something of total voters. People want to act like there was this massive red shift and Dems are doomed for eternity, that they cannot possibly hope to win in 2026, and that we now all must accept an eternal Republican dictatorship or something.

Yes, Republicans won the Senate and the House. But, contrary to both Republican talking points and breathless headlines and hot takes from leading media outlets (resounding, rout, runaway win), there was really nothing at all historic or huge about the margin of victory.\\n \\n Repeat after me: there was no landslide. There was no blowout. There was no sweeping mandate given to Trump by the electorate. The numbers dont lie.\\n \\n First, consider the popular vote. Yes, Trump became the first Republican for two decades to win the popular vote. However, per results from CNN, the Cook Political Report, and the New York Times, he did not win a majority of the vote. Barack Obama did in both 2008 and 2016. Joe Biden did in 2020. But Donald Trump failed to do so in 2024.\\n \\n And the former presidents margin of victory over Harris is a miniscule 1.6 percentage points, smaller than that of every winning president since 1888 other than two: John F Kennedy in 1960 and Richard M. Nixon in 1968, as an analysis in the New York Times noted last month. In fact, in the 55 presidential elections in which the popular vote winner became president, 49 of them were won with a margin bigger than Trumps in 2024.","title":"Donald Trump didnt win by a historic landslide.

Canadians suffering solely from mental illness will remain excluded from pursuing assisted death until 2027 because the health care system is not ready, Health Minister Mark Holland said on Thursday. A provision preventing those people from accessing medical assistance in dying (MAID) had been due to expire in March. Holland said he had introduced legislation to extend that period by three years. Canada legalized MAID in 2016 for people with a terminal illness and expanded it in 2021 to people with incurable, but not terminal, conditions.

ISIS would behead people. Blow it up. Barricade themselves inside and refuse to leave. Make demands. Try to overthrow the government and plan to kill people/take hostages/whatever. This is more like a ragtag group of Trump supporters -- most of whom got caught up in the moment and had a lapse of judgement. The few that lead the way and assaulted police officers should be charged appropriately (although I think terrorism, and sending them off to Guantanamo would be beyond appropriate). One thing people don't realize about the prison system is that most are labeled as \\"correctional\\" facilities because they're designed (in theory) to correct and rehabilitate offenders, not punish them. Do you think these people will get out and try to plot some sort of domestic acts of terrorism? I highly doubt it. They'll probably try to stay low key and keep their head down to avoid getting in trouble again -- and I'm sure the FBI (which in all honestly likely played a role in instigating the whole thing) will be watching them like a hawk for years to come.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"I dont think anyone is arguing that.
