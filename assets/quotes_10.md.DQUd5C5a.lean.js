UhmApproaches to Sharia in the 21st century vary widely, and the role and mutability of Sharia[20] in a changing world has become an increasingly debated topic in Islam.[5] Beyond sectarian differences, fundamentalists advocate the complete and uncompromising implementation of \\"exact/pure sharia\\" without modifications,[2][21] while modernists argue that it can/should be brought into line with human rights and other contemporary issues such as democracy, minority rights, freedom of thought, women's rights and banking by new jurisprudences.[   When you ask a simplistic question like \\"Do you want Sharia law implemented\\" then you damn well need to clearly define what \\"Sharia law\\" means as it can vary widely amongst Muslims what their specific interpretation of Sharia law is.    Kind of like how people in the west keep shouting that our society is built on \\"Christian values and traditions\\" but we don't allow daughters to be sold into sex slavery, even though the Bible says we can.    If you were to ask someone the simplistic \\"Do you want a legal system based on Christian values\\" and they answer \\"yes\\", does that mean they want it to be legal to sell your daughter into sex slavery, as condoned by the Bible, or not? You'd have to define what \\"Christian values\\" means before you can answer that question.    Conveniently, it is those that hate Muslims the most who consistently are opposed to diving into the specifics of these questions and would rather just run with the \\"X% supports Sharia law!!!!!\\" statistic and not question what that means.

There are people on both sides of the political spectrum who support immigration and oppose it as well. The left is more in the middle (neither strongly advocating for it or opposing it), while the right has the extreme positions. On one hand, you have the big business interests that are in favour of large immigration of cheap labour to undercut the demands of the domestic workers. That's the traditional right wing. On the other hand you have the so-called alt-right that opposes immigration more from the cultural stand point than from an economic one. The best example of the above is the UK conservative party that negotiated the Brexit deal and then was in government once Brexit got into effect. The UK saw a massive surge in immigration predominantly from outside of EU. That benefitted the businesses that represent the traditional support of the party. But at the same time it was against the ideology of the more cultural right wing elements of the party. That tore the party apart and in this year's election it got the worst result in a century or so. There are much better policy examples of clear left-right wing division. The approach to taxation and public services and social welfare divides the public more clearly in the left and right.

You're correct that in all military conflicts there are refugees and all sorts of losses, but to ignore the context of what's causing the war and simply to point out that all participants are experiencing tragedies seems pointless and likely to cause one to overlook the important facts such as:?Israel declared statehood in 1948, not Palestine. This was after 30 years of immigration that the jews were able to engage in, even during the Holocaust straight from Hitler's boats and coffers, proving that this aggressive act of declaring statehood was unnecessary for Jewish security and even autonomy in the region. ?Israel (aggressive occupying force) is backed by American resources,  Palestine is not. ?to my knowledge, historically jews have always lived particularly safely in Muslim countries compared to their Christian counterparts. Any discrimination experienced post-1948 is explained by the fact that Israel is committing such atrocities against Arab Muslims in Palestine, so Arab Muslim countries, with religious and ethnic ties to Palestine the Holy Land, are angry at Israel. To have sympathy for the jews in this regard is akin to sympathizing with Germany in ww2 when Dresden is being bombed... yes it was terrible but it's a reaction and it's much more prudent to understand this and not ignore it.

I am sure there are some things that both sides can come to agreement on for example I think that anyone convicted of SAing children should be immediately put to death, I think even democrats can agree with that.  If Congress could start with things that they 100% could agree on like that then move onto things that would be more problematic would be a start.  I don't think that inflation or the cost of living are bipartisan issues being as they seem to be things that Congress can't seem to find an answer to, and yes printing money is a problem, but and I agree that both parties have added to the national debt, and I disagree with the current Republicans trying to raise the debt ceiling, though with the current problems in Cali I also understand they need to do so to have money to help.  I agree that BOTH parties need to focus on lowering taxes on working-class people and focus on policies that grow the economy without making it harder to get by. As for Trump, I disagree that his promises are ALL empty.  I'm not saying he was 100% with his promises but he did SOME good, SOME bad.  I hope his 2nd term he does better.

As for wanting to maintain power rather than serving the people, is questionable being that he did sign the First Step act and even though I disagree with it many people say that it was serving minority communities.  This claim of \\"systemic inequality\\" is part of the problem because it is a lie by democrats to make a victimhood narrative within black communities while causing finger pointing at White people.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"Yes Republicans shop at small businesses and tip better (generally, as shown by a study). Actually shopping at small businesses and tipping better absolutely means that they are prioritizing small businesses.  As for a policy level, the best thing that they could do for small businesses would be to get rid of Obamacare (the ACA), and give them greater freedom. The best way to empower workers is to get rid of collective bargaining and allow individuals to value themselves and not have good workers be encumbered by bad workers. I feel that unions, had a time they were needed and there are SOME careers that need them currently however I'm all for people being able to CHOOSE if they want to be part of the union, or not.  I live in Illinois and it is mandatory to be part of a union, they don't help for your first year but they still collect your dues and such because they want to steal your money, and a couple of years ago when there was a problem trying to reach an agreement on contracts people were looking to strike, but the Union didn't have ANY money in the strike fund.  No Unions don't play a role in protecting workers, they steal your money and when they bargain for YOUR contract they put the best workers and the laziest workers in the same group to bargain with the company instead of you getting what YOU are worth, you get what the group is worth on average.  That is the lie that they want you to believe but they were built to protect the lazy and incompetent, for example I was a Firefighter/EMT and there was a firefighter that got a DUI off duty, normally that was a quick way out the door, but the Union got him to keep his job, there were 3 people that came up hot on a UA test again normally easy way to get fired Union got them to keep their jobs.  Protecting people who KNEW the rules and broke them but made sure they kept their jobs that is what unions do.  We need to stop allowing these criminal organizations to allow inferior workers to stay at jobs, or the worst are teachers unions.  The Industrial Revolution was terrible.  It is part of the reason for all the environmental problems that liberals like to complain about.  Doing any job WELL comes with the opportunity for upward mobility.  Again the claim of \\"excluded people of color\\" is a out and out lie.  Race even during times when racism was an actual issue for blacks was far from a barrier look at people like Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis,  Heck the FIRST slave owner in America was a black Man named Anthony Johnson.  The problem is that liberals want to push a narrative that portrays blacks as victims and White people as the transgressor but if you look all the way back into slavery it was one African tribe enslaving another tribe and then selling those slaves to Arab traders who sold them to White Europeans.  Most Whites haven't had great success either no it isn't \\"disingenuous to hold her up as proof that the system works\\"  She is just ONE example of MANY examples of Americas class mobility, and how it is equal to ALL who work hard and have a good idea.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"What if that was a factor? I want to know","title":"Biden always delivers!"},{"text":"Ok long response so I'm taking it bit by bit.  I think that there is an easy response to crime, I think that MAGA just needs to implement it, and that is to actually enforce the laws and be strict with punishments, I feel that Presidnet Trump was too soft on crime in his first term with things like the \\"First Step Act\\", I think he needs to be strict with the laws and this includes immigration.  Take the list of illegals from Obama's DACA and arrest every single one of them and deport them they are here illegally, they have had more than 8 years to become legal citizens kick them out, start making it so that there are no more anchor babies for illegals, get rid of duel citizenship you are either American or you aren't.  Then tell illegals that they get no protections under the law or the Constitution if you are here legally you get full protection but if not GO BACK anything that happens to you happens.  All other crime will be strictly punished no more soft on crime DAs if the DA lets a criminal off easy and they commit another crime the DA is held as an accessory to that crime.  It isn't \\"blaming minorities\\" it is looking at statistics and identifying reality.  If you live in a community that is 87% White and a crime happens guess what the probability is that the person that committed the crime is White, if you look at Murder in the USA and 51.2% are committed by blacks guess what when you find a murder victim you have a good probability that your suspect will be black that isn't blaming that is a statistical reality.  It isn't \\"romanticizing\\" anything it is looking at the world and seeing that when your grandparents (or great grandparents) were in their 20s and 30s they could walk the streets at night and not worry they could leave their doors unlocked or their cars unlocked and not worry about getting broken into.  And there was the fact that family dynamics were better a husband could hold down 1 job, work 40 hours a week with his wife being a stay at home mother and they could afford their lifestyle and still put some money away for saving now we have 2 people working 50+ hours a week just to barely make ends meet.  You claim that this \\"came at the expense of marginalized communities\\" but that isn't true because blacks at the time were actually the fastest improving group within the socioeconomic ladder.  They were able to move from low income to middle class, with ease.  It isn't enough to pretend like things were bad and ignore the reality of the good.  Crime is caused by all kinds of people but as stated if you look at statistics you will see that White collar crime tends to be White people, while 50% of all violent crime is committed by 15% of the population of the USA.  No crime isn't \\"tied to systemic issues\\" that is a liberal lie because if you look at poverty stricken White communities there is less crime in poverty stricken black communities.  Inner cities have a crime problem and interestingly enough if you look at crime it tends to be in democrat run cities even within Republican run states the cities are run by democrats and that is where the greatest amount of crimes are happening.  Part of the issue is this imaginary \\"systemic\\" problem that liberals love to throw out there but yet are incapable of every having an example of a law that says \\"If a black person does this they will be arrested and it will be a crime, but if a White person does the same thing it will not be considered a crime\\" The ONLY cases of systemic racism in America today are Affirmative Action and DEI programs that says because of skin color or gender you gain preferential treatment.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"The Mariana Trench wouldnt reach the depths the GOP is willing to go","title":"Nancy Mace Erupts At Dem In Committee Clash, Asks To Take It Outside"},{"text":"Yeah, I mean he was still blaming Obama for things like ten years after he was president.","title":"Biden always delivers!"},{"text":"Counterpoint -- nothing they did would have been effective because the people that they need to reach are in an echo chamber that will never accurately represent what is actually happening.That isn't to say that their focus shouldn't have been much more geared at ramming through legislation that would have helped the common man, instead of the wealthy, but the Dem's messaging had very little to do with the US getting to the state that it is currently in.","title":"Elizabeth Warren Uses Hegseth's Own Words To Call Out Sudden 'About Face' On Women In Military: 'We've Got The Video'"},{"text":"Obviously the Jewish exodus is atrocious but comparing it to the Nakba is apples and oranges First of all there was no amorphous Jewish exodus. Youre talking about many situations happening in various countries over the course of two decades. Yemen, most left voluntarily due to a love for Israel and were airlifted by Israel. Imams were also bribed by Israel to allow Jews to leave. Jews were BANNED from leaving to Israel in countries like Syria and Yemen. Morrocco, many fled because Israel had France (which had Morrocco as a protectorate at the time) allow them to leave, sometimes by force. Algeria, Jews fled to Israel and France because they had assimilated into the settler population and thus fled once settlers were being attacked. Iran, many left shortly before and after the revolution, much like plenty of other Iranians. It still has a Jewish population. Iraq, some attacks were genuine, but some were also orchestrated by Israel. Many Jews in these counties simply left because they wanted to live in Israel. Its a very amorphous event (hard-pressed to call it one when its many separate incidents across two decades). To say all 1 million were expelled is disingenuous.However this is a fair assessment in many cases, such as Egypt and Libya. Hate crimes skyrocketed. But this is very different from the Nakba. The Nakba was a deliberate plan for expulsion that was carried out by paramilitary groups, whose actions were sanctioned by the leaders of the country (and sometimes directly ordered), and then the country immediately implemented top-down policies to ensure the population could not come back. So expulsion. This is not similar to civilians attacking Jews out of Judeophobia following Israeli atrocities (not dissimilar from the rise in anti-Muslim attacks following 9/11). Furthermore, Palestinians were expelled into refugee camps. They are a stateless people due to these expulsions. They dont have citizenship, and they are still destitute due to the Nakba. Israels founding was based on the Nakba. Its existence as a Jewish state is predicated upon retaining a Jewish majority and thus prevention repatriation. So its scars are more deeply felt in the present day. On the other hand, Mizrahi Jews fled TO a wealthy country like Israel that privileges them. This brings me to the point about reparations - the PLO and Arab states WERE absolutely aware of this issue, and HAVE offered a right of return for Mizrahim, but naturally they declined. Why wouldnt they? How would they benefit from leaving a wealthy country to a much poorer one where they would likely face discrimination?If anything its against Israels interests to ensure Mizrahim are properly compensated with repatriation and restitution. If Jews are not dependent on Israel as their only place to live, it begins to fall apart. Israel has  not made serious efforts working towards helping Jews with this issue. So yes, true justice would entail righting this wrong. And Israel is an obstacle in this issue as well.That aside, its also just bizarre to bring this up when talking about the Nakba.From 1948 to 49 Israel committed a series of mass expulsions and massacres during a war, then immediately declared independence and prevented the return of any refugees, who are still stateless and destitute due to this expulsion to this day. But also across the next few decades, Libyan civilians, Iraqi civilians, Turkish civilians, Israeli false flag attacks, Israeli and French efforts, Egyptian civilians, Pakistani civilians, etc made Jews flee to Israel. You might have a point if this was by Palestinians but its hate crimes done by heterogenous citizens of many countries.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

There's been a massive wave of far right Christians in Europe over the last couple years gaining political power in order to use it to suppress the rights of others.I see. What you mean by \\"christians creating the law of the land\\" is actually that Christians are using democratic institutions to lawfully run for office and are being *elected, lawfully* into office by a voter base that *wants* them in office. So its that's votes aren't going your way that you truly have a gripe with, or should. It's hypocritical to be all pissed off about Sharia and then put your fingers in your ears when it comes to LGBTQ+ people and women losing rights because of authoritarian Christians.This is a misconception. It isn't authoritarian if it is the will of the people who voted them in power. Then, it is simply democracy following its intended path, whether we like or not.\\"Hypocritical to be all pissed off about Sharia\\"\\n\\"Fingers in your ears when it comes to lgbtq people\\"The difference is one of these is obtained by following the tenets of democracy as I explained above.

The only laws that matter are the laws in the Quran and what the voter base wants is irrelevant. If you think christians having a problem with abortion and holding up signs outside abortion clinics is the same as the kidnapping of and assaulting hundreds of school girls (children) in broad daylight (as happened in my region), or that refusing to teach children about sexuality is somehow equal to the BEHEADING of anyone who so much as has a problem with the fact that the prophet at 40 married a 9 year old, then you are so unbelievably privileged that high from your ivory tower you have lost the ability to measure degrees of severity.Did you know Sharia permits public executions, in broad daylight?

The right to be tried under Jewish/Islamic laws only applies when both parties agree to it and cannot be unilaterally imposed by just one legal party on the other in a dispute. Hence it cannot be forced on others or used to harass those who dont follow the same. The idea is to provide recognition for such process where both the plaintiff and the defendant agree to a separate judicial standard. These arrangements generally happen all the time anyways, and the idea is to bring this under documented frameworks, so neither party can renege on the deal later due to the present system being all trust-based/oral. Parallel judicial laws that are at direct conflicts with national laws/rights (like the capital punishment/pedophilia mentioned in the OP) are not considered to be a part of these systems either. And the standard is that if the parties disagree, the national law has the final/only say. While I agree these parallel justice systems are archaic and spending resources on it that can be used to correct for the injustices these systems have created. The present implementation efforts dont seem to be a direct degradation of the judicial system but an effort to make these marginalised demographic comfortable with the countrys judiciary and view them as less antagonistically.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"Exactly.

And conversely, the things not mentioned in the constitution are deemed to be such that the majority should be allowed to change if they think so. So, if the constitution prohibits some laws that Muslims want to push, so what, they will never become a law any more than laws that, say, Nazis want to push. If the constitution doesn't prohibit some Muslim demanded laws, then do they really hurt that many people if the writers of the constitution didn't think that those laws should be banned?To me it looks as you're appealing to some non-constitutional extra protection that should exist specifically against the demands of laws by the immigrants that doesn't apply to non-immigrant demands.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"hate is the most motivating emotion. that is why hacks like nancy mace attempt to manipulate voters via hateful rhetoric.liberty. freedom. equality. empathy. these are all more complex and difficult concepts to champion at scale.that's why troglodytes on the right keep it simple, keep the focus on hate.","title":"If you want to take it outside ...: Rep.

If we take it out of the specific context of Sharia law, this behavior is common amongst immigrants and visitors across many countries, if not as aggressively. Whether in the form of Doctors Without Borders and the Peace Corps or missionaries or foreign business investment, different cultures will exert pressure to make their new homes similar to their old ones. And by and large its a good thing. As they are encouraging Sharia Law in the West, the West also encourages more liberal beliefs in Islamic countries. The ideal is to take the best parts of cultures to make a comfortable living situation for as many groups as possible (barring the paradox of tolerance).While the cultural clash in both cases has had some negative repercussions, its significantly better than the alternative. If we dont allow for some cultural change by civil action, then our cultures will become separated, but not isolated. At that point moral distinctions will inherently lead to violence. As youve established, Sharia law includes a number of precepts that are fundamentally incompatible with Liberal Western Secular values, but we no longer live in a world where we are wholly ignorant of what takes place in other countries. At a certain point, well have to look at those other cultures and decide to take action or accept our values are false. If we cant take civil action like protest to encourage cultural shifts without being expelled then the only other option is mass government actions like sanctions and war.Obviously, this is a bit of an exaggerated thought experiment more than an immediately expected result, but my point is more to highlight the value of civil action in encouraging cultural change.  Sharia law in particular does bump up against the Paradox of Tolerance, and I do think theres value in reducing their platform, but shutting them off entirely prevents them from experiencing the benefits of other cultures and hopefully shifting their opinions even if its over generations rather than just years.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"Because he has moronic takes (mostly a recent phenomenon)mean lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You don't condone cheating you just enable and profit off it?","title":"Top Dem Says Trump 'External Revenue Service' Can't Hide Plans for Huge Tax Gift to the Rich  |  \\"No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multitrillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,\\""},{"text":"I think it's funny that if you're not registered with the CCP as an influencer in China, you can't use TikTok.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If you are appealing to \\"inherent value\\", you have probably lost the argument","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Pete Hegseths hearing was revealing today.

If a Christian says they support laws in line with the Bible, they could mean anything from \\"keeping murder illegal\\" to extreme fundamentalism. The same concept applies to Sharia. Extreme interpretations are an insignificant minority: A survey of three European countries on capital punishmentcentral to the nastier interpretations of shariafound that 35% of all French people, 27% of Germans and 50% of Britons felt that the death penalty is morally acceptable, while only 24% of French Muslims, 27% of German Muslims, and fully 63% of British Muslims believe it is. On the question of honour killings, the figures for the French, German and British general public who approve (2%, 1%, 1%) are similar enough to those of Muslims in those countries (3%, 3%, 2%) to fall within the surveys margin of error, and suggest that the practice has negligible support. In other words, the occasional disturbing instances of honour-killing murder in these countries are not tied to a broader Muslim acceptance of the practice. (Wajahat Ali and Matthew Duss, Understanding Sharia Law (Washington, DC: Center for American Progress, 2011)).You don't even need this data to know that this is a non issue. Muslims in Europe don't have voting patterns that indicate extreme politics, in the same way that the average Christian in the United States doesn't support the KKK. As for what to do with this insignificant minority of people with extreme politics? We already have a legal framework to deal with this. If they break the law, we can imprison them. Doing anything more would infringe on the freedom of speech.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"How many poor people do you know that have become President?","title":"Biden always delivers!"},{"text":"We're already there!

Sharia Law is like 99% legal/financial framework stuff, and 1% the more controversial stuff. Its a bit like how a huge percentage of Christians in the US will poll saying they want the bible to influence policy more, but they ignore stuff like not mixing fabrics in clothes or not eating food from animals with split hooves or slavery. The legal/financial stuff is often viewed as 'good' even besides religious compulsion by many muslims. It is a big thing that they think its rational and righteous and anti-greed. Things such as banning excessive interest, sharing risk between investors, splitting inheritance between siblings and children etc. I am not saying these things are good, but its not surprising that many Muslims will say that they think these things should be implemented more. Now, there are actual Salafist/Wahhabi types who genuinely want extremely strict, authoritarian Sharia law. But I am just referring to the poll figures which show huge support for sharia law. They are usually talking about different things besides, say, stoning apostates.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"This is Exactly what will happen","title":"Biden always delivers!"},{"text":"(You will remain a puppet, everyone else will be annexed, you will not \\"lead\\" the federation, you cannot take leadership of it in any way, you have to win independence)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"EXACTLY.

First, you talk about demanding Sharia law and being tried under it as if they are the same thing. They are not. There is a difference between people demanding a completely new legal system based on Sharia law and incorporating aspects of a different legal system into the existing legal system. The latter is actually quite common, especially for lesser crimes. Where I live in Canada, for example, Indigenous people who commit minor crimes can often end up going through a legal system determined by their specific indigenous community rather than the normal Canadian justice system. I'm not a legal expert so I can not speak to the nuances of it, but I can say that I do not think non-violent offenders facing consequences from their community rather than the state is a substantially harmful problem, and further I believe the community punishments have to be consistent with Canadian rights and freedoms, so a community cannot for example decide that they should be allowed to stone gay people to death.You do not cite any sources, but from a little researching this seems to be what the Muslim immigrants polled want in Europe. Not a total restructuring of European law to Sharia law, but instead the ability for Muslim communities to practice Sharia Law within their communities. I think that with proper oversight that's wouldn't be harmful at all and may even ease up pressure on the traditional justice system for minor crimes.\\nThe harsh bullet points you list off are absolutely law in many Muslim countries, but that doesn't mean that Sharia law has to include those things nor that the Muslims in Europe are advocating them. Those things shouldn't be law anywhere, and I do not think it's particularly difficult to allow Sharia law for minor non-violent crimes while still not tolerating extremely backwards, sexist, and violent laws such as the ones you have listed.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"I agree 100%. \\nBasically they are saying when demanding sharia: we want to kill you, please let us!","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"There was a whole show about this.

They are not saying what you can say, they are saying no one can say anything in this one place. This is allowed if they can provide an adequate national security or public welfare reason and show that there is no reasonable and adequately effective alternative to this. In this case, TikTok was essentially bugging your phone. Which, fine. Many phones and apps are eavesdropping, but how often is the conversation of the people around you being sent to CCP through those other apps? What if you live near a military base or near a government building? that provides more of a national security risk when you happen to be around those people in public. This is one example. There are numerous other valid security concerns.This does not provide a dangerous precedent. If a company has an allegience to a foreign country then they are not entitled to the Constitutional rights of Americans. While the constitution applies to all individuals in America, it only applies to domestic entities or those with substantial (meaning more than half) of their business ties here. Which TT does not have. This isnt an exception to free speech, because free speech doesnt even apply because they dont have standing to claim a constitutional right.  \\n  \\nIf red note is also operated by or reporting to CCP , then that will likely face a looming ban as well. The government is not saying that no foreign entity can operate here and be a social media platform. They are saying that if they are going to, they have to abide by American laws. That is the rule for any entity in any country. TikTok's parent company refused to do that and when given the alternative of divesting all ownership and allegience with China, they chose to go to court instead. This legislation is supported by precedent. The ban would not create or expand any dangerous precedent. This precedent to legislate on content-neutral regulations has been established since at least the 60s. This ban is Constitutional. I am just saying.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"I think Diddy.

Moving through La Mesa, Santee and El Cajon. Completely clear and sunny. You would think others would have spotted it, was in good view for at least 5 minutes before speeding off East and out of sight. My guess is people were just either glued to their phones or looking at the cars in traffic heading back home. Or they don't want the extra attention or negative associations discussing it.

I just figure we are all going to see something, so it's no longer some big secret.I had to yell down my street at the neighbors to get their attention to look up. The birds knew something was going down though. Unlike the stories of everything going quiet, it was the opposite. The craft was dead silent, but the birds all started screaming and all took flight.  Had my family try to livestream it to a group of friends, but the phone could not make anything out because it looked like a tube head-on, and only revealed the rounded oval ring / disk shape when it made a couple of turns reflecting the sunlight and revealing the metallic nature of it. Even if I had an awesome camera to get a shot, it looked like something AI would generate, or something CGI. It did not have a glow, but maybe a slight mirage-like discoloration around it. I had never seen anything like it, or anything resembling what's been documented. That's why I been lately obsessing over these threads to see if someone else saw something like it.

I know that when I'm (semi-)volunteering for stuff, it doesn't get done until the week it's due.  That said, from other threads it appears I (being a modeler) overestimated how flexible folks can be on that. While ideally academics would not take on reviewer responsibilities when they are busy a.) Commitments do come up unexpectedly, and b.) there is the issue of small fields. I know a former academic who worked on an esoteric subject with about 15-20 academics globally working it (I note also that it was not a completely trivial issue in biology, just not an area that lends itself to large sums of grant money). Many of those 15-20 academics had published with each other within the last five years, which meant that this researchers reviewer pool was often down to &lt;10 people. As a result their papers were being reviewed by almost identical reviewer teams on a regular basis, requiring a lot of these researchers.That's a fair point, I didn't think about there being a tiny pool of available reviewers (my area is niche, but it's close enough to the broader field that I wouldn't be worried about someone from a different niche reviewing things).  In that case you more or less have to go with whatever's going to get enough reviewers with suitable expertise.  !delta Unfortunately, I think until peer review, the publishing industry and probably academic contracts in general are reevaluated we unfortunately have to accept that people will occasionally take a long time to complete their peer review duties. If you take peer review on I think you should try to see to it in a timely manner and keep the editor informed if you are late, but I think that's all you can ask of volunteers.True.  I wasn't arguing that should never happen, but just that it'd be better if the default deadline was shorter - but that view's been changed.","title":"CMV: peer review deadlines [at least in the sciences] should not be longer than approx. 1 month."},{"text":"Where's the Church of Satan when you need them?","title":"Supreme Court takes up case claiming Obamacare promotes homosexual behavior.

While I agree we have have social platforms that polarize us just as well as TikTok, this isn't the main concern of the US government when it comes to TikTok. Repeatedly, the US has asked to review the algorithm that TikTok uses to run it's platform and they have repeatedly denied the US access. Meta, Snap, and X are all willing and able to provide our government with information about how information is disseminated across their platforms. TikTok does not provide this level of access.  The second issue lacking in your comment is the issue of reciprocity. Meta, Snap, and X are all free to access the US market and other markets internationally. Additionally, if a founder wants to start a new network, they are welcome to do so within the US. However, the CCP actively restricts the access of these social networks within China, and does not allow US citizens to operate a social network within China. Facebook has never been allowed to operate within China. From this point of view, why should we allow a foreign entity access to our marketplace without a reciprocal agreement?","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"Ok, I am gwtting real tired of religious people ruining shit for everyone else...and I consider myself a religious person.

Maybe I just am too hopeful with others intentions, maybe Im looking for some shred of legitimacy in our system, maybe Im partially correct and all of the above are true.And yeah, AOC connected with the voting block. In her district and on progressive websites. But the unfortunate reality is that too many people will watch Fox News call her a crazy radical who wants to use Ukraine funds to perform sex change operations in high school dressing rooms (or whatever the conspiracy theory I vogue is), *or* hear this on MSNBC and NPR as they continue to invite these insane pundits on to try to appear less biased, and take that message to heart for her to be successful in a publicly elected scope. I agree she should have been appointed to the House Oversight Committee, but this is the thought process behind those who pull the strings at that level (or, perhaps they want a political ally in that position, or feel they ought to reward someone for being helpful in previous years). I wish wed see an introduction of term limits and people like Pelosi would transition into consultants for new blood politicians instead of retaining the highest ranking positions they can for decades.And yeah, best of luck. It looks like were in for some bad times - but in the 60s we also had it rough. We had a progressive president assassinated in the public memory; high school graduates being forced into an unpopular and morally wrong war; we had POC being forced out of the democratic process, redlined into ghettos, and getting fire-hosed on national TV with half the country supporting this action; gays being actively repressed from public consciousness; the destruction of a sustainable economy with policy pushing more and more towards supply side economics and unchecked expense spending; the constant, looming threat of nuclear war; a previously unprecedented executive espionage scandal and on and on. I fear for our immediate future, but cling to the hope that it is not the end of legitimacy in this country. Sometimes looking with a critical lense at our past lets me continue to breathe through the anxiety.

Why is it a problem for science to go slowly? Respectfully, from what I can tell, the only argument provided for why a review should not take more than a month is that it was inconvenient for you. Well, that's certainly what prompted the post, but it's a more general problem in this case because my area is (since the tech just recently got there) moving very fast (across several groups and coupled to large-scale applications).  I'd guess peer review takes about half as long as the actual research and writing for a lot of the current work.  So I've had it happen where very relevant work I'd love to have looked at comes out six months after it was submitted, and a month or two after I submit my paper where I would have cited it.  That's not a one-off.  For example, going through code in detail,Your field includes code in the peer review?  I'm impressed.  I've only seen maybe 10-20% of reviewers so far give any indication of having looked at the code, and it's not required. considering whether the measurement actually captures the thing the authors care about, and thinking about whether there is other related work that the authors may have missed. None of those is a trivial consideration. Fair points.  I'd put that down to my post being too broad - we've got a pretty straightforward set of metrics over here and not a huge amount of literature to sift through - but needing to narrow it down is a change. !delta Is the goal to be efficient? Or is it to find truth? And if we rush only to publish spurious conclusions--which are much harder to get rid of than prevent in the first place--then the problem of bad research also compounds. All the more reason to take the time to be thoughtful and considered during peer review. Do we want our science fast or do we want our science accurate?Well, preferably both, but I was assuming that a month is enough for a thorough review.  You're getting the second delta on points in that direction.I do think that efficiency matters, though, especially given the way research can accumulate exponentially.  A 10% slowdown adds up after a while.  (I'm biased here because my field is tightly coupled to a set of applications that can move very quickly from research to real-world prediction.) I have never completed a peer review in less than 12 hours, and usually, I take closer to 18-24. And it's not just the amount of time it takes; I need large blocks of time to think deeply and thoughtfully.Given the points above, that makes sense. Lastly, I think we need to acknowledge that the peer-review system, as it currently operates, largely benefits the corporations that own journals. Sure, there are some society journals (though I pay my annual membership fees for those), but in my field, there are many more journals and more prestigious journals that are owned by corporations. It's crucial that we remember who is actually benefitting from the peer-review system. I honestly believe that science would benefit from focusing less on the number of publications (each with their own publication costs) and more on the quality of the science being done.True.  But I think number of publications is somewhat separate from submission-to-publication time.","title":"CMV: peer review deadlines [at least in the sciences] should not be longer than approx. 1 month."},{"text":"Non Stop Impeachment.

BOTH DONALD &amp; MELANIA DIDNT ATTEND BIDENs INNAUGARATION."},{"text":"I am an academic, and while I agree in principle, we have to be realistic about what is propping up the peer review process. As you know, it's academics giving up their time for free (see note for non academics).When there is zero financial incentive to review (and very little in the way of other compensation or prestige) and immense pressure is put on academics to produce research, grant applications and quality teaching, while also dealing with their family life etc, we have to be realistic and accept that reviewing is the first thing that will fall by the wayside.While ideally academics would not take on reviewer responsibilities when they are busy a.) Commitments do come up unexpectedly, and b.) there is the issue of small fields. I know a former academic who worked on an esoteric subject with about 15-20 academics globally working it (I note also that it was not a completely trivial issue in biology, just not an area that lends itself to large sums of grant money). Many of those 15-20 academics had published with each other within the last five years, which meant that this researchers reviewer pool was often down to &lt;10 people. As a result their papers were being reviewed by almost identical reviewer teams on a regular basis, requiring a lot of these researchers.Would it have been better if the only people in the world who were truly qualified to review their paper said (truthfully) that they were too busy? Maybe, but one could make the argument that if you take this path the science itself would suffer, which is not a great outcome. Furthermore, if you boot reviewers who take longer than a month automatically you are then back to square one, looking for a new reviewer. While it might be ok to proceed if one of three reviewers drop out (though not ideal), where do we draw the line? Would you be comfortable if a paper was reviewed by one person? How many people should the editor ask before giving up the search for new reviewers?Unfortunately, I think until peer review, the publishing industry and probably academic contracts in general are reevaluated we unfortunately have to accept that people will occasionally take a long time to complete their peer review duties. If you take peer review on I think you should try to see to it in a timely manner and keep the editor informed if you are late, but I think that's all you can ask of volunteers.N.B. For non-academics reading this. Academics do not get paid to peer review papers (PR being the process of evaluating and correcting other workers papers prior to final publication). Academics also do not receive payment to publish papers from journals, in fact the opposite is true with universities usually footing the publication costs for their employees.Most academic journals are owned by publishing companies (though some are run by societies and charities). Large academic publishing houses make a lot of money, Wiley regularly has a turnover of ~$2bn P/A, while Elsevier turns over ~$3.5bn P/A. Public universities are at least partially funded by tax, so when a university pays the publishing costs to one of the journals run by these companies, it is funded partially by the public. Much of the research published is also funded by tax payer money. Wiley and Elsevier journals will then charge the public to read the research they paid for or charge the university extra to make the paper 'open access'.","title":"CMV: peer review deadlines [at least in the sciences] should not be longer than approx. 1 month."},{"text":"![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)","title":"NO BIG DEAL.

Why is it a problem for science to go slowly? Respectfully, from what I can tell, the only argument provided for why a review should not take more than a month is that it was inconvenient for you. Some other things to consider:I can imagine it might take quite a while to thoroughly evaluate, say, a philosophical or mathematical argumentIn my field, there's a lot of stuff that requires lots of time. For example, going through code in detail, considering whether the measurement actually captures the thing the authors care about, and thinking about whether there is other related work that the authors may have missed. None of those is a trivial consideration. that's no reason to just accept the inefficiency, and if one paper builds on another, that delay compounds.Is the goal to be efficient? Or is it to find truth? And if we rush only to publish spurious conclusions--which are much harder to get rid of than prevent in the first place--then the problem of bad research also compounds. All the more reason to take the time to be thoughtful and considered during peer review. Do we want our science fast or do we want our science accurate?My thinking is that if you can't find \\\\~8 hours or so (the time commitment suggested by AGU's how-to-do-peer-review article) - total, not all at once - in the next month, you're not going to reliably find it within any time frame.?I have never completed a peer review in less than 12 hours, and usually, I take closer to 18-24. And it's not just the amount of time it takes; I need large blocks of time to think deeply and thoughtfully. I would not trust myself to peer review in one-hour long periods across a week. Plus, in my position, only 10% of my distribution of effort is for service (and peer reviews are considered service), which is only half a day a week of time. And peer reviews are only a small part of the service I am expected to complete. I am technically compensated for this service, but minimally. I don't really need some editor breathing down my neck when I have so many other more pressing things to juggle, too. Lastly, I think we need to acknowledge that the peer-review system, as it currently operates, largely benefits the corporations that own journals. Sure, there are some society journals (though I pay my annual membership fees for those), but in my field, there are many more journals and more prestigious journals that are owned by corporations. It's crucial that we remember who is actually benefitting from the peer-review system. I honestly believe that science would benefit from focusing less on the number of publications (each with their own publication costs) and more on the quality of the science being done.","title":"CMV: peer review deadlines [at least in the sciences] should not be longer than approx. 1 month."},{"text":"I meanyay?

I'm not saying it's not, but I haven't read anything about this. All I know is that it's apparently better at predicting the kind of content that would keep people scrolling and feeding them more of it, not that it's more polarizing. TikTok in China is a fundamentally different app with a completely different algorithm. I find that at least interesting.It's a product of regulation. Chinese government regulates internet pretty strongly, many would argue too much. Part of that is that they have restrictions in place regarding how algorithms can function, and they even try to cap how long the youth can remain online at any one time. America could get Tiktok to be less addictive, but that involves putting forward legislation to regulate it to that effect, and the same thing ought to be done to every social media platform since every problem Tiktok has is a problem that all the other social media platforms do too. In fact that's pretty much what everyone against the ban are arguing - that the ban will literally do nothing to help Americans because with Tiktok gone, some other company will just fill the void. If congress actually cares about reigning in social media companies, they should be targeting them all. social media in general is the biggest psychological experiment in history, completely uncontrolled and unhingedI completely agree. I don't think an outright ban is a solution, but there needs to be a fundamental shift in how this stuff is regulated, to avoid loopholes. And the regulation but help with both data privacy and the addictive nature of those algorithms. A good case study is the EU's internet data privacy law which forced websites to ask users' permission to use tracking cookies. In theory, it's a good way of making sure people only get tracked with their consent. However, the companies being the self-interested ghouls that they are, got around that by using that annoying popup banner you see at the bottom of websites where they have the trackers enabled by default and ask if you want to switch them off, and in order to do so you have to then manually go into the settings and know which button to click.I don't know what the solution should be, and don't feel I'm well-informed enough to have a concrete opinion. But as it stands, I'm leaning toward just banning the collection of data entirely, unless for very specific circumstances such as when engaging with medical practices and such. Because let's be real, data collection is intrusive and a violation of the spirit of privacy rights, even if it's not technically against the law. The fact that my doctor has to explicitly ask me for any information they need while some random website is able to automatically track my online activity and use it to figure out who I am with zero consequences is insane.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"So thatll last less than a week.

In 2016, Chuck Schumer said this about the Democratic Partys strategy:For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.Basically, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate admitted that they are actively seeking to be the moderate Republican Party. He is still the Democratic senate leader, being unanimously reelected on December of 2024.AOC, someone who seems to actually connect with voters and is a progressive, got flanked by Pelosi when she ran to be the ranking member on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee. Instead, due to Pelosis machinations and the people who follow her lead, AOC lost out to Gerry Connolly, a 74-year old with cancer.Jack Smiths report just dropped that basically told us Trump would be convicted of election interference if he hadnt won (per DOJ policy, they cant indict a sitting POTUS). The Democratic Party told us how bad Trump was and that electing him would mean the end of democracy. Once he won, there was no fighting back. No investigations about election interference or fraud or anything. They rolled over, claiming the high road, even though Trump and his cronies are known cheaters. They offered no push back or fight.With immigration, illegal border crossings are highly unpopular with U.S. voters. However, legal immigration is popular. Dreamers/DACA recipients (those who were brought to the U.S. as kids and have lived basically their entire lives here and are productive members of society) are highly supported by both democrats and republicans. Yet, this bill that Gallegos co-sponsored attacks all of the above. Does something need to be done about immigration? Yes, but that doesnt mean you sign (or friggin co-sponsor) a MAGA bill. They could argue for different language so that this new bill doesnt affect legal immigrants or Dreamers and that they have to be found guilty instead of simply charged with a crime to be put in detention. They have the numbers (at least in the Senate) to block it if necessary. They didnt. Theyre signing on.Why? Its not for the betterment of the people. Its because they saw that Trump was reelected and figured the best way to keep their necks safe and political career alive was to go along with it. At worst, theyre accomplices. At best, theyre spineless scumbags who are letting it all happen without fighting back. And it guarantees that the GOP will keep on winning (if elections are still a thing), because no one will want to show up for a Republican-lite party, at least not enough to beat the real thing.Best of luck, friend, and hope we all make it out alive.","title":"Elizabeth Warren Uses Hegseth's Own Words To Call Out Sudden 'About Face' On Women In Military: 'We've Got The Video'"},{"text":"Yep, the amount of deals that have fallen through last minute or renegged on.

That's all we know because, unlike the fake Illuminati, the real Illuminati doesn't plaster its symbols everywhere and knows how to keep a secret.

Do you think I'd disagree with this?Collusion has a very specific legal definition and this does not meet it.Given that they're being currently sued for anti-trust I'd argue that they do, but here I'll quote my other post and you tell me if this looks competitive. I genuinely don't think you understand what they do:1. YieldStar uses nonpublic, competitively sensitive information to allow competitors to generate prices. This includes not only public data like \\"What is the rent\\" but things like renewal rates, discounts, occupancy, expected occupancy, tenent data etc. Most jobs would fire you for leaking this information to competitors.\\n2. YieldStar TOS involves landlords agreeing to use the software 'as designed', meaning to let it set the prices. 85% of all rentals under Yieldstar were within 5% of the algorithmically recommended value. This price is based on the sum total of all of the nonpublic anticompetitive data provided to the company and effectively sets the market price in an area.\\n3. Landlords who differentiate from the pricing by more than 1% have to explain why to a Yieldstar agent. If the agent cannot convince them to stay with the software they are escalated up to a regional manager who will again explain the importance of sticking to pricing.\\n4. Realpage has a consistent business refrain of \\"A rising tide lifts all boats\\" and uses this argument when landlords attempt to defer from strict pricing. This is a tacit acknowledgment that they are fixing prices by avoiding competition.\\n5. Realpage explains that their software 'reveals hidden yield'. In context this yield is the amount that would normally be lost through competition where landlords do not share data with one another.\\n6. Internal Yieldstar document states the following: \\"Demand is fixed, but our piece of the pie is variable. Yieldstar recommends a Market Position every day, not a price. Previous achievement vs. Peers and Current need will *determine how competitive we need to be Each day*.\\n7. Yieldstar has a market floor below which it would not drop. In instances where a client cannot make occupancy without lowering prices the software instead reduces *occupancy* and optimizes against that lower number rather than simply lowering the rent as doing so may hurt other landlords.\\n8. Yieldstar includes a 'governor' that maximizes rents overall even if suboptimal for individual landlords. For example, if todays optimal price is better than yesterdays, it will recommend that price. If tomorrow's is lower the system will recommend yesterday's price in order to increase overall revenue even to the determent of the individual landlord at that moment.\\n9. Yieldstar uses 'lease expiration management' to collude between various landlords to minimize the overall number of units that come available at any one time and thus constrain supply to maximize leverage for the landlords as a whole, even to the detriment of individual landlords at specific times.This is price fixing by algorith. If you replaced yieldstar's algorithm with 'some guy named bob' as u/reborngod joked, this would be blatantly criminal.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"Ouch ??..., well the truth can easily hurt ??","title":"No One Wants A Biden Presidential Library"},{"text":"Probably forgot It/he/she has a back shaving appointment that day.","title":"Michelle Obama Will Skip Trumps Inauguration After Missing Jimmy Carters Funeral"},{"text":"Continuity, its better to have same director overseeing large departments for continuity.

The market can bear it, certainly, but that is because shelter is a basic human need. It is price gouging, pure and simple.But this argument goes toward *any* appraisal, credit report, or other intelligence/advice businesses buy from other businesses. Your 'price gouging because of need' is an emotional claim, not a legal one. Businesses don't exist because of a 'need'. They exist to make the owners money. Without this, they don't exist. it is akin to claim farmers are gouging consumers for food because it is essential. Or doctors are gouging patients because they need healthcare. It is an entitlement mentality that is quite toxic. If you have a building with 100 units each paying 1000 per month, that is 100,000 income. If you jack the rent up to $1,500 per month you can afford to let 33% of your property stand vacant and still break even.It is far more complicated in that empty units still cost money. And a totally full building limits oppertunity for market changes. But yea - every business is going to do an analysis for how to make the most money the most efficiently with the least risk. That's life. Consumers do the exact same thing. Part of the sickening behavior of this collusion is that it incentivizes landlords to hold vacant units in order to drive up the price.Collusion has a very specific legal definition and this does not meet it. Being advised what market rates are and deciding to charge those, even leaving units open, is a valid business decision whether you like it or not. Your complaint about this is like the complaints about there being three credit reporting agencies and literally all the banks use them. If you are denied one place, you are likely denied elsewhere. Sorry - no sympathy here.This software is just making it easier for landlords to know market rates for the model they want to charge. If people aren't colluding, the market would not support these prices. Are you kidding? The number of threads on housing shortages are almost daily. If they get 5-10% or less vacancy, the market very much IS supporting these prices as people are willing to pay them.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"In one state didn't not showing up disqualify the representative from running again?","title":"Minnesota House Democrats boycott first day of session, but Republicans move forward anyway"},{"text":"Well, you can't have a job like head of the dod going to some minority.  /s","title":"Democrats Say F.B.I.

In the US, it's pretty bad how much people don't understand how the military is used as a geopolitical tool. In post Iraq War/Afghanistan, I hear a lot of people criticize any forward deployment of US military as simply \\"American Imperialism\\". Additionally, the defense budget has been a very profound target as well. What a lot of them don't understand is that those forward deployments are meant to keep pressure and shift the calculus of those who desire to create conflict for XYZ reasons. Conflict in general is bad and always risks wider escalation that will overall make the world a less safe place. Furthermore, they don't understand the economic impact. Preserving global stability through defense pacts and forward deployment also serves to protect commercial routes and industries that are important for global trade. Instability doesn't just hurt local regions now. They also can severely impact the rest of the world. For example, Ukraine was one of the top exporters of wheat and grain. Since the war began, global prices have skyrocketed. Regarding the defense budget, yes, there is a lot of drifting and mismanagement. However, outright defunding or severe reduction in the current geopolitical climate is insane. Despite having the highest defense budget, we are running into increasingly severe manning and material issues. We are struggling to continue to modernize and expand, especially in the case of Navy, to preserve our ability to meet real world tasking. Although, I agree that we can't just throw money at the issue, I also believe that we are at war whether we like it or not, therefore, we can't afford to drastically cut spending either as many would like to help solve domestic issues. We simply make it more likely that the tense geopolitical climate shifts more towards a global conflict.","title":"CMV: Civilians not understanding war and international affairs is a severe threat to the democratic world"},{"text":"I saw literally nothing gay about the character personally,  he just has the sleezy car salesman, lawyer, or Hollywood producer vibe.Like he comes off like Billy Flynn from Chicago or Saul the lawyer from breaking bad, or Max Bialystock from the producers, or the monorail salesman from the Simpsons Just a fast talking philander How you got gay from him is wild to me.","title":"CMV: \\"X character is Y-coded\\" is just a socially-acceptable version of stereotyping."},{"text":"I don't think Micheal will be missed...","title":"Michelle Obama To Skip Trump 2.0 Inauguration"},{"text":"First I've ever heard of it too, wtf?","title":"MAGA's new darling: Dem.

But I will try to summarize.1. YieldStar uses nonpublic, competitively sensitive information to allow competitors to generate prices. This includes not only public data like \\"What is the rent\\" but things like renewal rates, discounts, occupancy, expected occupancy, tenent data etc. Most jobs would fire you for leaking this information to competitors.\\n2. YieldStar TOS involves landlords agreeing to use the software 'as designed', meaning to let it set the prices. 85% of all rentals under Yieldstar were within 5% of the algorithmically recommended value. This price is based on the sum total of all of the nonpublic anticompetitive data provided to the company and effectively sets the market price in an area.\\n3. Landlords who differentiate from the pricing by more than 1% have to explain why to a Yieldstar agent. If the agent cannot convince them to stay with the software they are escalated up to a regional manager who will again explain the importance of sticking to pricing.\\n4. Realpage has a consistent business refrain of \\"A rising tide lifts all boats\\" and uses this argument when landlords attempt to defer from strict pricing. This is a tacit acknowledgment that they are fixing prices by avoiding competition.\\n5. Realpage explains that their software 'reveals hidden yield'. In context this yield is the amount that would normally be lost through competition where landlords do not share data with one another.\\n6. Internal Yieldstar document states the following: \\"Demand is fixed, but our piece of the pie is variable. Yieldstar recommends a Market Position every day, not a price. Previous achievement vs. Peers and Current need will *determine how competitive we need to be Each day*.\\n7. Yieldstar has a market floor below which it would not drop. In instances where a client cannot make occupancy without lowering prices the software instead reduces *occupancy* and optimizes against that lower number rather than simply lowering the rent as doing so may hurt other landlords.\\n8. Yieldstar includes a 'governor' that maximizes rents overall even if suboptimal for individual landlords. For example, if todays optimal price is better than yesterdays, it will recommend that price. If tomorrow's is lower the system will recommend yesterday's price in order to increase overall revenue even to the determent of the individual landlord at that moment.\\n9. Yieldstar uses 'lease expiration management' to collude between various landlords to minimize the overall number of units that come available at any one time and thus constrain supply to maximize leverage for the landlords as a whole, even to the detriment of individual landlords at specific times.I can go on if you'd like, but this is just price fixing by algorithm.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"He/she is a complete c*nt and I dont use that word lightly.

Being shut out of a price fixing scheme would be pretty damning, or as one landlord put it:It actually gives me chills to think about what a disadvantage wed be at if we hadnt adopted YieldStar, knowing others are using it.As for what the pricing advisors do:AIRM and YieldStar provide daily price recommendations. RealPage has taken multiple steps to increase compliance with AIRM and YieldStar price recommendations. It designed AIRM and YieldStar to make it much easier to accept recommendations than to decline them. It built an auto-accept function and pushes clients to adopt it and increase its role. And its pricing advisors encourage landlords to follow AIRM and YieldStar pricing recommendations. Among their duties, pricing advisors review any request to override a price recommendation.So to lower your prices below the recommended levels requires you to get someone from RealPage to authorize it (even if they can't refuse it). Given that they can cut you off from the software if you fuck around, this check should functionally prevent any landlords from using the data for anything other than price fixing.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"Let him pass that FBI background check hes trying to get out of.","title":"Hegseth with the quick response had Elizabeth Warren stumped"},{"text":"Remember when it was revealed that the FBI actively ignored tips in the kavanaugh investigation at the request of the trump folks?","title":"Democrats Say F.B.I.

To pull straight from Propublica's article on the matter:This doesn't demonstrate that they're price fixing, it demonstrates that the software was good at measuring the market demand. That's what its supposed to do. Prices going up are the expected outcome if they were previously underpriced. This is why. Removing humans from this process eliminates basic human empathy and replaced it with an algorithm that maximizes two things, profits and by extension human misery.Lacking human empathy is also not price fixing. I'm not arguing that Yieldstar is good for renters (I'm aware that it's not!) Now you can say 'well the market can bear that', and that is true, but there is an exception to the above. The province of Saskatchewan had its own existing telecom (sasktel) with its own infrastructure. Their existence forced Robelus to actually compete for that market place, meaning Saskatchewan prices were roughly half of the canada-wide prices despite the fact that we are a rural hellscape that is basically the worst place for telecom to try and make money.There are still non-yieldstar landlords in the market all over the place providing this countermeasure, and in the case of the telecoms it sounds like they had an explicit agreement in place between them to fix the prices. *That* is what makes it price fixing, not the fact that they were able to command high prices. If you can demonstrate that Yieldstar is enforcing high prices among its clients that could change my view. Simply showing that prices went up won't change my view.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"This feels like a loaded question, but Ill be fully transparent.

Software that helps it's users find what the market will bear will always be bad for the users' clients, but only because the market is so skewed against them. The underlying issue is the shitty market, not the software doing the math to figure out how shitty the market is for renters.I'd argue that the software is price fixing, yes.With respect, you can literally see this in action. To pull straight from Propublica's article on the matter:\\"In one neighborhood in Seattle, ProPublica found, 70% of apartments were overseen by just 10 property managers, every single one of which used pricing software sold by RealPage.\\"If the majority of landlords are setting their prices not based on their competitors, but on what the software tells them is most profitable, that is just price fixing. Traditional price fixing is a bunch of people going into a smoke filled room and agreeing \\"We'll all take $500 for this, yes?\\" and the price goes up to $500 because there is no more competition. This is the same thing but with the veneer of the software doing it.The proof is in the pudding. Rents skyrocketed in areas using Yieldstar compared to places that did not. This isn't accidental and it isn't the result of knowing what your competitors are doing.Relying on the empathy of a business to keep prices low isn't a good policy. Building homes is, and that requires removing the barriers to construction.Back in the 70's IBM had a presentation with a quote that said:\\"A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision.\\"This is why. Removing humans from this process eliminates basic human empathy and replaced it with an algorithm that maximizes two things, profits and by extension human misery.This goes back to my chess bot analogy. Even identical algorithms competing against each other are still competing. Normal market mechanics still apply. The fact that the units are successfully rented out at those higher prices means that those prices are what the market will bear, and they just didn't know that before. I am in 100% agreement that those high prices suck, are harmful to tenants, but the proper solution is that we should build so much housing that we crush landlord's ability to raise rents.They aren't, though, they're colluding.To give you an example that might help, in Canada we have 'Robelus', which is Rogers, Telus and Bell. Together these three companies set the prices for basically all telecommunications in Canada, and for *decades* they have been price fixing, colluding with one another to make sure that no actual competition happened.The result is that Canadians pay more than any other developed nation for our telecoms.Now you can say 'well the market can bear that', and that is true, but there is an exception to the above. The province of Saskatchewan had its own existing telecom (sasktel) with its own infrastructure. Their existence forced Robelus to actually compete for that market place, meaning Saskatchewan prices were roughly half of the canada-wide prices despite the fact that we are a rural hellscape that is basically the worst place for telecom to try and make money.The point of this example is that saying 'well the market can bear it, therefor the price is fine' is asinine.  It is housing, people famously need shelter and they'll pay whatever they have to in order to get it.  A price can be inflated by collusion, and as a society we don't have to accept that, we can do something about it.The proper solution is to break the fucking spine of what is effectively a cartel. We did it with Standard Oil, with Microsoft and plenty of others. This is an anti-competitive practice and should be treated as such.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"It's projection for their closet, homosexual tendencies and need something to blame because they can't believe their Lord gave them those desires.","title":"Supreme Court takes up case claiming Obamacare promotes homosexual behavior.

Hes also going to face intense media scrutiny if he has a conflict of interest.Consider Pete Buttigieg, Bidens Transportation Secretary. The guy rightly faced scrutiny for his conflicts of interest being overly chummy with the airline industry he was supposed to regulate.  But ultimately that conflict of interest stench travels back to the White House, and Biden also rightfully gets the blame since its his administration.Thats how conflicts of interest with political appointees work.For conflicts of interest with career officials, its more dangerous however. Theres no political blowback for a random general having a conflict of interest. Not only that, but its easier for a general to hide their conflict of interest behind their expertise. When a general gives advice to buy from Lockheed Martin, how do you know if he genuinely thinks Lockheed has the best military capabilities OR if he is angling for a cozy job at Lockheed in retirement?You dont and thats the issue. The Secretary of Defense has a different role. They are not appointed for their military expertise. In fact, they are supposed to be separate from the military and its only in recent times that weve had former generals in that role. They are an intermediary between the generals and the White House.

The market can bear it, certainly, but that is because shelter is a basic human need. It is price gouging, pure and simple.Even then, market forces?*still*?apply. If I have empty units, they are costing me money in maintenance, utilities, taxes etc. It is in my interest to have those rented. Even in your example of $500 difference, if I can't fill the majority of the units, I am not coming out ahead. I am leaving money on the table with the empty units.This is the exact issue I was discussing. Let me give you an example.If you have a building with 100 units each paying 1000 per month, that is 100,000 income. If you jack the rent up to $1,500 per month you can afford to let *33%* of your property stand vacant and still break even.Part of the sickening behavior of this collusion is that it incentivizes landlords to hold vacant units in order to drive up the price. If all the major holders in a market use this software, it tends to aim for \\\\~5-10% vacancy rates, because setting the rent at $1500 with at 10% vacancy is better than setting it at $1200 with full occupancy. If people aren't colluding, the market would not support these prices. I'd jack my rent to $1500 and all of my tenants would move to places that pay $1000.

Super racist. But. It is just a fact to say that this is a common stereotype. This has been a popular insult against Jews for literally hundreds of years.\\nIf you say the Gringotts goblins are just like Jews, that's racist. If you say the Gringotts goblins are designed to look like a common and insulting Jewish stereotype, that's just recognizing the stereotype exists.\\nHere's a other example: the original Disney Jungle Book movie had a scene where orangutans sing a song in the style of Harlem Jazz. The song is about how they want to be more civilized and to become / be treated like real people. The leader of the orangutans is named King Louie, and one of if not the most recognizable black Harlem Jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong (often pronounced 'Louie'), and the voice actor even kind of sounds like Louis Armstrong's unique voice.\\n(Also worth noting, this movie came out almost 70 years ago, a mere 30 years after the Harlem Renaissance - jazz was still much more associated with black America back then than it is now. It would be like having the orangutans rap in a modern movie).\\nSo, we have (1) orangutans (a common insult for black people is to call them monkey or apes), (2) singing a specifically black kind of music, (3) admitting they are uncivilized (a common insult for black people), (4) led by a character with a similar name to a famous black musician from that style and in a way that sounds like he's imitating his voice.\\n(Another note: they actually wanted Louis Armstrong to voice the part until they decided that would be too racist. The voice actor they chose basically does a Louis Armstrong voice impression).\\nIt is widely considered to be extremely racist. To your point, it would be racist to say \\"they are like black people, because black people like jazz and are not civilized.\\" But it is *not* racist to admit that the stereotypes exist and that these orangutans are written to fit a bunch of them.\\nEdit: After writing this I remembered that not all \\"coding\\" is about insulting stereotypes. Sometimes it's about acknowledging issues real demographics face. Someone can be \\"gay coded\\" because they're trying to hide a personal secret from bigoted family members, or whatever. So maybe the movie isn't actually about a gay person, but lots of gay people identify with the character as a metaphor.

Traditionalism2. The Crusades 3. Oppression of Heretics  \\n  \\nThe first one attracts extremists because they know that Catholicism is the \\"tradition\\" denomination historically and present.  It's pretty self explanatory. They don't co opt Eastern Orthodoxy (an arguably even *more* traditional denomination) because they either don't know the EO even exists or because they've already picked catholicism and see Orthodoxy as \\"Heresy\\" (which also becomes their new favorite word). The second and third one are self explanatory; waging holy war to exterminate the enemies of traditional values *and* torture and execution of people who have the wrong beliefs? This is basically their wet dream, regardless if either are completely unjustifiable from a theological perspective. Additionally, the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church makes it super easy to figure out what the church believes and doesn't believe.

Seeing a lot of talk about revolutions and eating the rich in this thread so I'll probably get downvoted, but for the sake of being constructive and hopefully brightening your outlook there are a few things worth considering.  \\nA key part of that absurdly high and growing ratio is what makes up pay. A typical worker gets cash compensation compared to CEOs whose pay packages include a big chunk of equity compensation. Just doing some basic math, if you assume wages grow at inflation (I know, they don't), that'd be around a 2% increase per year. Compare that to say the S&amp;P 500 and assume it grows 10% a year, a large chunk of the CEOs pay will be tied to that higher growth rate, so the ratio will keep growing. In general, I'd say it's probably a good thing CEOs get equity compensation as they have skin in the game when it comes to health and growth of the company. I'm a big proponent of workers at all levels getting some form of equity compensation, it just becomes a lot more difficult for non-public, smaller companies. And even then, for lower paid employees I think many would rather receive 100% cash comp for 75% cash and 25% equity, since they won't actually be seeing that money for years and they have bills to pay. Even in that case, people would posting here comparing it to slavery by paying workers less cash and forcing them to stay at the company in order for their equity to vest.  \\nAs for the end of the country, people owning nothing, etc. I disagree. If that's a view you want changed, I think you'd need to be a lot more specific as to why you think that's the case.

Software that helps it's users find what the market will bear will always be bad for the users' clients, but only because the market is so skewed against them. The underlying issue is the shitty market, not the software doing the math to figure out how shitty the market is for renters.  Human beings have basic human empathy, and as a result you'd usually see 'reasonable' rent increasesRelying on the empathy of a business to keep prices low isn't a good policy. Building homes is, and that requires removing the barriers to construction.  Problem is, when several large landlords all agree to use the same software at the same time, normal market mechanics need not apply. Everyone gets hit with the same increases and no one is going to lower their prices because even if they fill up entirely they'll make less money than the guys renting at $1500/month.This goes back to my chess bot analogy. Even identical algorithms competing against each other are still competing. Normal market mechanics still apply. The fact that the units are successfully rented out at those higher prices means that those prices are what the market will bear, and they just didn't know that before. I am in 100% agreement that those high prices suck, are harmful to tenants, but the proper solution is that we should build so much housing that we crush landlord's ability to raise rents.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"Not really, if you quit em, hell pull up quick to get wit em","title":"Hegseth with the quick response had Elizabeth Warren stumped"},{"text":"Not as a % share of wealth at any given time.

Everyone gets hit with the same increases and no one is going to lower their prices because even if they fill up entirely they'll make less money than the guys renting at $1500/month.The counter to this is that evidently, the market will bear this increase and things were underpriced. Remember the goal of business - to make money. It is a balancing act to price goods high enough to make money while pricing them low enough to actually be sold. All this is really is a way to appraise the market. This has been done forever but with modern computing and software, it is much easier to get better data. As you said, the end goal of the business is to make money, and in this case, not to house as many people as possible. Once you understand a landlord is not concerned with making sure everyone is housesd, you understand the motivation. This software and this data provides information about what the rental market will bear and allow that business to increase profits (which is why they exist to start with).Even then, market forces *still* apply. If I have empty units, they are costing me money in maintenance, utilities, taxes etc. It is in my interest to have those rented. Even in your example of $500 difference, if I can't fill the majority of the units, I am not coming out ahead. I am leaving money on the table with the empty units. Simple example - 100 unit building. At 1000/month, I fill every unit. At 1500, I can only fill 50. Linear relationship with respect to rent (90 @1100, 80 @1200 etc). Doing the math, I make the most money when I fill all 100 units though the 90% level is likely the optimal at only $1,000 off the max but oppertunity to capitalize on market changes. 80% is still just $4k off the max. The 50% figure gives only 3/4's of the possible return. The 80-90% occupancy in this example is the optimal choice for the business as it nearly maximizes theoretical profit while still having the oppertunity to cash in should demand increase.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"This.

Human beings have basic human empathy, and as a result you'd usually see 'reasonable' rent increases, most staff don't make more money if the company makes more money, so their internal goal is to keep their bosses happy without actively hurting their tenants.Yieldstar took humans out of the equation and this got very bad, very quickly. Rental markets saw 20%-50% rent increases over the course of a single year because the ruthless software went 'well if we jack everyone's rent 50% we'll temporarily ten tenants in this 100 unit building,  but we'll make it up from the rest.The thing is, you couldn't normally get away with that in most markets. If I jack my rent from $1000/month to $1500/month people will move across the street to the guys renting at $1000/month.Problem is, when several large landlords all agree to use the same software at the same time, normal market mechanics need not apply. Everyone gets hit with the same increases and no one is going to lower their prices because even if they fill up entirely they'll make less money than the guys renting at $1500/month.That last part is what you're missing.

Could Facebook have done more, absolutely, but who was paying Cambridge Analytica? Russia and China.'Now, about this algorithm theory. While China's government definitely isn't winning any freedom awards, the idea that they're specifically using TikTok to polarize America? We're doing that just fine on our own, folks. Have you SEEN Facebook and X lately? American-owned platforms are FULL of extreme content and echo chambers. The polarization problem exists across ALL social media - it's not unique to TikTok.'It is a FACT that content the CCP does not like gets suppressed on Tik Too Vs other social media channels  e.g. Tianenmen Square, Honk Kong protest, Uyghur cultural genocide, origins of COVID etc. posts about such things end up getting X50 more engagement on Insta. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/business/tiktok-china.html'Here's the real kicker - and this is what nobody's talking about - banning TikTok sets a DANGEROUS precedent for government control over social media. Today it's TikTok, tomorrow it could be ANY platform that the government decides is \\"problematic.\\" Is that really the power we want to give to our government?'This is the fairest point they've made. As someone who's lived in China and as a result has seen the effects of media repression, I instinctively stand up for freedom of expression. Problem is, China do this banning because they know the destructive capability of a free internet (they would know as they are the ones using social media to divide us). I am really torn on this because more and more I'm starting to think we do need certain restrictions on free speech, namely restricting the ability for hostile governments and billionaire oligarchs to divide us. But it's a tough one, as it could be a slippery slope.'And let's talk about those 170 MILLION American users - many of whom are small business owners who depend on TikTok for their livelihood. A ban would devastate these entrepreneurs overnight. The economic impact would be massive.'They'll find new alternatives.'The solution isn't a ban - it's better data privacy laws that apply to ALL companies, regardless of where they're based. We need to address the root cause instead of playing whack-a-mole with individual apps.'No, the banning of tik tok has nothing to do with data protection, it's an entirely separate issue and a red herring in this conversation.'If you're worried about data privacy and social media's negative effects, you should be pushing for comprehensive reform, not celebrating selective bans that won't solve the underlying problems.'Again, this is not about data protection, it's about geopolitical rivals having a tool to divide us, and perhaps crucially, a tool they don't allow us to use on them.Your original comment was pretty on point, so no need to change your view too much.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"What?

As you probably understand, Russia is no democracy, a nation veering past authoritarianism into totalitarianism, with more Russians persecuted for political activity since the days of Joseph Stalin.Faith in democracy is unquestionably on the decline. A new study finds that a fifth of Britons under 45 believe that the best system for running a country effectively is a strong leader who doesnt have to bother with elections compared with 8% of their older counterparts.Its no wonder democracy seems increasingly unappealing to them and to their peers in other countries who have suffered at the sharp end of neoliberalism. In France, for example, nearly a third of young people say they have lost faith in democracy.Democracy under capitalism has always been heavily curtailed by corporate interests and plutocrats who have enjoyed far greater power than the average voter. When capitalism falls into crisis, as it did in 2008, its profound flaws generate popular fury.The question is who harnesses this.

To me this reads like the most prescriptive part:  The creed tells us were no better than anybody else but also no worse. What liberals value should be within everyones reach. A liberal person wants to be generous, open, alive to new possibility, willing to learn from anyone. We want to share whatever wealth and fortune we have, to welcome strangers to our table, to stand up for people when theyre in trouble. We know we have to change our minds when someones idea is better than ours. We have faith that history rewards those willing to fight for what they believe. Now, none of us is ever as generous as wed like to be, and no liberal has a monopoly on generosity, but the largeness of spirit it calls us to does define our horizon of hope. Such values are embattled today, and they need defending because our societies so desperately need largeness of spirit, together with a revived liberal ideal of solidarity.  My read of it is that generous-minded universalism is the core of liberalism and straying from that (into cultural fragmentation re race, gender etc)  is the cause of liberalism's decline. I don't think we can blame these cultural issues in the way the author wants. What were we going to do? Not pass the civil rights acts of the 50s and 60s? Not allow any immigration from non-European countries after 1960? Not allow women to open their own bank accounts? Reactionaries are reacting to real social changes (often for the better). Sure there may be excesses we can point to and learn from, but I find painting the whole reforms of the 60's and 70s with contemporary debates  and weakens the author's argument. I think his point is not that these reforms were bad but the reactions to stamp out opposition is what was bad. Potentially, but it seems too muddled and that part gets lost.I also think the solutions are generally agreeable, but lack for mechanism of how to get people to value liberalism over retreating to reactionary fear? Overall I think the piece is an interesting take even if I don't find it especially feasible.In short, I read the article as telling us to eat more vegetables without saying much on how.","title":"I was born liberal.

Is the existence of a precedent that already existed that much of an existential threat? Isn't this whataboutism? First they came for the 8chan, and OP did not speak outbecause they didn't use 8chan.Now they're coming for TikTok. OP thinks they should speak out before there are no places left to speak out.hey.. do you work for bytedance?Not everyone you disagree with is a shill. Also, be careful, I think accusing people of being shills might be against the rules.Demanding comprehensive reforms is such a lazy hand wave of an argument. Demanding the company stores data in the United States was too extreme (according to you) but comprehensive reforms aren't?Moving all the data storage infrastructure for one of the most popular social media apps would be incredibly expensive and solve nothing. And I really mean it would solve nothing. How would it even work? Let's walk through it:Step 1.Byte Dance agrees and moves all data to a US datacenter.2.Byte Dance sets up an encryted VPN to the datacenter in order to work in the datacenter remotely from China, where the developers live. 3.Either the benefits are already gone, or the US forces them to hand over thier encryption keys.4. Byte Dance hands over the keys.5. Byte Dance hires an American employee, who lives in the US and connects to the datacenter via a different VPN.Now, does the US government demand the keys for the American employee? The data is staying in the US. Lets say they don't, for that reason.6. CCP connects to American employee's home network via VPN. Well, that won't work, I guess we have to monitor the US citizen's VPN between their US home and thier US place of employment. 6. The US forces TikTok to hand over keys for communications that happen entirely in the US.7. CCP connects to American employee's home network via VPN.Whoops. I guess we need to monitor the American's internet use, to see if they connect to China.7. US forces American citizen to install some kind of spy device on thier internet connection to prevent them from connecting to China8. US citizen downloads data, transfers it to a harddrive, and uses a different connection to upload it to the CCP.Shit.8. US citizen is forced to have every single electronic device they own monitored by the US government.9. US citizen stores some work files in Dropbox.10. CCP connects to that dropbox accountDamn.10. US government forces Dropbox to hand over all encryption keys for thier buisness, and forces them to allow all connections to China.11. Employee uses Google Drive instead.See where this is going? In order for it to work, the US goverment has to monitor every employee 24/7 across all devices, and get encryption keys and monitoring for every third party the company uses (Microsoft, Google, Dropbox, Amazon, etc.) or perhaps force ByteDance to develop thier own email server, file storage, calendar software, search engine, etc. in house in order to avoid having to monitor every single US company.  Step 587: The datacenter where TikTok was forced to store thier data gets breached and all the data gets released to China anyway, rendering steps 1-586 moot.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":" His empathy only extends to some people.I disagree.

[To quote the investigation:](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4844069-realpage-sued-for-rental-price-manipulation/)The complaint alleges that RealPages agreements and conduct harm the competitive process in local rental markets for multi-family dwellings across the United States. Armed with competing landlords data, RealPage also encourages loyalty to the algorithms recommendations through, among other measures, auto accept functionality and pricing advisors who monitor landlords compliance. As a result, RealPages software tends to maximize price increases, minimize price decreases, and maximize landlords pricing power. RealPage also trained landlords to limit concessions (e.g., free month(s) of rent) and other discounts to renters. The complaint also cites internal documents from RealPage and landlords touting the fact that landlords have responded by reducing renter concessions.The complaint separately alleges that RealPage has unlawfully maintained its monopoly over commercial revenue management software for multi-family dwellings in the United States, in which RealPage commands approximately 80% market share. Landlords agree to share their competitively sensitive data with RealPage in return for pricing recommendations and decisions that are the result of combining and analyzing competitors sensitive data. This creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop that strengthens RealPages grip on the market and makes it harder for honest businesses to compete on the merits.In fact, as RealPages Vice President of Revenue Management Advisory Services described,?**there is greater good in everybody succeeding versus essentially trying to compete against one another**?in a way that actually keeps the entire industry downAnd part of that investigation is that it appears that Yieldstar may have deliberately kicked out users of their software who didn't go with their pricing model.  IE \\"To get this data, you have to set prices how we tell you to.\\"  That hasn't been proven in court though.","title":"CMV: YieldStar, the rent pricing software used by landlords, isn't price fixing."},{"text":"Youre trying to apply limits of logic to a theoretically limitless being.First of all, an omnipotent being by definition should also be omniscient, as being all powerful means you have the power to also be all knowing. Its not like looking into the future and being unable to change what you are going to do, its like knowing what you do in the future because you already did it and exist in the past, present,and future simultaneously.And while occurring to the logic we are restricted by, yes, creating a rock so heavy God couldnt lift it seems like a paradox. But omnipotent means you dont have to be restricted by logic. You cant expect an all powerful being to be understandable under human logic, our brains are far from perfect machines.As for the biblical stuff, thats a specific interpretation of God, its possible that God is real and the Bible is completely false. The issue I personally have some sects of Christianity is they interpret the Bible as being just as perfect as God is, while humans are incapable of perfection. Youre gonna find errors and contradictions in a collection of stories that old, especially when the oldest used to be spread purely through word of mouth.But Christianity aside, its impossible to disprove the existence of an omnipotent being. If such a being does exist, it is not bound to any rules of logic and reasoning we know. Its like a blind person speculating what colors look like.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Having spoken with Chinese exchange students, I am not sure I agree with the notion that there is either a greater trust in their government, nor a belief in wanting to help fellow nationals.

There are a lot of parallels between this era of history and a previous era known as the Gilded Age which stretched from around 1875-1900. That era also had a large wealth gap, government corruption, polarization, media manipulation, populism, nativism, and racial division. That era also had many seemingly positive similarities to ours in that the economy was consistently growing and on paper wages were increasing, as well as high voter turnout, yet people still felt like something was off. That feeling of something being off then as now is likely that, due to partisan polarization, the government isnt effectively responding to the needs of the citizens. So, how did this change in 1900? Well eventually polarization ebbed and local governments began to push for reform. That trickled up to federal leaders who followed suit with reform. During the Gilded Age many historians believe it was the Third Great Awakening a revival of religion that pushed people away from racialism, nativism, and economic polarization and towards seeking common ground on good government reforms that we now call the Progressive Movement. The role of religion may or may not be relevant today, but essentially the idea is that the wealth gap increased so much that even well off middle class people and even some of the very wealthy began to look for ways to improve society. They claimed it was for religious and ideological purposes but the modern reform efforts may or may not root itself in the same religious and ideological grounds. However, it is important to note that the progressive movement was bipartisan and started in local government reform movements. So, if you want to be the change you want to see in the world try and reach across the aisle and find common ground. Push for local reforms within your community that arent tied to the blue or red teams. Who knows, maybe those reforms will be successful and break the current doomloop we are in just as they did a century ago.","title":"CMV: We will look back in 50 years and think the CEO to pay ratio was really low in 2025, compared to 2075 in the US."},{"text":"Use your stop dancing around the point.
