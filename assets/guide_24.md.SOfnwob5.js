Because I can tell you for a fact that there are firms / countries / circumstances where it definitely happensThere are certainly situations in which action should be taken. I think that actual sanctions or outright bans make far more sense than tariffs in these situations. Somewhat reducing demand for products generated through profound injustices seems like a pretty lacklustre response. It feels like you're choosing the wrong tool for the job, just to justify owning the tool.Nowhere have I suggested that there are no objectionable practices going on anywhere in the global economy. But these things aren't the norm. And it's the norm that I think is worth talking about. Unless you only want to impose tariffs of countries and goods especially associated with these forms of compulsion, I can't see that specific abuses justify blanket restrictions.Are you saying forming a judgement about how other people do things in other countries is intrinsically wrong? As in we can't have our own values and set our domestic policies accordingly?I'm saying it's incredibly presumptuous to think that you know how the lives of strangers in distant countries should work better than those people. I'm saying that you aren't just proposing domestic policy when you try to impose an economic cost on other countries based on their domestic policies. Of course, you can have your own domestic policies. I think every people should be entitled to make their own domestic policies, within reason. A risk of that is that the world might not have a totally uniform minimum wage. I'm happy to take that risk.Hmmm I don't know what to tell you on this one because it is about as close to an objectively understood fact as you can get with this sort of thing. Care to substantiate that in any way? I'm not sure that's what I'd read if I cracked open an economics textbook.Can you really not see that some people accept things that they otherwise wouldn't if they had more agency? I realize that can be true of anyone, but it is especially problematic where it eats into the basic fundamentals of human dignity.Of course I recognise this. That's exactly why my threshold for whether an economic relationship is exploitative is meaningful consent. But consent doesn't require total agency. Agency requires that a person are genuinely free to choose between the available options, and that those options aren't unreasonably restricted. It doesn't require that every imaginable option be made available. People aren't victims of injustice any time they're unable to do the thing they would most prefer to do. I don't know exactly what fundimentals of human dignity are at stake when an auto worker in Mexico is paid a third as much as an American auto worker would be for doing a similar job. But it seems like material wellbeing and the opportunity provide a better life for one's family must count for something. How does limiting employment opportunities facilitate that?Do you really think its in any nation's interest for their 'strength' to be unskilled, low paid, dangerous, labor intensive work? Does relying on this type of labor strengthen the country, or does it entrench poverty and underdevelopment?Desperation and grinding poverty are really crappy economic assets to have. But some nations are desperate and poor. They aren't going to develop massive oil reserves or a thriving tech sector through the power of positive thinking. Their only comparative advantage is that they're cheap. Slap a load of tariffs on their products, and they don't even have that anymore. The idea isn't that these countries 'specialise' in being very unproductive indefinitely. The goal is for them to develop. The high productivity of hoghly developed countries depends on capital, technology and knowledge that poorer nations don't have. They have cheap labour, and they trade it for things they want more. Over time, these countries can accumulate the means to be more productive and thus get better jobs and have higher standards of living.","title":"CMV: Tariffs actually (politically) progressive"},{"text":"\\"We must have an election for the Rada since Ukraine hasn't had one in ages.

Does a meeting with rich people throw out all the positive change he made? Under Biden we achieved the highest unemployment in more than 50 years immediately after a massive pandemic. Under Biden we are outperforming in our recovery from the pandemic in terms of economic growth, inflation, unemployment,  etc.Under Biden we changed the laws on overtime pay to make millions of our poorest Americans now eligible to earn extra for their hard work. Biden was the first president to walk a picket line. He walked with UAW union. That UAWs strike won historic wage increases and helped ensure that electric vehicles would be manufactured in America by union workers.President Biden signed into law the Butch Lewis Act which protected roughly 2 million workers pensions, ensuring they remained solvent.Biden passed The Inflation Reduction Acts corporate minimum tax ensures that billion-dollar corporations pay at least 15% of their income in taxes. In response to the surge in corporate stock buybacks after the Trump tax cuts, the Biden-Harris Administration enacted a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity as opposed to funneling tax-preferred profits to wealthy and foreign shareholders.The Biden-Harris Administration reversed the chronic underfunding of the IRS, giving the agency the tools it needed to improve taxpayers experience and make wealthy and corporate tax cheats pay the taxes they owe.Biden passed major infrastructure bills and the CHIPS act bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. All of these things are helping the poor and middle class.

For about two years, Trump news dried up, but Musk happened to come along and was willing to damage their control over social media.  He fits the Trump mold closely enough- wealthy, confident, moderate-yet-fairly-conservative.  Speaks against the left and puts his money where his mouth is.  A threat to their agenda.  The anti-Trump training kicked in and he became a surrogate that they could attack for any reason.  Now Trump is back and they're seeing double.  The response will be to merge them into a single entity and transfer traits from one onto the other, since it's easier to manage.

A lot of the tech billionaires like Gates or Zuck or whoever arent exploiting people making minimum wage and paying them nickels; their employees are highly educated nerds making really generous like 250k+ salaries.Improving quality of life for the majority does require having a globally competitive economy, so like you do have some basic constraints there.The way you improve quality of life for the majority is by ensuring more balance of power between employees and employers.The left correctly recognizes some of that comes through workers right regulation, and the right correctly recognizes that pulling that lever too hard inhibits the economic engine that powers this whole thing.The right correctly recognizes that immigration - particularly undocumented - are big drivers of inequity as they strain services / drive up some costs, while contributing to wage suppression as surplus labor. The left is largely in denial about it.The left recognizes the need to break down monopolies (but theyre super disorganized about it), while the right recognizes regulatory capture and nationalization also create effective monopolies. The left and right are both pushing on the issues that improve quality of life *for their constituents*.The failure here is not recognizing the validity in the other sides approach.I do think a workers unity party / supermajority focused on these issues is possible.

But let me try something slightly different.  And this is purely based on the claim that it's hypocritical.  This isn't a defense of J6, a support of the idea that any election fraud took place or an attack on Democrat reactions to losing 2024 (which I think are mostly quite reasonable and far less extreme than they were in 2016).For a claim of hypocrisy to be correct, the essential reactions of the two parties needs to be similar in principle, though not in scale.  That is, paraphrasing, you posit that it's hypocritical for Trump voters to make fun of Democrat reactions to losing because Trump voters reacted much more strongly when their candidate lost, correct?If so, the argument against this is that the two reactions were entirely different, in **principle**.If Democrat reactions to Trump winning are, as you say, are \\"*rightfully upset, angry, etc, that is bound to happen when you lose an election, especially when its to someone as hated as Trump is*\\", this is principally different than the reasons Trump voters were upset about 2020.  It isn't just a difference in scale, it is different, in principle.The **principle** you described as why Democrats are upset is:a. it's natural after losing an election andb. because Trump is so hatedFrom everything we know, the **principle** why Republicans were upset was:Allegations of fraud, media messaging, mistrust in voting systems, political polarization and Trump's pre-election narratives 'priming the pump' as it were.  I suspect you will agree with this but if you request links with evidence, I will provide them.  Note: I am not defending any of those views, in any way.  They are, imo, incorrect and...concerning.  But that's not the point, here.The **principle** of why Republicans were upset can't be attributed to the same reasons as Democrats.  That is, as being natural to losing an election (since J6 hasn't really occurred before, much less regularly, when Republicans have lost).  And there is no evidence to suggest that particular hatred of Biden was a factor.Because the reasons for being upset were do different, it's not actually hypocritical.  It's potentially misinformed, lacking in self-awareness and poor sportsmanship...but not hypocritical.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"The fact that threatening to fund a primary opponent worked is so strange to me.

Hell, [Russian KGB defectors](https://youtu.be/yErKTVdETpw?si=jSI72FNoNjjLb7h1) even told us they were going to do this in the 80s. They never stopped and now were at end game for democracy. Once Trump got in power, he opened the floodgates on illegal Russian immigration to seed the country with bad actors, while red herrings gushed from his mouth constantly. He let them in and they are going to win because nobody is looking closely enough to the depth of the threat. He literally had the lowest deportation numbers in the last 30 yearsno coincidence. They said they would start with the education system, because the damage done there takes the longest to recover from and is easier. Sometimes up to 20 years to undo.

The case proceeds, everything is by the book, the jury issues a verdict: innocent. You read the news and say fuck, but at least a jury decided. Then, the news breaks about the DA and the prosecutor sleeping together etc.; would you say that the State was robbed of a fair trial because you dont know if the prosecutor got the job due to nepotism?

Like the filibuster and electoral college, its something outdated that was built for older systems, has no real purpose in modern times, doesnt currently operate in a way designed by anyone, and sticks around because it benefits politicians whod need to be on board to remove it.Back in the day, the federal government didnt do a lot, and mostly got its income from stuff like import taxes. When it needed to raise money for a big project that would exceed their current income but is a long-term positive  like building a canal or something  theyd finance it by selling bonds. Youve probably seen this kinda thing in state and local government, where you see an ordinance to eg. sell bonds to finance a new bike path or something.So, the feds want to build this canal so Congress passes a law authorizing the Treasury Department to sell some bonds to finance it. Thats what were talking about  the national equivalent of municipal bonds.Over time though modern society gets more complex and nation states become more important. The federal government is doing more stuff, they keep having to pass new laws to authorize more bond sales. So eventually Congress says, This is annoying, we cant keep having to pass a law every time the Feds want to raise money. Heres what well do  well pass a law setting an upper limit for the sale of Treasury bonds, and then authorize the White House to sell bonds up to that limit as necessary to fund the shit we appropriate money for.So, thats trucking along, and nation states are becoming more complex, and now after WWII countries have all these big federal agencies doing all this shit. And the president (who unlike most countries is not picked by the legislature) has a ton of discretion in how and the extent to which things are funded. So one day Tricky Dick Nixon says, you know what, fuck this shit Congress appropriated money for, Im just not gonna spend it.So then Congress goes, Wait a minute, wtf? You cant just not fund things we authorized. Thats a violation of the separation of powers, you cant just veto things after the fact! So Congress decides  Ok, fuck it. From now on were going to set the budget every year, were gonna do like a whole process and you HAVE to spend what we say, no holding back on shit you dont like.So now, you have federal law mandating the exact amounts the executive branch has to spend on shit. From that time on, the overall indebtedness of the US has been controlled by the formal budget process.But you still have this old law, the debt limit, putting a cap on federal bond sales, and the budget often requires the executive branch to exceed this cap. This would be bad, because it means the government doesnt have the funds to pay its bills  including paying interest on the past bonds it sold.But it wasnt really a big deal, and Congress would just kept raising the limit to match the associated budget. A Congressional fix to keep an outdated law in step and out of the way.This went along for a while, and everyone took care of it but would sometimes give speeches about deficit spending or whatever and make protest votes, but it was all for show.Until the Obama era, when Congressional republicans realized that, wait a minute, this would really fuck shit up if we didnt do the little fix this time. And since were gigantic shitty assholes, were not about to let a chance for extortion slip away.And since then, weve been dealing with bullshit.To add to that, not raising the debt limit would be VERY BAD because (1) it would raise the cost of borrowing for the United States for a long time, nobody knows how long because nothing like this has ever happened. Just proactively raising your cost of credit forever is the least fiscally responsible thing you can do, a default is literally the bad thing that youre trying to avoid by balancing your budget, its like killing someone so they dont get shot, and (2) it throws off balance sheets globally, because the dollar is the worlds reserve currency and EVERY stable, reliable investment vehicle on planet earthpensions, sovereign funds, other central banksholds some treasury bonds that now are less valuable, and which affects their balance sheets.

There were long periods of time where he saw his entire family die off in wars, wars where he was often the one killing his family. He finally attained a measure of peace by being the most powerful person - really, the person who was left standing. He respected power because he knew how awful it was.The kingdom was passed to the son, the prince. The prince knew the awful cost of power, had seen his father kill his uncles and cousins, and knew that peace was a gift. He struggled to maintain the kingdom his father made, but it mostly worked out because he was there to have seen the most violent years of his father's struggle. He was not a great, powerful man like his father, but he was an obedient, mindful son, and that ensured he kept peace above all else.The grandson of the king inherits the kingdom from his father, the prince. The grandson grew up in abundance, knew nothing but pleasure and comfort, and thus had nothing to struggle for except ways to find more pleasure. He is a drunk, abusive to his staff, and a terrible ruler of the people.

This is called alienation by critical theorists. Connecting people back to an ideology where class analysis dominates their thinking would be impossible without community. Communities require interaction among their members. Without such interaction, humans can be prone to grandiose thinking, can get trapped by messaging akin to rugged individualism, or become angered by isolation. Argument, within reason and without violence, must be a central tenet of every human community. It is in these important conversations that hostilities can be amended or assuaged, and learned behaviors from the existing superstructures (Capitalism and its ugly cousins Patriarchy, White Supremacy, Homophobia, Xenophobia) can be combatted.

It feels like an attempt to redirect the primacy in a moral hierarchy instead of an entreaty to set aside moral differences.When any resource is scarce (including money), the natural goal of those with access to the resource is to both maintain existing levels of access and increase acquisition of the resource as a hedge against potential future increased scarcity (one of the things that's led to the increase in cryptocurrency in an effort to get around the scarcity of fiat currencies, as well as their vulnerability to bad actors within high levels of government).At the end of the day, the \\"ultra wealthy\\" aren't doing anything wrong by being wealthy. As a cohort they're as likely to contain bad actors as any other cohort, but on a macro level are no better or worse than anyone else. Attempts to siphon off their wealth through taxes, regulations, or social unrest only come off as rank class warfare, which is ultimately rooted in jealousy.Within America, this is ultimately a non-starter, because it's baked into our culture AND laws to favor individual exceptionalism. Anyone can theoretically become wealthy or \\"ultra wealthy\\". Find a need, create a means to meet that need, and through innovation or skilled business &amp; social maneuvering, convince people that the means of meeting that need is still represented best through you. It's how current billionaires did it. Sam Walton in Walmart made the \\"best\\" one-stop-shop. Jeff Bezos made the \\"best\\" bookstore with the fastest shipping, then expanded to shipping other products. Bill Gates made the \\"best\\" computer operating system at a time when computers were just starting to fully penetrate middle-class America. Elon Musk made the \\"best\\" electric vehicle, and also got around American franchising laws that prevented OEMs from owning their own dealerships by exploiting a vagary in American law through which Teslas were able to operate under a different classification than \\"automobile\\", thus avoiding those franchise laws' restrictions.By nature the left and right are always going to argue, because while they have the same goal (improvement in the quality of American life, freedom from violence and theft, ability to maintain a particular quality of life), they have radically different approaches to that goal. As a consequence, efforts to remove that conflict are destined to fail, mandating that reluctant bipartisan compromise is the only way to achieve any kind of legislation in a country nearly 50/50 split between those two poles. Consequently, unifying the two against the \\"ultra wealthy\\" (who are significant financial contributors toward both sides, and as a result are relatively safe from being targeted by the very people leading each side) isn't something that'll happen. Practicality would then indicate the pointlessness of pursuing a goal that only seems to appeal to the fringes who think wealth is inherently bad, and often seem to instead favor absolute redistribution of wealth so everyone \\"has an equal amount\\" (which brings with it its own significant problems, outside the purview of this particular discussion).","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"watching the country go to shit, actually.","title":"Appeals court disqualifies DA Fani Willis from prosecuting Trump Georgia case"},{"text":"Something something *south Africa was a british colony too*","title":"Rand Paul Suggests Worst Person You Know Should Be Next House Speaker.

Wade and Willis didnt do any favors by being very evasive about addressing that evidence. The judge very politely tells them that they were playing footsie with perjury with lies of omission and lack or candor with the court. It is honestly amazing they made it past the trial judge. Not crazy to think that it might well have been an attempt at a professional courtesy since the Judge had previously worked under Willis. Just as a basic tenant, how can you trust anything the prosecution puts forward after the lead prosecutor was caught lying to the judge once already? Additionally, it really isnt the worst argument that Trumps lawyers made initially, that Willis and Wade had needlessly drawn out and complicated the process to gain notoriety, money (not necessarily just the funds from GA), or other personal gain.The tape was a god damn slam dunk.

When you ask a right wing person and a left wing person what the problems are they will often agree. The biggest issue is how each of them want to solve it.Right wing solutions aren't actually solutions. For financial problems their solutions are to cut programs that help people. They say this is because it will force them to work their way out of their problems but really it's because they don't want to help carry the burden of the misfortunate. For social issues their solutions are to pressure people into acting according to normative acceptable groups. Left wing solutions are actual solutions. Financial problems are solved by the redistribution of wealth from the ultra wealthy to the needy. We say this is because relieving some financial burdens will allow people to get on their feet and improve their conditions. This is born out in the data of countries who do this. Social issues are resolved by acceptance and inclusion. This also works but people like to pretend not being allowed to harass people until they act the way they want them too is an infringement on their freedoms. Left wing social framework allows each person to act according to their own values provided it does not infringe on another person's rights or violate the law. Using abortion as an example left wing policy allows people to get abortions and people who don't want abortions can simply not get one. Right wing social policy denies the autonomy of the people who want abortions. This is why \\"finding a middle ground\\" is so infuriating. Left wing policy is almost always starting from the middle ground and then forced to cede ground to the right under the pretense on middle ground. The left never advocated for forced abortions which would be the opposite position. They started at the middle ground.These two groups are diametrically opposed in how they aim to solve problems and can't just not fight each other.Certainly the ultra wealthy are favorable to the right wing because they can afford to exist in a world that doesn't provide for the needy and as a result they have a motivated interest in convincing people of the public that right wing policies are best. Unfortunately for everyone they are really good at it and so many people vote for people who will directly harm them with their policies.Left and right don't agree so we can't stop fighting each other but we should also try to take down the ultra wealthy.Short version.

But in reality he paid 2.37% of his current wealth in tax. Now make your own math, how much % do you pay every year? I bet it's higher than 2.37%. On the last front, he complains about government subsidies and government spending, but happily accepts all the subsidies for his EV's and his company SpaceX is soly reliant on NASA, being it's biggest contractor.

In the absence of that, the realistic possibility of a better alternative.So then you agree that, in circumstances where these things are questionable or absent, some kind of (indirect) intervention is warranted? Because I can tell you for a fact that there are firms / countries / circumstances where it definitely happens (bonded laborers in India and the artisanal mining industry in Congo come to mind).You are justifying these policies on the basis that you disagree with the choices that people in foreign countries have made. You're absolutely rendering a judgment on how they should do things. That only makes sense if you think you know, better than they do, what is right or appropriate.Are you saying forming a judgement about how other people do things in other countries is intrinsically wrong? As in we can't have our own values and set our domestic policies accordingly?I don't believe this is the general outcome of globalised labour, no. When everyone is allowed to play to their relative strengths, everyone ends up better off. If a Mexican labourer is happy to do a job for less than an American worker, it is in no way exploitative to hire that Mexican labourer at the wage he is happy to accept. I genuinely cannot see what's objectionable about that.Hmmm I don't know what to tell you on this one because it is about as close to an objectively understood fact as you can get with this sort of thing. Especially given you use the word 'happy'. Can you really not see that some people accept things that they otherwise wouldn't if they had more agency? I realize that can be true of anyone, but it is especially problematic where it eats into the basic fundamentals of human dignity. Do you really think its in any nation's interest for their 'strength' to be unskilled, low paid, dangerous, labor intensive work? Does relying on this type of labor strengthen the country, or does it entrench poverty and underdevelopment?Except it doesn't have to be especially bad. The US has some of the highest wages of any country in the world. It's labour laws and employment regulations, while not world leading, are far more strict than those that the overwhelming majority of the global population live under. These aren't typical expectations.I don't see how any of this refutes my response to your analogy (it would be appropriate to sanction / close the mine if it subjected its workers to inhumane treatment).","title":"CMV: Tariffs actually (politically) progressive"},{"text":"It's because fame or attention is the new currency.

It's not just a set of policy and personality differences, it's a difference in how you view the world.The Right (which I count myself a member of) believes in hierarchies are good and necessary for societies to operate. In the case of the American Right they believe in a nationalistic meritocracy, basically that the government should be used to prioritize American enterprise but that internally we should be meritocratic. They might be sympathetic to restricting how the ultra wealthy make money through leveraging international trade and labor, but they don't have a problem with the mere fact that they're ultra wealthy.The Left see hierarchies as bad and a necessary evil at best. They believe in social and economic equality and to them the mere existence of the ultra wealthy is bad, even if they arrived at their wealth through legitimate and legal commerce. They don't particularly care whether a product is made internationally or domestically as long as the workers are fairly compensated and nobody is getting rich off the effort.So the two will never 'focus on taking down the ultra wealthy' because the right and the left aren't united in seeing the ultra wealthy as a problem.There might be some specific instances where their interests align, but those will be rare and the details of actually acting on those alignments will generally result in failure.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Exactly.

I presume you mean people.But more than that we have internal differences, sometimes almost as large as external ones. Within the left you have (at the very least) socialists and liberals. Within the right you have (at the very least) ~~neoliberals~~ neoliberal conservatives (edited after [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hhujbm/comment/m2u8s7x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button))  and traditionalists. These best describe politicians (and you will sometimes find each ideology across the bench a little) - but they also work as decent labels for people, albeit people knowing less about and having more of a mix of ideologies.Socialists will get behind your message any day of the week - whether they be communists, anarchists or even social democrats / democratic socialists, all agree on \\"rich people bad\\". Liberals... will hesitate. Because ultimately liberals want \\"kind capitalism\\". They wouldn't even really see a problem with the ultra wealthy if \\"kind capitalism\\" could be achieved.Traditionalists are ultimately less focused on class. There are numerous camps of traditionalists, obviously - some are even borderline monarchists or support an aristocracy, others are very religion focused. But so long as their social aims are met and society \\"returned\\" to its glory (whatever they perceive that to be) - they do not really care about the ultra-wealthy. They might see them as a current obstacle, but in the long run they aren't a problem. Neoliberal conservatives, on the other hand, are fundamentally opposed to what you are calling for - as they believe in and agree with the current world order as it is, they are the ones who constructed it after all. If you notice with Trump - it is the traditionalists who rallied behind him with \\"Make America Great Again\\" - and it was the neolibrals who hated him as \\"Never Trumpers\\" because he threatens the neoliberal world order (by threatening other countries with invasion, tariffs etc).Centrists tend to be a blend of liberals and neoliberals.So you could convince maybe 3/4s of the left/right political divide. But it would be a tenuous alliance - with the traditionalists and liberals likely to flake on you the moment they see a better opportunity.At the end of the day...we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy... is a left-wing statement.If those from the other political ideologies agree with it - it is because either it currently it aligns with their goals as the ultra-wealthy are an obstacle *or* they have a little bit of a socialist mindset buried somewhere within them.

The case would then be referred to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia Executive Director Pete Skandalakis. In a statement to CBS News, council spokesperson Tracy Walston said Skandalakis would have a few options.?\\"The executive director can appoint a district attorney, a solicitor-general, a retired prosecuting attorney, an attorney employed by the Department of Law, designate an attorney from the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council, or appoint a competent attorney to act as district attorney pro tempore in place of the district attorney,\\" she said.?Naming a district attorney in another county would be one possibility. Georgia has 159 counties, 129 of which voted Republican in 2020. The remaining 30 counties, all in more urban parts of the state, voted Democratic in that election. But even if the case were to be referred to another office, the new prosecutor would have oversight on whether to add, drop or amend the charges Trump and several others face. Those kinds of changes could require reopening the investigation, which would delay the trial for months, likely beyond the presidential election.[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/us/politics/fani-willis-disqualified-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/us/politics/fani-willis-disqualified-trump.html)Mr. Skandalakis is considered to be fair-minded by a number of prominent Georgia Democrats. But he has also been criticized for moving slowly in the effort to find a prosecutor to consider whether Georgias lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, should face charges related to the Trump case.A judge in July 2022 blocked Ms. Willis from developing a case against Mr. Jones, who served as a fake pro-Trump elector, because Ms. Willis had hosted a fund-raiser for one of Mr. Joness political rivals. **No replacement prosecutor has been named.**","title":"Fani Willis disqualified from Trump's Georgia election interference case"},{"text":"So how do you explain all the massive donations the democrats get?

The ultra wealthy are easy to hate because they are very public and it makes everyone very aware of the class divide, but what do you actually hope to accomplish by taking them down? What do you actually think would change in society?IMO most of the issues that people get upset about are not the result of anything the ultra wealthy do. Most things are the results of systematic choices that were made long ago that we are just dealing with, and they have figured out how to profit off of.Take the UHR CEO: He did profit off of a broken system that incentivizes denying care to people in need, but he didn't set up the system. Of course, he would likely prefer it continued since it enriched him, but taking him down didn't exactly take down the system, or even change it at all. If we took down Jeff Bezos would small business suddenly flourish and Amazon would go away?To me it seems like if we want to have real positive change again the left and the right need to learn to work together again and actually make compromise. The real issue that is plaguing the US is that the sides are so adversarial that when all parts of the government aren't in control of one party then nothing ever gets done or fixed. The health care industry in the US does need more done so we get better results without bankrupting so many people but that simply won't happen, regardless of who is in charge of those healthcare companies, until the two sides are willing to work together again towards a common goal (which means it likely won't happen in the next few decades).","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"It really shouldnt be.

You can't just eat the rich, you need to make it so that they don't come back the same way. This requires systematic change on a national scale. Many in the right wing of American politics don't seem to agree that the issue is Capitalist structures. They just think that the specific people who are at the top are bad, and if they are removed then things will all be better. If folks like that have significant say in any reordering of society, when the time comes to make new systems and new institutions, then they will very likely be the same ones in place now. It will be a turning back the clock, but not a changing of the game. For a true, unified, working class revolution (or systematic reform that meaningfully alters current structures) both sides need to be on the same page that the systems themselves are the issue, not the individuals within the systems (although of course individuals can be shitty too). Until the majority of the working class agrees to this bedrock concept, any meaningful change is doomed to fail as the wealthy will peel off those who are in it for their own personal circumstances and any movement will die by a death of a thousand cuts. The left and right wings of the working class _should_ be working together, but if they're not pulling in the same basic direction then they will end up just ripping things apart.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"No bill should be longer than a couple pages ever AND all bills should be single topic.","title":"WH Slams Trump, GOP Over Sinking Federal Spending Plan"},{"text":"AOC will get her time in the sun eventually, shell outlive all these people","title":"Ocasio-Cortez pokes fun at Trumps suggestion to keep trying to lead Democrats"},{"text":"Sorry, Im afraid it doesnt make sense to me.

This by definition makes tradition useful.This is your more defensible claim. But I still disagree. served some purposeYes, it has served some purpose. In many cases, it will have served the interest of the custodians of culture (often older people exerting influence over younger people).Purpose =/= greater good.People are also extraordinarily bad in judging the effects of tradition, especially in communities where the scientific method isn't strong footed. There are millions of people still believing female genital mutilation  has health benefits. The UN names hundreds of harmful traditional practices. Made it through generations =/= good.Traditions might have been beneficial when they came about.

Of course we can't know exactly how it started, but the two main ideas are \\"bro thought it was hot\\" (I love how I proved your theory that foot binding is beneficial the women and their families wrong so you attack my facts)\\"There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these accounts is of Pan Yunu, a favourite consort of the Southern Qi Emperor Xiao Baojuan. In the story, Pan Yunu, renowned for having delicate feet, performed a dance barefoot on a floor decorated with the design of a golden lotus. The Emperor, expressing admiration, said that \\"lotus springs from her every step!\\" (b b shng lin iiɏ), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati, under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms 'golden lotus' or 'lotus feet' used to describe bound feet; there is no evidence, however, that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.[6]The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated during the reign of the 10th-century Emperor Li Yu of the Southern Tang, just before the Song dynasty.[2] Li Yu created a 1.8-meter-tall (6 ft) golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls and asked his concubine Yao Niang () to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon. She then performed a dance on the points of her bound feet on the lotus.[2] Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her.[7] The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.[8]\\"","title":"CMV: Tradition works and should be respected"},{"text":"He just wants to further erode checks and balances on the Executive's power.

In the absence of that, the realistic possibility of a better alternative. But I am not proposing to get involved in local dynamics. I am proposing (for the purposes of this thought experiment) domestic economic policy.You are justifying these policies on the basis that you disagree with the choices that people in foreign countries have made. You're absolutely rendering a judgment on how they should do things. That only makes sense if you think you know, better than they do, what is right or appropriate.Do you agree that people in developed countries obtain a material benefit from exploited workers in developing countries due to the operation of the global labor market? I don't believe this is the general outcome of globalised labour, no. When everyone is allowed to play to their relative strengths, everyone ends up better off. If a Mexican labourer is happy to do a job for less than an American worker, it is in no way exploitative to hire that Mexican labourer at the wage  he is happy to accept. I genuinely cannot see what's objectionable about that.As I've said, I think that specific practices such as slavery or child labour are exploitative. But these are objectionable irrespective of who benefits from them.Again, for the analogy to work, it would have to be a coal mine that subjects its workers to inhumane conditions (even by coal mining standards). Except it doesn't have to be especially bad. The US has some of the highest wages of any country in the world. It's labour laws and employment regulations, while not world leading, are far more strict than those that the overwhelming majority of the global population live under.

You probably dont want to hear it, but just hear me out please. The tariffs Trump implemented during his first term and the following trade war increased the cost to build a home. While tariffs increased the cost to build Trump incentivized real estate investors both foreign and domestic, large and small to buy up existing homes. He also pressured the Fed to lower interest rates in 2019.It seems as if the [Trumps] TCJAs intended purpose was to give investors and developers a leg up to do long-term business in the real estate market, an advantage single-family homeowners can only dream of receiving. The intention was to uplift the real estate business, not the individual homeowner, something the TCJA delivers. https://www.americanbar.org/groups/gpsolo/resources/magazine/archive/impacts-tax-cuts-jobs-act-2017-real-estate-ownership-investment/It [New Research] finds that trade-weighted average tariff rates for homebuilding products from China were more than nine times higher in 2021 than in 2017 before these tariffs were enacted, and the rate for homebuilding products from all countries increased more than four times over the same period https://www.americanactionforum.org/press-release/tariffs-are-increasing-homebuilding-costs/A $60 Billion Housing Grab by Wall Street https://newslink.mba.org/servicing-newslink/2020/march/mba-newslink-monday-march-9-2020/a-60-billion-housing-grab-by-wall-street/Trump steps up pressure on Fed to cut interest rates, but economists say its a bad idea https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-fi-trump-pressures-fed-lower-interest-rates-20190430-story.htmlBlackstones CEO endorsed Trump. Blackstone is one of the private equity firms buying up single family homes.The blanket tariffs and the following trade will potentially trigger a great depression 2.0 in addition to increasing the cost to add supply. Just like the first one there will be a wave of foreclosures and distressed sellers exceeding the Great Recession. But have no fear there are buyers waiting. Blackstone along with other private equity firms and private hedge funds with global monies from the ultra wealthy, foreign governments and pension/retirement funds will benefit the most from these deals that are out of reach to most Americans. They have billions and billions to buy assets like real estate, small businesses pennies on the dollar. Saudi Arabia has $2 trillion to invest. When America First texted me asking what they should prioritize on day I told them Preventing a recession. People are already being impacted by just the possibility of tariffs. Purposely triggering Great Depression 2.0 so Blackstone and other wealth management firms with global monies can buy up assets like foreclosures that housed a family is not putting Americans first.

This means that even when something works, it'll often happen that it stops serving a purpose when technology and/or society changes.You mention \\"no sex before marriage\\" as an example of a traditional value, so let's look at that in some more detail.Go back a couple generations, and most human beings lived in societies that had no social safety net other than family, where cultural ideas STRONGLY condemned especially women who had premarital sex, and where neither reliable contraception nor safe abortions were available. Most people completed what little education they had and started working full time at some point in their teenage years. Given **THAT** specific situation, yes sure it made sense to encourage your daughters to remain celibate until marriage. (which might have meant until age 17-21) That's not the world my daughers grow up in today. Instead their current reality looks something like this:* Low-cost low-risk high-reliability contraception is routine. A subdermal requires only a single 15-minute visit to the doctor and provides 99.95% reliable contraception for 4-5 years.\\n* Low-risk fully taxpayer-funded abortions are freely available to all\\n* There is no social stigma around having premarital sex, except for in a few small conservatively religious subcultures\\n* Most people remain in education until they're well into their twenties, and are perhaps 30 by the time they marry.Putting all of this together, it's clear that the situation is VERY different. And yet you're arguing that sticking with the same traditional value, despite the underlying reality having changed RADICALLY makes sense.That is to me an example of dogmatic belief in tradition -- which is the OPPOSITE of paying attention to what \\"works\\" (and related: why a given rule makes sense in a given context).There is no \\"wisdom\\" in (say) a 20 year old person with a committed partner and who are using modern contraception to remain celibate in order to accomplish .... what exactly?","title":"CMV: Tradition works and should be respected"},{"text":"Remember when there were 3 *separate* branches of government?","title":"Trump says Mike Johnson will 'easily remain speaker' if he acts 'decisively and tough' on spending bill"},{"text":"You don't hate the media enough...

No county using the other 2 machines shows anywhere near this leadSummary: Trump's team stole the tabulator software, Musk joined in and as Tech Bro?? he had the connection needed to find someone who could crack it. Voting centers got cleared out due to bomb threats and once the tabulators were mysteriously left alone with potential Lion of Judah election workers they suddenly started coming up hard for Trump, including an astronomical increase in bullet ballots for Trump (typical average: 0.3%, 2024 average: 10%). This is why Musk has total control over Trump now, he has him by the balls as the orchestrator. This is also why you can ask so many of your friends and family in swing states to check their mail/absentee ballot status and it will almost certainly still be uncounted, because the tabulators stopped counting real votes around 8pm.I would also add that in a painful cruel twist of irony, if this is indeed what happened, Democrats fucked themselves in the end. Because the only way to expose this would be hand counting ballots, which Georgian republicans, unlikely to know of the monumentally treasonous Trump/Musk rigging, tried to do and Democrats sued and stopped it.

I'm merely testing how 'necessary' it is.Imagine I went into a coal mining town in West Virginia and announced that the mine was closing, do you think the people of the town would be happy?

No. Everyone would be distraught at the loss of their livelihoods and the likely dissolution of their community.

I don't think you'll find many people willing to open defend slavery, but it seems pretty obvious that there's not some kind of near universal consensus on appropriate labour regulations. Why would you expect a subsistence farmer in Chad, a factory worker in Vietnam and a Danish conceptual artist to have the same expectations of their livelihood? Even different US states have different minimum wages. Is it exploitative to hire someone in Utah rather than California?Are you saying there is no threshold a foreign nation could exceed before imposing some kind of sanction would be appropriate?I think that slavery and child labour are objectionable. I think that exterbalities like pollution can be legitimate concerns for outsiders. But if a group of people will genuinely consent to certain standards of pay and conditions, and their relatively legitimate government is willing to allow them to do so, that's pretty much their business. It seems incredibly presumptuous for a foreigner with no experience of a given society to think they know better than the locals how economic minutia should be handled.I guess you could consider it performative, but from my perspective it is just being pragmatic.

There isnt an official record of how many hours per day Donald Trump spent golfing during his first administration (2017C2021), as the White House did not consistently disclose his golfing activities. However, numerous reports from media outlets and watchdog organizations like TrumpGolfCount tracked his visits to golf courses.According to their data:\\n\\t?\\tTrump visited golf courses approximately 298 times during his presidency.\\n\\t?\\tHe often combined golf with meetings or other informal activities, so its not clear how much of each visit was spent playing.Estimates suggest he spent four to six hours per round when golfing, which aligns with typical rounds of golf. Specific daily averages are harder to determine without consistent records, but his frequent trips to golf courses received significant media attention and criticism, especially compared to his earlier criticisms of President Obama golfing.","title":"Trump says federal workers who don't want to return to the office are \\"going to be dismissed\\""},{"text":"It would have already happened.

One important difference is this:* Keeping slavery going *restricts* people's economic choices. The slaves had no choice. Once freed, they could, if they wanted to, continue working the plantations - but presumably, many found there were better options elsewhere.\\n* Continuing buying from poor countries *gives the people there more choice*. They don't have to work in the sweatshops - it's just that that's the best option they currently have. Which is, of course, tragic, but it does not follow that boycotting sweatshops will improve their lives. In fact (as I explain below), it perpetuates their misery.In other words, while the anti-abolitionists might claim the slaves were better off being slaves, but if that were really true, then setting them free would not change the status quo.But the broader point was that it is fundamentally wrong to obtain enrichment from the subjugation of others, as is the point herePeople in poor countries have shit working conditions. Refusing to trade with those countries keeps them poor, therefore perpetuating their shit conditions.The examples of Japan, South Korea, China and others show that when you open up trade with poor countries (\\"exploiting\\" the fact that workers there produce stuff cheaply) then those countries often grow economically, permanently improving working and living conditions for almost everyone there.People no longer buy Japanese goods because they're cheap, but because they're excellent quality.

You get angry against evil because you dont know what to do against it.Therapy fixes more than the death penalty, as does rehabilitative prisons. Oh and were also gonna sentence innocent people to death because assuming the courts are 100% right before enacting a permanently damaging punishment that cannot be undone is what stupid people say is a good idea.How exactly does hurting someone fix the problem? Pedophiles and other paraphiles have a big root in social maladjustment. What youre suggesting is to make any attempts to fix themselves be punishable by death, which doesnt solve the problem. It isolates people with unstable and dangerous psychological problems Big thing to talk about here is precedent; youre setting the precedent that if an individual feels like they were wronged by evil, it should be encouraged no matter the circumstances. What if I feel that women who have had an abortion are evil and that they wronged an unborn child? Am I allowed to perform a very late term abortion on the mother? What if I think the person who enacted vengeance on someone who they thought was evil and wronged them did it in an evil and wrong way and enacted vengeance on them?The different and better way to mob justice is literally anything. Law and order policing and imprisonment isnt doing us any favours, but its a step up from mob justice. Rehabilitation does everything we want it to; fewer reoffenders means fewer skilled criminals and more productive members of society, lower recidivism rates hurts underworld crime, and less punishment means that people will actually cooperate with police more instead of trying to take off running. No, really, how many people are gonna go on sprint from a cop if their punishment for crime is a mandatory year stay at a rehabilitation centre, playing sports and learning marketable skills? Crime rates wont go up, as evidenced by the myriad of countries who have only seen improvements from rehabilitation programs. This is the method argued by psychologists, sociologists, criminologists, and even the prisoners themselves.

As far as preserving cultural tradition, explain to me then why has it been so important for people like you, obviously Christian from what you posted, to stamp out other's cultural traditions? Those traditions were equally as valid to those cultures as Christian traditions are to current society. I think Neil Gaiman wrote a fantastic fictional yet truthful book, \\"American Gods\\". Why were those traditions less important than the Christian traditions? They were also a way of \\"preserving cultural heritage and bringing us together\\", yet they were slowly pushed out. The traditions you speak of aren't really traditions, i.e., sex before marriage.

Joes mortgage carries significant risk of default as his ability to make payments is entirely dependent on his employment status.  This risk is only partially mitigated by the lien against the property.  So, as the bank, you charge a premium to Joe on top of the 4.5% yield you could be collecting to offset the increased risk his mortgage represents.

What value does it add to society?It doesn't discourage people from being gay, because people are born gay. So the number of gay people will not decrease.Gay people make up a very small minority, so it doesn't have a negative impact on population growth.There have been suggestions that gay members of a community serves an evolutionary advantage, since there are now men who are not in \\"competition\\" so to speak - men whom you can safely leave around the women because they won't try to to steal them.Killing or exiling these people just means you lose valuable members who can contribute in various ways. They can help raise children communally, and could even take care of children who've lost their biological parents.So this tradition doesn't actually work. It's a bad tradition, that's only a detriment to your society.Some traditions just do nothing at all. Like the tradition of the father giving away the bride at the wedding. It serves no purpose, it doesn't add anything of value, other than some people wanting to do it because they think it's traditional or they it's how they've envisioned their wedding. It's not harmful, it's not beneficial, it just *is*. There's no reason to respect the tradition because it adds nothing. It's also not bad if someone wants to follow it.In general, tradition is just \\"we've always done it this way\\", and the things we've done for a long time is a big mix of good things, bad things, and meaningless things. We cannot say that tradition works, because we've had so many, many traditions that just don't. Bigotry, slavery, abuse, rape, sexism, material waste, bad habits that spread disease, etc.To say anything, we must look at every individual tradition and determine what the purpose was, what the purpose is now, if the tradition fulfills that purpose, and what value it brings. Only then can we say if it's worthy of being respected or if it works.Edit: I should add that if the purpose of the tradition of killing gay people is \\"I think homosexuals are disgusting and I would rather kill them all so I don't have to see it in public\\" then the tradition obviously works since it discourages homosexuality in public. However, that would be a *bad* tradition, morally, since it harms people and it also harms the community itself. So then it would be a tradition that works for it's stated purpose, however it should not be respected by any civilised society.","title":"CMV: Tradition works and should be respected"},{"text":"Elon: \\"Here's another truckload of money, sir.\\"","title":"'Unelected President Musk': Elon posts 70 times trashing GOP bill, Trump caves"},{"text":"He will spend more money to make sure he is always welcomed, he and other Billionaires are here to stay.","title":"Elon Musk Urges Congress To Not Pass Any More Bills Until Trump Takes Office"},{"text":"There are too many clearly terrible traditions for what you've said to be true.
