That is what is so horrifying about it.I live in a pretty solidly red county, and in 2016, I had more than a few friends and coworkers tell me that, while they sometimes cheered for Trump, they actually realized that he was not at all a moral person, and the thing they were actually cheering for and voting for was the idea of Trump and the idea of MAGA. And almost unanimously, that idea was: we feel so fed up with our government - our system - that were going to chuck this grenade into the gears, because maybe if it explodes and rattles some things up, whatever comes of it will surely be better than what we have now.As far as I can tell, much of that sentiment is exactly the same. Eight years after Trump won his first term, and after Bidens victory in 2020, I had hoped that enough Americans learned that approach doesnt work, but I feel like, if anything, things are worse now. Prior to Trump taking office in 2016, he just represented that idea of the grenade, designed to drain the swamp and gum up the works, but now, a lot more of his ideas are more entrenched than ever. Some of his behaviors - the egotism, the narcissism, the lack of shame, the willingness to deny literally any wrongdoing hes committed no matter the evidence - have taken root more broadly amongst Republican politicians. And the culture that everything is fake news has run rampant. If we are lucky, Trump is uniquely capable of garnering enough votes to win the presidency running for office the way that he does in 2028 and beyond, but even then, some of those changes to the publics psyche are going to continue plaguing us for decades.","title":"Trans People Are Scrambling To Prepare For The Waking Nightmare Of Trumps Second Term"},{"text":"lol...

I think where they go wrong with election polls and why they are usually off is their sampling methodology. If they correctly stratified based on party affiliation and broke it down by individual states, they could much more accurately predict elections based on electoral college outcomes and it would require a larger sample size due to the change in methodology as opposed to random sampling. However, these types of polls cost a ton of money and are usually paid for by the parties and are kept internal.What is funny is the parties do actually pay for these polls to better target their campaign funds. During the Rogan interview, Trump actually talked about how he doesnt believe the polls that we see, and he only believes the high quality internal polls that they pay a ton of money for. There is also a high powered disgruntled Democrat campaign fundraiser, Lindi Li, going around doing some interviews now that are pretty interesting. She claims that the Harris/Walz high quality internal polls showed for a long time that they didnt have a shot and she is angry she kept taking money from people she considers friends when they knew it was basically a waste of their money. Apparently Bidens internal polls showed Trump would win 400 electoral college votes and that is why he was forced to drop out.

The Governor was more forthcoming, trumpeting the states receipt of a block grant waiver.  You say aggregate cap, I say block grant, lets call the whole thing off.  And that is exactly what happened on August 4, when the Biden administration CMS signed off on TennCare III, a 10-year extension of a section 1115 waiver for Tennessee.You saying \\"lack of fanfare\\" and \\"unwind\\" made it sound like Biden quietly cancelled the program, rather than what seems to have happened where they extended a waiver for 10 years and just didn't make a big deal out of it, like Trump did.Whether it's a good or bad thing that this is how they're doing it now, the waiver does push more of the responsibilities onto the state, so it's probably a good idea that only one state has this, because then it allows you to test changes in policy in isolation, see if it's actually a good idea.","title":"Former health secretary predicts Trump will bring in block grants for Medicaid"},{"text":"SOOOO TRUE!!!!!1!!!!","title":"Trumps intel pick was placed on government watch list for overseas travel and foreign connections"},{"text":"And money","title":"Trump plans to fire Jack Smiths team, use DOJ to probe 2020 election"},{"text":"\\"The government is run by billionaire coastal elites.

This has been known since Trump first mentioned the tariffs. A perfect example is Papa John's when the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was rolled out. The law states that companies with 30+ workers had to provide health insurance. Papa John's was furious, since they were legally not even having to pay their drivers minimum wage, since they got tips. The next thing they did was why I've boycotted them ever since. They said, fine. If we have to pay more to our employees, we are passing it on to our customers. So they retaliated by raising the price of pizza, to punish their customers (voters).A company that profits millions of years, not willing to let it affect their wallets. China is not going to lose any money from these tariffs. They will pass the cost on to consumers. The last, and most important part, is Temu. Temu is growing a customer base faster than Amazon did. Amazon cannot undercut their prices. While I don't find it a coincidence, Amazon announced they will start selling low priced goods, like Temu, right around the time Trump announced the tariffs. It seems Trump is doing the tariffs thing to help the richest man in the world, while he's obviously making deals with Elon Musk as well. This is what selling out the American people looks like.","title":"Walmart just leveled with Americans: China wont be paying for Trumps tariffs, in all likelihood you will"},{"text":"I do wish she'd go back to selling car insurance.","title":"Trans People Are Scrambling To Prepare For The Waking Nightmare Of Trumps Second Term"},{"text":"BECAUSE OF YOU.","title":"Joy Reid To Trump Supporters: People Dont Feel Safe With You, Have Legitimate Fear Of You"},{"text":"Remember the Wayfair scandals and her $10,000 pillow that was named after a child that was missing?

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

This bill is a high priority for labor unions but controversial among Republicans.

Advocacy for Public Sector Employees: Chavez-DeRemer supported the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which aims to protect the rights of public employees to unionize and bargain collectively.\\n3. Small Business and Retail Support: She has been recognized for her efforts to foster policies that support small businesses, including advocating for child care cost reductions and women-owned small businesses.

It's already been brought to light publicly that millions of these immigrants are receiving MORE MONEY than a lot of us citizens are, Even getting put up in five star hotels and given credit cards loaded with funds. The amount of money it takes to house and provide benefits to these people IN ONE MONTH  despite the fact they are not supposed to be here surpasses the amount it will cost to throw them on a damn plane and drop them off in their country. I've heard rumors that some of these people are getting 2,000 to $3,000 a month. That's utterly despicable and unacceptable besides the American people have decided by voting for Trump that they want these people gone And it is our country after all... If the politicians want to support these people out of their own pockets using their million dollar net worths from using internal secrets to beat the stock market then fine by me, but it's not out of their pockets because they don't use their own money THEY USE OURS! So let the debating stop America has spoken on Trump's mandate by voting for him we want these people gone and we want them gone now. We the American people decided we wanted Trump after he told us what he wanted to do, we've made up our mind.For the record it has nothing to do with racism, or judgmental natures, or being greedy, it simply has to do with logical common sense. If your neighborhood is on fire you are going to save your children before you save your neighbor's children - your average liberal Kamala Harris supporter would say that means you're going to leave your neighbor children to die, when in reality what that means is you are going to save your children and then immediately try to run over and save the neighbor's children. AS ANY SANE PARENT WOULD DO sorry but I take care of me and mine first. That is not to say I would leave the neighbor's kids hanging mine just have to come first, And that is not even a hard thing to decide. That analogy works for the country as well we need to worry about America and their legal citizens first, our tax money supports our economy therefore it is our money therefore it is our economy and OUR COUNTRY.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"They are going to fire them anyway.","title":"Trump plans to fire Jack Smiths team, use DOJ to probe 2020 election"},{"text":"Creates a team designed to cut government waste.Spends taxpayer dollars investigating an election from 4 years ago.","title":"Trump plans to fire Jack Smiths team, use DOJ to probe 2020 election"},{"text":"It's all a distraction.","title":"The GOP consistently uplifts accused sex offenders while claiming trans women are the dangerous ones.

History piles up, says Maddow. So seeing what were standing on is really helpful.Rachel Maddows new podcast, Ultra, is about ultra-right wing groups that sided with Hitlers Germany, and plotted to overthrow the U. S. government before World War II. It led to the largest sedition trial in American history.  Ultra is also about sitting members of the U. S. Senate and House of Representatives who colluded with a German agent to spread Nazi propaganda to millions of Americans with the help of American taxpayers money. Rachel Maddow uncovers a WWII-era plot against America in UltraAs a new authoritarian movement rises in American politics, stoked by one of the countrys most outrageous demagogues, there is an all-out international manhunt for an American traitor. The U.S. Armys Nazi war crimes trials in Germany have been infiltrated by a spy  a mole for the other side. A gruesome foreign influence operation unfolds in Washington. A blackmail plot turns deadly in the U.S. Senate. A Hail Mary scheme to stop the counting of the Electoral College votes rattles democracys cage. With the line between the violent ultra-right and mainstream American politics fraying beyond recognition, with the FBI always one step behind their quarry, Americans of all stripes step up to confront a seemingly unstoppable, ascendant, anti-democratic force. \\nJoin Rachel Maddow [Audio: Rachel Maddow presents Ultra](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/id1647910854)Both seasons should be required listening for all students and Americans: Ultra audio- book by Rachel Maddow\\n[How a U.S. Senator from Minnesota became a key player in a Nazi plot](https://www.minnpost.com/national/2023/01/how-a-u-s-senator-from-minnesota-became-a-key-player-in-a-nazi-plot/)\\nWASHINGTON  When former Minnesota U.S. Sen. Ernest Lundeen was killed in a plane crash in the foothills of Virginias Blue Ridge Mountains on Aug. 31, 1940, he likely knew the Justice Department was investigating his part in a Nazi-driven plot to overthrow the U.S. government.Lundeens secretary, who was tasked with driving the senator to the airport for that ill-fated trip, testified to the FBI that she found Lundeen in his Capitol Hill office crying inconsolably. The senator would not say why.According to the secretary, Ive gone too far to turn back, was about all Lundeen said.The cause of the mysterious crash was never resolved. Lundeen, 62, was among 25 passengers of the plane, which also carried two FBI agents and another Justice Department official.\\nAll passengers and crew on the plane perished. But miraculously, a copy of the speech Lundeen planned to give at a Labor Day event in Minnesota was found unscathed in the Virginia countryside, which was scattered with body parts and debris from the crash. It was not written by Lundeen, however, but by an agent of Hitlers government who paid the Minnesota senator to promote Nazi propaganda.Thats just part of the story that MSNBCs Rachel Maddow tells in an eight-part podcast called Ultra that uncovers a series of seditious plots to sow discord in the United States 80 years ago. The plots also included plans for a violent overthrow of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to impose a fascist dictatorship in the United States.[Archive photos](https://www.nbcnews.com/msnbc/msnbc-podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra-episode-1-ncsl1299321)\\n[Ultra Episode 1- Trip 19.

We were really stumped as to what the woman at the bottom had to do with anything. I can tell you who she is - Jane Austen, the 19th century author of romance novels, including Pride and Prejudice.I have NO idea why they included her. Her backstory is really weird. I don't believe she was middle class. She was likely a prominent member of the British peerage with connections to the navy. But what she has to do with 2024 and Trump's election? I have an idea but it's shaky. Give me credit because her inclusion is so random that all anyone can do is speculate. Okay, so, JD Vance has ties to Opus Dei, and overall the Project 2025 has laid out plans to remove institutions that have allowed women to be independent within the civilization despite their reproductive burdens making them less ideal workers in a capitalistic system than men. The last century has shown that when women have control over their reproduction, they don't need men on an interpersonal level. Society needs men, women in general need men, but when society doesn't make laws that prevent women from controlling their own reproduction, a woman doesn't necessarily need to marry a man in order to get food and shelter. They have time to be competitive in the workplace. What does this have to do with Jane Austen? Her books were actually quite scandalous at the time. It's ironic that modern society sees the world of Pride and Predjudice as sexist and backwards. At the time, the idea of a woman choosing who she would marry was radical. The idea of a man being interested in a woman for her intelligence like Darcy was in Elizabeth Bennett was also radical. It could be seen as promoting female education. Jane Austen's work was proto-feminist in a sense, also due to her being a female author at all. So in that context, maybe they included Jane Austen because (and this is where my radical theory comes in) she was an important agent engaging in Project Chaosesque activities to engineer Western society and contribute to women wanting more. Now it's coming full circle, as Trump's (or rather JD Vance, the Heritage Foundation, and the Catholic Church they serve) presidency will herald in a regressive new age. While men and women fight each other at epic proportions, the build up to which has been more than a century in the making, all their other plans will unfold and no one will stop them. Turning different ethnicities against each other is good for them, but turning the sexes against each other is the most valuable. They have made people atomized and weak by taking away even their families.","title":"WOW, the economist front cover for 2025"},{"text":"So whats your solution then? Complacency?

Everybody is rushing, putting as much food in their warehouses as they can before [Trump] gets in, said Michele Buccelletti, whose family business produces olive oil and wine in Tuscany and Umbria. However, such efforts are constrained by a shortage of cargo space in the run-up to Christmas. Right now, its impossible to find a 20-foot or 40-foot refrigerated container, Buccelletti said. Buccelletti said he usually sends 20,000-30,000 litres of extra virgin olive oil to the US two or three times a year. But since Trumps victory, his US importer has been pressing him to increase shipments quickly, and he now aims to have 50,000 litres en route this month. Filippo Marchi, general manager of Granarolo  a Bologna-based dairy, said the company is scrambling to dispatch more Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano cheese to its own US subsidiary. However, Marchi expressed concern that production bottlenecks  in terms of long maturation time for the cheeses  and scarce shipping capacity posed serious constraints. It is not possible to produce a lot in a short period, he said. Until December, it is quite difficult to find extra cargo space, Marchi said. Everyone is trying to do the same thing. Granarolo is looking to secure additional warehouse space to hold the extra stock by late February, when it expects tariffs could be imposed.?Yet Marchi still hopes Trump may reconsider his tariff plan, especially on food. You have to think about the availability of products on supermarket shelves, he said. Luigi Pio Scordamaglia, director of international affairs at Coldiretti  Italys influential farming association, said some stockpiling may have begun even before Trumps win, as producers were hedging for this outcome. Italys food and wine exports to the US were 19.5 per cent higher in the first half of 2024 than over the same period last year. In total, Italian agrifood exports to the US  Romes most important market outside Europe  are forecast to reach 7.8bn for the year.? Though Scordamaglia said new tariffs are expected to dampen future growth, he expects the market to remain solid given strong demand for Italian food in the US. Some Italians hope Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni  who has forged a strong friendship with Elon Musk, Trumps powerful backer and nominee to head a deregulation department  may be able to secure favourable treatment for Italy. Foreign minister Antonio Tajani said this month that Trump had shown a special regard for Italy, different from other countries in his first term, which could help shield the country from the tariff blow. However, Meloni admitted this week that we are all worried about tariffs  this is a fact. She said that her government would engage in talks with the Trump administration while also seeking to boost Europes competitiveness. During his first term, Trump levied 25 per cent import duties on various European goods, including French wines and Italian cheese, as punishment for European subsidies to aerospace giant Airbus. Though Italian wines were spared from direct tariffs, Albiera Antinori, president of winemaker Marchesi Antinori, said wineries suffered anyway as US wine traders hiked prices all around.?It damaged the whole sector, she said. It unsettles the consumer and it unsettles the supply chain. Not all Italian winemakers were rushing to front-load exports, she said, given large volumes of red wine already in the US. Each one is going to be looking at their own stocks and their own availability of wine, Antinori said. Francesco Mutti, chief executive of Mutti  the biggest Italian tomato products maker in the US market, also warned that front-loading exports can be risky, given the cost of capital and extra storage, which may not pay off if Trumps tariff threat doesnt materialise  or if rates end up lower than predicted. Massimiliano Giansanti, president of Confagricoltura  which represents Italys largest agribusinesses, said any export surge would likely be followed by a slowdown. Many producers also fear that if the prices of authentic Italian products rise, some American consumers will switch to cheaper domestic substitutes. The big risk of duties is that fake products restart on the market: Italian-sounding, not Italian, he said. Some American consumers are going to choose the products that cost less.?!ping EUROPE","title":"Italian cheesemakers stockpile in US over fear of Trump tariffs"},{"text":"I hate seeing these headlines that are just so obvious.

And that's to use the power of government agencies to seek retribution against their opponents and political adversaries.Trump has made continuous unconstitutional threats against his perceived enemies, against the media, against journalists, against judges and prosecutors, against the FBI, the DOJ, against anyone who's ever hurt his precious feelings, against any former staff members who have spoken out against him, against all those who he says \\"stole the election\\" from him, against the American people, against anyone who's tried to hold him accountable, against congressman, and the list goes on. And for a while now, we've been warned about this agenda. One that Trump and his MAGA allies intend to follow through on.Through executive actions like schedule F, and by providing the Trump administration with unitary executive privileges and broad immunities, Donald Trump and company will seek to eliminate the independence of most government agencies, fire all staff who are not loyal to the MAGA movement, then flood whatever positions are left with extreme loyalists and sycophants, only to then put these agencies under the direct control of the executive. The goal is to cripple the separation of powers and system of checks and balances that hold our democracy together. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he's the victim of relentless persecution, sometimes even comparing himself to Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, even Jesus Christ. According to him and his followers, he's the most persecuted man on the planet, and a victim of a radical left agenda to undermine him and oppress him at all costs.He has the audacity to claim that \\"the radical left\\" has weaponized \\"three letter organizations\\" and the justice system against him, all while planning to take these same actions against anyone who has ever challenged, criticized or humiliated him.Come January 21st of next year, the MAGA coalition agenda will be to consolidate power and pave the way for a Republican led, one party state and system. \\"Limited government\\" my ass.

And that's to use the power of government agencies to seek retribution against their opponents and political adversaries.Trump has made continuous unconstitutional threats against his perceived enemies, against the media, against journalists, against judges and prosecutors, against the FBI, the DOJ, against anyone who's ever hurt his precious feelings, against any former staff members who have spoken out against him, against all those who he says \\"stole the election\\" from him, against the American people, against anyone who's tried to hold him accountable, against congressman, and the list goes on. And for a while now, we've been warned about this agenda. One that Trump and his MAGA allies intend to follow through on.Through executive actions like schedule F, and by providing the Trump administration with unitary executive privileges and broad immunities, Donald Trump and company will seek to eliminate the independence of most government agencies, fire all staff who are not loyal to the MAGA movement, then flood whatever positions are left with extreme loyalists and sycophants, only to then put these agencies under the direct control of the executive. The goal is to cripple the separation of powers and system of checks and balances that hold our democracy together.Hell, the Trump administration is even creating new agencies out of thin air, and nominating billionaire election influencers and political agitators like Elon Musk to imaginary roles within the government where they can do the most damage possible. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he's the victim of relentless persecution, sometimes even comparing himself to Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, even Jesus Christ. According to him and his followers, he's the most persecuted man on the planet, and a victim of a radical left agenda to undermine him and oppress him at all costs.He has the audacity to claim that \\"the radical left\\" has weaponized \\"three letter organizations\\" and the justice system against him, all while planning to take these same actions against anyone who has ever challenged, criticized or humiliated him.Come January 21st of next year, the MAGA coalition agenda will be to consolidate power and pave the way for a Republican led, one party state and system. \\"Limited government\\" my ass.

I am as left leaning as possible. I believe that human caused climate change is an existential threat to life in the universe.**In Oregon, the last slow train we built, the Orange Line cost 250 million dollars per mile and serves 10,000 daily riders.**A train from Seattle to San Diego spans 1,250 miles, which would be 315 billion dollars, or 9% of federal tax revenue to serve less than 1% of the U.S. population.We can have this train if we increase everyone's federal taxes nationwide by 9%, bumping the average tax rate from 15% to 16.4%. Alternatively, we could shut down all public schools nationwide for half a year, cutting 315 billion dollars from education.Those figures are for a regular train. A high speed train would likely cost more than a slow train. The aforementioned train line was built in Oregon. The new rail line would be built partially in California, where it is more expensive to eminent domain land. It is possible that a west cost high speed train would cost more than 9% of federal revenue.My argument is not that it is too expensive. Its physically impossible to build it in the real world, and therefore we should spend our energy on other topics. I am not arguing against high speed rail, I am claiming that no matter what we absolutely are not going to build it. Because its impossible.The **USA land mass is 35 times** larger than the average European country or Japan. BeijingCKunming is a reasonable comparison.A plane ride from Seattle to San Diego takes 2 hours 45 minutes at a cost of **$70**. A one-way high speed rail ticket from Tokyo to Kyoto (280 miles) costs **$160.**One cannot reduce atmospheric carbon by building 1,000 miles of of anything.There is no amount of increased human activity that will reduce our carbon emissions.

There was a situation akin to a civil war in Ukraine ongoing after this happened, then there were peace talks and an agreement known as the Minsk Accords which was broken by Ukraine, not by Russia. Angela Merkel is on record saying that the west never had any intention that the terms of the agreement should be honoured.Those are a few of the reasons why Russia believes it is fighting a war with NATO and that the west is using Ukraine as NATO's proxy.You can carry on pretending like none of this happened, keep repeating to yourself that Russia just decided to invade Ukraine, \\"unprovoked\\" and out of the blue in 2022 \\"for land\\" or energy resources... Have you seen the size of Russia?  Do you really think they need more land? They're also rich in natural gas and other resources and before 2014 they had a good trading relationship with Ukraine. In fact, they supplied Ukraine with energy at a discounted price.","title":"There is a massive push on media &amp; social media  to convince everyone that Putin is bluffing that Russia would use nukes if pushed to it.

Thanks for posting this and making it free to read.ETA some good bits so people click the link: The one source of hope for Trumps opponents from the history books is that Reagan damaged environmental programs, but he certainly did not dismantle them. The programs remained in place, and in the coming decades, they would grow. Lee M. Thomas, Reagans last EPA administrator, persuaded Reagan that the United States should sign the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. When Reagan delivered his farewell address, the EPA was still standing.The reaction against his administration going too far, moreover, **stimulated a massive mobilization that produced an environmental movement that was stronger in scale and scope than when he started.** Membership in one of the largest organizations, the Sierra Club, reached 364,000 people by 1985. Five years earlier, they were only at 181,000. Although the environment suffered eight years of cuts and inaction, the worst fears did not come to pass, the New York Times reported in 1989, since as a result of Congress, the courts and public opinion  the laws, agencies and public lands survived the Reagan years more or less intact.For the time being, Congress and the courts will not provide an obstacle as they did in the 1980s. **But the public might. Recently energized state governments, working in coalitions, could prove to be effective allies.**","title":"Trumps Executive Picks Are Radical, but Not Unprecedented"},{"text":"There are whole regions of the US that don't even have clean drinking water.

It was cause of covid for some reason, right?The answer for why the prices went soaring during Covid and stays at the same level can be understood by taking one quick glance at the [Federal ReserveBalance Sheet](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) aka \\"How much the money printers are printing\\"Initially they used the excuse of [Repo Market Crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_events_in_the_U.S._repo_market) to start the money printers to fund the pandemic.As the pandemic started trailing off, they passed \\"Inflation Reduction Act\\", which was another excuse to keep the money printers printing, to fund \\"green energy\\" and other progressive agenda. Other excuses to keep the printers running - Ukraine war.In today's economy, the monetary inflation (aka increasing money supply) is the primary cause for price inflation because the newly supplied money is coming at the expense of reduced value of all existing money. Market economics 101.\\"But Keynesians tells us we can keep printing money ...\\"Yes, as long as you can artificially keep up the demand for that money by forcing all countries to use USD to buy Oil, and you eliminate any \\"dictator\\" who dares to [create their own stable currencies](https://theecologist.org/2016/mar/14/why-qaddafi-had-go-african-gold-oil-and-challenge-monetary-imperialism) not bound to the imperial petro-dollar.And, as long as they can keep up with the [forever wars](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_IGU_7alJ80) necessary to keep enforcing this financial paradigm on the world. As this paradigm comes crumbling down with the increased awareness of the people, the prices catch up to the monetary inflation.What people get wrong about the illegal immigration is not that immigration caused the prices to go up/down OR deportation will cause the prices to up/down. Its the opposite. Monetary inflation to fund the pandemics and wars is what made it necessary to bring in mass immigration, and as the fiat USD falls flat on its face with increasing [de-dollarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedollarisation) the population will need to be reduced whether people like it or not.Even if the millions of illegals cannot be physically deported, does not matter. The market will take care of this.Once the charade ends and the dollar starts crashing, and their debit cards start going dry, and the conflicts in their home countries can no longer be funded anymore, not just illegals, but a lot of legal immigrants will start making their way back home.The future will be bright, not just to US but to the whole world.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"Shame that it isn't closer to 60%","title":"53% Of Americans Approve Of Trumps 2nd Term Plans"},{"text":"Why not do both?

Paul said god created men and women with equal dignity.2. For arguments sake, lets say it is written in a book written hundreds of years ago, thats been translated who even knows how many times - religious belief is just that - belief. Its a choice. To believe something that is not factually proven. Anyone trying to impose their religion on anyone - or the rules of their religion on anyone - should not be able to do so to those who dont hold the same beliefs.I support everyones right to believe what they want, but dont dare try to impose divine law onto us secular, nonbelievers. Women are not inferior to men. We are not meant to be subservient to men. Women are not responsible for sexual violence done to us, regardless of what were wearing.3. Taliban care about women - The new religious code issued late last month bans women from raising their voices, reciting the Quran in public and looking at men other than their husbands or relatives. It requires women to cover the lower half of their faces in addition to donning a head covering they were already expected to wear, among other rules. In other news, ultra conservative Shia Muslim parties are trying to lower the age of consent from 18 to NINE, which means men will marry NINE YEAR OLDS.And listen, I dont know if you were being sarcastic or whatever but you struck a nerve. I dont want anyone impressionable reading through this thread to think that god has defined roles for women and men and we have to follow them. Ladies, if someone tells you that you should believe in a god who says your existence is of less consequence than your male counterparts, pump the breaks.

Trumps transition team did not sign agreements with the White House or the Justice Department to allow the FBI to conduct background checks on the president-elects nominees.When we ask, Is there anything else we need to know about? that is usually a good time to mention a police report, a Trump adviser says.

Then acting out as a teen became an excuse for bad behavior. I was born in what used to be a third world country and dont ever remember or saw teens acting out there or ever heard of parents having an issue with their teens. Just wasnt permitted. People had pride in demonstrating maturity vs regressing to infantile behavior. I was myself very well behaved thru my teen years. Nowadays college students are called kids, when a kid actually means child of perhaps less than 5 or 10 years old max. They even call young NBA players kids now.Maturity has slowed down probably due to affluence, enabling a longer lifespan. People are allowed or encouraged to delay maturity and indulge themselves vs having to survive in the old days with a shorter lifespan. 20 something year olds today have about the same level of maturity as teens 100 years ago. 50 year olds today look and act a lot younger than 50 year olds 100 years ago who if you look at old photos or film reels look wrinkled, gray, and wizened, acting very stuffy. Women looked very dowdy in their dress and were often seen knitting on a rocking chair. They all moved stiffly. Elderly women who married as a teen were likely very mature when they did so.

It's only recently that my home state of Oregon started following the CA model and allowing ballots to arrive after election day as long as they were mailed by election day. The argument against that model is that it makes it harder to vote (just by giving you less time to do it) and there is no realistic reason to do it. We don't NEED the votes to be 100% counted for near a month after the election. Most elected officials won't take office until January and the EC doesn't meet to elect the President until mid December. A second difference might be that we have national ID cards and a register of all eligible voters and where exactly they live. I figure we dont need as many checks.Again, this is going to vary by state but this is similar to how most states do things I think. In CA as an example you do have to register to vote and provide proof of residency to show where you live. Most people think the fact that some states don't require ID at the exact time you vote (you can't provide ID if you vote by mail) means there are no checks of any kind. In CA as an example you need to provide some identifier that the state can use to look you up and verify you are eligible. As an example, you need to provide a CA ID number or the last 4 of your social security number. From there the state can verify all the information you provided is correct and that you are eligible. If you don't provide or don't have that information you still need to show up in person with ID to verify you are eligible the first time you try to vote. Once you're registered we primarily validate everything by comparing the signature on your ballot to the signature on file with the elections office/the department of motor vehicles. And lastly, we do have pretty good pollsters who are able to provide a pretty accurate prognosis right in the second the polls close.?We do this too. Most elections, especially the big ones, are called very quickly. It may not be in \\"seconds\\" after the polls close but even in CA where they are still counting all but 2 US House races have been called. The majority were called within 24 hours of polls close and often sooner. It's also done based on a ton of statistical modeling. The agencies who make the calls use polling data from before the election, polls done right after people vote (exit polls), and the results as they come in to make those calls. The thing is some outlets HAVE gotten a call wrong in the past so their threshold for making a call is pretty high.","title":"Trump Won Less Than 50 Percent.

Have a separation between the president and the DOJ and make the DOJ an independent agency like the Fed or the FTC. Make the Supreme Court always have an equal number of liberal and conservative justices, with new justices always being appointed in pairs by the majority and the minority in the Senate.

What will kill democracy is a partisan bad faith Supreme Court making ridiculous decisions, and loyalists civil servants and military abiding by those decisions (or ignoring the courts if the president orders them to). At that point the Supreme Court could always toss out ballots so republicans will always win trifectas. They could reinterpret the Bill of Rights to allow for government censorship and indefinite detention of persons.Of course, safeguarding the Supreme Court, the civil service and the military is ideally something you would do when drafting a Constitution. Because it's almost impossible to do it later when one of the parties is already corrupted like this.The best that Democrats can do for now, is to obstruct and play hardball for as long as necessary and hope that one day the GOP will get over this fever; or do such a big power grab (like adding 5 blue states and stacking the SCOTUS with liberal justices) that republicans would have no choice but to come to the negotiating table.","title":"Trump hush money sentencing delayed indefinitely"},{"text":"We're gonna do it the way alien greys would do it.
