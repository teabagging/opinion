People forced to train their own replacements, entire support team jobs shipped overseas, salaries in general went to shit for everyone because of this program, and people are still being screwed obviously. I got to the point that if I had an interview scheduled and the hiring manager or HR person was from India, I didn't bother taking it because either the salary was going to be 10-20 grand less than similar positions or they just wouldn't even consider me for the position.

Increased supply leads it decrease in demand, leading to less pressure to offer competitive wage increases. H1B visas will also get paid a \\"prevailing wage\\" to prevent undercutting domestic wages, which do not reflect market salary, thus leading to an employer hiring H1B for 85K a year over an American for 120K a year.

Reddit collects your data. Google. X. Facebook (also, even if you \\"delete\\" your facebook, they keep your account so you can reactivate it at ANY time).Spotify: not American, collects data on you and your interests, and does a lot better job than tiktok at collecting and studying data on you, the listener. (Before I got premium this week, I had a conversation with my coworkers about how Happy Meals still have toys: In the past year of listening, I had zero Happy Meal ads, all McD's ads were things like McRib and McChicken, but the second ad after that talk with coworkers? Happy Meal. I went premium because I kept getting the ASMR scentiva ad and it's so profoundly unpleasant.)But yeah, everything is listening and watching, TikTok is the least of your worries.More concerning to me is Temu, which buys data from sites like Reddit and Facebook and X (and tiktok), and uses it to sell to people. It was originally an American company, then it went to the Caymans, then to China, and now Ireland. The company is only a few years old and has exploded because they buy data and use it to make very targeted adverts (then they just sell the cheap stuff from wish, but for more expensive). And since Temu jumps countries as soon as there's an issue in one (like taxes, or the law), it's not like they are going to be terribly hurt by any bans against China except where they have to order wish products to whatever country they are in at the time before repackaging them for the US.And yes, China bad or whatever: but TikTok primarily uses the information same as any other social media platform does: to sell your interests to advertisers.Bonus: the fact that nowadays, most of your information is tied to a single company: be it Google or Apple, which people then use to login to things like TikTok. And so Apple or Google also has all the same information on you that TikTok does.","title":"How do people think TikTok is evil and spying on us but the rest of the internet does not?

They are harms of directing one's anger at someone. This is crucial. When you are angry at someone, you end up either inflicting physical violence or else controlling the person through your anger, which is emotional abuse and which can be just as bad or worse than physical violence.  There is a way to process anger which involves fully owning the experience of anger. This is the anger that leads to healthy boundaries and clarity in how you move through the world. I'm not overly familiar with the research on venting anger which suggests that this just makes it grow. But my guess is that the participants did not fully own their anger, or they didn't release it fully. Or there was something about the way they vented it which only re-enforced their old pattern of suppression, perhaps because their anger wasn't \\"held\\" with unconditional love by whatever coaches or therapists were facilitating the venting, and so they actually felt more shame about their anger afterwards.In summary, anger is basically the emotional extension of your physical immune system and developing a healthy relationship with it is one of the best personal development levers that I know of. But it requires know-how to overcome all the conditioning which almost everyone has around anger. Because people are so conditioned, you may be correct that it is most frequently a harmful rather than beneficial driver of behavior. But since you say that you yourself have a problematic relationship with it, I wanted to point out that there is a vital benefit that's hidden underneath the glaring examples of harm.","title":"CMV: Anger is overly glorified and has limited utility in the modern world"},{"text":"I bet TikTok buys Truth social in the near future","title":"Trump Pleads With Supreme Court to Let Him Save TikTok | \\nThe president-elect reportedly met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month"},{"text":"I've always thought this as well, but I'd be interested in hearing how one might spin this whole H1-B thing as a positive that perhaps I don't understand.?

To avoid spoilers, thats all Ill give you, a name.Every demon choses to perfect a single spell over their long lives, often creating spells so good that humans and elves are unable to alter or improve them without intense study.If you read along, this is actually a bad thing since the specialization and longevity of demons can result in spells that are, at their time, insurmountable. Yes, Zoltraak was eventually usurped but during its time, it was NEVER beaten, but there are other curses which are not solved that can actually doom humanity due to the nature of how esoteric and specialized the demons can get. The demons are also strong, capable of rivalling or surpassing the greatest of mages (including frieren) so its not trivial to simply let demons practice their craft unabated and uncontrolled. The nature of magic and counters means some demons will require very specific counters (the demonking being one such) even battle happy giga mages like Serie admit they could not defeat the demon king. It took a perfect storm or even something more by the heroes party.Every demon is confirmed to be an absolute ticking time bomb. Letting them continue their magic training unabated will only spell doom, especially if its esoteric and weird enough to not be combatted and therefore exists as a curse. If you catch up to the current manga stage, we are talking high level concepts in terms of magic control. Imagine if demons could break apart the strong nuclear force that holds atoms together, or time magic or completely nullify human magic mana? There is no known limits to the magic system and that stuff is explored in the manga. Its pointless discussing this further if you are not up to date with the manga that does explore this and should be the basis of season 2. I can give an example using show material, we saw that plant with magic reflective surface use a sleeping curse in a large area. What if a demon developed a spell like that but its global and had bonus penetrative bonuses against the goddess protection against curses (and yes, we see that there are curses that can completely bypass goddess protection). Humanity, overnight, instantly becomes sleeping cattle to be harvested at will and allowed to breed in controlled limits at the demon's discretion as a farmable resoruce because you let a demon develop freely.The season 3 (conjecture, but based off rough arcs, current manga) stuff is even more advanced magic fuckery. Although admittedly it doesnt seem to be demon sourced, it does show that there doesnt seem to be boundaries to the possibility of magic. Giving demons free reign to practice is a recipe for complete disaster.Demons are known to be cunning, its part of your points you acknowledge that they can use long term planning. They will absolutely be using long term planning to break free and destroy humanity.Edit* This is a spoiler/non spoiler but we also dont know the precise mechanisms of demon reproduction/replication. This is just a further massive wrench in any attempts at using them as a controlled resource to extract research from.","title":"CMV: The demons in Frieren could be integrated into human society under certain circumstances"},{"text":"And Trump is hovering around +- atm.

I'll let [el gato talk for me](https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/immigration-immigrants-and-the-american).(Grabbed from the middle of a long essay) vivek did not put his case especially well, but that does not mean hes wrong. to see if we cant get to the bottom of this, lets look at some basic economic and incentive reality: workers do not want to compete with foreign labor just as companies do not want to compete with foreign producers. everyone would like more pay or more profit with less effort. but one way or another, such competition will always emerge because the alternative is far worse. the \\"don't import the workers!\\" issue is a fallacy because if we don't, these same consumers will just buy more foreign made products and US jobs will be lost to it. unless you never buy foreign sneakers or autos, that's how it works and consumers are certainly not going to agree to the same stricture of you cannot hire from abroad if you could hire locally! just pay a higher price! when told you cannot buy a foreign made stereo system if US makes them too! they rapidly discover what US made amplifiers and speakers (the best in the world BTW) cost. you want a $500 stereo, not a $5,000 or $50,000 one. fair enough. but unless folks are going to agree to pay $4 a banana and that kiwis are now priced like jewelry and only buy american, goods are going to cross borders and consumers will benefit from it. saying no hiring foreign workers and then buying foreign products made by foreign workers in foreign countries is hypocrisy, but saying so only buy american generally winds up worse.","title":"Looks like Vivek's 15 minutes are about up"},{"text":"I got a Bachelors in Computer Engineering in 2022.

Both sides have good points. The hardcore conservatives have solid proof that the program is being abused and it's clear that Musk is downplaying the fact that he wants cheap labor for his companies. However both Musk and Vivek are right about the decline in the quality of American tech talent and how it is directly related to the culture. I mean, conservatives were the first to complain about the quality of higher education and how it has been corrupted by left-wing policies. While the average American spends time partying, doing college sports, hooking up, doing extracurricular activities, joining clubs and playing politics for 4 years there's a guy in Poland or India that codes 24/7 from the age of 17 in an attempt to escape poverty or mediocrity. Is it surprising that they end up doing better? I literally had two American candidates recently asking me about the \\"workplace rules regarding harassment and mental health\\". Mind you, the \\"workplace\\" is essentially just Slack, so I was like \\"well we just follow common sense and are decent human beings and never had any complaints\\". They did not like my response.  What did the guy from Poland ask? He asked about our scaling efforts and how we detect slow database queries. What I've noticed throughout the years is that, yes the top 1% of tech workers are either Americans or Asians (Chinese, Korean and Indian). But unless you have Google's budget you can't hire the MIT graduates that aim for Silicon Valley salaries but you might still want to have access to the top 20%. That's where Americans lose.Another trend I noticed on Twitter and Reddit were people blaming H1B for the stagnation the tech market is experiencing the last two years but that's wrong. If an American entry level engineer is struggling with landing a job then interest rates and AI are much more responsible than H1Bs. Hiring has slowed down because of the lack of cheap VC capital.Now from a libertarian perspective it is, again, a problem caused by government intervention. On a surface level, tying an H1-B visa holder to a single employer partially enslaves them. They are more eager to do unpaid overtime because their access to a top tech market is depending on it.  On a deeper level, why not just let companies hire whoever they want? If the government blocks hiring from other countries why not ban exporting goods and services to other countries or importing materials from other countries. I bet conservatives are more than eager to buy cheaper phones or clothes manufactured by kids on sweat shops but they get upset when an Indian gets H1B.","title":"H1B situation"},{"text":"Ya I go the AskTrumpSupporters sub and its the same exact thing.","title":"Musk says hateful unrepentant racists must be removed from GOP as visa feud deepens"},{"text":"History has been telling that since before I was born (m60) but they dont pay attention because politics is boring","title":"Elon Musk Warns 'Hateful, Unrepentant Racists' Will Be the 'Downfall of the Republican Party' as MAGA Immigration Debate Intensifies"},{"text":"If you approve of a certain person or group just because you're told to, or just because of some immutable characteristic, and then follow them blindly despite decades of wrongdoings, you might be the mind controlled one.","title":"Lefties love calling people on right naz!s Yet they are bashing on jewish people and supporting assassinations (luigi &amp;, trump attempt) Who are the actual naz!s here?

Finally there has been a massive increase in foreign student numbers, which has multiple causes, the two key ones being that there was a backlog of demand post Covid but also their universities are increasingly dependent upon foreign students for funding.Im actually relatively pro immigration in the UK but our current immigration and asylum systems (note that theyre two separate but related problems) has been intentionally trashed over the past 14 years to provide an easy scapegoat.","title":"Musk says hateful unrepentant racists must be removed from GOP as visa feud deepens"},{"text":"That and he endorsed Donald \\"Theyre poisoning the blood of our country\\" fucking Trump.","title":"Musk says hateful unrepentant racists must be removed from GOP as visa feud deepens"},{"text":"I've struggled with defining the exact number because of its complexity. Estimates range from just under 100k to about 200k but there's really no way to nail down exactly how many were directly attributed to apathetic republicans.The calculus involves population density, climate, individual governing practices, vaccine rates over time, and other things which makes it a moving target.The easiest way to get the closest would be to compare global hospitalizations and death rates, pre vaccine, to regional H and D R's factoring climate to compare. A dense population would logically be more disadvantaged in a pandemic so we have to factor for that as well.Once the vaccine came out, things became a bit muddier because anti vaxxers were beneficiaries of herd immunity and therefore harder to differentiate statistically beyond simple vaccine efficacy numbers. In short, the stubborn morons dragged out the vaccine rollout for everyone, but if they weren't in the statistical column of anti vax covid death, then they now enjoy the benefits of widespread vaccination anyway. This is why comparisons of total deaths don't really line up globally. Because we had a very efficient vaccine rollout, comparatively, due to Bidens efforts which stopped our deaths in our most vulnerable areas that other countries didn't have.So I used tens of thousands because it most definitively is at the high end of that number at least, and is unconcionably high. I do this to avoid accusations of exaggeration and to not have my number confused with total deaths.","title":"Trump transition team plans immediate WHO withdrawal, expert says"},{"text":"I havent seen any indication reddit or the broad left is against h-1b or immigration in general.

She never seems to have money but when her fridge went out she had to have the best.  Rented some $4000 fridge.  She OD on something at some point.  Prescriptions.  Tried to sue Walmart.  Judge told her Walmart didnt tell her to use them all at once.  Note on foster care.  While she abused it, and has been heavily manipulating of the kids, they seem well enough for having been in the system.  Little co dependent, ok a lot, but that comes with the abuse/neglect that got them in foster care in the first place.  I thinks shes retirement age now or very close.  I have no idea what her social security benefits are but you earn those by working so I got no issue with those.i.

But this hinges on society at large to simply be stronger than the psychopaths and impose a need of being careful on them.Without explaining whether demons in the series actually need to kill humans or not, it is not reasonable to assume demons can integrate into human society... but given that weak demons must exist even in demon society, and that it would be hard for them to survive in it in a non-servile state (in which their pride will be injured) it is likely to assume many weak demons are simply hidden in human society and are actually integrated. This probably requires a delicate balance of power where humans are actually able to over-power said demons at least with group action. Which is likely. but unable to detect them if they are hidden - which is also likely. plainly stated - a weak demon has a conflict of prides: the pride of being a superior being against the pride of being master of her own fate.

The teaching of Christianity is that nobody deserves salvation, but Christ dying gives people salvation. It is by Gods mercy that people are saved. So the quotes you gave about salvation only existing through Jesus are saying that quite literally Jesus is the only reason that a path other than Death exists. It isnt saying someone has to be a Christian for God to save them; it is saying that the only way to be saved is if God saves you.Your third quote about Christianity states that only those who do Gods will will enter the kingdom of heaven. It also explicitly says that many who identify as Christians will not be saved. So if being Christian is not enough, then what does God mean when he says people need to be doing his will to be saved?*Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. \\nThen he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me. (Matthew 25:34-36, 41-43).*\\nBeing a Christian is not mentioned as a criteria. All of the verses and writings about salvation are too much to cover in a reddit comment. And different denominations have different interpretations so its not like I can cover all of them anyway. But your verses dont mean that only Christians can go to heaven.

The consensus on Reddit, which leans left, is that the H-1b program is bad for American jobs and immoral for how it treats foreigners. This point of view is wasteful and illogical. It ignores economic realities and lacks perspective.?A principle of economics is the concept of marginal returns. When it comes to employees, each additional marginal employee must result in a positive or neutral profit. An economically sound business cannot hire someone if adding that employee would result in negative marginal profit.?The bean counters in Elons companies have likely run the numbers and determined that they can only add additional employees who are willing to work long hours for low pay.??Most American graduates in these industries will not accept jobs that offer low pay for long hours.??These theoretical jobs exist, but Americans are unwilling to fill them. So without foreign workers, the potential to the economy of filling the job goes to waste.?This is analogous to certain agricultural jobs where produce would rot without foreign workers.?Filling these jobs with foreign workers will not hurt American jobs. In fact, the boost to the local and national economy brought by filling these jobs should boost American jobs.?When the value potential of these jobs are realized by adding a foreign worker, true value is created. Some of the value will go to the corporation as profit. Some of it will benefit society from innovation. Some of it will go to governments at all levels through taxes. Some of it will go to the foreign countries through remittances. But much of it will go directly back into the local economy through the expenditures of the foreign workers and their families.?More money flowing into the local economy as a result of created value means that more businesses that sell goods or services that foreign workers buy will thrive. A growing market will boost entrepreneurship in the area. More businesses means more jobs. More opportunities means more job openings for the positions they left. It sends cascading benefits throughout the economy.?For example, more businesses means more computer science jobs.?Further, more taxes means more government jobs and more government contracting jobs at local and national levels.?Filling these jobs with foreign workers is not the grave moral affront it is purported to be. Just because many Americans are unwilling to work those hours for that pay does not mean a foreign worker would not want the opportunity. Even if its creating a relationship ripe for abuse because of the power the company has over the H-1b holder, viewing it as inherently cruel lacks perspective.??Many foreign workers would work very hard and make many sacrifices for the opportunity to work under such conditions.?In my opinion, it is far more cruel to deny them the opportunity based on what we think is acceptable.?Seeing as Reddit leans left, It seems to me the prevailing view is a result of a new nativism on the left.??I suspect these flawed theories, that adding foreign workers suppresses jobs and invites cruelty, is a smokescreen to disguise our more base human nature. That outsiders are a threat to us and can only make things worse. That we dont have enough to share with them, regardless of the benefits they might provide in return.?I believe that Americas greatest strength in innovation and progress is a result of our strong history of immigration. We build the best ideas because we bring in the best from across the world and put their brains to good use.??By attempting to stifle immigration, we threaten one of the things that actually makes America great.?","title":"Trump sides with Musk on support for H-1B visas for foreign tech workers | \\nRemarks follow social media posts from Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who vowed to go to war to defend program"},{"text":"Theyre so self centered too.

Im generally pro-legal immigration, especially immigrants who come here to work hard, assimilate well to American society in terms of values/cultural norms and contribute back to society in terms of paying taxes and not acting as a net drain on the system. Thats the American dream, and I believe these folks should have a streamlined shot at naturalization/citizenship.At the same time, we cannot rob native born Americans of opportunities by flooding the country with immigrants, especially those brought here en masse by corporations to pad their bottom line by replacing hard working Americans using lower wages. Thats wrong, and a source of legitimate grievance for American workers. The right balance has to be struck here. America still needs to be the land of opportunity, but not at the expense of those Americans who are also trying to live the American dream. Frankly I think the education system in this country needs a full reset, so 4 year colleges arent just producing unskilled, ignorant woketards. Rather workers who can compete with H1B workers in terms of engineering skills, and whom should be given priority in terms of work opportunities. So theres clearly room for optimization here, and corporations need to get with the program and play by the rules.

They're not just acting on instinct like your spider example. They make conscious, calculated decisions to deceive and kill humans. maybe they'd even be able to find a spell that could remove demonkind's bloodlust for humansThis is incredibly naive. Why would demons want to change their fundamental nature? They don't view their predation on humans as a problem to solve. That's like expecting a serial killer to research ways to stop enjoying murder.The demons' magical innovations come directly from their drive to become better at hunting humans. Take away that motivation, and you lose the very thing you're trying to exploit. You can't separate their creativity from their murderous nature.More importantly, creating a system where some humans are sacrificed to demons (even criminals) would be a massive moral failure. It would legitimize demons' view of humans as prey and create perverse incentives in the justice system. We'd likely see more death sentences just to keep our demon \\"allies\\" fed.The only ethical approach is to continue treating demons as the existential threat they are.

Trump. A man who openly allied with white nationalists, banned Muslims from entering the country, and has a long track record of empty promises. Trumps Middle East policies have always been theater, designed to rile up his base, while placating hardliners like Mike Huckabee. Yet, these so-called activists fell for his posturing and voted for him, or worse, threw their votes away on Jill Stein.Lets be clear: this isnt a victory for Arab or Muslim Americans.

Men are honestly some of the most emotional people because of anger. But for some reason they don't consider getting angry to be getting emotional. Like it's a trope in society that women are the emotional ones, meanwhile men commit the vast majority of violent crimes, especially \\"crimes of passion\\" due to their own insatiable anger. And growing up, the men in my family were extremely angry and abusive all the time while the women were level-headed and could actually control their emotions. I just think it's complete bullshit when men try to say \\"women are so emotional\\". However, I disagree with where you said \\"anger has limited utility in the modern world\\". Anger is the only emotion that allows us to stand up for ourselves, self-advocate, be assertive, enact justice, be confrontational, protect others, fight when we need to, etc. Anger is how you stop people from walking all over you because \\"I'm just non-confrontational\\" or \\"I'm a people-pleaser\\". Anger is how you stand up for yourself when your landlord tries to increase your rent suddenly, without notice, because they want to save up for a new yacht. Anger is how you confront someone about mistreating you and demand respect. I know of way too many people who just don't get angry when they need to, and it shows. They're always in miserable situations that they've allowed to happen to themselves because they won't be confrontational and they just let other people use them, exploit them, walk all over them, treat them unfairly, forget about them, etc. They're like meek little ghosts that just get pushed around and never stand up for themselves, and it's led to some pretty miserable circumstances for them.

Going as far as rephrasing the term \\"negative emotions\\" with something like \\"uncomfortable emotions\\" to not illicit guilt or shame when feeling something unpleasant. The problem with philosophies like Bhuddism or what you mentioned is that they are really not compatible with modern lifestyles/western cultures. You can't completely detach yourself from everything and you can't eliminate emotions like anger. You can definitely modify how you respond to them, though.

I think it really depends on how the next four years of Trump goes because I still think Trump wins reelection in 2020 if COVID never happened. The level of disaster (if it goes that way) will dictate the kind of Democrat that runs against Trump. 2028 could literally be a repeat of us falling back on an established Democrat if Trump shits the bed in an enormous way.

The nature of the H1B as a non-immigration visa means that it will always be open to exploitation, even if that exploitation is in a golden cage. No matter how you manage the current program, the sponsor will always control the visa and that means that people on the visa will always be susceptible to mistreatment.The program should instead be entirely eliminated and replaced with a visa that is expensive for the sponsor to obtain, but protects the recipient from deportation regardless of employment (provided that they do not incur a need for social services) and gives eligibility for a green card after a term of years.This program would still allow for the importation of top talent, but would change the control of the visa from the sponsor to the beneficiary; giving the beneficiary the ability to bargain and/or change jobs if mistreated. It would also provide an incentive for immigration and investment in the US, rather than allowing a well-paid (rare under H1B) foreign national to save up for ten years, all with the knowledge that they will be forced to return to their country of origin because the H1B doesn't allow them to settle here permanently. The high cost would additionally create a built-in incentive to try to hire an American first; which would result in the new visa being reserved for the kind of revolutionary engineers, scientists, doctors, and etc. that the H1B visa was originally designed for.","title":"CNNs Jennings: GOP Can Compromise on Immigration by Eliminating Fraud in H-1B Program"},{"text":"I don't give two shits.

These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there.

Fields like AI, biotech, and engineering arent things the average American is just walking intothey take years of specialized training. The problem is that were not producing enough graduates in those areas fast enough to keep up with demand.On wages, youre absolutely rightcompanies do like having a bigger labor pool to keep wages down. But the bigger issue isnt immigration itself; its the lack of investment in education and training in the U.S. If we were pumping out more high skilled workers, companies wouldnt need to bring in immigrants as often. Blaming immigration alone is letting corporations off the hook for not investing in the domestic workforce.And for fields like agriculture, raising wages isnt as simple as you make it sound. If farms had to pay a lot more, food prices would go up, and its regular people whod feel that hit. Im not saying we shouldnt aim for fairer wages, but pretending that just raising pay would magically fix everything isnt realistic.At the end of the day, immigration can definitely impact wages in some industries, but its not the whole story. The bigger problem is how corporations prioritize profits over long-term investment in workers in the countries they operate.

Although Hindenburg went along with most of Hitlers demands (in dissolving the Reichstag when he wanted to and in writing decrees), Hitler did not wield those \\"dictatorial powers\\" until Hindenburg died - Hitler assumed the office of Reichspresident without an election and against the provisions in the Constitution that should have prevented combining both offices in one person.Additionally, the Reichstag had a majority supporting Hitler, so it did not move against any Article 48 decrees.\\nUltimately, Hitler rose to power because the German people elected a majority that supported him. The Nazis did everything by the book until there was no one left in power to complain about them going off the book.The mechanism for Hitler to claim dictatorial powers was an Act of the German Reichstag to amend the Constitution, allowing the Office of the Reichskanzler to pass legislation into law without any involvement of the Reichstag. That Act had nothing to do with Article 48.So, again, the Weimar Constitution was not weak, as it actually fended off several attempted coups. The German State was weak.
