The movie ticket debate has certainly affected more Americans at some point in their lives. And, one could easily argue that its blatantly unfair out the gate. \\nIts not fair in sports if someone has a high metabolism or natural gladiator physique either. Or if someone is in a wheelchair.

Others actually say that trans women who have undergone testosterone suppression actually are at a *disadvantage*, because in most cases youre effectively running a larger machine on a smaller engine. Things like bone density, muscle mass and fat distribution change with introduction of oestrogen into the system. I say in most cases because there are trans women who are the same physical size as cis women. A trans woman who isnt on hormones, sure, there could be advantages. But it isnt fair to say all trans women should be kept from sport, because it is more than likely that the ones who are on hormones have no advantage at all.People hear trans woman and think of a huge burly guy in a dress but just like cis women, there are a diverse range of body types and certainly if a trans woman has been on puberty blockers and then hormones for a long time, shes virtually indistinguishable from a cis woman to look at. There are trans women who have only ever gone through female puberty, so impactful levels of testosterone have never been in their system. How is it fair to exclude them from sport?Edit: also in high school, kids develop at different rates anyway! Girls often develop at a faster rate than boys, I remember when I was 16 a lot of my boy friends were still baby faced while the girls had basically fully developed.

Allow me to enlighten you. First and foremost Newsom is basically bankrolled by the electric companies. Three of the most expensive fires in the state were caused by either PG&amp;E, or SoCal Edison and caused billions of dollars worth of property damage. They were each sued and told to pay for damages. This settlement was then absolved by the Public Utilities Commission, of which every member was appointed by Newsom. Prior to Newsom California had a tax incentive for private solar panels which created a massive boom in the industry. Newsom revoked this incentive because he claimed \\"solar farms generate more jobs\\" and that the power companies claimed the private panels were overloading the grid that they were supposed to fix with the money they saved from not having to payout lawsuits. Another fantastic one is where the money for the SB-1 money is. Back in 2016 California voted on a measure SB-1 that instituted a gas tax that was to fund infrastructure projects across the state. For the last 8 years the money had funded tons of rehabilitation and new construction projects creating a construction boom. A subsequent bill was also passed to ensure that the money could not be used for anything other than that specific purpose. Newsom was busted several times for trying to dip into the SB-1 money to try and fund various pet projects. He even tried to classify homelessness as \\"human infrastructure\\" in an attempt to bypass the secondary law but was shot down by the California supreme Court. Mysteriously, last year, when the state was somehow facing a budgetary crisis, all infrastructure bids were cancelled citing lack of funding. Equally mysterious was the massive influx of financing the state employee pension fund got that had been sorely needed for years but was denied funding due to mismanagement.

And for all of their whining, if the tables were turned, you know damn well that conservatives would be having a collective conniption fit while demonizing and publicly harassing the nominee every chance they get.That being said:Hegseth previously led a partisan organization called \\"Concerned Veteran for America,\\" which has strong ties to the Koch Network. Hegseth was eventually forced out of the advocacy group due to \\"mismanagement of funds, sexual impropriety and reports of intoxicated behavior.\\"In fact, he was booted from another conservative group, \\"Veterans for Freedom,\\" for similar complaints. Which raises questions about his suitability for a position that oversees the countrys largest federal agency that employs more than 2.8 million people.A report about Hegseth's time as president of CVA describes him as being \\"repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity and sometimes needing to be carried out of the organizations events.\\"Hegseth has been a Fox News contributor since 2014.He has also been pretty vocal in the past about his opposition to women serving in combat roles. There are a lot of concerns among women in uniform right now related to fears that Hegseth will hinder efforts to prevent sexual assault and harassment in the military.Despite Republicans complaining about \\"the left's violent rhetoric,\\" Hegseth has received backlash for labeling all left-leaning Americans as \\"domestic enemies.\\"Hegseth has been accused of being an extremist. A fellow service member once called him an \\"insider threat\\" after seeing a tattoo of his that's associated with white supremacist groups. The Army considers an insider threat someone who is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from a person or people within the organization.Hegseth has of course blamed these criticisms on \\"wokeness,\\" and even wrote a book about it titled, The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free. The War on Warriors uncovers the deep roots of our dysfunction C a society that has forgotten the men who take risks, cut through red tape, and get their hands dirty. The only kind of men prepared to face the dangers that the Left pretends dont exist,Hegseth has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California after a speaking engagement. It's been reported that he barred the door to her hotel room and took away her cell phone.  Although Hegseth denied the allegations and was never charged, he did pay a settlement to the accuser.Questions were raised when his account of the events changed while under investigation.The settlement also included a confidentiality agreement.Remember the tasteless smear campaign against Tim Walz and his time in the National Guard? Well, not a peep from conservatives this time despite Hegseth being pulled from his National Guard duties due to concerns from members of his unit. Oh, and the concerns were raised when Hegseth was assigned responsibilities for Joe Biden's inauguration.Then there's his outspoken and controversial support for the Blackwater contractors who killed 14 unarmed Iraqi Civilians during the 2007 Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad. Hegseth lobbied President Donald Trump to pardon these contractors, which Trump ultimately did at the end of his first term.Shockingly, Hegseth has also downplayed January 6th, particularly the violent role that any veterans played during the attack.Hegseth is just another example of the rampant cronyism, corruption, misogyny, and extremism we will come to expect from the next Trump administration. an administration that's already estimated to be the richest in U.S. history and filled the brim with far right MAGA loyalists.","title":"Pete Hegseth's Opening Statement Thanking Trump Interrupted By Protesters: 'You Are A Misogynist'"},{"text":"Yes he has some Neo Nazis supporting him but that doesn't mean he is one","title":"I don't see how Trump could be a fascist"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/1xbnfh3da1de1.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1fd684448555bf0c5bfed8d107eca3e0676668a","title":"Trumps Cabinet Proves MAGA Never Valued Meritocracy"},{"text":"Apparently this isn't true.

He had almost four years to secure a conviction even with all the judicial interference that is just unacceptable. And not a word about the injustice when you have partisan hacks like Cannon, Alito, and Thomas essentially pulling off a judicial coup to prevent a trial before the election. To your point, Biden had a lot of chances to speak out on the issue or fire Garland and he didnt. He also had a window before the election where he could have used his presumptive immunity to counter the judicial malpractice that was going on.In any event, Biden, Garland, and Democratic party leadership were complacent with the status quo and failed to protect the country from a traitor.

They just build. They said, \\"Build over here, build over there.\\" With us, you have to go through years, but I'll make it possible to create tremendous amounts of electricity very rapidly.

Hardly dominating.If trans athletes had a significant advantage you'd expect to see teams made up predominantly of trans athletes,  yet you don't.

Sounds like a fair requirement for league where money is on the line, and she managed to meet it.Fairness is not stopping children playing sports because of their gender identity. Fact is that trans people exist and will continue to exist. If we're playing the save the children card its important children learn how to treat everyone with fairness and respect.

The MN legislature has an even number of seats, so ties generally result in power sharing agreements. There was a tie in November, so negotiations between the DFL and MN GOP proceeded to share power in the chamber.However a series of lawsuits derailed negotiations. MN GOP decided they would refuse to seat Rep Tabke who won his election by just a few votes, a move which would give them a definitive majority to take the chamber and elect a speaker.However their plan hit a bump in the road when they realized that MN statutes require a quorum to begin a session, and the DFL boycotted. MN GOP with just 67 votes did not have the required 68 to meet the quorum requirements. So presiding officer DFL Secretary of State Steven Simon gaveled the session to a close. After the session was closed, the MN GOP ignored Simon's ruling and began house business as normal, electing their own speaker.This will likely go to the courts now, which could result in a drawn out process where Minnesota effectively has no recognized lower chamber to conduct business of the state. All state offices are controlled by the DFL, the senate is controlled by the DFL, and the state Supreme Court has a liberal majority.","title":"Constitutional crisis: Minnesota House Republicans elect speaker after Simon adjourns session"},{"text":"You have that right on Inanna.

Comparing race to gender is such a blatant false equivalency. They literally have nothing in common.And you simply just don't have the facts. Not all transgender people are the same. Some take HRT before puberty. Meaning they have virtually zero biological differences in athletic performance than cisgendered people. For trans that take HRT after puberty, studies show their performance to be in closer alignment to cisgendered individuals after 1-2 years of HRT.In fact, some metrics show transwomen actually have WORSE performance than cisgendered women after HRT. For example, lung capacity is WORSE on average.Not all sports are the same either. Many are more about skill than physicality. Such as Archery, Curling, Darts, Shooting, Billiards, Bowling, Softball, etc....The NCAA and IOC are also PRIVATE entities. They can set the rules themselves based on experts of the sports, statistical analyses, and medical studies.Lastly, the number of trans athletes is TRIVIALLY, INFITESIMALLY SMALL. We're talking less than 50 in the NCAA out of 500,000 athletes. And there's no statistical evidence that those 50 are dominating in any way.Then, you have the fact that transwomen have been competing in sports since the 70s. Literally \\\\~50 years.Yeah...no.

And there is no way for America to manufacture everything, especially not instantly.

The second and third one are self explanatory; waging holy war to exterminate the enemies of traditional values *and* torture and execution of people who have the wrong beliefs? This is basically their wet dream, regardless if either are completely unjustifiable from a theological perspective. Additionally, the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church makes it super easy to figure out what the church believes and doesn't believe.

However, they have all stated they have to be incredibly gradual. They have to keep slowly raising that price so consumers are going to start moving over to american-made options, or companies have time to adjust and get things more American as opposed to all over the place. Now that's in an ideal world of the past where it was basically down to either something completely made here, or something made from a foreign company and imported. We now live in a world where you have an item that's made from parts and items from all over the world, and it's rather difficult to put it all into one spot. Not to mention a political cycle that changes every 4 years, and how easily anyone with money can pour enough campaign donations to buy out the government. This is why I always throw out there that China and Canada and all these other countries can simply sit and wait 4 years and let the prices in the US be high, and probably spend money on campaigns through social media and everywhere else to blame it all on Trump. Make everybody suffer enough that they will vote him out or at least in 2 years. Vote out the Republicans in Congress who will then turn around and start doing things to reverse Trump's policy. We don't live in a world where it's all or nothing anymore. There's too many options where companies can simply let the consumers suffer and do the work for them of removing the obstruction, or put their business elsewhere. I'm not saying an actual realistic tariff plan, which is something Trump obviously would never do, wouldn't work, but these decisions popping up seem to be the logic of people living in the past.","title":"Trump Team Studies Gradual Tariff Hikes Under Emergency Powers"},{"text":"Bro didnt even study for the test he knew was coming ??","title":"Trumps cabinet is a joke"},{"text":"Piss off with that shitty take. 75 million of us voted against that asshole and dont deserve the terror hes inflicting on every American.","title":"Trump would have been convicted of election interference, DoJ report says"},{"text":"  Thanks for lying.I  did not lie.

There's maybe a small handful of transgender athletes, and in only rare cases do they perform above average in their league.Participation requirements should be determined at the league level, not by the federal government, and restrictions should be based off actual evidence of clear competitive unfairness.As an example of how absurd this has become, Fox News, a while back, wrote several articles, which they featured prominently on their front page, about a high school track team, which won a track meet, and had a transgender student on the team. The article made it seem as though the transgender student was the reason they won. The reality was that the transgender student came in 4th place in the lone event they participated in, and made no difference to the teams overall win.Another example was a transgender woman who ran in the London Marathon. Fox News highlighted that she beat thousands of women, but excluded that she came in over 6,000th place among women runners. They even suggested that she should have her medal stripped, even though it's a finishers medal, that anyone receives who finishes the race.

That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family. We Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible. I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms. The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you. You see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you. It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do. All of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am. So please vote Democrat.

Fascism, at its core, is about authoritarian control, censorship, and the suppression of dissent, often justified by appeals to the collective good or some higher moral purpose. Ironically, its actually parts of the progressive leftwith their fixation on censorship and policing speech to avoid causing offencethat bear a closer resemblance to this definition than anything Trump has done.Say what you will about Trump, but his entire approach has been rooted in disrupting the establishment and defending free expression, even when its controversial or uncomfortable. Thats not fascismif anything, its the antithesis of it. Fascism thrives on centralising power and silencing dissent, whereas Trump has consistently leaned into open debate, even when it gets messy or polarising.Labelling all Republicans as Nazis or fascists isnt just intellectually lazy, its a convenient way to sidestep meaningful discussions about actual policies or ideas. You dont have to agree with Trump or his methods, but relying on such extreme rhetoric only deepens divisions and shuts down critical thinking and genuine discourse.And lets be honestReddit is infamous for groupthink. Certain subs turn into echo chambers where people parrot the same takes, no matter how detached from reality they might be. Its always more productive to examine actual policies and actions rather than getting caught up in hyperbole or social media outrage cycles. Its the only way to cut through the noise and foster meaningful discussion.A good quote for all to remember:https://preview.redd.it/c6czq3s5n0de1.jpeg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ff2bcd759f71542a1fe94136c17ccbdb65b358","title":"I don't see how Trump could be a fascist"},{"text":"Thats not how respect goes and how is a rapist fraud who was disqualified to be President by Colorado in court bringing us together?

Some argued that a criminal conviction was unnecessary, not that it mattered because none of Trump's indictments include that charge.  Previous uses of the 14A didn't include a conviction through a trial.  But most people think that there needs to be **some** sort of due process.  Trump's 2nd impeachment was one possibility.  While it didn't reach the threshold necessary to remove and bar him from office, it's definitely the case that over 50% of the sitting Congress voted that he incited an insurrection on January 6th 2021.  It was 232-197 in the House and 57-43 in the Senate.Then once he was running for office again, there were the state cases to bar him from the primary ballots.  These failed for a few reasons.  First, party candidate selection is somewhat outside government itself, so the rules that apply are different.  Since Trump was not in office and wasn't \\"officially\\" a candidate for one yet, options were fewer.The Colorado case got furthest.  I think there's a quirk where the CO Secretary of State has more authority over primary elections compared to other states.  The state courts (district and state supreme) ruled that Trump engaged in insurrection and therefore could be prevented from being on the primary ballot.  That got appealed up to SCOTUS, which ruled that states do not have the authority to make that determination for a candidate for nation-wide office.  Or at least, that letting them do so would make things so confusing to screw things up.  I think that means that any determination for Presidential (and maybe Congressional?) office must get done in federal court.  They also said that Congress would need to legislate more specifics to flesh out the bare bits in the amendment, or possibly delegating disqualification power to the states and/or courts.Interesting to me, I don't think the SCOTUS ruling overrode the lower courts finding that Trump in fact engaged in insurrection.  They just made that CO ruling a moot point when it comes to preventing Trump from running this year.TL/DR: it looks to me that the \\"we know insurrection when we see it\\" used in the past left too many loopholes for Trump to slither through.  Especially since it was so uncommon that there wasn't a lot of precedent to rely on.  The effort to deal with those loopholes spanned many different branches and level of government.  Trump and his allies (in and out of the government) kept throwing up delays, and eventually he ran out the clock and got to election day as a \\"qualified\\" candidate.  And then the voters picked him.","title":"Special Counsel Jack Smiths Final Report Says It All: Voters Saved Trump from Prosecution"},{"text":"This is your average redditor right here.

We can affect the world and others, both good and bad. One could say that God created a world without suffering; but we chose rebellion. But I think the point of us coming here was to experience pain.God is all knowing, I believe that he KNEW that we would choose rebellion and turn this world into a place of suffering. Yet he allowed us to do it.....why? Free will was a big reason. Yet I think that we were meant to come here and suffer and experience bad things and that this was part of his PLAN.So why would he want this? Pain helps us grow. Pain makes us more understanding. Experiencing sad things and pain makes people more caring and understanding; which is not the same as being weak. If the goal is to love our neighbor, we need to feel the pain that they felt, and it helps us come together. It creates compassion.By seeing how awful things are, we want to work together and help each other so that others don't have to feel that pain. By doing this, we are closer to being in sync with the divines. We are closer to achieving the levels of love and compassion that God has.Yet unfortunately....I don't think that everyone is going to make it. Meaning that some people experience this pain....and it turns their hearts dark, it makes them bitter and they are angry at the world and everything. I'm afraid many are like that. Pain can help you grow; and turn you against yourself as well. I don't want anyone to go to hell but I'm afraid that people don't want to be with God.The message is; don't let yourself become bitter.
