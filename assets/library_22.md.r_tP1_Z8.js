THIS. This x 1000! Carrying a firearm can make things *more* dangerous for you during an altercation if you are not trained how to use it properly, or do not have good impulse control or emotional discipline in terms of altercations or risky situations. It's important to know how to deescalate situations or defend yourself without a firearm too, 'if the only tool you've got is a hammer everything looks like a nail,' etc. I lived in an area with a really terrible armed robbery problem for a while. Almost every other person I knew got robbed or mugged at some point, myself included. The only one that got shot in the process escalated the situation by pulling out their own gun in response and nearly died as a result. It's not a one-off for people who carry, either. Deescalation is a mandatory skill and people who cannot understand that or who are unable to attempt to deescalate situations first shouldn't carry a gun at all imo, for their own safety.","title":"Women and LGBTQ+ people take up guns after Trumps win: We need to protect ourselves"},{"text":"Clever bastards","title":"Pete Hegseth Might Be Trumps Most Dangerous Nominee - The Atlantic"},{"text":"But the infighting means the GOP will be split on votes, therefore will have no bills passed.

However, the one thing that they all have in common is transportation, which is reliant on gas/oil prices. So by vastly increasing oil supply (and local drilling), the transportation costs will fall, and prices will fall accordingly (10-20%). The articles criticizing Trump saying groceries will be more expensive are only looking at tariffs, because most people don't understand how/why tariffs work. IF Trump implemented tariffs and no other tax relief or reduction, then everybody in the US will pay more. But that isn't his plan. His plan is to reduce income tax (by a lot) and then make up the tax burden with tariffs. So the average person will have a lot more money in their bank account to offset the increase prices (typically coming out better). This also forces US companies to move production back to the US from asia, which will then greatly lower prices in the long run. Additionally, the tariffs aren't placed evenly across all countries. China and India will get the brunt of all tariffs, so only food coming from those countries will be increased in prices (which is a decent amount if you only shop at walmart). But other countries like Argentina will have free trade between them (Argentina grows and produces excellent beef). Speaking of beef, have you noticed that chicken and pork prices have returned close to normal after Covid, but not beef? That's because of regulations implemented by Biden to greatly increase the cost of cattle ranchers to offset carbon emissions. Beef will never come back down unless those regulations are removed (which may happen under Trump). That said, importing a lot of beef from Argentina may lower beef/dairy costs as well.","title":"What policies will help bring down the grocery prices?"},{"text":"Slaves via the 13th amendment","title":"Trump's deportation vow alarms Texas construction industry"},{"text":"The quick results really put to rest the Florida turning blue myth and showed just how red America was turning.

These issues encompass his academic credentials, alleged affiliations with far-right groups, professional conduct, and legal challenges.1. Questionable Academic CredentialsGorkas academic qualifications have been a subject of scrutiny. He earned his Ph.D. from Corvinus University in Hungary, but experts have criticized the rigor of his dissertation. Andrew Reynolds, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina, noted discrepancies in the evaluation process, including the involvement of referees with only bachelors degrees and prior collaborations with Gorka, which could indicate a conflict of interest. Additionally, Daniel Nexon, an associate professor at Georgetown University, described Gorkas thesis as inept and lacking basic methodological standards. Such critiques cast doubt on the legitimacy of his academic expertise. ?2. Alleged Ties to Far-Right OrganizationsGorka has faced allegations of connections to far-right groups, particularly the Hungarian organization Vitzi Rend, which has historical ties to Nazi Germany. Reports suggest that Gorka was a sworn member of this group, a claim he has denied. Nonetheless, his association with such organizations has led to calls for his resignation from various advocacy groups, including the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect and the Anti-Defamation League. These affiliations raise concerns about his ideological leanings and potential biases. ?3. Professional Conduct and Security Clearance IssuesDuring his tenure in the Trump administration, Gorkas professional conduct was questioned. He reportedly failed to obtain a security clearance to work in the Hungarian Parliament, which effectively ended his career as a national security expert in Hungary. In the U.S., his inability to secure a security clearance raised questions about his role and access to sensitive information. Such issues are critical, as they directly impact the trust and reliability required for national security positions. ?4. Legal Challenges and Media BansGorka has been involved in legal disputes, notably suing the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot to block a subpoena for his phone records. He argued that the committees actions were a partisan fishing expedition. Additionally, platforms like YouTube have banned his channel for violating policies against disinformation, particularly concerning the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. Such actions suggest a pattern of contentious behavior and dissemination of misleading information. ??5. Criticism from Peers and Media OutletsGorka has been criticized by peers and media outlets for his views and qualifications. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton labeled him a con man, expressing strong opposition to his appointment in a national security role. Furthermore, Fox News reportedly banned Gorka from its hard news shows, indicating a lack of confidence in his credibility. Such criticisms from prominent figures and organizations highlight widespread concerns about his suitability for senior positions. ??In summary, Sebastian Gorkas history of questionable academic credentials, alleged affiliations with far-right groups, professional conduct issues, legal challenges, and criticism from peers collectively raise significant concerns about his appropriateness for a senior national security role. These factors suggest potential risks to the integrity and effectiveness of national security operations.","title":"Trump names Seb Gorka, Alex Wong to be senior national security staff"},{"text":"cool, then explain why they voted for the party that made anti-trans hate the central pillar of their campaign?","title":"Democrats rally behind first out transgender member of Congress, decry Republican attacks"},{"text":"I legit wanted to know if she was actually a doctor.

Weldon exposed how the Immunization Safety Office, which is supposed to ensure vaccine efficacy and safety, has become subsumed in that metric.He has also repeatedly voiced serious reservations about the independence of the federal governments vaccine safety review process, and previously suggested that a mercury-based preservative once commonly used in vaccines, thimerosal, is linked to a rise in autism.

He considers himself to be at war with basically everybody to Trumps left, and it is by no means clear that he means war metaphorically. He may be no less nutty than any of Trumps more controversial nominees. And given the power he is likely to holdcommand over 2 million American military personnelhe is almost certainly far more dangerous than any of them. His most recent book calls for a straightforward political purge of military brass who had the gall to obey Democratic administrations: Fire any general who has carried water for Obama and Bidens extraconstitutional and agenda-driven transformation of our military. In The War on Warriors, Hegseth makes plain that he considers the very idea of rules of war just more woke nonsense. Modern war-fighters fight lawyers as much as we fight bad guys, he writes. Our enemies should get bullets, not attorneys. He repeatedly disparages Army lawyers (jagoffs), even claiming that their pointless rules are why America hasnt won a war since World War II. (Ideally, the secretary of defense would be familiar with historical episodes such as the Gulf War.) Writing about his time guarding prisoners at Guantnamo Baywhere, as even the Bush administration eventually admitted, many detainees were innocent men swept up by American forcesHegseth describes calls for due process as a stab in the back of brave soldiers like himAnd The War on Warriors repeatedly urges readers to treat the American left exactly like foreign combatants. Describing the militarys responsibility to the nation, Hegseth writes, The expectation is that we will defend it against all enemiesboth foreign and domestic. Not political opponents, but real enemies. (Yes, Marxists are our enemies.) The Marxist exception swallows the not political opponents rule because pretty much all of his political opponents turn out to be Marxists. These include, but are not limited to, diversity advocates (They are Marxists  You know what they are? Theyre traitors), newspapers (the communist Star Tribune), and, as noted, almost anybody involved in public education.Hegseths idea of illegitimate behavior by the domestic enemy is quite expansive. Consider this passage, recalling his time advocating for the Iraq War: While I debated these things in good faith, the Left mobilized. Electing Obama, railroading the military, pushing women in combatreadiness be damned. The Left has never fought fair.

Yes, it's true that Harris only won NJ by some 6% while Biden and Hillary both won it by about 16% in 2020 and 2016, respectively. Here's a deeper dive into why that's the case. * Trump net gain of votes from 2020 to 2024: 83,258\\n* Harris net **loss** of votes from 2020 to 2024: 390,322 \\n* Total NJ turnout between 2024 and 2020: -286,864So Trump saw a measly improvement of about 83,000 votes while Harris underperformed Biden by a whopping 390,000. On top of that, 287,000 less people voted in NJ as a whole this year than in 2020. That alone is enough to jack up percentage margins and make NJ *look* redder, but that's not enough to say that it's becoming a swing state. Furthermore, let's look at individual counties. Passaic County made headlines for going to a Republican (by 2.8%) for the first time since it went to HW Bush in 1992, and because Biden had won the county by 16% in 2020. * Trump net gain of votes from 2020 to 2024: 8,946\\n* Harris net **loss** of votes from 2020 to 2024: 33,942\\n* Third party net gains from 2020 to 2024: 5,729\\n* Total county turnout between 2024 and 2020: -19,267","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 23, 2024"},{"text":"I hope they drive themselves into the ground before they can get to us.","title":"'Huge fight': Warring factions inside Trump transition get into 'big blowup' at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"They're only shit Republicans because people let the local party \\"elites\\" pick them in the primaries.

Unpopular incumbents tend to lose. Harris was still a part of the Biden administration. She was already losing there. It is simple historical precedent. She was also polling badly. Now what do you mean by that? I forgot of who stated it but the rule was that a Democrat had to be polling ahead way more comfortably for them to be confident of a win. Biden had a strong lead into polling in 2020. Harris did not. She was moreso or less tied. Since Trump was historically underpolled, you can begin to see why the Harris campaign in hindsight seemed desperate. Tim Walz being chosen made me a bit suspicious too. The big names didn't seem to want to be chosen as her running mate. As if they knew it was a losing ticket. What solidified it was North Carolina and Georgia being called. Pennsylvania was icing on the cake. You could also feel it in the air. There was a certain dread in 2020 and the election night. It wasn't there anymore. The momentum was with Trump.

This started, from what I saw and the metrics I use, about 2-3 weeks prior to the election.  At that point all the other data metrics in polling started making more sense when looking at the previous 2 election cycles.This is why many conservatives are having so much fun with these liberals.  There was no objective metric that could be referenced indicating Harris had any shot whatsoever.  So when MSNBC was saying TEXAS was in play I just laughed because Texas looked like a 10-12 point win based upon what I saw (Trump won Texas by more than 13%).  The only thing signifying Harris could win was emotions.  So, just like a liberal, ignore facts and just go with feelings.  Those same feelings were on display in the subsequent temper tantrums.  Hopefully they move forward from here realizing their media lied to them, but I doubt it.

Why do I say that? Well, theyre great for when you dont drive long distances at a time, and have a charging station installed at home. Not to mention the cars themselves are very expensive, and installation of the charging station is expensive as well. You also need to live close enough to an EV repair shop, which isnt as common as gas vehicle repair shops are now. My cousin is a lifelong Californian and owns an auto repair shop, the most successful and popular in the county, but he doesnt do electric vehicles.Electric vehicles are terrible for long-haul road trips. They will run out of juice, and it takes a long time to recharge them, as is the nature of lithium batteries. If the cars were built with easily removable batteries, and every gas station had a reserve of batteries charging at all times that you could exchange for your depleted one for a small fee, it could be a solution. However, as it stands, electric vehicles are not viable for multi-hour trips.And I say this as someone who enjoys electric vehicles. Theyre silent, smooth, and often feel like they come from the future, what with all the extra features companies like Tesla tack on to them. With my way of life, if I had the money, Id buy an electric vehicle in a heartbeat, and Im not an environment freak. I just dont tend to do road trips, and it would save me a buttload and a half on gasoline. God knows it would have helped my father, who would forget to refill his tank whenever he was running out of gas, and would get on in the morning to go to work only to find he may not even have enough fuel to reach the gas station. All in all, electric vehicles are great, they have a use case, but theyre not for everyone, theyre definitely an investment, and there should MOST DEFINITELY not be a mandate.Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.","title":"Auto Execs Beg Trump to Keep Biden's EV Mandates After Spending Billions on Unprofitable Electric Cars"},{"text":" The real problem will be that they will dilute the pool of volunteers and force us to reinstitute the draft.??\\nProject 2025 calls for mandatory military testing in high school.

Making full sized trucks hybrid or electric seemed rather challenging, which I guess is what Tesla thought they'd innovate. Unfortunately for them it took so long that Ford and Chevy worked out the electric side. The hybrid side still seems tricky. The funny part is the solution was to bloat full sized trucks to the point where a light truck could be designed to fill the hybrid niche. It still took diverging entirely from the actual truck platform, but it's working better than expected for Ford. That's probably what Tesla should have targeted to slip in with the Santa Cruz and Maverick.

Trump won Arizona by the largest margin of the swing states and Lake lost her Senate race by the largest margin of any swing state Senate race.  Lake might have been a particularly terrible candidate, but I'd argue her terrible features were the same things that made her so Trump adjacent, and I don't see any counter examples either.And that was with Trump on the ballot, which is an advantage Republicans won't have going forward.  Trump managed to get a winning coalition to the polls in all the swing states but could only drag one Senate candidate in those states across the finish line and by the tiniest of margins.  You could certainly argue that's because none of those candidates were sufficiently devotional to Trump, but to me the more likely explanation is just that his coattails aren't very long, which is what we've seen pretty consistently during his time leading the Republican party.","title":"CMV: Trumps Threat to Primary Senators with Musks Money is a Bluff That Senate Republicans Should Call"},{"text":"Whose the toddler here?

For as long as I've been aware of American politics it's always been the same:1. Republican Candidtate says exactly what they're going to do\\n2. Republican voters vote against their interestes\\n3. Things go south and Republican politicians blame Democrats somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary\\n4. Republican voters believe it and continue to vote against their interestesIt's not about truth, or factual results, or reasoned choices. It's about feelings and tribalism. Conservative voters in flyover states form their worldview based on their communal identity. Their news comes from a single perspective. Their friends, family, community leaders, all believe the same thing. That makes it incredibly difficult to break through to people. You're asking them to reject their entire reality.This is compounded by conservative perspectives that view the world in zero-sum terms. If you grant rights to marginalized groups, those rights must come at the expense of the conservative group. If you provide fiscal or social support to the under privileged, you must take those resources from the conservative's pockets. If you provide safe spaces for people who are non-normative in any aspect, you must make those spaces less safe for those who are normative. Obviously none of that is factually accurate, but when your view of the world dictates for there to be winners there must also be losers then you're going to gravitate toward the political personalities that promise to protect you from it and you'll gravitate to media that tells you your fears are justified. It's also why they gravitate to authoritarians, because they're looking for someone who will \\"put things right\\" regardless of obstacles. It doesn't matter of those obstacles are legal, moral, or ethical, because the risk is existential in their view.Those are not the kind of attitudes you change by pointing out tarrifs are bad, crime statistics are actually down, vaccines are safe and effective, etc, etc, etc. You can't reason with the unreasonable.","title":"Trump's deportation vow alarms Texas construction industry"},{"text":"I feel like there's stuff going on behind the scenes and we've yet to see The bigger picture","title":"Trump nominates Project 2025 author to head Office of Management and Budget"},{"text":"The fact that Trump was elected is his legacy and no amount of policy will EVER erase that!

The collapse in 2022 was a whopping 9,243,895 votes or 15.3 percent. While it is often true that the party out of the White House wins in the midterms, it is not an absolute rule--and we've never seen such a spike and crash as this one. Still, even after the drop off, Democrats managed their second highest turnout ever. Democratic numbers are through the roof, but the old pattern of spikes and drops continues at much higher levels.In presidential races, every time Democrats first replace Republicans since Jimmy Carter, they do so in a turnout boom. The next election turnout slips noticeably. The pattern continues in 2020 to 2024 as turnout for Kamala Harris slipped 6,829,702 votes or less (numbers still coming in). This was expected (at least by me). On the Republican House side, 2018 was a record, 2020 was a record, and 2022 was a record with turnout inching above 2018. We await 2024 House numbers, but expect they will be about the same as 2020--and could be yet another new record albeit just a few ticks up as happened with Donald Trump in the same two years.Both parties are having turnout booms, but even at higher levels, Democrats are inconsistent and Republicans are consistent. The fact is that Donald Trump and Republicans in general are more popular than ever, and unless Democrats can continue to push turnout sky high or unless Republican popularity slips, we could be facing more years of Republican dominance.","title":"Analysis: Some of Trumps largest gains came in highly-educated counties"},{"text":"It is!By eliminating the DoEd, poor schools and districts lose out on financial aid, on education research (that they can't afford to do themselves), and poor students lose their financial aid, finally, minorities lose anti-descrimination support in education.But rich schools and districts won't notice anything.

However, the elimination of the department, per se, is not necessarily bad, and my guess would be that even with a messy transition the negative effects wouldn't protract for more than a handful of years. I know that the DOJ will probably be heavily politicized, but the DOE would be under Trump's control anyway. There is no escape from the loyalists. Do you think I'm wrong? I am not familiar with the working of this field, so I might be wrong. If anything, I was worried that the DOJ would start trying to overreach massively to threaten schools to become religious schools and ostracizing trans students. Do you think this is a possible risk? I also don't think this is going to happen, because it will never reach 60 senators' votes. Even if it happened, the DOT would still grant the same amount of money to schools in red states as before, I'd assume. I also appreciate you laying down this argument, seriously. Thank you.

The Biden administration was close, with the bipartisan immigration bill they drafted; however, as we know, Trump tanked it.  Trump is, if anything, a masterful marketer who knows how to play to peoples fears. He told people to fear the invasion poisoning the blood of our country and promised he would be their protector, and his supporters believed him.  What Trump did not tell his loyal followers was the realistic result of his mass deportation plans, which will take a wrecking ball to our economy. Its not just housing, its agriculture.

But democrats wouldn't be in the position they're in if they had the balls to play the system.","title":"Donald Trump faces backlash over Russ Vought pick: 'He lied'"},{"text":"Yeah, this kind of can't be said enough.  Reject great man theory.  As much as my ego loves the idea of individuals like me being deeply important, the historical record shows no particular evidence of any individuals being especially influential since the dawn of agriculture and the shift from small family groups toward large social structures.  There is a lot of anthropology and sociology to it, but basically, the earliest writing samples in existence are things like storehouse inventories that show the basic fact that everything we think of as \\"civilization\\" was a matter of group activity, not individuals.  In fact there is a lot of evidence to suggest that socially constructed superorganisms took over the planet before humanity as individuals ever got more influential than setting the occasional wildfire.  Corporations, governments, religions... these are things that arise through the sociological process of social construction, but once formed, \\"take on lives of their own\\" and behave in different ways from how individuals behave.  Individuals generally tend to have some level of empathy and awareness of the humanity of people around them, while socially constructed superorganisms like governments and corporations are categorically so devoid of such capacity that their human components have to write it into their marketing materials to pretend.  It is these organizations that have the power to really shape the world.  The pyramids were build by organizations, not individuals.  An individual obviously could not build something as big as a pyramid or a cathedral; but organizations started doing so almost as soon as they existed.  This historical view makes it fairly obvious that individuals don't matter a sliver as much as groups.  Even old literature like the Iliad tries to play up the role of individuals like the hero characters, but ultimately acknowledges that it's only the organization of large groups like governments and armies that makes the real difference.  The most influential individuals only matter to the extent that they can influence or improve the performance of organizations.  The absolute most powerful that an individual can be is when he or she develops the ability to influence others and behave like an organization.  The usual argument for great man theory is to cite examples like Hitler and Stalin.  Yet, this doesn't work.  Hitler arose concurrently with similar demagogues in other countries, and only Germany and Japan managed to achieve what they did while others with essentially equivalent leaders were less successful - and ultimately, large democracies triumphed over all of those.  There is really nothing in the history to suggest that WWII and the Holocaust would not have happened, or would have gone very differently, if somehow Hitler had been removed leaving instead Goebbels or similar to lead Germany.  Similarly, I see no evidence that Elon Musk ever did anything special.  What did he \\"invent\\"?  His first venture, x dot com, was a payment by email platform, and arose at about the same time as competing Paypal.  It was only by dumb luck of resources that Musk's company was able to merge with PayPal rather than just losing to it.  It can't be overemphasized that Musk at no point even worked at PayPal, being merely the investor of a chief competitor that got rich in their buyout. His next venture was to ponder whether Soviet ICBMs could be repurposed as space ships, which is basically the most generic idea a nerdy person with a pile of money might come up with after having read some science fiction books.  Similarly, Tesla was a company founded by some engineers that he was easily able to jump onto just because he was a fat bank account that happened at the moment to be attached to an individual and not a hedge fund; but there is no meaningful difference in performance between Musk as an individual, and a generic hedge fund.  Billionaires don't matter, and never have. They basically don't even exist as a social force; they are passengers to the action of piles of money that really don't care who \\"owns\\" them.","title":"Experts: DOGE scheme doomed because of Musk and Ramaswamy's \\"meme-level understanding\\" of spending"},{"text":"Yea it's always conveniently ignored, no matter who it is, it just needs to benefit the bigger agenda","title":"Dems Score Win on Judges After Late-Night Deal With GOP"},{"text":"Hes gonna get absolutely EVISCERATED by Susan Collins","title":"Donald Trump faces backlash over Russ Vought pick: 'He lied'"},{"text":"Cherish your loved ones and this next few months.

I think they'd lose half their labor.\\"Talk of a mass round up comes as Texas is booming. Texas cities regularly appear on lists of the country's fastest growing communities, and construction cranes and workers donning safety vests are common sites in most major cities.That Texas relies on undocumented labor is one of the state's open secrets, despite Republicans' tough-on-immigration stances.In 2022, more than a half million immigrants worked in the construction industry, according to a report by the American Immigration Council and Texans for Economic Growth. Nearly 60% of that workforce was undocumented.\\"The state needs to leverage both U.S.-born and immigrant talent to fill construction jobs that power the Texas economy,\\" the report notes....Trump's sweeping campaign pledges likely have the support of Republican border hawks in Texas, where a state-led border mission called Operation Lone Star started in 2021 and has cost taxpayers more than $11 billion. The effort has included deployment of thousands of Texas National Guard and state police officers to the border, construction of barriers that include fencing, walls and razor wire on or near the banks of the Rio Grande, and a floating buoy barrier in the river.All signs show Trump will try to make good on his deportation promises. He has tapped Tom Homan, Trump's former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who also served in that official capacity under former President Barack Obama. Trump has also named Stephen Miller a deputy chief of staff for policy and advisor on homeland security issues. Miller served in Trump's previous administration and was the architect behind the zero-tolerance policy that led to family separations after parents who entered the country illegally were incarcerated....Marek said Trump can solve the problem by backing a guest-worker program similar to the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA: Applicants can live and work in the country legally, but only after agreeing to backgrounds checks, paying a fine or application fee and working for a company that pays payroll taxes.\\"It's so simple. The right likes it because we've [identified] the people for national security and they're paying taxes. The left likes it because we've basically given them a legal status and we've given them the protection of wage and hour laws,\\" he said.It's not just businesses in Texas that will suffer from this, but industries all across the country. At this point hoping that the new administration will do the right thing(s) is nothing more than wishful thinking, given their indications otherwise. Given Greg Abbott's initiation and support for these draconian policies though, it's pretty disappointing that these businesses don't hold him to account for some of their woes as well.","title":"Trump's deportation vow alarms Texas construction industry"},{"text":"  Vets just reelected a dumbass that constantly shits on vets,Corrected to represent that the majority of Vets voted for this guy.

Trump should be in jail, not talking to NATO. https://substack.com/home/post/p-151721941\\nIn Presidential Races since 1980, these bullet ballots rarely account for more than 1% of the total votes including in Mr. Trumps winning 2016 election and losing 2020 election, and when they do it warrants further investigation.  In 2024 in the 43 non-swing states, bullet ballots make up a nominal 1%.   In the seven swing states the numbers are so high to be unbelievable, unprecedented and demanding of further investigation.  Here is analysis from totals as of late Nov. 12thHere are the unprecedented results of drop-offs in the two western swing states:AZ - 123K+ 7.2%+ of Trumps total vote.  Enough to reverse the outcome.NV -   43K+ 5.5%+ of Trumps total vote.  Enough to exceed recount threshold.It is my belief these two states have illegally added votes.  For comparison, examine Trumps 2024 results in three states which border AZ and NV.  They have equally passionate Trump supporters, but have the normal levels of drop off or bullet ballots.ID     &lt;2K      0.03% of Trumps total.OR   &lt;4K      0.05% of Trumps  totalUT    &lt;1K      0.01% of Trumps total.In the case of Idaho and Utah, Mr. Trump was a run-away winner and had no need to add votes.  In the case of Oregon, Ms. Harris was a run-away winner and adding votes to Trumps total would add risk without adding value.   The same pattern of large numbers of drop-off votes or bullet ballots exists in the totals of MI, NC, PA, WI.   North Carolina is the most extreme.

He lost and was fined $355 million plus interest. Thats accountability.__Manhattan: Defamation and Sexual Assault__\\nTrump also faced a pair of defamation suits from the writer E. Jean Carroll, who said that Trump sexually assaulted her in a department-store dressing room in the 1990s. When he denied it, she sued him for defamation and later added a battery claim. She was awarded $5 million and $83.3 million judgments, respectively.__Manhattan: Hush Money__\\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg brought criminal charges that Trump had falsified business records as part of a scheme to pay hush money to women who said theyd had sexual relationships with him. He was convicted of 34 felonies. Sentencing is indefinitely delayed, but hes still a convicted felon, and the first to ever go down in history for being elected president. Thats accountability.__Department of Justice: Mar-a-Lago Documents__\\nMar-a-Lago was raided to recover the stolen, highly-classified documents, and Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump with 37 felonies in connection with his removal of documents from the White House when he left office. Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon has the case, finding that Smiths appointment was not constitutional, but he was held accountable.__Fulton County: Election Subversion__\\nIn Fulton County, Georgia, DA Fani Willis brought a huge racketeering case against Trump and 18 others, alleging a conspiracy that spread across weeks and states with the aim of stealing the 2020 election. Though not resolved yet, the were three major plea deals from co-defendants. Trumps victory may result in the case being frozen indefinitely, but he was held accountable.__Department of Justice: Election Subversion__\\nSpecial Counsel Smith has also charged Trump with four federal felonies in connection with his attempt to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. This case is in court in Washington, D.C. This resulted in the Supreme Republican Court giving Trump (and any future presidents) immunity from prosecution for official but not unofficial acts, finding that some of Trumps postelection actions were official and sending the case back to the trial court to determine others. This case is going away, now that Trump was elected, but he was held accountable. This is unprecedented, and will forever be a part of his legacy, part of American history. That's accountability.","title":"No-one Held Trump Accountable"},{"text":"Did I say that? No.But lowering them is anti progressiveEdit: and taxes not being economics?

They only cared about whether you made cool shit. You still see that in a few people like Ben Milton, creator of Knave, Maze Rats, and runner of the popular OSR RPG channel, Questing Beast. You see, Ben doesn't talk about the politics of the creators of the RPGs he reviews or of his sponsors. God, I wish more people were like Ben.That all changed, really, last year. We were just starting to get into election season and some guy named Alexander Macris, former owner of the escapist (you know when they were tolerable) and creator of the fairly popular RPG in the scene The Adventurer Conqueror King System, decided to kickstart a second edition. You see, Macris is a open right-wing libertarian who previously worked with one Milo Yiannopoulos (although they cut ties over the whole \\"Milo got groomed by a gay adult and didn't think it was that bad\\" thing). And that just wasn't acceptable. So a part of the subreddit bitched, and they moaned, and they cried and cried and cried. They would do this whenever Macris's name was brought up. Despite being, frankly, one of the bigger names in the scene.The mods of OSR, a relatively hand off bunch and in the past pretty even handed, decided that the appropriate way to handle this was to ban all discussion of Macris and his system. This had only ever been done before for another, substantially more left-wing RPG creator Zak Sabbath when he got #MeTood by an ex-girlfriend and the debates around it drowned the sub in nothing else but talk about Zak. But Macris was censored not because of something he did, but explicitly because of his politics.The mods should have just manned up and chosen to enforce a no-politics rule. Keep OSR about rpg discussion rather than culture war bs. Let the RPG sub be that, lord knows they're up for the task. But they banned Macris talk and now the usual suspects know there's blood in the water. Instead of curbing this behavior, they've encouraged it. They've turned their guns on TheRPGPundit (another rw libertarian), the #BrOSR, and many, many others, completely transforming the character of a once cool sub. And now the struggle session has turned to Ben Milton, because somebody he took money from to review a cool rpg product made a bad AI art of blue haired fat women crying about the election results.I miss you circa-2019 osr subreddit.

A lot of Trump supporters who would benefit from additional Medicare services vote against it because they fear it could bankrupt the country.People who know less than zero about healthcare provision, how much insurance companies and the system are rorting them to literal death and especially know nothing about the huge sums of money effectively being stolen from under their noses.A better healthcare system (there's so many globally to choose from) even in a crippled form would still provide better healthcare and cost less than the travesty that is the US system.","title":"Trumps mass deportations could split 4 million mixed-status families.
