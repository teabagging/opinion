To the argument that increased anti-discrimination and equal rights enforcement will have a chilling effect on other University actors, Berkowitz replies that speech and expression are not primarily at issue here. \\"The claim that free speech principles thwart protection of Jewish students from antisemitism is false since much of the antisemitism involves not protected speech but forbidden action.\\" Over the past year these actions have included \\"physical intimidation, trespass, and the destruction of private property.\\"How do you think the incoming Trump administration will change the enforcement of federal anti-discrimination laws within federally-funded universities, compared to how these matters are treated currently?","title":"Trump and Congress Gear Up To Fight Campus Antisemitism"},{"text":"RW Americans praise &amp; applaud the fact that this rapist is now able to dismiss the charges against himself, even the espionage charges.

Given how clearly the rule targets a single member, Dems are going to defer to that member when it comes to how they want to approach it. And McBride's in one tough spot. She's the first transgender member of congress, she's facing a rule that was crafted to target her--and everyone knows it. She's also standing in the aftermath of an election where fearmongering over transgender individuals played an absurdly outsized role in Trump's messaging.She can choose to fight the rule, but she'd ultimately lose. Johnson isn't going to backtrack on this anytime soon and there's no real mechanism to force him to. While she hasn't explicitly spelled this out, she's clearly choosing *how* she loses this fight. Right now, Republicans have convinced a not-insignificant segment of the population that there's a nefarious transgender movement out there that's just looking for the opportunity to transition their kids. They expected McBride to fight back, with everyone else in the Dem and progressive world falling behind her so they could point to all of that momentum and tie it back to the faceless \\"transgender agenda\\" and spin it as McBride and elite, out-of-touch \\"trans activists\\" demanding special treatment.Plus, they'd point to the private restrooms in members' offices and say \\"they're making a big fuss over nothing when McBride's got her own private restroom anyhow.\\" They'd play it up, call forth the mental image of the executive washroom from The Simpsons, try to make her seem out of touch--as if this situation were her fault in the first place.By not giving them the fight they wanted, she makes it clear she's laser focused on doing her job--and that she just wants to go to the bathroom without it becoming a national debate. Johnson appears petty and vindictive, and she appears more human and relatable.Instead of another battle in the culture war, this becomes a case of two assholes--Johnson and Mace--singling out and harassing one of their co-workers just because they can. It's petty, mean, and vindictive. Even for people who aren't comfortable talking about transgender issues can probably relate to that. Everyone's had a truly terrible boss or co-worker, or listened to a friend complain about *theirs*.McBride denied them what they wanted. Ultimately, she wins when Americans see transgender people as just other people who want to live their lives.

I was 100% behind Harris, I thought she was brilliant and I actually don't think she lost the election fairly (we'll put that aside). Your point about the \\"day one dictator\\" is a good example of lies and exaggeration. Do you know the context of the quote \\"dictator *from* day one\\"? The context of this quote is from an interview with Sean Hannity, where Hannity asked him:\\"You are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?\\"Trump responded:\\"I love this guy,\\" referring to Hannity, \\"\\\\[Sean\\\\] says, 'Youre not going to be a dictator, are you?' I said: 'No, no, no. Other than Day One.' Were closing the border, and were drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, Im not a dictator.\\"Trump did not say he would be a dictator *from* day one. He explicitly said \\"no... other than day one\\". He then went on to outline what he meant by that (closing the border, drilling for oil) and explicitly said \\"after that, I'm not a dictator.\\" In this context, he appeared to be using \\"dictator\\" as a metaphor for him taking immediate radical actions in the face of opposition and/or bureaucracy. Worth noting, he appeared to be referencing an earlier conversation with Hannity  so there may be some context missing.Harris, understandably, sought to use this to her advantage. However, in doing so she paraphrased his words to the point of perverting their meaning. She repeatedly claimed that Trump said he would be a \\"dictator *from* day one\\". This paraphrasing is explicitly dishonest, implying by the word \\"from\\" that Trump intimated there would be an enduring dictatorial approach to his leadership. When, in fact, he said the opposite  referring to *only* day one and appearing to use the word \\"dictator\\" metaphorically. * Did he respond to an important question with an irrelevant answer that references dictatorship without provocation? Yes.\\n* Now does this make him any more of a desirable candidate for presidency? No, no, no. \\n* But did he say he would be a \\"dictator *from* day one\\"? No, he absolutely did not. Democrats must know this was dishonest. Probably, they were playing dirty. I understand why they would, after all Trump's campaign was filthy. However, we have to understand that when Democrats portray themselves as the good guy, they're asking to be held to a high standard. So if they lie or misrepresent information, they'll inevitably face a harsher punishment in the polls than someone like Trump. Personally, I have the same expectations of both parties. So, while I understand Harris playing dirty, I would call out lies and misrepresentations from Trump, so it's only fair that I would do the same to Harris.","title":"CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric."},{"text":"The most ridiculous part of it all.

But you have completely fallen for it. You are the stooge. It has worked on you. And here you are on reddit arguing with a bunch of strangers online that the people criticizing that message in alarming terms were actually the ones out of line.You've been had man. You are the mark.  \\nAnd as far as abortion goes. I fully believe that some people truly and genuinely are concerned about the little tiny babies. I got you. But caring about the babies and thinking it's murder and wanting to control women's bodies are not mutually exclusive. They want to control women's bodies....to not do this thing. It can be both...In fact in their cases, it has to be both, since there isn't a way to criminalize abortion without controlling women's bodies, they are inseparably entwined.","title":"CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric."},{"text":"Merrick Garland can go fuck himself","title":"Jack Smith files to drop Jan. 6 charges against Donald Trump"},{"text":"Concentration camps coming right up, thanks to everyone that could have done something meaningful but didn't.

Maybe there were more than I knew personally, but for my one anecdotal experience, it did nothing to negatively impact good order and discipline, or military readiness. That troop has served 15+ years, in fact. People who believe in a calling of service to something greater than themselves, are our best asset.  Its what makes our nations military unique.  And in an all volunteer service, our government officials need to consider that. There was a time where black persons couldnt serve. Women couldnt serve.  And for a long while, segregation rules were in effect once minorities and women were able to join.  It wasnt until recently that openly gay personnel were allowed to serve.  Were all the better for having righted those past wrongs, and a professional all volunteer force, will always be better for the country then returning to a draft to fill service quotas.

Brace for impact.Her first day in Congress six years ago was amid a protracted government shutdown;?then came two impeachments, a global pandemic, and an insurrection at the Capitol.But unlike her arrival in 2019 when Democrats controlled the House, the Boston Democrat will soon be serving in a Trump Washington as a member of the minority party.Not only will she and her colleagues have to navigate total Republican control of Washington next year, but also ongoing soul-searching within the Democratic Party as it works to return to relevance after an apparent loss of support from voters across their political coalition.Shell have a front-row seat for many of the biggest fights. She will be taking on a new role as cochair of the House Reproductive Freedom Caucus, rebranded from the Pro-Choice Caucus. She will also be continuing as cochair of the Haiti Caucus, as Trump is set to institute hard-line immigration measures and deportations that could impact that community, which is significant in Massachusetts.In an interview in her Capitol Hill office, Pressley told the Globe she fears?the shock of the election results will cause Democrats to take the wrong lessons from their loss and react in a way that could jeopardize their standing with the voters they need to win back to return to power in Congress in two years.I am concerned that we will reflexively, in this moment, moderate our policy aspirations, Pressley said. If we are to say, Come on home and lets do the work of getting the gavel back and being in power, getting the House, getting the Senate, getting the White House, the real question is, Democrats, you want the power, but to do what? And this has been an issue that we have struggled to overcome.Since the election,?[theres been a backlash from moderates in the party](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/17/nation/democrats-divided-election-results/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), who blame the more progressive wing for positions that pulled the party to the left on social issues and allowed Republicans to paint?Democrats as out of touch with economic pain. That means?as a progressive, Pressley could have work to do to convince some of her more centrist colleagues that her factions ideas are the way back to the majority.I think we should assess what went awry, recognizing that a lot of our blue-collar voters have moved away from us  and Defund the police did not help, Springfield Representative Richard Neal told the Globe earlier this month.?[Salem Representative Seth Moulton caused a firestorm](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/seth-moulton-democrats-transgender-backlash-election-challenge-massachusetts/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)?when he told?[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/democrats-kamala-harris.html)?that he worries about his two young daughters someday facing trans athletes in sports, but as a Democrat, Im supposed to be afraid to say that.","title":"Ayanna Pressley, preparing for a second Trump term, says she is battle-tested and clear-eyed"},{"text":"Elections are most contentious in purple states.?

As I said, I dont know enough about like half of your examples here so I hope youre right.","title":"How Trumps Radical Tariff Plan Could Wreck Our Economy"},{"text":"It's a shame they can't keep what's good about NPR and weed out the partisan programs.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene to NPR: The DOGE Is Coming for You"},{"text":"What??Then, its dictatorship.??Did Garland force him to do this or is Smith also complicit in the end of accountability?Trump will run wild. ?Arrest his opponents, &amp; seize their assets, just like Putin.","title":"Special counsel Jack Smith drops election subversion case against Donald Trump"},{"text":"I hope he fails harder than Lindsay Graham at the Playboy Mansion.","title":"Donald Trump won the election.

Three issues with that:A) it doesnt directly make domestic goods cheaper. 2) it assumes comparable domestic goods are available.d) it isnt legislatively stabilized, so it can be undone by the next president. These three facts make it challenging for a domestic supplier to enter a market they have been priced out of for years or decades. The added struggle of complying with numerous federal regulations before they can even start producing domestic goods can cause them to forgo the market altogether.We have dug this hole for decades, long before NAFTA, and ever since, we have encouraged producers to move to places where the labor is cheaper and the startup costs are lower. We cant undo it in four years. But, we *can* turn the corner. We can encourage a legislative response that will set the stage for a more solid footing. We can work to square our labor supply with the demand. We can pass the FairTax to make the US the most financially beneficial country to operate in.

Their motive is not to control a woman's body, it's to prevent murder. Controlling a woman's body is the effect, not the motive. And there are those who likely have dual motives of both control and anti-murder. It's wrong to say they \\"just want to control women\\".\\nEven when (or perhaps especially when) you find people who are not only anti-abortion, but anti-birth control, anti-premarital sex, and anti-gay marriage, you might want to check to see if they're strict Catholics. The Catholic Church teaches that the only good sex (i.e., sex that their god likes) is sex that occurs between a married heterosexual couple and is open to procreation. And they spell out the reasons for that belief. And that belief, however silly, does explain their views without it being 'control of women'. I wouldn't argue with you if you claimed it boiled down to ex post facto rationalization for holding the anti-woman views they already held, but for the suckers who just believe what the church philosophers and leaders tell them upon pain of eternal torture, well, it's probably a sincere belief.\\nAre you in favor of laws which make it a crime to murder adults and which protect society from murderers by putting them in prison? Is your motive specific and general deterrence and community safety? Or are you motivated by a desire to control a certain group of people and making murder illegal is just a convenient way to do it?\\nSo, while you can confidently assert that control is the primary motive for a lot of anti-abortion people, there are also those who have different motives, and that shouldn't be ignored.","title":"CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric."},{"text":"Round up the illegals, arrest them, and then use them as prison labor on farms instead of deporting them.

This doctrine enforces rigid command structures, leaving very little tactical capability for individual units. You can see this in tons of footage and coverage from the war, Russians are often caught out seemingly sitting, doing nothing. They're waiting for orders on poorly-implemented communications networks, some of which are civilian and not their version of MILSPEC. That always works out so well. But, Stalin figured it was the only way he would be able to maintain control of one of the few government organs that could challenge him.The US figured out that this was a bad way to run a military in _checks notes_ the Korean war. Instead, they set operational parameters and goals. Individual unit leaders have fairly broad latitude in the specific details of _how_ the mission is run.

It bothers them that there might be people left behind by the slow steps toward progress but, and this is going to be a reoccurring refrain, that's just how it is. Whether it's fair or not, they have to make themselves palatable to the average person who isn't interested in their plight; even if that means they have to put some people to the sidelines due to the damage they can cause the movement. I liken this to something that happened with the 'Defund the Police' movement a few years back. While, yes, the movement was about police reform, the slogan was something entirely different and the average person interpreted it as such because that was what got media traction due to the aggressive nature of it. This was pointed out early in the movement but the response was 'how dare you suggest that' and we know what happened. As a result, the average person rejected the movement and it all but died in a summer. As you pointed out, gay marriage activists actively pushed certain movements within their own to the side just so they could make themselves as boring as possible. Fair? No. Realistic? Absolutely.\\n Sometimes you have to accept that you won't get to see the full fruits of a more equal society. Please preach this to everyone you encounter on the subject. I know a lot of trans people who actively go 'I do not want my existence to be political' or 'I do not want to have to wait for X' but the reality is that, when you're fighting for rights, you can't avoid what society labels you. Right now being trans is a statement, just like being openly gay was. That statement is defined by how you handle yourself. Rep. McBride understands this and, as a result, she actively shrugged at what Rep. Mace did to her. Does it upset her? I absolutely bet it does but she also knows that 'rising to the challenge' just reinforces what the Right wants to see which just continues the combative label that trans individuals have gotten themselves tagged with.\\n think \\"how uninteresting,\\" and we then move on to talk about something else.This is the thing that I feel like people in the trans community are missing. The goal isn't for everyone to rally around them and go 'Trans People Rah Rah!' The goal is for no one to care that they're trans because it's as interesting someone's shoe size.","title":"Transgender Rep.-elect Sarah McBride calls GOP attacks 'an attempt to distract' from the issues.

The price of eggs is secondary, were headed to a dictatorship! While Trump said hed fix the price of eggs. It isnt hard to see why he won. Democrats pitched ideas Americans didnt identify with or care about, and Trump talked about real issues.

People are not going to respond well to that, and will often end up defending their belief/candidate rather than actually considering that they could be wrong. This happens because you make people defensive when you characterize their views in a way that makes them out to be a terrible person or an idiot or whatever. If you want them to change their views then you have to acknowledge that they're trying to do what they think is right and then show them how they are actually wrong about how to achieve their that. And yes this applies even if the candidate has said or done something crazy or bad. For example, if someone supports Trump because they really want the economy to be better, but u believe that Kamala would make it better then you should make an argument like \\"Hey I know you think Trump will make the economy better and that's why u support him, and I understand why you might think that, but it is actually not true. Here's some reasons why\\". If instead you said \\"Don't you know that Trump is a fascist racist rapist? If you support him you're crazy. Trump's economic plan is so retarded that not a single economist thinks it's going to work so I assume you're an idiot if you support it. Kamala will actually make things better\\" that's not going to work to change their minds. They'll be too busy defending themselves against the accusations u made/implied against them and likely defending Trump as well against what they will see as hyperbole instead of actually considering that they might be wrong to support his economic plan.

We had no idea how to do activism. Pro-democracy candidates were floating at around 3-5% of votes and weren't even able to unite behind a single candidate or party.

The downside is you have less control over it and you're at the mercy of a bunch of amatures.

It doesn't matter if Trump specifically says the words \\"Anyone that voted for Kamala should be killed\\" or just refers to them as \\"the enemy within\\" and then goes on talking about purging the enemies by force if necessary. His rhetoric is very clear about what he wants to happen, despite not actually stating it word for word. Referring to this as lying or exaggerating is intellectually dishonest at best. We've already seen examples of Trump's supporters not needing specific word-for-word instructions to get the meaning of what he wants from them. Quite frankly, I'm a little surprised Trump supporters haven't already started carrying out his non-orders.2. It doesn't matter how literally Trump verbalizes the threat he represents, his supporters will rationalize it away as poor word choice or a joke. Dealing with my avid Trump-supporting parents has proven to me that no amount of truth or fact changes their feelings and this has generally been true of almost all my interactions with Trump supporters.To summarize, not saying the quiet part out loud is how shitty people get away with shitty things.

If you require the shitty person to say the actual immoral intent in definitive words to believe it, you'll be left waiting until those words become reality, at which point it's too late for it to matter anyway.

For the United States this was a breathtaking power grab.Our Constitutional system is that the president appoints the major executive branch officials and then the Senate either confirms them or rejects them.I have heard Trump supporters saying Trump should get anyone he wants in the government. That might be what a king would want, but thats not how our constitutional system works. In our system the president has to pick people the Senate will agree with. That is one of the important and proper checks on the presidents power.There is a proper way to use recess appointments, of course. If a vacancy occurs while the Senate is not in session the president can make a recess appointment. But there is nothing in the Constitution that says a president can deliberately have the Senate adjourn just for the purpose of bypassing any check on his power. Such an action would fly in the face of the whole spirit of the Constitution.We shouldnt want any president to bypass the checks and balances in the Constitution in order to improperly inflate his own personal power.Thank goodness Republican Senators have, so far, refused to give Trump the recess appointments he demanded. So far, at least some Republican Senators have refused to roll over and play dead for Trump. At least four Republican Senators, maybe five, made it clear, at least in private meetings, that they would NOT vote to confirm Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. For that reason, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, Trump lost one of his first important nominees, and we still have a president instead of a king.One of the most important ways to protect liberty in a country is to have effective checks and balances on power. We dont know if these four or five Republican Senators will check and balance Trump on other issues or when the pressure is greater. In this case, Gaetz was a clownishly bad pick for Attorney-General and these Senators were able to oppose him behind closed doors, so it was relatively easy for them.But even so, the Constitution worked here. The president wanted an Attorney-General these Senators thought was disgusting and dangerous, so they shot him down. Just as the Constitution empowers them to do.The Republican Senators who held the line here were: McConnell from Kentucky, Murkowski from Alaska, Collins from Maine, Curtis from Utah, Mullin from Oklahoma (Mullin is not mentioned in this article, but I have heard he was part of this group as well.)I really think Trump and his most extreme followers (like Steve Bannon) want him to be a king.

It wont be easy for them to wage any of their warfare on those who dont agree with them unless you are in a deeply blue state. After Jan 20th, President Trump will be in power, republicans will control both houses, and the Supreme Court which we already have. Also, the mainstream media is losing its grip on society. No one including the liberals and leftists are watching it anymore. Their remaining base that hasnt swung over to Trump (there were lots of Biden 2020CTrump 2024 voters, just look at the numbers in blue states)  are all tuning out and ignoring whats going on. I saw a meltdown on one of the liberal media shows last week, I cant remember which one, about how unlike 2016 and 2020, no resistance is forming against Trump this time.! Theres been no protests! The resistance has gone quiet. Clearly, the legacy media brainwashing and lies wont work anymore. The awful Biden administration was so bad even the medias lies couldnt convince people it was good.Bottom line is, democrats are in shambles, theyve lost their coalition, their base is shrinking, and their abilities to manipulate society are rapidly disappearing.

You have bought into the right wing media narrative wholesale. There were no cities burned down. Why phrase it that way? It isn't an accident. Why call it the left wing media? Do you mean not strictly right wing? There was looting and destruction at times, but there is no equivalence or comparison to mass scale nation wide  protests about racial injustice to a sitting president inciting a riot against the Capitol with an explicit goal to disrupt the process, based on complete lies. The lie the election was stolen, by the \\"radical left\\". The violence is an inherent part of this movement you are seemingly advocating for. You can't have a  facist movement without violence. It's necessary for the mission and for that matter not actually unpopular among the people who buy into this shit...None of this shit is new or original, it is literally the same shit the Nazis preached but for Americans . Secular Liberalism and elitist, decadent intellectual degenerates gone to far threatening the very fabric of  traditional, normal white Christian society. It's just American neo-fascism not some righteous moral battle against liberals.I'm honestly pretty partial to the idea of cutting people out at a certain point because politics are reflective of you as a person. It's not just some abstract thing. If you for example believe there is some radical leftist movement that justified trump you are really not too  different from the Germans during the rise of Hitler and it's striking at this point , it's just a matter of how it pans out and what the consequences will be.  No one owes you a relationship  or understanding despite the things you believe, simply because you think yourself to be a better, more competent and discerning person than you actually are and therfore you're entitled to something you have no actual right to.  There's a pretty good chance you're also just unpleasant to be around, partially because of the media you consume , though  not always. I don't believe you, or rather people like \\"you\\" to be  a wholly terrible person or evil, but you don't get to the point of justifying the election of a facist based on some hatred and fear of liberals, without being angry and scared  and this bleeds over outside of the  abstract realm  of politics  and \\"discourse\\" into real life *especially* with people actually close to you. I live in deep red Texas, I've consumed right wing media, I am familiar with how conservatives have been talking about liberals, what they believe, and in a lot of cases why, I predicted or expected I guess, this sort of escalation as a literal child during the Obama administration because the reactionary  hatred was obvious. The conspiracy theory bullshit rising  to mainstream right media was blatant even to a 12 year old me  still partial to some form of  conservative worldview.  I certainly didn't predict Donald Trump, but I knew that there was *something * off.  Something irrational and negative. The point of all this is ultimately something like, facts do not care about your feelings.  There are two sides to every story but sometimes one side is just a lie, and wrong.  The assumption that there must be some middle ground or truth to both sides is a fallacy and wrong. Trump incited a riot. He was elected because he appeals to this sort of sentiment in general. It is dangerous and we will have to see what happens now. I can't change your mind and you can't change mine but one of is right and the other is just right wing.","title":"CMV: As someone who would have voted Democrat if I were American, Joe Biden's historical legacy will be like that of Jimmy Carter, if not worse."},{"text":"I know I'm responding to dopey, slow MAGAT trash, but that's what I fucking wrote.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Warns DOGE Subcommittee May Defund Sanctuary Cities"},{"text":"We have become a nation of Upper Middle Class Twits and Gumbies.","title":"US farm groups want Trump to spare their workers from deportation"},{"text":"In fairness, people in this sub supported the main opponent to Trump, they didn't sit on the sidelines like the KPD.","title":"How Trumps Radical Tariff Plan Could Wreck Our Economy"},{"text":" raise your hand actually dont do that because it would be badyou're kidding right? that's like winking or using air quotesThe same rhetoric exists around abortion.

In her 30s now, still feminine as hell. IF THAT WERE TODAY, she would have been manipulated into becoming a boy and been stuck with the results. its truly insane. There was also this scandal (if you will) in my hometown a couple of years ago. The high school held a little  family fun fair. The ads for it showed kids playing games etc. It turned out to be a literal lgbtq festival. The kids were handed flags when they walked in and the games were all strange trans games like dress up as the opposite sex etc. Get your face painted but only with the lgbtq flag. People were outraged, at least. Only the real crazies let their young kids stay.

That I can tell you for a fact.In addition to saving Lamarine money on gas and offering a smoother driving experience, the Lightning also moved Massachusetts one more small step to achieving its climate goals of net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. The transportation sector accounts for 37 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts and the state is counting on at least 900,000 drivers switching to EVs by 2030.But the election of Donald Trump could slow the transition if the incoming president follows through on campaign promises to slash tax incentives, subsidies, regulations, and other programs that speed up EV purchases.Trump has said he would eliminate the $7,500 federal rebate that Lamarine collected. And on day one, the president-elect promised, he will revoke the Environmental Protection Agencys new regulation?[requiring carmakers to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/20/1239092833/biden-epa-auto-emissions-evs)?across their vehicle fleets.That rule was intended by the Biden administration to push manufacturers to build EVs instead of gasoline-fueled cars. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group which represents manufacturers, wrote a letter to Trump seeking stability and predictability around the emissions rule, the New York Times?[reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/climate/gm-ford-electric-vehicles-trump.html).Trump and the soon-to-be Republican-controlled Congress may also try to repeal incentives and spending for EV charger construction, domestic battery plants, and other EV-related projects. Those incentives come both from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administrations landmark climate bill that Trump promised to repeal, and from an?earlier infrastructure law.This is all about potential delay in the transformation of the market from gasoline to electric, said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to accelerate the energy transition for consumers in New England. Its just a matter of: Do they slow us down for four years or for 10 years? We dont know.Trump has offered contradictory statements about EVs during the campaign and may not be able to make all of the changes he seeks, experts said.Sometimes with the president-elect, there is a gap between rhetoric and action, said Kyle Murray, director of state program implementation at the Acadia Center in Boston. It can be difficult to judge what is actually going to occur.The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for an interview.?[Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/)?on November 15 that his team is planning to propose killing the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EV purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation.Further complicating any crystal-ball gazing,?Trump has also formed a close alliance with Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who will be a key adviser to the incoming president?[on the federal budget](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/12/nation/musk-ramaswamy-government-efficiency/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).","title":"How Trump could stall Massachusetts electric vehicle transition"},{"text":"I think its interesting how there is always some exonerative context for the violent things Trump says, but never for anyone on the left.Edit: its basically the same strategy that Shakespeare writes Mark Antony using!

As I recall, Nixon was elected, promising a return to domestic tranquility, and an end to the war, immediatly escalated the war by bombing Cambodia.  The anti war movement responded with huge protests, many of which turned into police riots.These protests were under reported, often ignored by the press,, and the number of participants under counted, and although deaths or injuries often occured that had become normalized.  It wasn't until Kent State that a mass casualty event occured which the press did not ignore.  Two weeks later the local cops opened fire on a dormatory at Jackson State, on a protest consisting of all of 100 kids, 12 students were injured and two students died.  It was a black school, so not considered important enough to remember.From all of that, here are a few suggestions if you do protest, be sure to wear jeans and sneakers.  Heavy clothes will help.  Bring a mask or a scarf or something to cover your face if they use tear gas.  Your phone may be confiscated, write a phone number on your wrist so you can contact someone if you are arrested.If the police come at you, grab the hand of the person next to you and walk, do not ever run away, if you run from police they have an excuse to be even more violent, if you are arrested then go completely limp.  Do not resist, but do not co-opeate, make them haul you to where ever they want to put you.  It's not a party, don't bring little kids.  Leave a blanket in your car if you have one in case they use water cannon.  If you are tempted to fight back, that will be the one thing that shows up on social media, and it will fuel the next round of misery.  I am literally too old and ill to do this now, but I would if I could.Things did change, but it came because of a lot of sacrifice, and a lot of loss.Also bring an extra pair of soxs, in your pockets, if your feet get wet it's pretty miserable.","title":"Pam Bondi: Pick to replace Matt Gaetz wants to deport pro-Palestine protestors"},{"text":"That's the burden of being superior, we have to wipe their asses for them.","title":"US farm groups want Trump to spare their workers from deportation"},{"text":"You can't reason people out of things they didn't reason themselves into.","title":"The Smarter Anti-Trump Resistance: More Facts, Less Outrage"},{"text":"What if it turns out this Presidential run was to film The Apprentice: Presidential Edition","title":"Fox hosts, cable news regulars and entertainment pros: Trump is casting a made-for-TV Cabinet"},{"text":"Trump's tariffs required a $30 billion bailout for farmers his first term.

As much as I hate the slippery slope shoe on the other foot argument, it still has some merit here. That being said I would agree with the point that Trump coming in after and packing the court isn't much different to the wildly lopsided composition we already have but...The president has basically no other check or power over the courtAs for his legacy, the fact is you're only correct in that a legacy is dictated by how people view history, not the actual fact of the matter. The biggest mistake the biden administration made was not treating MAGA as the \\"fascism without any ideological consistency\\" scurge that it is and not going harder on trying to throw Trump in a dark prison for insurrection as soon as he took office.Obviously, the democrats have a lot of problems both when it comes to messaging and use of political power. They come to gun fights with waterpistols because they're still under the illusion that half the country isn't beyond saving as far as messaging goes. But the boring fact is that incumbent parties were basically doomed to fail after covid all over the world. People don't understand macro economics or the time delay of economic policy, all they knew was inflation got really bad. Incumbent parties all over the world lost seats and vote share. So while yes, Biden should have dropped out earlier and the democrats should have picked a more appealing candidate, it's hard to see any of that being enough to escape the global backlash against incumbency this time around. Once again, a republican will fuck everything up, a Democrat will come in and fix the economy but the effects won't be felt fast enough so an angry electorate will vote in the same party (and same literal individual this time) that fucked everything up to take over and the Republicans will reap the reward of the democrats being the adults in the room. Then the republican will out deficit spend their predecessor despite complaining about that very deficit spending whenever they're not in power, cut taxes and deregulate, and cause another economic melt down that a democrat will have to come in again to fix. Rinse repeat until the average political and economic literacy of the American people surpasses that of a highschooler.Biden, as far as I'm concerned, actually did a pretty good job. America outperformed every other country in the world with regards to inflation. Unemployment is low. Much needed infrastructure was passed. He had the balls to finally pull out of Afghanistan despite the political backlash that was always going to happen because there was no good way to do it. He supported our allies while doing what he could to properly restrain them (to all the \\"genocide in gaza crowd\\" I don't care, you're wrong). Sure, he may have been sliding not so slowly into dementia, but from his actual job as president he's either a fantastic decision maker behind the scenes or his handlers are.","title":"CMV: As someone who would have voted Democrat if I were American, Joe Biden's historical legacy will be like that of Jimmy Carter, if not worse."},{"text":"And the leopard has really only started some probing nibbles so far","title":"US farm groups want Trump to spare their workers from deportation"},{"text":"At this pointdo it.

The Senate couldn't do anything by law without consent of The Assembly - which was supposedly a representation of the citizenry at large (though the wealthy were overrepresented there as well due to the century system based on economic class but let's not go there).Side note:  You have to understand this was the ancient world - it's just so vastly different then today.  Basic concepts were just unknown, the very ideology and concepts of liberalism just don't exist yet, the vast majority of citizens (let alone the population at large) is illiterate, even basic algebra hasn't made it to Rome yet... It's hard to overstate just how different thing were; don't try to apply a modern understanding to things here.The whole political structure of the Roman Republic was built on the citizen farmer as it's base.  This was your main voting block, and your manpower source for soldiers; the citizen farmer was the foundation on which everything else stood.  To vastly oversimplify things, as Rome kept winning wars it would capture massive amounts of slaves who would then be brought to Italy to farm the land; as this happened the ultra wealthy families would buy the most slaves and bring them to Italy to do forced manual labor.  This large influx of cheap slaves caused an economic pressure for the ultra wealthy to buy out the citizen farmers from their family farms and build largescale Latifundias maintained by slaves (basically ancient plantations).  These Latifundias ran on cheap slave labor, making more profits for the ultra wealthy, making it easier for them to buy up more citizen farmland and build ever larger estates.  When we get to the Late Republic the citizen farmer had been nearly squeezed out of the existence by this new Latifundia system.  Without the citizen farmer providing the base citizen population on which the entire Roman Republic political system relied, the system began to fail.  The ultra wealthy gained more and more control and corruption began to run rampant.The wealthy bought up hired muscle and began to use violence in Rome in order to accomplish their political goals.  Reformers would rise and be crushed and the violence got worse and worse.  This eventually culminated with Sulla, who suspended the whole constitutional system of Rome and became the first perpetual dictator - Sulla was an ultra conservative tyrant who purged his political enemies through violence.  Sulla would have lists of names posted in the forum in a system called \\"Proscription\\" and anyone who's name was on the list would be marked for death with the person killing them being granted all of that person's property - he did this for over a decade and it completely obliterated any sense of normalcy or peace in Rome.  He eventually \\"retired\\" and gave up the dictatorship in perpetua after he surmised his ultra conservative government was strong enough to never be challenged again.Caesar grew up during Sulla's progroms, and hated Sulla (Sulla almost had Caesar killed when he was a teenager, but was talked out of it).  After Sulla died, Caesar ended up taking up the mantle as the opposition leader to Sulla's system; he was a reformer.  The modern concept of left and right or liberal and conservative just doesn't apply here (ancient world, very different than today), but he was anti conservative - a reformer; he attempted to reestablish a reformed political system with the basic citizen being important in politics again and not just everyone bowing to the will of the Senate (ie the ultra wealthy).  He was ultimately killed for this by the ultra wealthy before he could really get to implementing his planned reforms.  Caesar was also a glory hound and didn't really focus on politics and reforms the way he liked to pretend to, but that's getting a little too far into the weeds.Augustus was Caesar's heir.  He liked to pretend he was a reformer too and out there fighting for the common citizen.  He wasn't, he was a rich narcissistic asshole out for himself.  The thing is Augustus won in the end.  Augustus was the one who decided that the old political system and the very concept of The Republic was rotten to the core.  He destroyed it and crowned himself Emperor when he won the civil war.  It was Augustus, not Caesar who ended The Roman Republic and ushered in the Roman Empire, but the man who really broke the system and allowed Augustus to get away with that was Sulla, not Caesar.I'm way, way oversimplifying and skipping over alot of the details obviously, but that's the best TLDR I can type out.","title":"Donald Trump Thinks He Wont Have Enough Power"},{"text":"Party of states' rights and small government, folks","title":"Trumps Border Czar Makes Big Promise if States Dont Cooperate"},{"text":"full on imperialist neo-con.\\nBiden is a corpse. weekend at bernies","title":"Biden just renewed a ridiculous Trump-era executive order declaring Nicaragua an \\"extraordinary threat\\" to the US.

Anyone that does not think the pace was fast enough needs to point the blame at SCOTUS for assisting Trumps defense team with delaying the trial as much as possible. One motion to dismiss took a full year for the case to get back to the original courtroom. SCOTUS provided 6.5 months of that delay. They also left certain things vague enough in that decision for the defense to have new reasons to use appeals to start another delay process.
