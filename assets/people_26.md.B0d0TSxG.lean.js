Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election.The request to freeze the case for nearly a month comes as prosecutors are mulling whether to pursue the proceeding at all now that Mr. Trump is returning to the White House.The defendant, Mr. Smiths filing said, is expected to be certified as president-elect on Jan. 6, 2025, and inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025.The government respectfully requests that the court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule, Mr. Smiths deputies went on, to afford the government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.The prosecutors asked for a new deadline  Dec. 2  for the government to file a status report or otherwise inform the court of the result of its deliberations.A longstanding Justice Department policy bars the prosecution of sitting presidents. Mr. Smith has already opened discussions with department leaders about how best to wind down both the election interference case and the other federal case he pursued against Mr. Trump  the one in Florida in which he was accused of illegally holding on to classified documents after he left office.The request to pause the case in Washington was the first overt sign that Mr. Smith and his team are in the throes of figuring out how to shut down the two prosecutions.Prosecutors asked Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who is overseeing the election case, to push off the deadlines now because Mr. Trumps lawyers were scheduled to send her a critical court filing on Nov. 21.In that filing, Mr. Trumps lawyers were expected to lay out a detailed argument for why Mr. Trump should not face trial at all on the election interference charges because of the Supreme Courts ruling this summer granting him a broad form of immunity against prosecution for official acts he took in office.For the moment at least, Mr. Smith and his team have not made a similar request to pause efforts to revive the classified documents case, which was dismissed in its entirety this summer by Judge Aileen M. Cannon. Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, tossed out all of the charges on the grounds that Mr. Smith was unlawfully appointed to his post as special counsel.Mr. Smiths team has appealed Judge Cannons ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. His deputies are currently scheduled to file an additional round of court papers this month.","title":"Judge Grants Jack Smiths Request for Pause in Jan. 6 Case After Trumps Election"},{"text":"100% (I also live here, and like him as Gov, and call him Governor Batemen lol).","title":"Trump Accuses Newsom of Attempt to 'Trump-Proof' Calif."},{"text":"Ya because women just care about reproducing..","title":"4B Movement Surges in U.S. Interest After Trump Wins Election"},{"text":"It's pretty clear that the supervisor, Marni Washington, should be fired straight up.

Student loans, it was too little too late, but they did at least try putting something through, and honestly SAVE was a bigger win than the $10k of forgiveness...that alone will save a lot of people way more than the $10k anyhow.  Healthcare, they're not improving it, but they're also not gutting it (I expect a more likely than not chance that healthcare is gutted in the next 2 years now).  Immigration, they're far from good, but they're far better than mass deportation.  Palestine, they both suck, obviously, but add Ukraine to the mix to suck more for what we have now.  (I fully expect neither Palestine nor Ukraine will exist by 2026.)  Stuff like taking money out of politics, I've seen them put bills forth, but they obviously need filibuster-proof majority to get through, and they haven't had one in 12? 13? years.  (And yes, I'd say Obama was useless then on that front, but he did get us ACA then, so not entirely...)They're far from perfect, for sure...but the alternative is going to be way worse.  Republicans last action on student loans was making them unable to be discharged in bankruptcy (except with very rare circumstances).  Republicans last action on healthcare was to promise to get rid of it without a replacement plan.  Republicans have promised mass deportation.  Republicans suck just as much on Palestine, and add Ukraine to the mix to suck on as well.  Republicans universally fought against taking money out of politics.  And things Obama tried to do at the end, like fixing salaried wages, Republicans immediately shut down the moment Trump got in office.  Then there's COVID, which at the very least Trump made far worse than it needed to be, and arguably ACTUALLY CAUSED TO BE A THING AT ALL by disbanding the pandemic response that Obama had put in place, including in the area where it originated...**If the Democrats had won, I'd expect four more years of next to nothing, good or bad, getting done.

If my Mom said she was going to stop paying the electrical bill for my housing situation as a result of who I voted for, which resulted in my power being shut off, then the withdrawal of financial support to pay said bill may not be voter retaliation in the same way.

These are all very different - only loosely related - ideas.Second, **even if** swing voters really do believe Kamala is too focused on transgender issues (which we don't know), that **doesn't** mean swing voters have immense antipathy toward transgender people and want to see politicians be more mean toward them and support public policy that makes their lives worse.

I was reading a bit here: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/insurrection-act-explained.. which leaves me with an believe that the President can certainly invoke the Insurrection Act,.. although I'm left wondering how that would work out in a practical manner. The scenario I imagine in my head,. is that Trump would gin up some imaginary \\"insurrection threat\\" (say like he did saying \\"Illegal immigrant gangs have taken over Aurora Colorado\\").. what happens if he dispatches the Military there and when the military arrive,.. there's nothing to do ? (citizens obviously knowing this is coming.. would just hunker down and presumably it would have a chilling effect on public travel and daily activities. Then what ? (a little edit here:.. I would assume (again, perhaps naively) that the Military, when asked to go into what's being claimed is some kind of \\"insurrection zone of disruption\\" would ask or require \\"intelligence\\" or information up front as to what kind of threat they were facing ? (logistically and warfare fighting wise, you obviously want to know what you're driving into) What happens when Trump says \\"INSURRECTION!\\" and the Military gathers data and says.. \\"What insurrection, sir?\\")How would a military-dispatch like that \\"provide results\\".. when they're given a fake or imaginary or vague \\"just go find some immigrants to arrest\\". I presume (and anyone can call me out if I'm missing something or just being incredibly naive).. but I just don't see much going to happen there if you send the military into a wild goose chase. A bit more plausible though might be sending the military to target specific individuals (whomever he labels as \\"the enemy within\\" as he now so often has). To me that's a little more clear cut example of an unlawful order that shouldn't be followed. (but again, I'm not Constitutional Law Scholar and we are way beyond \\"unprecedented times' now) My feeling at this point (and again, I'm happy to listen to any well reasoned observations of how I might be wrong about this).. is that much of the aggression and antagonistic hate being spewed up on the right at the moment ---is purely being done to \\"anger the libs\\". \\"creating fear\\" (or \\"creating an atmosphere of fear\\" is (at least in my opinion) at the moment the thing they're most interested in. It's a terrorism tactic. They want to instill fear and obedience. (it's why they said \\"it can be a bloodless revolution if the left allows it\\"). They expect the left to just \\"lay down and take it\\". As to how all this plays out and which groups align with whom... I honestly do not know. I'm definitely frightened by it.

The Republicans actually respected the democratic process, while the Democratic/media party/Hollywood/elites verbally complained that the Republicans were/are going to destroy democracy.

This was 100% the fault of the media, George Clooney, Pelosi, Obama, no name congress people, etc. Candidate switcheroo strategies that rob Dem primary voters of their primary choice for Joe Biden, all over a tenuous June debate performance, are always a really bad idea that really contaminated the democratic process of every vote counts; this strategy should've been avoided at all costs. If this was a real primary candidate selection rather than a default excuse to the effect of, \\"it's too late now to pick another candidate now type choice,\\" then the media's much hyped, \\"So much enthusiasm behind Kamala Harris,\\" and alleged $1 billion raised BS would've equalled an actual win at the ballot box. It was all nonsensical strategy and had zero to do with misogyny and racism. If there was a real primary, then I wouldn't have had to cross out, \\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,\\" and write in, \\" Joseph R Biden Jr and current Vice President,\\" (to avoid confusion). I woul've? had zero objection to casting my vote for Kamala Harris, a WOMAN OF COLOR, following a real primary with Kamala Harris having received the most votes at the top of the ticket, but this just wasn't that scenario. Our primary ballot in the March San Francisco, California ballot did not identify the name of a running mate and only included the name, \\"Joseph R Biden Jr,\\" as the candidate for president and that was our selection in March and in the November general election.

The last time around, Trump was surrounded by a small group of moderately competent people, and these adults basically put baby bumpers and pool noodles on all the sharp edges of government. This time, Trump will rule with greater power but fewer excuses, and heand his voterswill have to own the messes and outrages he is already planning to create.                   Sorry, but there is no bright spot. **That's** whistling in the graveyard.

The damage that Trump and acolytes will do (especially if he winds up with a Republican House to couple with the GOP Senate) will take a generation to undo, if it can be undone. It's possible Trump, the first truly fucking archcriminal I've known about outside of a comic book, could wind up having put **SIX** justices on the Supreme Court. That won't be undone anytime soon.

I thought that was absurd, but I am now convinced that if that really did happen, people would just vilify the victim or say they had it coming or say it was self defense or something.

I'm convinced he's a sociopath who feels no empathy and has no conscience, which enables his manipulation and gaslighting. He is literally immune from prosecution and unable to be held to account.

The Democratic Party adapted policies in support of Civil Rights in opposition to the Jim Crow laws enacted in Southern States that mandated separation of white &amp; black people, red-line laws, separation in education (Brown vs Board of Education), lynchings, etc.  when President LBJ (a Democrat) signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, essentially ALL of the Southern Democrats, the Dixiecrats, abandoned the Democratic Party &amp; joined the Republican Party in protest &amp; opposition to Civil Rights, Equal Rights, etc.  As happens with people, they move for jobs, &amp; many other reasons, so we have a lot of Southerners (not all Southern US citizens are racist, but by history, most of them have been - hates teaches hate &amp; needs hate &amp; fear to continue to grow) moved out of the South &amp; to other parts of the US.  This is where you find a lot of the racist policies &amp; racist dog-whistles you hear coming from Trump - these are his people.  The KKK has morphed into White Militia groups, like The 3 Percenters &amp; The Proud Boys, and many more, who were solidly represented at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Charles Koch &amp; his Bros, born &amp; raised in Kansas, family of oil-barons, still one of the richest people in the USA, joined the Libertarian Party (founded in 1971), whose platform emphasizes individual liberty (freedom) in personal &amp; economic affairs (stress economic), avoidance of foreign entanglements (isolationism &amp; America First), free trade &amp; migration (Wikipedia definition).  As the Libertarianism Party couldnt really get enough voters to get behind its platform, they kinda bought-up the Republican Party who rolled right over for all the financial backing &amp; money that Charles Koch &amp; many other ultra-rich billionaires gave them (this is the impetus behind Citizens United decision of the SCOTUS), at about the time that Ronald Reagan, a charismatic actor who was active in California politics, &amp; who they supported.  After 50 yrs of billions &amp; billions of dollars poured into the GOP (Grand Ole Party - what it was back-in-the-days of the Civil War, now the Republican Party), through many tax-free organizational &amp; research groups, like The Heritage Foundatiin, the GOP adopted many of the ideas of the Libertarian Party - this is where the marriage of fiscal conservatism (the idea that people shouldnt have to pay taxes, at least the rich corporate &amp; business class) &amp; racial bigotry, hatred &amp; resentment occurs.  Theyre all still very much of the Republican Party believers belief system (now, to be fair, not all Republicans are selfish &amp; racist, but, to be fair also, many are, &amp; you can hear the subtle gas-lighting &amp; dog-whistles in the speeches of Trump, etc.).  Then, and still, in the 1960s - 1980s, Republicans still had a hard time getting voters to join their party in a solid-enough way as to ensure winning National elections.  The pendulum of history had swung to the Left in politics - the Civil Rights mvmt, the Kennedys War on Poverty, the backlash of young people against conservative beliefs (this was when the SCOTUS struck down state laws banning marriage between people of different races, when SCOTUS decided that states couldnt prevent the use of birth control by people, that women couldnt be discriminated against, prior, they couldnt take out loans, own a credit card or have their own private checking account in most states prior to 1974, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), &amp; Roe v Wade, decided in 1973, that women all across the USA had equal rights to Abortion &amp; Reproductive Care.  This is what MAGA means, the Koch Bros, Heritage Foundation, etc, have been pushing since they joined the Republican Party to have many, if not all of these Freedoms &amp; Rights repealed).  In the 1970s the GOP courted &amp; incorporated the Moral Majority political mvt, a Born Again Christian mvt, mostly of white followers, into the folds of the Republican Party.  Many White Christian churches (some Evangelical, some Catholic, Pentecostal, the Christian Liberty Party, etc), have congregations that believe in Christian Dominianism, a belief that God gave them the theological mandate to rule the USA - this is where you see them pray over Trump, &amp; he says things like I will protect you &amp; I am your salvation, because most of them believe that he was sent by God to help them enact their beliefs on the American Public, the 1st big one was the Dobbs Decision by the SCOTUS &amp; his appointment of 3 additions SCOTUS Justices on the Supreme Court.  (Democracy in Chains, by Nancy MacLain is the most clearly &amp; concisely written historical reference I know of on this subject).","title":"Donald Trump has won  and American democracy is now in grave danger"},{"text":"They never scrutinized it to begin withtrump said there was fraud on election nightproceeds to file lawsuits, lose nearly all his cases due to lack of credible evidenceis told by his own DOJ that they looked into his claims and theyre bullshit. recounts and audited reconfirm the totals, trump still claims massive fraud and schemes to steal the election after the deadline for legal challenges endsthrows Mike pence under the bus for not accepting fake votes that will help overturn the electionthen eventually gets indicted for it.at what point were trumpers scrutinizing anything?

We had a staunch democrat, who's only \\"conservative\\" part of her platform was school vouchers, completely flip from Democrat to Republican. Not only did she switch parties, she flipped on every single issue she ran on, including abortion rights. Which is ironic, because she was previously famous for when she gave a speech on the floor of the GA talking about how important abortion is because *she* had had an abortion before. She even claimed afterwards that Republicans had tried to hit her with their car in the parking lot of the GA after that speech. But when she switched over, she suddenly supported a 12 week abortion ban. Normally one person switching isn't a big deal, but that one seat switched it from a Republican Majority to Republican Supermajority, meaning they could override the Democratic Governor's veto with ease. And unfortunately, she won her new hand drawn district this week after that supermajority redrew the maps in their favor. She was representing one of the most left leaning districts in the state before they redrew it. We also can't forget Sinema in the US Senate who started her career as a Green Party member (first sign of trouble) and then moved further and further right until she has a more conservative voting record in the US Senate than Collins and Murkowski. Finally, leaving the Democratic party to be independent.","title":"Janelle Bynum wins race for Congress, flipping U.S. House seat from GOP to Democratic control"},{"text":"Thu 7 Nov 2024 07.00 ESTWhat?

I don't see any way to fix this trend without having parents who aren't also part of that system actually spending more time with their children and giving them better role models, keeping them off social media, and/or create more free and open communities to teach young men wood working, machining, archery, chess, art, anything productive with good roll models. Allow spaces where women can join too and let people learn what it is like to meet and understand one another. Our society is too spread apart and expensive for young people to properly mingle day to day, and the ipad babies are being brainwashed by the babysitter algorithms instead.Dating apps and other online portals are also to blame for this trend and need to be heavily regulated or even just funded by the government so that they are freer and open instead of the scam they are now.

The case is not going forward during the next four years. So it comes down to does the DOJ want to1) keep the cases active and let Trump live with the optics of shutting down the open cases against him2) somehow put the cases in a dormant state, and hope Trump does nothing in the intervening years to make a resumption of prosecution possible3) close the cases and produce a final report detailing the evidence against Trump and making it clear that his re-election is the only reason they're declining prosecution4) close the cases and present as minimal a final report as possibleI don't see them going for option 1. It cuts against their standing policy of not prosecuting sitting Presidents and won't get them any closer to trying the cases.I doubt they'd go for option 2, either. While it's appealing to think, \\"Hey, at least they're not giving up on the case,\\" the reality is that Trump might not be around four years from now, and the memories of witnesses will have faded (assuming they're still around four years from now). There would be a reluctance, I think, to reactivate the case. Option 4 is possible, but the only thing it has to recommend it is that it's the course of action least likely to provoke retaliatory action from Trump and his cronies. Given the rhetoric already being spouted by Fox News hosts that the prosecutors in the Trump case should be given the death penalty, I don't think cowering would make a damned bit of difference. I think Option 3 is what we'll eventually see. As unappealing as it is to realize that Trump would not face accountability for his actions, at least it will preserve the evidence for the historical record.","title":"Judge hits pause on Trump's election interference criminal case"},{"text":"what are the chances it will be Walz 2028?","title":"What will happen to Tim Walz after Donald Trump's presidential election win?"},{"text":"It is fear mongering and hyperbole from the Left.","title":"Can anyone explain to me how any American citizen's rights are actually in reality in any way different based on the election results?"},{"text":"maga","title":"Leftist Women Shave Their Heads in Protest of Trump Victory: F**k Being Hot, Thats What the Patriarchy Wants"},{"text":"Sorry for coming across as negative and condescending.

Two major drawbacks are:  1) the USA imports lots of raw material worldwide that it cannot obtain naturally, so costs for these items will balloon to match the new tariffs. And 2)  many retailers and manufacturers will be forced to sell their products at a higher price, to offset the costs, which could lead to a financial depression. The NAFTA / USMCA was created solely to get around these price increases, but would mean nothing under the tariffs, unless a deal is reached between Canada/Mexico. So while the cost of locally produced goods may go down, chances are the prices will *rise*, so long as the price is still lower than that of their competitors / outside manufacturers. Long story short: Tariffs are a double-edged sword and can boost a countrys economy in the short-term, but may create undue hardships in the long-term.","title":"Trump-Vance Need To Fix The Debt Bomb Biden-Harris Created"},{"text":"Feels good to have balls again","title":"Trump Has a Message for Hamas"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|z619OZp86JaBG|downsized)","title":"The level of what I am dubbing \\"Copeporn\\" is ridiculous on reddit"},{"text":"They werent having sex to begin with.","title":"Liberal women across America vow to NEVER have sex with men again in revenge for Donald Trump's victory"},{"text":"Only Democrats blame themselves, silly.","title":"The next 4 years will be a Republicans quadfuct'ya"},{"text":"You mean like their rhetoric to teenage girls, saying their body is now theirs?Seems they deem Trump a rolemodel just fine.

In response, the official said, We have already spent a lot of money, adding that moneys not an issue.  \\nThe charges announced today expose Irans continued brazen attempts to target U.S. citizens, including President-elect Donald Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran, said Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I.Iran has been conspiring with criminals and hit men to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply wont be tolerated, he said.The newly unsealed complaint also contains allegations that the authorities had disrupted another plot to assassinate Masih Alinejad, a Brooklyn human-rights activist who has long criticized Irans repression of women.The man prosecutors said was tasked with the plot to kill Mr. Trump and Ms. Alinejad is Farhad Shakeri, 51. Prosecutors said that he was at large and is believed to reside in Iran.

Ive listened to all of them for years and not one has said anything of the sort. I also listen to many more commentators than just them. A few on the left, a couple more from the right and Dave Smith. Just saying that so you dont think Ive only been listening to the DW for years. I sincerely hope youre not referring to Matt Walsh trolling the internet by saying it was the plan all along. The guy whos made two deadpan comedy documentaries and by far the most sarcastic voice Ive ever heard on the internet. If youve really listened to all of them, you know that Klavan, Shapiro, Knowles etc all share wildly different opinions on some things and they regularly argue about them when they do the backstage segments. The only one Ive heard that can even be interpreted as wanting war with Iran is Shapiro. But I dont believe he wants that, and he said he doesnt. I can see how some people could think that though because hes obviously a biased voice on the issue and hes always going to argue for some level of support from the US for Israel and for Israel to be allowed to defend themselves and/or retaliate when they need to. Im not saying I agree with Shapiro, just stating what Ive seen and that he has obvious strong biases and no one should be surprised when they surface. But I fail to see where youre going trying to say theyre endorsing or celebrating that ridiculous agenda.Edit: The DW guys dont all share the same ideas about Israel. Walsh and Knowles have consistently voiced very different opinions than Shapiro has, they just dont bring it up to each other in person. Youd know if you watched their individual shows when they talk about the Israel and Palestine issue. The only one who took it further than anyone else and was much more outspoken was Candace Owens, and we all see how that ended.","title":"Any good Libertarian news sources?"},{"text":"Yep, which makes it incumbent on the Democrats to define the brand by loudly professing core values and striking down the unsavory parts.

Yup.Are liberals in the minority? Wrong question. Are we really in the wrong with our ideals? Nope.What is going on? Big money through the boomers have raised Americans to be awful humans.Trump offers absolutely nothing but performative cruelty, and he chose women and brown people as the enemies. Based on the popular vote, Americans love cruelty more than anything else. It's not like 2016 when trump was a bit of an unknown; everyone in 2024 knew exactly what he was about and slightly over half of us said \\"yup we want that.\\" As much as we'd like to think \\"we're better than that,\\" the popular vote proves we are not. Trump is now a mirror.Asking whether liberals are in the minority misses the point. To trump or not to trump is less a question of politics than it is a question of class. Steinbeck's description of Americans' identity of \\"temporarily embarassed capitalists\\" was humorous because very few humans will be or should be capitalists. The vast majority of humans will only ever be labor but capitalists had no problem convincing us otherwise. All they had to do was provide a scapegoat for why we're not all billionaires.Of course liberals aren't wrong in their ideals. Humans are only powerful and happy when we work together, and humans in capitalism will always fall into a bell curve: 5% will always struggle, 90% will adjust, and 5% will always excel. Liberal ideals ride that 95% wave and take care of the bottom 5%. The conservative ideal is \\"fuck the bottom 95%.\\" Conservatism is unsustainable and at best provides boom and bust cycles.

However I would never vote for a candidate based outside of meritus metric.I was ready to vote for Tulsi gabbard if she got the presidential Democratic nomination back in 2019 and she could have done it but the DNC robbed her of it, pushing her out, forcibly and barring her from debates.She's got years of military service as an army medic that has seen combat. Even now she's still in The Reserves. She's a seasoned politician and her biggest platforms are the prevention of War, veteran care and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Gabbard was always amiable to Republicans and willing to work with them when she was a House Rep. She has a calming presence that's still authoritative and she can clearly explain concepts and ideas in an everyday-erudite manner. That she was a woman was never a reason for my wanting to vote for her. Now that she's on Trump's team, I do admit, as an undecided and non-party affiliated voter who voted this past Sunday, that I voted more for the people around Trump than Trump himself. He's got a powerful transition committee. He's got some amazing advisors and while Congress is now Red, I do expect Congress to make it difficult for Trump to appoint people like RFK Jr to Cabinet positions. I suspect he's going to get around that by creating one or two new departments that will oversee troubled departments. At any rate, while the first woman president can certainly be Democrat I do think it's more likely that it's going to be a Republican, specially now that Gabbard is a Republican.","title":"Will the First 'Madam President' Be a Republican?"},{"text":"What an awful thing to say about the next president of the US","title":"Judge grants Jack Smith's request to pause Trump's election interference case"},{"text":"I disagree with this.

When Stewart cornered Walz on the Cheney endorsement Walz practically dismissed any kind of policy concessions.?You campaigned together and yet you havent really promised explicit policy that will reassure former Republicans on the fence.?She spoke in generalities like being a President for Americans type of rhetoric. ?It was pretty clear that the campaign was afraid of upsetting the left by refusing to make any kind of explicit policy concessions, any fig leaf that could be used to signal moderation.?I think this was also conveyed to moderate Republicans who felt that she wasnt really trying win them. Liz Cheney burnt her political career and yet you cannot offer any kind of fig leaf besides saying you will appoint a single Republican??That doesnt seem very effective, it feels like trying to buy off people on the cheap. The whole effort was too mired in aesthetics.?Specific policies dont matter usually but, showcasing the explicit policy is useful for conveying a message.

Ive had to teach my parents what it means to research trustworthy sources, finding multiple verifiable claims of the same nature, and in general not to trust anything they read (especially on the internet). Thats what scares me though is that these working class republicans may not even be capable of understanding the why which explains how they cant admit any fault in Trump or even admit ANY failures. I still struggle to comprehend how they actually think like this and arent putting on some sort of ruse. I have college educated friends who voted for Trump, but we have in depth conversations about their choice. They usually provide valid answers and arent afraid to admit that Donald Trump isnt exactly their favorite choice of candidate in terms of representing them (i.e. older, lying about certain policies, talks like an idiot).It really seems politics has turned into some sort of contest where it doesnt matter what the candidate does, but instead that they win the game.

Her and Trump are the two people most famous for taking down Kamala. Being Vance's V.P. for 8 years and running in 2036 is a solid path forward for her. She would be 55.

Too many are afraid to speak up and say things like  hey , maybe we should just admit we have a crisis at the border  instead of following the administrations 3+ years of telling the public it was under control Maybe democrats need to actually stop being afraid to point out where their policies have failed while still making voters aware of the policies that are working. But the rational and critical thinking dems are afraid of breaking from the narratives passed on at the top There are dems that dont believe in the idea that biological males should compete on biological female sports but the dems would rather stay as extreme left on the subject instead of pushing the idea that youre intolerant if you dont believe biological men should be able to compete in sports with biological women. Personally Im right center , I dont believe in governments involvement in the personal choices of women and their bodies and I was sure the election was going to be won or lost on that front. But the reality is almost every Harris campaign ad reaching out to women was centered around their bodies from the waist down. Dems have gone so far left they alienated and vilified young white men. Almost a decade of telling men they are the problem and masculinity was a direct threat to democracy and a direct threat to women. Young white men were told they were more dangerous than bears.  They were told by their razor makers that they are toxic. Young white men spoke up\\nBut they did so at the polls. Rural America saw the ads representing them as flannel shirt wearing John deer hat wearing donut holes that have finally seen the light and are voting for Kamala. This was a total misrepresentation of rural America and they spoke up on that at the polls. Dems made the entire election about misogyny while a minority female who is the vice president of the country told us women are being held back by white men. The attack on masculinity , white men , and the pandering to the lgbtq community and the trans community not to\\nMention another year of treating minorities like helpless children and victims swayed the election Blatantly lying to the public about how great the economy is doing swayed the election. Covering up\\nAnd denying bidens rapid cognitive decline until the very last minute swayed the election. Kamala shamelessly switching personalities , accents , dispositions depending on who she was pandering to swayed the election. Even that hideous cackle Kamala just couldnt let go of swayed the election.  Even now watch CNN, you cant go 2 min without the word  misogyny  being uttered .  In 2016 it was a white lash . But for the most part young white males\\nSaid this is enough.  We took it for a while but now its just getting out of hand. They just got fed up with being told they are the problem with the country. Now if Dems deployed some critical thinking at had those discussions internally without fear of being ostracized this election goes another way.  The election wasnt even about trump. Youd think with my reasoning that I voted for trump. I did not. I did not in 2020 or 2016. Hes a buffoon. This election result was the country telling the left the extreme left to stop with the rhetoric and get back to the real issues. They told the left to stop pandering and creating villains. They told the left to start being honest and self reflective.  They told the left to stop\\nSaying theyre helping the black community and actually help them.  The election was lost because democrats ran an entire campaign on fear mongering. At least were not him. If I had to add another reason this election was lost I cant help but recognize the trump\\nCampaign ran a very calculated campaign. A very targeted and smart strategic campaign. The Harris campaign ran on the assumption that they already had the 2020 Biden votes and just needed to hold on to them. They didnt need to gain even an inch of ground they had to just not lose any.  And they lost about 500 yards of ground.  Harris didnt over perform really anywhere. Trump over performed just about everywhere. So what I can only deduce from this election cycle is that next election an even slightly\\nLess flawed and controversial candidate for the republicans may very well win the next 2 elections.  Thats about how long its going to take for the Dems to undo a decade of relying on fear mongering , pandering and vilifying  key voting demographics. White men especially young white men found the counter strike to being blamed for everything.  And Dems cant just do an about face and start pandering to them. Theyre going to have to slowly walk away from these mislead attacks and narratives. Dems strategy of muffling the voice of white America worked for a bit but now they know its going to work against them in the future.","title":"Why Democrats Lose Even When Republicans Are so Endlessly Terrible"},{"text":"They will never ever become president.","title":"Why did Donald Trump win in Arizona but Kari Lake lost?

The only surge of excitement we saw among the wider populace and young voters was when Walz was announced and began antagonizing the Republicans. Establishment Democrat advisors told the campaign to abandon that to chase the mythical moderate Republican that no longer exists. For all their effort abandoning aggressive and populist language what did they get?94% of registered Republicans voted for Trump just like 94% did in 2020. And they alienated the young progressive voters and the blue collar working class by saying nothing would change from a very unpopular administration and offering niche specific policy nuggets that no average voter cares about instead of a compelling narrative.Again, it doesnt matter who has the better policies. It doesnt matter who lies. It doesnt matter who is the fascist. When it comes to actually running a political campaign with a largely unengaged and uninformed populace with heavy populist biases what matters is emotionally engaging people.

What is going on in Israel is unconscionable, US interests in the Middle East be damned. But what do you think the solution is to that? Sure, you can refuse to vote for a Democrat, but how does that get you any closer to your goal of ending the war? I'd argue, as always, that the primary elections are for putting candidates up there who actually represent your ideology, and the general election is for damage control. I firmly believe that history will prove me right here when I say that the simple fact is that more Palestinian children will die under Trump than under Biden. Obviously we can't objectively see how many would have died under Harris, but it is clear to me that while the Democrats have a lot to answer for, the Republicans embrace it wholeheartedly and unapologetically. Biden at least *tried* to broker peace. Trump has given no indication that he will do so. It seems very clear to me that the only rational action here would be to vote for the Democrat who's not perfect, and next cycle ask some very hard questions of the primary candidates and refuse to help nominate any who cross one or more of your hard lines.how else do you explain Kamala losing to someone like Donald Trump? I don't believe that there's one single factor. Sexism both ways is absolutely a factor--both sexism against women in states that are anti-abortion, and frankly sexism against men in the Democratic messaging that implies men are near-exclusively responsible for all these problems.But you can also point to other factors. For example, it's very plausible that abortion wasn't a winning argument in large part because the various ballot measures allowed voters to protect abortion independently of Trump or Harris, thus freeing pro-abortion voters from the need to vote for Harris to protect their interests in that way.Racism, obviously; a huge part of Trump's popularity can be traced back to a backlash against Obama. Not to mention we're sliding back to Bush-era racism against Latinos.There's also the global trend of pushback against post-covid inflation and cost-of-living issues that can't be entirely blamed on the Democrats (because it's happening everywhere, not just in the US).
