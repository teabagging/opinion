Every campaign has its own sources of polling information. Sometimes this information is intentionally skewed towards the campaign so the campaign can publish the results for a round of fund raising. But sometimes the polls are brutally honest and say things the campaign doesn't want others to hear, but still wants to act on. The former get published (and promptly dismissed by aggregators like 538, but crowed by dishonest groups). The latter are hidden and only seen by the campaign's most loyal members. The thing to keep in mind about polling is it's more to tell a story than actually inform what the public's going to do. They poll a couple hundred thousand to maybe a million people over the course of the campaign, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 at a time, and try to forecast what 160+ million people are going to do from those numbers. And all it takes for these numbers to be off is someone to say they're going to vote for a candidate to a pollster and vote for another during the election, or worse, just stay home. You want to not see Trump in office next January? There's only one thing that you can do to ensure that you won't see Trump in office next January. That's to make sure your vote is cast for his opponent, the only person who can possibly win against him, Kamala Harris.

I was planning to vote Republican but Trump was not who I wanted to vote for. He was crass, rude, and had no filter! I didn't think he was dignified enough to be a proper president. But he won anyway and so I got to see what he was made of. He still says things that I don't necessarily like sometimes but that's what you get with someone who doesn't have a filter, the good thing is that you also get the TRUTH. He's been a lot more honest with us than pretty much any president in history, he tells it like it is or he tells us what's really going on, even if his advisors will be upset with him. He doesn't give a damn. He goes off the script ALL the time, he'll say \\"they wanted me to say this, but I'm gonna say THIS instead\\" and blurts out the truth, even if it's a hard pill to swallow and I've really come to appreciate that. He's respected by other world leaders and that lends a sense of safety that I have not felt these past four years. I've felt like we're on the edge of WW3 the whole time and honestly embarrassed by how long they allowed Biden and his very frail mental health to \\"run\\" things. I would've preferred to have Obama in charge, at least he was mentally present and I feel like he could handle a big conflict. Trump doesn't even need a teleprompter or ear piece. He can go right off the top of his head, tell an engaging/factual story in layman's terms (forget all the political jargon the other politicians EXPECT us to not be able to understand yet use anyway), get his point across, and keep our attention while also using clever humor to keep it light-hearted. He cares about our country, he donated his entire presidential salary the whole time he was in office last time. What other president has ever done that? He's quick to help with disaster relief in our country, he donated $52 million to the people of North Carolina before Biden even knew what had happened. He's just ON TOP of things.He puts our citizens first, caring for veterans and the poor, protecting us from the impact of illegal immigrants who come here and absolutely drain the system which was intended to help our poor and our victims of natural disasters and our elderly. What other big successful country throws its borders wide open allowing anyone and everyone to come in completely unvetted? I'm all for helping people, people who are willing to do things the right way and prove that they will be upstanding citizens. I don't care where you're from, what color your skin is, or what religion you are, if you come here and get properly vetted and show that you love America and want to be part of it, then welcome!He cares about our freedom. I know gun rights are always a touchy subject but let's be real, the government is kept in check here because we are willing and able to defend ourselves. Look back at Australia for example during COVID. They had previously done the whole mandatory government gun buy back thing and took and destroyed everyone's guns. Then when COVID happened they forced everyone to get vaccinated. Which I believe should be everyone's personal choice, another reason why I support Trump, vaccines can be dangerous especially when they haven't had the time to go through the lengthy and proper testing. And nobody should be forced to take any kind of medication, procedure, or vaccine if they don't want to. The people who refused to get vaccinated or popped up as COVID positive in their system were thrown into internment camps basically. Their kids were removed from them and vaccinated en masse in stadiums. I mean the whole thing was a dystopian nightmare that could've been SO much worse and that our government would absolutely NEVER be able to pull off since we are able to defend ourselves. Look over at the UK, there are people there who are being arrested right now for saying offensive things on the internet! Censorship and losing your freedom of speech are DEVASTATING. At first you're just \\"not supposed\\" to say rude things or the TRUTH, then you're not ALLOWED to say anything that might hurt someone's feelings or rile anyone up in a way the government doesn't approve of, then you're being hauled off to jail for saying that what's happening is wrong or trying to share your point of view or change someone's mind. Once the government gets control of these freedoms we have they will NEVER give it back. That's why we fight so hard for our freedom, not because we love our guns and love being douchebags to strangers on the internet, but to protect EVERYONE on both sides of it.Why have multiple people tried to assassinate Trump? If he's just some big bumbling fool why are they so scared of him? Because he threatens their plans for US. They've literally tried every single thing in their power including assassination to get rid of him. Doesn't that strike you as weird? Many other politicians have done similar and even WORSE things than he's done and nobody is fighting like hell to lock them up or get rid of them! It's just a bit too strange... Why would they fight for non-citizens to be able to vote? Why wouldn't they require ID's to vote in the most important election in our country? Why are they letting illegal immigrants flood in at unprecedented rates? Why give them so much money that it literally drained our FEMA fund? They're literally BUYING the votes of people who are not citizens.Anyway, there are plenty more reasons that I will vote for Trump this year. I'm not a Trump worshipper and if in the future he shows some ugly side of himself I won't hesitate to change who I support. He's a human being who has his flaws and a big mouth, but a lot of what comes out is just the truth, plain and simple. And he is currently showing and has shown in the past that he cares about our country, and I enjoyed my life during his last four year term a lot more than I did during Biden's. Kamala will just be another Biden, maybe a bit more mentally \\"in tact\\" but let's be real here, she doesn't know what she's doing either and is not fit to run a country. We've already seen that Trump can be successful in running this country and I'd like to see OUR country and OUR people being put first again. And of course be able to buy a cartload of groceries for less than $400 and fill up my gas tank for less than $60! ??","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"Sorry to get caught.","title":"Bret Baier Says He 'Made a Mistake' after Kamala Harris called him out for deceptively editing video during Fox interview"},{"text":"Can children operate bucket wheel excavators?","title":"Democrats Problem With Male Voters Isnt Complicated"},{"text":"It's so crazy that California the state where the most Democrats and most Republicans live hardly gets any in the presidential election.","title":"The electoral college has becomea gun held to the head of US democracy"},{"text":"Im saying that Kamala is LOSING.

I wanted to know the original intent for the electoral college and how would could implement a new system while keeping the core intentions of the EC. However. It appears we lost the fucking plot ages ago and the listed intentions of the EC have overwhelmingly failed. The original purpose of the Electoral College was rooted in the Founding Fathers desire to create a system for selecting the president that balanced several competing goals. When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted in 1787, the Electoral College was intended to be a compromise between several factions with different concerns. These concerns shaped the design and intent of the Electoral College in the following ways:\\t1.\\tBalancing the Power of Large and Small States: The Founders wanted to create a system that ensured both large and small states had a role in electing the president. A direct popular vote would have given significant power to populous states, which smaller states feared could marginalize their influence. By giving each state a set number of electors based on its total representation in Congress (number of senators and representatives), the Electoral College aimed to balance the interests of states with varying populations.\\n\\t\\n2.\\tGuarding Against Uninformed Voting: The Founders were concerned about the general electorate not being fully informed or educated about candidates across the entire country. Given the limitations in communication and travel at the time, many voters would have only known about local or regional figures. The Electoral College was designed to have a body of electors who were expected to be knowledgeable and capable of making informed decisions on behalf of the citizens, theoretically selecting a president based on merit rather than popularity.\\n\\t\\n3.\\tProtecting Against Demagoguery and Factionalism: The Founders worried about a direct popular vote enabling a charismatic figure to manipulate public opinion and seize power. The Electoral College was intended as a buffer to protect against the rise of demagogues who could exploit popular passions. Electors were expected to exercise independent judgment and prevent the election of an unqualified or dangerous candidate.\\n\\t\\n4.\\tFederalism and State Sovereignty: The Electoral College also reflected the federal structure of the United States, in which states retained significant sovereignty. By giving states control over how electors are selected and allocating electors partly based on equal representation in the Senate (two per state), the system respected the states role in the federal union. The idea was to reinforce the balance between national and state power.\\n\\t\\n5.\\tCompromise on the Issue of Slavery: Though not often cited as a core intent, the Electoral College also helped protect the political interests of slaveholding states. The number of electors a state received was based on its population, which included three-fifths of the enslaved population (due to the Three-Fifths Compromise). This gave Southern states disproportionate influence in presidential elections compared to their voting population, as enslaved people could not vote but were counted toward representation.In summary, the Electoral College was designed to balance the influence of large and small states, guard against uninformed or impulsive voting, and protect the federal system by maintaining the role of states in the election process. It was intended to be a buffer that would ensure the election of a qualified candidate, while preventing direct, unchecked democracy from determining the presidency. However, many aspects of its original design have evolved over time, especially as electors today are largely bound by popular vote outcomes in their states.","title":"The electoral college has become a gun held to the head of US democracy"},{"text":"Why shouldn't children of age 13 and up be allowed to work in easy jobs like stock boy or dishwasher?","title":"Democrats Problem With Male Voters Isnt Complicated"},{"text":"Sorry, u/Rune_Rosen C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

I didnt. 2. https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/spring/lbj-and-white-backlash-1 He was the one to convince Nixon and republicans to abandon the civil rights movement. This is why I say kind of true. The Republican Party of today has an opposite view on civil rights than that of the 60s. So to use the fact republicans historically were the party of civil rights to vote for republicans today is silly as they dont believe the same thing. They believe the opposite.3. I dont know what you are refuting. I was talking about the role of government in our day to day life. Also, I wouldnt look at what people say but rather what they do.4. These policies like all policies have effects. Some positive and some negative. Just like all policies. See my point 3.5. Therea an issue with citing stories. The biggest issue is who is telling them, why are they telling them, and how large is their audience. I can tell you of thousands of stories of us veterans raping women in the places they visit. Does that mean it is a widespread issue? Bad things happen, but so do neutral things and good things. But if our news only shows us the bad, we dont get the full scope of what the issue truly is and how bad it is. I agree that I want more paths to citizenship. That is a very liberal perspective. Republicans tend to be very anti all immigration in their policies. Idk what you are talking about no vetting. Getting a visa in the US is extremely difficult do you the high volume of demand. As someone who deals with immigrants frequently, I can tell you that it isnt easy. 6. You are proving my point. How can I be happy for other people if Im not getting anything. I dont know what to tell you. You be happy for them. I dont need to gain something order to be fair for someone else. But if you look at who is trying to make college more affordable for everyone, its the democrats right now. 7. My opinion is it wasnt handled well. That is based on the facts of the situations. You argue opinions with facts.. thats how an argument holds. What you are talking about with the correction of the issues. It isnt so easy to correct. You could try to sue your parents for damages. It isnt the governments job to preemptively go in and solve your problem. For the PPP loan abuse. The republicans forgave the loans. You cant unforgive those loans. You cant go back on that. A lot of your points I agree with that there is a problem. The issue is that conservatives do not bring good solutions to those problems. They simply problematize. The pandemic is a great example of this. Covid was a problem that needed to be solved. You couldnt just complain. And the people in power during the first year really fucked it up. Because conservatives arent writing good policy. When they write okay policy democrats have been trying to get it passed and then it gets stopped ruined by conservatives ( for example the immigration bill, or Obamacare, or the stimulus plans). So for each of your problems with the current system, I want you to ask what truly caused those problems and how do we fix them and do your fixes cause other problems.For example we repeal Obamacare, now people with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare and the cost of insurance wont go down (why would it, its not like companies are gonna say we can take less money).Edits to fix some typos","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Op, Bro real talkYou realize Trump doesnt care about you, right?

It's okay to not be on a team at all, and simply assess each individual candidate based on how their election is likely to impact your life.  It's okay to recognize that neither \\"team\\" is a monolith, and accept that in some areas where one \\"team\\" is treated like a persecuted minority that they might well behave like a persecuted minority (and I've spent enough time in Alabama to know the lay of the political landscape there).The intentional decimation of critical thinking and rationality in education was in large part to produce voters acting on feelings (which are easily manipulated) rather than a more involved assessment of candidates and agendas, just like what you seem to be doing now.That aside, I will break down as much of the second half of your reply below as I can staying under 10k characters and try my hardest not to use a single insult in the process... Heres what I do know: Democrats tend to reach first for insults. You know that some people local to you do this.  You have generalized without just cause.  See above about teams. The Republican Party was the generally larger percentage who voted for the civil rights act(s) to be put into place whereas most democrats were often against it. Percentage is a misleading metric for this statement.In 1964, there were 67 Democrats and 33 Republicans in the Senate.  27 Republicans voted yes.  46 Democrats voted yes.  Percentage-wise, the Republicans may have been more in favor, but they could not have possibly passed the bill without massive support from Democrats.The Senate version voted on by the House of Representatives tells a similar tale.  153 out of 244 Democrats voted yes and 136 out of 171 Republicans did likewise.  Percentages again favor Republicans, but the bill would not have passed without majority Democratic support.Now, let's just look at votes from states who had seceded and formed the Confederacy, and most significantly impacted by desegregation...  In the Senate only 1 out of 21 Democrats voted yes, and 0 out of 1 Republicans voted yes, while in the House 8 out of 91 Democrats voted yes while 0 out of 11 Republicans voted yes (and 4 representatives voted \\"present\\" while 13 did not vote at all).  Among all other states, Democrats voted 145-8 in favor in the House and 45-1 in the Senate, while Republicans voted 136-24 in the House and 27-5 in the Senate.In other words... the Civil Rights Act was WILDLY unpopular in the South regardless of party, and Democrats in all regions were *more* likely to support it, with the \\"big picture\\" numbers distorted by the massive representation in the South by Democrats at the time.In fact, the Civil Rights Act was so wildly unpopular in the South that it caused significant reorganization of political parties, without actually changing the prevailing thoughts or beliefs of the electorate.  Many Democrats left their party in the South as fallout from the Civil Rights Act, as they saw more consistent opposition from Republicans in the region, and aligned their registration with the party which reflected their beliefs. The republican party was the one to abolish slavery. Parties are not static.  The Republican party of the 1860s is not the same party as the Republican party of 2024.  That is a sound byte with no substance.  See above about reorganization after the CRA due to dissatisfaction with stances on civil rights as an example. The democratic party wishes for more government involvement, which often has failed to work, excluding those whom are eligible. The current incarnation of the Democratic party believes that government can play a positive role in society.  Saying it wants \\"more government\\" is overly reductive.The current incarnation of the Republican party believes that government should play less of a role in society.These are philosophical differences in terms of how society manages itself.  \\"More government\\" usually means more regulations in common parlance, and regulations are generally reactive to actual negative behaviors.For example, a major river near me was *heavily* polluted by Dow Chemicals and others dumping all sorts of waste directly into it, and EPA regulations on dumping and waste disposal has finally allowed it to recover enough where it is deemed safe to swim or fish in (for almost 40 years it was completely inadvisable to swim or fish in this river due to the level of pollution).  \\"More government\\" saved the river, the ecosystem, and the local inhabitants from a lot of issues related to severe and ongoing pollution that would never have changed on its own, because the companies doing the dumping were doing what was rational for their bottom line without consideration to the broader impact. As a college student, Im not eligible for majority of these benefits but i hold the same economic need as those who can receive it. That doesn't make the benefits bad, but it does mean that you need to be looking for elected representatives who see and support your need.  Removing them from everyone doesn't help you any more than not being eligible for them at all doesn't help you.If you are truly as broke as you say, you should essentially be paying no taxes at the federal level.  If you are making enough to have to pay taxes and still struggling, you are in the same boat as millions of other Americans, and redistributing wealth to the wealthy (which is the main thing the combinations of eliminating social programs + cutting taxes accomplishes) will not make that situation any better. Social security is almost gone from stimulus checks put out that I never even received because there was no plan put into place to ensure the money that went to families didnt go to drinking and the like, yet my taxes get higher and Ive only been a tax-paying citizen for a year now. Stimulus checks did not kill Social Security, and I am confident beyond doubt that you cannot source a reputable study that demonstrates a causal link.Underfunding and demographics (e.g. size of generations) issues have had much more impact.Stimulus checks were not funded by tax revenue nor reallocation of Social Security funding, and instead by creation of new debt.  That debt may be an issue in the long run and contribute to our ability to fund Social Security, but Peter was not robbed to pay Paul directly.You have made value judgments on how the money was used.  The stimulus checks did exactly what they were supposed to do - stimulate economic activity.  Some of that activity may have been with restaurants, bars, breweries, distilleries, beer distributors, liquor stores, etc. but those are all businesses with employees who also buy things from many other businesses which are not directly involved in \\"vice\\" at all (e.g. metal fabricators who just take any profitable work).  Money flowing in the economy is what keeps it healthy and the stimulus checks helped ensure that the flow continued.Your taxes have gone up, btw, because the tax cuts under Trump had a built-in sunset for individuals.  The process by which the tax cuts were passed meant they had to be projected to be revenue neutral over 10 years, so they were designed such that the corporate rate was permanently reduced and the individual rate would gradually increase so that net tax revenue would be the same.  Trump literally sold you out to cut corporate taxes, and did it in a way where most of the pain would land when someone else could be blamed (and your taxes would have gone up just the same if he'd won in 2020, the worst of the increases come in 2025-2027 when Trump could not have been president if he'd won a 2nd term). Illegal immigrants come in all the time and I live in genuine fear due to the amount of issues Ive seen arise from it; people who are not vetted have killed college students,Funny that you say this, as visa over-stay, including educational visas, is the largest source of illegal immigration, not border crossings.  In fact, our previous First Lady overstayed a visa and was an illegal immigrant before getting her green card.  Go figure.There is no data whatsoever to indicate that violent crime, particularly against college students, is being committed at a rate which is statistically significantly higher by illegal immigrants.  Most violence against college students comes from other college students or the people in the immediate vicinity of the college (with the distribution being far more influenced by proximity than demographics). just like me, and these same people get benefits that I will never receive when I am currently starving, making it on a scholarship of all things, and $2 in my bank account. You feel an unfairness that can and perhaps should be addressed, but you are misplacing blame for it.  You should be asking yourself why you cannot get those benefits and who would champion such benefits on your behalf, rather than who else is getting them and whether they \\"deserve\\" them.  I already addressed this in some length above.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"This bullshit complaint is more about priming his fans to claim the election is invalid.

Even though King and other Civil Rights leaders managed to rally Christian pastors to their side, the acrimony between Christians over racial segregation and the movement to destroy it underscored political tensions that were already creating schisms within American congregations. If progressive-minded Christians are divided about combining religion and politics, those on the Christian Right have far less compunction over imposing their beliefs on others as a matter of public policy, claiming that America is and should be a Christian nation-state.\\n**\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1g6jfb0/a_corruption_of_what_it_means_to_be_christian/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \\"Version 2.02, ~695203 tl;drs so far.\\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \\"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Christian**^#1 **church**^#2 **evangelical**^#3 **right**^#4 **Jesus**^#5","title":"\\"A corruption of what it means to be Christian\\": Liberal pastors challenge Christianity's MAGA turn"},{"text":"The concepts of cash...","title":"Bret Baier Says He 'Made a Mistake' after Kamala Harris called him out for deceptively editing video during Fox interview"},{"text":"If people cared about policy, the guy proposing 2000% tariffs would be losing in a landslide.

That is very much anecdotal, and we see that Kamala and the left have come up with a new insult outside of the norm (thats funny and valid for both parties), and to claim to judge those people when you have no inside information is just as odd. https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/30/republicans-weird/2. Its not kind of true, it is true, however the party did change and I concede that. I dont like the gerrymander in the south, either, mind you. What specific policies did Barry Goldwater use that were, as you say, secretly racist? https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/17/fact-check-more-republicans-voted-for-the-civil-rights-act-as-a-percentage-than-democrats-did/amp/3. From the GOPs own website under the About Our Party section: Republicans believe in liberty, economic prosperity, preserving American values and traditions, and restoring the American dream for every citizen of this great nation. As a party, we support policies that seek to achieve those goals. Our platform is centered on stimulating economic growth for all Americans, protecting constitutionally-guaranteed freedoms, ensuring the integrity of our elections, and maintaining our national security. We are working to preserve Americas greatness for our children and grandchildren. The Democratic partys website in the same area does not state safety whatsoever except when it comes to guns, nor does it look to anything in regards of economic growth, nor do they state integrity of elections at all. From that alone, we can see that the Republican party holds many of the same beliefs.4. Many of the policies regarding energy conservation by the Democratic party only hurt individuals across the board, such as Obamas policies on climate change. It was until Trump came into office that things changed, lowering prices on energy and the like.5. The study mentioned in regard to immigration is from 2012-2018, in Texas alone. Given that many changes have been far more recent, using older studies isnt going to do much when it has also been found that illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarceratedthere have been continuous stories of illegal immigrants arrested and later released far too often, from other immigrants and the like. Thus, how can we determine if they REALLY arent doing as much if they are systematically not incarcerated, or convicted? I know that not every immigrant is good or bad automatically, my issue is that there werent steps taken to instead provide a better way towards legal immigration if individuals served our country or worked in jobs that are deemed essential such as healthcare and the like. Instead, no vetting is done and simply anyone can come in, which is a misdemeanor in itself.6. I have to disagree, as the party who is meant to help everyone, I havent seen anything regard economics which, well, helps everyone. How can I be asked to be happy for others getting help when Ive not seen active effort made to help individuals like myself? 7. If its an opinion, then how can you use that to argue the fact that it was abused by individuals, never corrected, never fixed, and has now screwed up things for my generation?","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Expanding the house would be great, but any laws they pass would still need to be signed off by the Senate before they go to the President.","title":"The electoral college has become a gun held to the head of US democracy"},{"text":"A widdle woman hurt his feelings","title":"Trump says Harris should be forced off campaign, wants Biden back"},{"text":"I think the headline is over the top, but that video wasnt great. ?The Detroit lines funny, but Mary Catherine Gallagher? ?An SNL character that hasnt been out there for basically 25 years? ?Poor strategic choice.","title":"WTF, Cringeworthy, Historically Bad, Kamala Harriss Al Smith Dinner Video Performance Mercilessly Mocked"},{"text":"Sorry, u/km3r C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

When I ask why minority rule is what they want and point out that because the senate is the way it is a minority of voters can vote in a majority of representatives and therefore have minority rule I basically get a nuh-uh response. I don't say that to be derisive, it is just they refuse to accept the fact that a minority of voters can run the senate and the white house because of how the senators are elected and how electoral college works. The house is somewhat more equal, but not entirely either. A minority of voters can hold the senate the white house and if the house rolls a certain way all three branches. At any rate the votes from low population states are worth more and that is minority rule. I will ask them why they prefer a required super majority to prevent minority rule or conversely why gridlock is better with a minority of voters preventing the majority from governing and they just say that isn't what happens, and again they will talk about protecting the voices of the minority. I can always only take away from these conversations that they mean if they can't have it their way no one gets anything? Again I am just coldly trying to understand the logic. But the feeling is one of they don't see the entire picture?

Biden's administration would need to make a finding of war crimes in order *not* to send weapons to Israel, and that finding has to be done through a prescribed procedure. Given the current Republican-dominated Supreme Court, that had better be fucking iron clad. Kamala and Biden both need to rhetorically express support for Israel in getting back the hostages that were taken by Hamas when it also murdered over a thousand Israelis (you and a lot of people on this website seem to forget about that somehow) while also pushing back on the Israeli government's crimes against Palestine in order to have a prayer of accomplishing anything diplomatically. The Left has had a critique that applies broadly in international relations that I agree with: if you set yourself as an implacable enemy of a group of people or a government - imposing embargoes on Cuba for instance - you strengthen rather than weaken the hand of their  government. Much of the Left does not seem to want to apply this logic to Israel for some reason.As for Israel being our dog, that's bullshit and basically just Iranian propaganda. Bibi Netanyahu literally campaigned for Donald Trump in 2020, so the notion that Joe Bidnen or Kamala Harris can just snap their fingers and he'll do what they want is silly.

Democrats tend to reach for insults first - what is this based on? It sounds anecdotal. If you look at Trumps rhetoric, I wouldnt say that Kamala is reaching for insults first. If you are talking about your general conversations with people, I would say that you probably arent talking with nice people.   2. The republicans were the party that voted for the civil rights act. This is kind of true but doesnt grasp the change in the political landscape. In the 1970s and 80s, republicans changed their strategy to begin trying to court the south. This was championed by Barry Goldwater. Basically he enacted policies and tried to enact policies that were secretly racist. This led to the black vote abandoning him but what he found is that the southern states loved him. This led to republicans trying to win over a till region rather than on political policies. So when we look before this time happened, what you will see is that representatives, both democrats and republicans, did what the name said. They represented their constituents. But after the shift in the Republican Party, it became that the republicans represent southern and rural styles of politics and democrats represent more urban style of politics.   So long story short. At the start of the civil rights movement, republicans did have a higher percentage of people voting in favor but this was because in the time, there were more republicans in the north and more democrats in the south. The south has never and still to this day has never when looking at white voters, championed civil rights.  So no the values of the current Republican Party would not align with the civil rights act of 64 and the Republican Party was notorious for shutting down civil rights policies after the 70s and 80s.   3. The idea that government intervention has failed to work is just not true. This is another conservative talking point with little to no meaning. What does this mean? Are you saying that broadly the government has done a bad job? I would argue that 90% of what the federal government does, you are happy with. Do you like the post office? So you like interstate travel? Do you like buying things on Amazon and having them shipped to you? Do you like flying in planes? Do you like trusting the food you eat at the store? Do you like that every kid has the opportunity for free education (even if that system isnt perfect, we can hopefully agree that it is better than not having school for anybody but wealthy people),  Etc., your life is full of federal government intervention. That makes your life better and is functional. But, there is stuff the federal government gets involved in that doesnt work out  that well. From both sides of the aisle. Lets look at the Iraq war. We can look at Citzens United. We can look at the recent surge of immigration. This doesnt mean thats when the government gets involved things are worse, it means people make mistakes on extremely complicated issues. The government is not an object, it is a collective of people.  4. We can talk immigration but it is messy. True things that I hope we can see eye to eye on. Not all immigrants are the same and not all illegal immigrants are the same. Historically, immigrants have done less crime than citizens. But there is a huge issue with cartels in northern Mexico. And it has been getting worse. And that has led to a rise in violent crimes amongst illegal immigrants. This is something that both parties see. The issue is what to do about it. By increasing certain policies and putting a tighter hold on the border, what we see is that it tends to hurt the immigrants that are in need of help and doesnt really effect the cartel based activities in the south. By keeping the border loose, it allows more people in who need help but really fucks up our entire system due to a volume issue. Every action we do send to simply reshape the issue instead of solve it. Its messy.   4. The economy and feeling the pinch. We all feel it right now. Its rough. In terms of school, I also had to part for college on my own and similarly my parents couldnt afford to help me but also made too much where I didnt get need based scholarships. There is a flaw in the system for people in these situations. But that doesnt mean there is a flaw in the system for other people. There is more to going to school than just the cost as well. There is societal pressure to not go to college in certain communities. Sometimes school takes you away from everyone who looks like you and the people who act like you. So while you are 100% correct on that there is a huge issue specifically in middle to lower class people going to college, if someone else is being prioritized, that is good for them. And we can be happy for them. So the question is how do we fix our problem without hurting them. Regarding the stimulus checks, they were not handled correctly. Nor were the PPP loans. But if you are looking politically, they werent handled well because we didnt have someone in office who knew how to serve the public. Thats of course an opinion but when a pandemic is happening, we need unified leadership. And we got division. Remember that Trump ran all of the executive branch. He has oversight over the cdc, over the nih. And he fought with them. You dont fight with your employees in the midst of an emergency. I know this was long but I do hope you read it. This is how I, a pretty strong leftist (I would not call myself a liberal) feels.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"survivedYeaaaaa not a good argument","title":"Voters wont thank Kamala Harris for the state of the economy | Why voters are down on Americas remarkable economy"},{"text":"Everything they're saying about the other side is just projection.","title":"Bret Baier Says He Made A Mistake In Kamala Harris Interview, Played Wrong Trump Clip"},{"text":"And like the Black Knight, they declare victory after being left in tatters.","title":"Bret Baier Blasted for Embarrassing Kamala Harris Interview"},{"text":"Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Healthy debates/interviews normally thrive on that kind of shit, and it's also why when you sometimes have moderation in the mix that the moderators also need to keep a basic rule like that in check.Interrupting them, cutting in without excusing yourself, not letting them have a chance to provide you with material to address...this is playground level arguing.

[In an interview aired Sunday on Fox News CHANNEL](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-suggests-hell-use-the-military-on-the-enemy-from-within-the-u-s-if-hes-reelected), Trump was asked about the potential of \\"outside agitators\\" disrupting Election Day and he then pivoted to what he called \\"the enemy from within.\\"\\"I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,\\" Trump said. He added: \\"We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they're the big  and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.\\"Trump has repeatedly invoked the phrase \\"enemy from within\\" in recent speeches.

For starters, we dont understand how anyone can even look at Kamala Harris as anything other than a joke, and we also dont understand why anyone would consider voting for a woman who never achieved anything on her own merit. She has always been a D.E.I. hire, throughout her entire career. So basically, we dont understand you for supporting Kamala anymore than you understand us for supporting Trump. However, that doesnt answer your question entirely. I, along with many are voting for Trump because we dont like the way our country has been going for the past four years. If you work for a living, you must have been to the grocery store, and you must have been to the gas station, so you must have felt the same pain we feel. \\n   Most importantly, we are voting for Trump because we are voting against the following; \\n Open boarders\\n Prioritizing illegals over the American people\\n Prioritizing other countries over America\\n The rise of crime and the unwillingness to prosecute minorities \\n The weaponization of our justice system to attack political opponents \\n The failing Board of Education \\n The lack of respect for our flag and our nation\\n The teaching of Critical Race Theory in our schools\\n The teaching of homosexuality and promoting the philosophy of multiple genders to children\\n D.E.I. hiring practices\\n Gun confiscations\\n Abortion\\n   Donald Trump has been viscously and venomously attacked politically and in the mainstream media. We have seen biased debate moderators resort to rigging debates by favoring one party and attacking the other. We have seen Attorney Generals selectively target and prosecute Trump for total and utter nonsense, in hopes of keeping him out of the running. We have even seen the extended use of buzz words and dog whistles, terms like Threat to Democracy , and Hes a danger to our future in hopes of inciting assignation attempts on his life. Politics is a dirty game, and We the People are beginning to understand the depths career politicians will sink to so they can remain in their highly coveted positions of money and power. \\n  So basically, we, the vile and deplorable Trump supporters, are hoping that President Trump gets re-elected, so that he can give our nations capital the long-overdue enema it desperately needs.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"Obviously the same way videos of police letting people into the capitol on Jan 6th proves it was peaceful.","title":"Bret Baier Says He Made A Mistake In Kamala Harris Interview, Played Wrong Trump Clip"},{"text":"I was forced to watch that clown show pretending to be news in the VA on several occasions.

Didn't like how Reagan then Bush 2x supported dictators. Attended their rallies and followed them when I was overseas. Up to Obama was leaning Dems. Watching Trump vs Hillary softened me against Trump personally but I still leaned D. Just didnt like the old GOP.I have degrees in economics, management and background in biotech, IT, law and finance. (Confuse-an)?? I became a whistleblower in one of the countries I lived. So when Trump started penalizing China and Iran in trade through tariffs, I read about all the world's top economist say it wouldn't work. I saw with my own eyes and from industry friends how China and Iran shifted their products through SEA just to circumvent the Trump policies. I saw them bleed and ultimately support the DEMS.\\nThis is how I got to feel good about Trump and started following his policies and actions including raising up the Brent price of oil slightly (though still 1/2 of today's prices) to save the mostly CALIFORNIAN OIL industry (even though that state is blue).I saw how Trump pumped aid to NJ despite fat governor's hate for him and the Cali forest fires with Gov Newscum.I saw how dictators grudgingly respected and feared Trump while assasinated PM Abe (especially), The Saudis, and other Arabs built a great friendship with Trump.I saw how the Media and many of my friends started censoring views similar to mine and I knew these were the very same people who ENABLED the DICTATORS I swore to fight.I saw how the \`hawks / neocons' eg John Bolton, Romney tried to derail Trump. Despite being conned by Bolton and even Fauci, Trump learned from his mistakee and evolved and my admiration grew.I saw how Trump earned the respect of Dr Ben Carson (the original front runner of the 2016 Rep party who Jeb Bush undermined) and how it blossommed into a deep friendship and trust.During the elections and after, I followed the US process as it was the same in countries where smartmatic was involved and saw an alarming trend of vote machine \\"reprogramming\\" I saw that the deep state, the neocons, the RINOs and Dem elite all of whom I blamed for supporting tyrants all over the world, hated Trump. I liked him more for that.Thereafter and after the \\"big steal\\", I learned about Rand Paul (his Dad) and their fight against globalist oppressive policies eg., Davos and Basel Agreements and the Covid plandemic. I watched the congressional hearings. My belief and faith in Trump and the moderate Reps like Sen Paul, Chip Roy grew stronger knowing they were right most of the time.I've followed Tulsi and RFK Jr because of their stance against war and the military industrial complex which victimized one of the countries I lived in. They're recent support of President Trump made me confident more than ever that Trump is a president who will bring peace to the world, fight against the while making America GOOD again.The repeated assassination attempts only vindicated to me that the, mean-tweeting, oft-vile, brutally-frank, name-calling, trolling, big-talking, orange man has evolved (just like the few great men called by fate) into America's and the world's great orange hope.Those that pander, suck up, suck on their knees ? (you know what we mean) never do lead us up, rather they lesd us down to the cliffs.There are FEW born leaders, the great many are shaped by the world around them, while FEWER get to survive assassinations and countless obstacles to lead us.This man Trump is chosen not because of his faults and weaknesses (which are many), but because of his character under fire, his consistent vision of the future (his vision and statements have not much changed sinde he was young), and his sacrifices along the way.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"That's fair.","title":"Kamala Harris \\"totally schooled\\" Bret Baier on Fox NewsRepublican"},{"text":"If anything, Id say Democrats tend to be *too* concerned with the votes of a very small pool of undecided moderates.

Mobilizing the base is more important than shifting right to capture a demographic that grows smaller each day.

I am voting for Trump due to his Economic policies, boarder policy, addressing homelessness policy, foreign policy, energy policy, boarder policy to name a few. Harris appears incapable to even provide the slightest bit of real information beyond platitudes. The policies she had attempted to articulate seem very weak and soft with little substance. Harris has had almost 4 years in office and had taken full responsibility for the current administrations actions which have gotten this country in a bad situation. Rather than distance herself from the Biden administration she has double down on taking ownership of this administration and I don't believe our country can withstand 4 more years of a continuation of these reckless war mongering open boarder, economic killing policies. Whatever numbers the media is going off of are heavily skewed because I don't know anyone who is not struggling badly right now yet they will say we are having a booming economy and things have never been better. I don't like being treated as though I'm an idiot I can look around and see that things are not good right now. We went from America ending conflicts and seeing a degree of peace we hadn't seen in modern times to wars breaking out all over the globe. Prices going through the roof on nearly everything, an atrocious energy policy that rather than making us energy independent has made us severely dependent on other nations. A total lack of respect for America on the world stage as a leader but rather being looked at as weak and vulnerable. We are losing control of the dollar as the world currency and the BRICS nations are poised to step in and fill that leadership role across the world stage. This would spell disaster for America on so many levels and the implications are unthinkable frankly. Bottom line I can't trust Harris I believe her to be fake and just a puppet for her party bosses. Joe Biden was unceremoniously knocked out of his rightful place as the candidate in which I may have voted for Joe Biden again and given him the chance to fix the issues that his administration has not done well on but Kamala Harris is a snake who stuck a knife in her bosses back to take his position and is untrustworthy. Her teak record as a DA and AG are abysmal at best and abhorrent in many circumstances. Imprisoning over 1500 black men for low level Marijuana charges. Advocating to extend prison sentences to gain cheap labor longer, withholding evidence that would have set a man free from deathrow. She is advocating for prisoners to receive gender affirming care including sexual reassignment surgery while in prison on the dime of the taxpayers. If you want to transition by all means do what is best for you but I should not be forced to pay for it because you are incarcerated. Her stances on fracking, boarder control, foreign affairs, gun control, economic development are all very structurely very weak and thin at best. I think she would drive this country into the ground beyond our ability to recover if she were elected. Donald Trump had very few if any likeable personnel traits. I find him to be very off putting to say the least but I'm not voting for my President to be my drinking buddy. He is effective and capable and has proven that over his previous 4 years in office. I'm far more concerned with capability than his likeability. That is where my fellow liberals get it wrong they can't get past their personal feelings of disdane for Trump and so they are blinded to say anyone but Trump. Their personal hatred runs so deep they are willing to sacrifice the future of this country and the lives of future generations just to ensure Trump isn't elected again. To me that is the most undemocratic, unconstitutional, un-American thing someone can do. You have to put your personal feelings aside and cast a vote that is best for the country regardless of how much you may dislike someones personality. Trump is an asshole and very unlikeable. I wholeheartedly dislike him as a person but he is effective and my life as were many others lives significantly better under his administration. An administration that was constantly embroiled in a battle against democrats that opposed him from day 1 and set out to derail his Presidency with shit like fake Russian dossiers and? bullshit impeachment precedings. All meant to attempt to lesson his administrations effectiveness. Yet despite all that his administration made amazing accomplishments. Imagine what could have been done of selfish democrats had tried to work together for the betterment of the country. It's what has driven me away from my party. My family has voted Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt but I will break that legacy this November for the betterment of my country and so will my parents and so will my 5 siblings.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"lol your source is a woman who tracked a different person down to prove the story correct?

Just something simple like \\"no ban before ~14 weeks, no abortions at all after viability except to save the mother's life, and any baby born alive, regardless of method, can not be left to die\\".States could tweak from there, but that would shut down the horror stories that are 0.001% of all abortions, AND stop the actual horror stories that can happen with the (effectively) no-exceptions bans.

Raphael Warnock and Katie Hobbs \\n also overperformed their polling, which showed them to be down to their opponents at times as well. On the flip side of things, democrats literally lost control of the House of Representatives because they lost what they thought were easily winnable seats in New York and New York suburbs(IE the George santos district). Democrats are currently fighting to win those seats back, but polling suggests that things arent looking good for them up there.Ron desantis has done a shit ton in Florida to turn that state deep red. Everything from purging voter rolls to their nonstop propaganda fed to Cubans and Cuban Americans. He also managed to successfully sell the state of Florida to many people as some sort of beacon of freedom during Covid, which resulted in millions of people fleeing to that state of the past few years in search of this freedom (only to be met with hurricanes and extremely expensive property insurance if they can even get any at all). Theres something like 1 million more registered republicans in the state of Florida than democrats. This resulted in Ron Desantis beating his Democratic challenger for reelection by nearly 20 points after winning his first race by just 33,000 votes. If Trump wins the state anywhere near that.

The economy: Under Trump the economy was so much better it's not even comparable. 79% of Americans surveyed said they were better off 4 years ago, i.e. in the middle of COVID too. 2. Taxes: Kamala will never be able to increase the taxes of the rich, because if she could, then Obama and Biden could have done it, as they also campaigned on high corporate and taxes on the rich too. 3 Tariffs over Taxes - Dems will say that the tariffs are going to increase prices on the American consumer to pass the costs along to the customer. Can I ask, what the fuck do Dems thing will happen with prices if the corporate tax rates are increased. Taxes will be harder to avoid then a very simple ultimatum: *Manufacture in the US* *and no tariffs, 15% flat tax.* Here is the secret to this, Trump/Vance will be in office for 4 years at least, do you (rhetorical you) believe that any company will pay 100/200% tariffs for 4 years, regardless of price pushdown? It's just not realistic.4. Immigration: Donald Trump wants immigrants, he wants migrants, but for FFS he wants people that will contribute to society. There will no longer be a blanket policy on letting anybody walk into the country. You have a criminal record? Stay the fuck out. I ask you a favor OP, please tell me as a Democrat would you leave the front door of your home open 24/7 and allow anyone in your house regardless of who they are, and let them stay indefinite period of time, not contribute to your household, oh and they happen to have a couple of felonious notches on their belt. DJT is not against migrants and immigrants, it was acknowledged no less than two times this week, we need immigration, we need migrant workers, but for FFS come with papers, come here legally, join our tax base, and make a path to citizenship if that is what is wanted. 5. Immigration Part 2: KH and the Dems have been trying to provide blanket amnesty to people in this country illegally, without vetting them, KH and the Dems have been importing people from 3rd world countries regardless of their backgrounds, they are literally (yes literally) flying them in planes into heartland towns across the red and purple states. WTF, that is some nefarious shit, give people a new life, they'll vote for your party forever. Sounds very Tammany Hall, some shit never changes with politics. 6. Honesty: There is no way that a person who has done their homework, has watched multiple Trump events and multiple KH events, can say that Kamala is capable of this job. She cannot speak off script, when pressed she goes into the nervous laughing, even with that pause and help she cannot come back and say anything of value. Wednesday night 8-millioni people tuned into KH's interview with Fox, if you have not seen it, you need to, I think you will see what I mean about her being dishonest. Her background, including her book are all fabricated.7. Democracy in a Constitutional Republic - In our country we have a system for selecting our presidential candidates, it requires that the will of the people of America be expressed. Biden received 14m votes from the people. KH has never earned a single national vote, think about it, how can the DNC just appoint her heir apparent to the throne. Doesn't it bother you that this election is being fed to you? In April 2024 would you have voted for KH if she said she was entering the primary? If so I have to ask why, she was rated the *Worst VP In History* and had an approval rate of 38%. For real, the pundits were discussing if JB should have dropped her from the ticket. 8. Trump Derangement Syndrome - KH spends more time in her rallies spreading bullshit about Trump than she does speaking about her own policies. She spent 11-minutes of her interview on Fox talking about Trump. She had a chance to sell herself to the Fox News audience and all she did was say \\"orange man is bad\\".9. Imposter Syndrome: KH knows this, we know this, she's an imposter. She has no platform of her own, she is seriously using Joe Biden's policies, all they did is swap some text for her, the source code was reviewed and confirmed the copy-and-paste. So, if she's running on someone else's agenda, but is saying something different at rallies, what are you getting if she's elected? I try to ask this question respectfully to Dems and I have yet to get an answer besides: she didn't have enough time to create her own. Well, that tells me as a presidential candidate she's not prepared for swift critical thinking, sorry uh... what. Not my president.  \\nI have several more reasons but it time to go work out. If you are serious about discussing this more, I would love to have that conversation in a respectful non-trolling way. The only thing I ask back is think about what I wrote, consider it, and maybe share it with someone you know.

Why keep infantilizing the Gazans? You clearly see that the Palestinians wish to continue the war if they're willing to keep 101 innocent hostages among them instead of giving them back and end their suffering.You need to ask yourself these completely legitimate questions and seek legitimate answers, because the Palestinians finally have a way out of this war now that Sinwar is taken out.","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"Most far right zealots will vote for Republicans, that doesnt mean that Trump align entirely with their views.

In this comparison, the latter would be preferred because more people who need the aid actually receive aid, even if it means some people who dont need it get some extra benefit.  The Dems tend to  believe leaving a needy person out is seen as the greater sin, rather than letting a wealthy person in.

There's a thread on r/books on gendered reading and a lot of the comments are about how older men in their life are reading books they \\"refused\\" to read as children because they were \\"for girls\\". The comments sound generally supportive but still seem condescending towards choosing to do so now rather than as a child, and I don't know that's really fair or productive.I don't see why they aren't given the benefit of not having had the agency or influence and also of having to overcome a strong stigma and barriers to buy or check out the books including a lack of adults recommending it and the social stigma against it including from adults especially the ones that would have been taking you, buying you, checking out for you, discussing with you at school or home, etc.Like I doubt if mom and dad or whatever adult weren't allowing or supporting Mary to read *The Call of the Wild* or *The Red Badge of Courage*, they weren't going to buy or support Peter reading *Anne of Green Gables* or *Little House on the Prairie* either. And if Mary didn't want to or couldn't read them due to social stigma back then, it wouldn't be framed as she \\"refused\\" to read them back then even if the books had been technically available to all if that makes sense, but I don't like relying on tit-for-tat hypotheticals like that, if you will. And if their interests just changed as an adult or they overcame an insecurity about or discovered a new interest that was socially atypical during their youth, why denigrate them at all or frame them as the responsible party in youth who only realized they were wrong now instead of celebrate they learned or grew and felt able to do so.Also, they are talking about it as if that was in the past and doesn't occur today, but the same behavior is still the standard normal or widely common for everyone today, even if softened slightly. But we still start out selecting colors to celebrate births from the baby's parts, kids are influenced to choose hobbies by gender, and it still wouldn't be uncommon for Mary or Peter to be steered towards or away and possibly denigrated for choosing to read the same books.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"And here is the worlds tiniest violin ?? to play your sad exit music to Rafael oh sorry he likes to go by his Americanized name Ted","title":"Ted Cruz says he's getting no help from national Republicans in tight race against Colin Allred"},{"text":"The VP is the tie breaker vote in the Senate.

Voters are more likely to trust Trump over economics and the border (I still cant believe border security is being touted as an ACTUAL issue in 2024) because Republicans pretend to be for the working class despite never doing anything for them and in fact doing things against their best interest. Trump blocked a bipartisan (right-wing) border bill because he wanted to use the crisis as a campaign point for 2024. Trumps deregulation policies have benefitted big businesses, but have led to over 50 grocery recalls, repeated train derailments, and the explosion of a chemical plant in Georgiaand thats just naming what I remember off the top of my head. Despite that, nothing has gotten cheaper for consumers, and Republican efforts have ensured that there is less money in the pockets of working class people.But none of that matters.It doesnt matter that hes a nepo-baby who flaunts his wealth and looks down on working class people who are immediately put in service of him. It doesnt matter that his refusal to meaningfully meet BLM protesters in the middle led to untold, unregulated, and largely unpunished oversteps in police authority that trampled over 1st Amendment Rights. It doesnt matter that his inept response to COVID-19 is responsible for the deaths of millions of Americans. It doesnt matter than his presidency led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the immediate loss of security for women across the country. It doesnt matter that he tried to seize control of the country after losing in 2020 by stoking the flames of a riot against the Capital, leading to his own supporters attacking police and some being killed in turn. It doesnt matter that hes a rapist who has a strange fascination with his own daughter. It doesnt matter that hes being supported by the literal KKK. It doesnt matter that his rhetoric is leading to people attacking FEMA workers trying to provide aid to areas devastated by natural disasters. It doesnt matter that hes a whiny, short-tempered, thin-skinned egomaniac who folds at the mention of his unimpressive rally attendancewhich he constantly lies about. It doesnt matter that Trumps presidency has led to more American deaths than the Civil War.You could name any issue, repeat verbatim the terrible things Trump has said, point to obvious signs in his declining mental faculties, show how his presidency makes us an embarrassment on the global stagenone of that matters. You know why?Undecided voters trust men to protect them more than they trust women to do the same. They trust men more with money than women. And most importantly, its easier for the average voter to imagine someone who looks and sounds like Trump getting a beer with them at their local bar. Someone they feel comfortable saying a slur with casually and not getting flack over itthe kinda person who will enable the worst parts of themselves and assure them that its okay theyre like that. The kinda person they see themselves having unbridled fun with.Thats all that really matters to them.Undecided voters dont have reasons to be undecided. They have feelingsfeelings rooted in a complete detachment from the system and those whose lives depend on it not being out to kill them. Theyre convinced that theyll be fine either way, and anyone outside of their scope is a non-factor. Theyre wrong, obviously, but that doesnt matter to them. They want to hold onto the things they think are theirsthe things that they think make them *them* and anything that threatens to change any of it is immediately suspicious. Trump promises to root out evil but what he represents to undecideds is the promise that nothing will change for them. Harriss more progressive elements suggest changethe Democratic Party, though insanely moderate and willing to capitulate to even the most extremist of Republican beliefsclearly wants the country to grow and develop. That requires change. It means more stories in TV  centering the narratives of marginalized people theyve never had to consider. It means the answering machines for their banks will offer instruction in more languages, making it take longer to get through it. It means a restaurant might open up near them with signs that dont entirely use the English Alphabet. It means they may need a service worker to repeat themselves constantly due to the thickness of their accent. It means their niece who lives out of state might come out of the closet on Facebook, leaving them unsure of what to say but feeling compelled to say something. It means their employers might pressure them to include their pronouns in their email correspondence. It means an athlete for a sport they dont even engage with mightve had testicles at some point. It means they may need to be more careful about the jokes they make at work or in public.All these little, benign things that really arent a big deal stress these people out enough to consider Trump over Harris.What are you even supposed to do to move people like that?","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"I said there's no point in discussion if you refuse to not lie.","title":"Bret Baier Says He Made A Mistake In Kamala Harris Interview, Played Wrong Trump Clip"},{"text":"Steal?

The apology is a wound-licking effort by Murdoch &amp; Co to smooth over the damage done in the face of a plausible blue wave. * In an alternate scenario where Baier somehow intended to air the right clip (his lead up context clearly shows otherwise), it's plausible that staff behind the scenes intervened for an \\"oops!\\" moment.

Trump made and why he should be re-elected.  Within all of those pages I had various links to video evidence of when he signed bills and every piece of evidence that one could even imagine that proved his accomplishments.  I made attempts at talking to individuals that were on the left.  I just could not believe that hostility, hatred, anger, denial, and lies that came forth from them.  Many of them were animal lovers so I decided to highlight that.  Donald J Trump signed into law a bill that made it a felony to deliberately harm an animal.  I went with that.  I had the video loaded up on my Chromebook of him signing the bill and the bill itself and set forth.  I was told by every single Democrat I encountered that it was phony video, that the bill was phony and the government website was phony and that Obama made it a felony!  The individuals were not making this up but the party was making it up.

And even if you lowball their figures, the numbers are still substantial.I already explained to you that the difficulty of identifying militants is due to the war crimes of Hamas, because they fail to uphold the principle of distinction - that means their militants operate in civilian areas wearing civilian clothes. If that war crime leads to the misidentification of a genuine civilian as a Hamas militant, the legal and ethical responsibility of their death is on Hamas, not Israel. I call bullshit on the sole ethical responsibility.

Israel is showing a disregard for this that's staining it's reputation with the rest of the world.As is always the case in this conflict, the reality is the exact opposite of what the Russo-Iranian propaganda machine pushes. They claim that Israel deliberately targets (non-militant) children, however in one of the Wikipedia articles you referenced in another comment, IDF evidence is laid out for Hamas militarisation of children in Gaza (another war crime), showing that the IDF are aware of children being used as military scouts who report intel to Hamas (among other things), and yet despite this: An IDF officer said that the IDF will not shoot or pursuit children that unusually appear in the battlefield.Well, the numbers show a lot of the kids are getting shot *now*.Does Hamas using child recruitment make it OK to kill radicalized kids?","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"Taking accountability for her administrations failures would be a start","title":"Fox Interview Did to Harris What the Debate Did to Biden"},{"text":"Idk bro sounds like you hate women and minorities.

Their agencies and missions operating in the region have been proven to be compromised - UNRWA employed Hamas militants and commanders as teachers and presided over the systematic indoctrination of Palestinian children with extreme antisemitism to ensure their forever-war continues with the next generation, while UNIFIL selectively enforced the mandates of Resolution 1701 by not securing the Israeli-Lebanese border and pushing Hezbollah back past the Litani, which should have been one of their primary goals since 2006. The UN special rapporteurs also continually rely on the words of Palestinian as their sole evidence of Israeli war crimes, calling for international action against Israel as if those unproven allegations were established facts, meanwhile they fail to report on or make similar calls for international action in support of Israel even when the IDF releases photo and video evidence corroborating their own allegations of war crimes from the other side. The UN has been extremely foolish in operating with clear double standards and biases like these, as the resulting loss of credibility undermines the effectiveness of their one-sided actions anyway. If they had at least maintained an illusion of impartiality, then perhaps their claims would be less suspect, but as it stands they cannot merely be assumed as a credible source, and can only be taken at their word if they present unequivocal evidence supporting their allegations. The IDF has very loose terms on what they consider a militant in regards to casualty numbers. If you run off of IDF and UN numbers, Israel claims almost every man killed in Gaza was a militant.I dont think you have any idea how Israeli intelligence identifies military targets, but regardless, I already explained to you that the difficulty of identifying militants is due to the war crimes of Hamas, because they fail to uphold the principle of distinction - that means their militants operate in civilian areas wearing civilian clothes. If that war crime leads to the misidentification of a genuine civilian as a Hamas militant, the legal and ethical responsibility of their death is on Hamas, not Israel. As is always the case in this conflict, the reality is the exact opposite of what the Russo-Iranian propaganda machine pushes. They claim that Israel deliberately targets (non-militant) children, however in [one of the Wikipedia articles you referenced in another comment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war_on_children_in_the_Gaza_Strip#Israeli_allegations_of_child_use_by_Hamas_and_PIJ), IDF evidence is laid out for Hamas militarisation of children in Gaza (another war crime), showing that the IDF are aware of children being used as military scouts who report intel to Hamas (among other things), and yet despite this: An IDF officer said that the IDF will not shoot or pursuit children that unusually appear in the battlefield.Meaning that Israel doesnt even deliberately target the children *identified as Hamas scouts* (ie militants), let alone children who arent running around active combat areas looking for actionable military intel for Hamas.Now Israel, on the other hand, *do* uphold the principle of distinction, so their soldiers are easily identifiable during all military activities - but Hamas responds by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians anyway, at every chance they get (another war crime).The two sides of this war are not the same.","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"That point has been defined as the return of all hostages, dead or alive.Until that happens, Israel will not stop, and it's up to Hamas/Palestinians to do that.Imagine Mexico kidnapped a bunch of Americans.

I live in the deep south, mind you, so that says a lot. Ive had more Republicans sit down and have an actual, informative, conversation with me while Democrats have resorted to slurs, yelling, or insults because I continue to discuss it instead of simply accepting their view as right. Neither side is totally right or correct in their morals, ethics, or policies, because nothing is perfect. However, if I had to vote right this second, Id vote for the Republican side because Ive been treated with decency and respect when it comes to differing opinions. There are good people on both side, but Ive noticed that Democrats tend to label sides as evil regardless, and use that on their basis for judgement, whereas Ive met Republicans as well as conservatives (one is deeper-set in beliefs than the other) and they listen, provide facts, links, evidence, etc. and acknowledge the bad individuals in the party, as well as policies.

Just because a secular law and a religious law align doesn't mean they are the same thing. It's like saying that my rights are impugned because my religion approves of eating dogs but the government is using that damn catholic law to restrict it.I think you're confused by taking separation of church and state too literally. It is very much more about keeping the state out of the church than the other way around.Our only real proof that the government is secular is that the church is not directly part of the government. We've always seen politicians flaunt their religion and proudly say it shapes their beliefs.We can harp on needing non-religious arguments for laws to maintain secularism, but that's not how we decide on laws anyway. Reality is that we're in a democracy with religious people in it who will vote on their religious beliefs.Gay marriage is a great example. It wasn't illegal because of religion. It was illegal because more people wanted it that way. The majority of people were opposed until like [2011](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx).

Some big issues for me: finance, medical freedom, censorship, and leadership that lies about senility and treats us like children.Financially, I was much better off under Trump's administration. Things have gone from bad to worse under Biden's administration and libs want to blame it all on Trump and Covid, but I'm just not buying it. Four years is plenty of time to make things right if you do things correctly.Medically, it was a very scary, sinister day when Biden announced to unvaccinated people, \\"Our patience is running thin.\\" I have not and will not be taking the covid vaccine. The party line is that vaccination protects yourself and others. All the while, this particular vaccine has been proven to not prevent the spread of covid. At the same time, I have personally witnessed severe side effects from the vaccine while also seeing officials deny that there are any side effects. My mother is a medical doctor and has always been very healthy and is a huge proponent of vaccination. After receiving her covid vaccine, she experienced heart palpitations and shortness of breath for several weeks. She refused any further vaccinations after that experience. I've had covid several times and would rather go through that occasionally than take my chances with those vaccines.Regarding censorship, Zuckerberg admitted that the Biden-Harris administration pressured him to censor certain content on Facebook. RFK said it well, the people censoring are always the bad guys. Harris promises to continue the practice. The idea frightens me and I see modern liberals going along with it. When I expressed disapproval of the Biden-Harris administration and changing my support to Trump, many of my liberal friends attacked me with much vitriol and hate. Any group that aggressively tries to suppress ideas and attack people they disagree with is not a group I want to belong to.As far as the lies go, the democratic party obviously lied to us for as long as they could about Biden's senility until they simply couldn't get away with it anymore. Kamala was appointed last minute rather than being properly voted in through the democratic primaries. She's a completely uninspiring candidate, and in fact, kind of scary. She just repeats key phrases over and over again, there's no substance to her speech. I also don't trust anything she says, her ideas and positions are constantly changing. Seems like she's just trying to say whatever to get elected (and then do whatever she wants in office).Once I was fed up enough with the Biden-Harris administration, I started actually listening to Trump and paying attention to him instead of just listening to what people said about him. I realized he's not nearly as bad as people make him out to be. I don't agree with everything he says, but I like his passion, and I think he's right about a lot of things. I admire that he stands his ground and he's not afraid to be himself, even if it upsets people. He's witty, sharp, and I honestly think he's a badass, too. Jumping up pumping his fist screaming fight after an assassination attempt was inspirational. That's the kind of guy I want running our country and negotiating with foreign leaders. I guarantee Biden, Harris or Walz wouldn't have handled it that way.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"!ping TAIWAN","title":"Diplomatic row looms after South African government demands that Taiwan move its office out of Pretoria"},{"text":"Harris has gotten a pass her whole political career.

It is what it is. She has said on camera that she wouldn't do anything different than Biden admin. Oil drilling and profits from oil were drastically higher in the Biden admin, almost double than under trump... completely countering climate conscious decision-making narrative. Was that in favor to the elites or us? Its just one of many under-the-radar policies that I (and many others) consider right of center. It is. Biden could of executive ordered writing off all student debt, but instead it's a 4 yr circus. Conspiracy, since it's convoluted as hell, but it was entirely unprogressive of him not to use the powers he had to do what he ran on and said he would do. For instance they funded the military budget for '23 at nearly 4Trillion, in the Dec '23 audit 1.9trillion of that was unaccounted for...that missing amount alone would have paid off all student debt with a sizable chunk left to pay off some of the country's medical debt (or contribute in any other way). Not really a political issue but shows that they keep it quiet when questions or real investigation should take place. The primaries this year were undemocratic for sneaky tactics to cut off other would-be challengers to Biden...only to have him drop out and then immediately prop up a replacement - from within DNCs favorites. I mean come on, that's not a good start or sign. Look it up there are legit articles highlighting how they eliminated all competing candidates in primary-critical states.Biden and Harris and MSM love to say they're in the center, and while they may claim or partially be in that camp, they frequently have done right-leaning policy/govt. Bernie is often closer to center than them. Right now you see trump trying to act for centrists, and tamping down his more authoritarian points...and Harris you see acting to the more right-leaning audience and tamping down much of the central and left leaning points. In harmony, it pushes the whole stage to right of center, right where the elites like it most. When it shakes out 50-50ish, and the Dems win, you'll hear things like \\"well, we have to consider the right's wants and needs too since 'half' of America voted trump\\" and \\"as criminal as trump was, America must begin to heal. I'm offering him a deal, a pardon if he promises not to do it again\\"...you get it. It's going to give these elite serving corporate politicians every excuse to do 2% of what they say they'll do (right now) and 60% of the things they do that will favor the elites.Whatever you take away from this, I'm not saying to vote for trump, he's even more dangerous. I just want people to take off the rose colored glasses and realize the DNC picks are the ones that will also be subservient to the elites. We need to be conscious of this for next election, we need someone that will really fight for everyone.

I can very much see how emphasizing his successes was also the view for the future. He wanted to keep doing what he's BEEN doing -- which has been good! -- and expand on it.  But too many people didn't know what he's been doing, so he had to try to educate them. Then it sounded like him defending the past, without talking about the future.  He really could not get a break.People facing high food costs and high housing costs didn't want to hear about the \\"great economy\\", or about how we're less worse off than many other countries.  Biden did bring the economy in for a soft landing and avoided recession. But it's really hard to get people to appreciate the message, \\"things aren't AS bad as they could have been\\".So, fairly or unfairly, that tactic wasn't working.  I feel like that's why her campaign decided early on about \\"we're going forward, we're not looking back\\", and that includes trying to get people to comprehend the good that the Biden admin did.If she wins, she can still continue many of the things the Biden admin was trying to do.

DNA tests have now confirmed that Sinwar is dead.  This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world. As the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, Sinwar was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, and citizens from over 30 countries.  He was the mastermind of the October 7th massacres, rapes, and kidnappings.  It was on his orders that Hamas terrorists invaded Israel to intentionally C and with unspeakable savagery C kill and massacre civilians, a Holocaust survivor, children in front of their parents, and parents in front of their children. Over 1,200 people were killed on that day, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, including 46 Americans.  More than 250 were taken hostage, with 101 still missing. That number includes seven Americans, four of whom are believed to still be alive and held by Hamas terrorists.  Sinwar is the man most responsible for this, and for so much of what followed.  Shortly after the October 7 massacres, I directed Special Operations personnel and our intelligence professionals to work side-by-side with their Israeli counterparts to help locate and track Sinwar and other Hamas leaders hiding in Gaza. With our intelligence help, the IDF relentlessly pursued Hamass leaders, flushing them out of their hiding places and forcing them onto the run.  There has rarely been a military campaign like this, with Hamas leaders living and moving through hundreds of miles of tunnels, organized in multiple stories underground, determined to protect themselves with no care for the civilians suffering above ground.  Today, however, proves once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice, no matter how long it takes.To my Israeli friends, this is no doubt a day of relief and reminiscence, similar to the scenes witnessed throughout the United States after President Obama ordered the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden in 2011.Israel has had every right to eliminate the leadership and military structure of Hamas. Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7.I will be speaking soon with Prime Minister Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders to congratulate them, to discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home to their families, and for ending this war once and for all, which has caused so much devastation to innocent people.  There is now the opportunity for a day after in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.  Yahya Sinwar was an insurmountable obstacle to achieving all of those goals. That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us.","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden on the Death of Yahya Sinwar"},{"text":"So is it 90% civilians or is it two civilians for every militant?

The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between militants and civilians. So what's your point, OP? You claim its time to wind down and proceeded to list various reasons on why the Israel is bad, but you didn't even mention the hostages. Let me paint you this picture: Sinwar is dead. Nasrallah is dead. Lebanon is getting turned into Gaza 2.0 and a year of fighting just proved that Israel doesn't give two shits about what the world has to say about its conduct. A few months ago, the entire world urged and threatened Israel not to enter Rafah - Israel entered Rafah anyways and managed to recover 6 executed hostages, completely seal Hamas' bloodline in the Philadelphi corridor and finally kill Yahya Sinwar himself. What message do you think it conveys? Now that Sinwar is dead, Hamas and the Palestinians have two options.?\\nOption one is surrender and give up the remaining hostages. Dead or alive, Israel recently announced it will give amnesty and a visa to whoever gives back hostages.\\nOption two is continue the way of Sinwar and continue this war without releasing the hostages.??\\nSinwar was the perfect summary of option two. When he was imprisoned for 20 years in Israeli prison, he was given a second chance in life. He was given education and had his life saved by Israeli doctors who removed a tumor from his brain. When he was released from prison in a prisoner deal, he used that second chance to terrorize Gaza and then orchestrate the October 7th massacre - which eventually completely destroyed Gaza and ended the lives of thousands of people.?\\nA famous quote on the Palestinians is that they \\"will never miss an opportunity to miss opportunity\\".

Is it time to end this war and return the hostages or is it a non-negotiable?","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"The rules that says the news has to be Anti-Trump, lol.","title":"This is ludicrous"},{"text":"Me TOO.

They also gerrymandered the state legislative and congressional maps solidifying their control. To give an idea of how badly the state was gerrymandered, in the 2018 WI State Assembly election, Dems won ~53% of the vote compared to ~45% for Rs yet Republicans held \\n~63% of Assembly seats compared with ~37% for Dems (62-37 seats). In 2012, Obama won WI by ~7%. It was considered part of the \\"Blue Wall\\" that was very likely to vote for Clinton. Unfortunately, Trump won WI by less than 1%, about 23k votes. With the state supreme court in R hands since 2008ish, things seemed pretty bleak in WI.Fortunately, things started changing jn 2018. Tony Evers eked out a win against Governor Walker for the governorship by less than 1%.Senator Baldwin crushed her opponent with a 10 point margin. But the R led state legislature had almost veto-proof margins and with no way for citizens to petition for a constitutional amendment (as is possible in other states), it felt almost impossible for Dems to breakthrough at the state level.When Wikler won the chairmanshop for the WI Dem party in 2019, WI had been under R control for a decade and was so badly gerrymandered that it was unclear how Dems could ever regain majority in the state legislative bodies. Wikler is a seasoned Dem organizer who was a Senate staffer (for Senator Sherrod Brown) and had worked on various Dem initiatives and campaigns. He immediately created a strategy for the state party by fundraising, hiring staffers for every part of the state, connecting with county leaders and voters on a state-wide listening tour, rebuilding the get out the vote efforts, and focusing on state supreme court justice elections. His record is astounding in that since he took over, dems have won almost all of statewide races. Wikler also communicated very effectively using Twitter. He explained what the state party was doing, why they won orbllst elections, the impact of proposed legislation, how people can help, etc. I have not yet seen another state chairperson be as effective in communicating and galvanizing support as Wikler has.As a result, Dems recently retook control of the state supreme court which allowed them to strike down the gerrymandered maps a D replace them with fairer maps. The expectation is that Dems can be competitive to take the majority in the State Assembly in 2024, and perhaps the State Senate in 2024. Additionally, there is an expectation that the court will rule that the congressional districts must be redrawn giving Dens the chance to win another congressional seat.In 2020, Wikler and his team worked tirelessly, focusing on increasing turnout in Dane County (where Madison is located), a Dem stronghold. Over 90% of registered voters in Dane county voted and Biden just barely won WI. Many, myself inckuded, credit that success to Wikler's leadership and organizing ability.There is now hope in WI that Dems can reverse the horrible policies of the Scott Walker era and give Dems a better chance to win elections. Many, myself included, credit much of this to Wikler for organizing the state party so effectively","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 17, 2024 - 19 days until election day!"},{"text":"Im not sure if rape, massacre of 1,180 innocents, and kidnapping an additional 251 innocents is standard school bully behavior.","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden on the Death of Yahya Sinwar"},{"text":"This is the reason that issue polling is barely predictive of who someone will actually end up voting for.

Then theres the reports of people like Sinwar disguising themselves as civilian women (this is a war crime), which further complicates things, as Hamas dont report their military casualties publicly. They also fail to uphold the principle of distinction, which makes it extremely difficult to distinguish militants from civilians, so the responsibility for the collateral damage in Gaza is exclusively on Hamas. You cannot begin a war, disguise your militants as civilians, militarise women and children, and shield your military assets with civilian homes, then blame the IDF for the number of women and children killed when they retaliate - that would be on you.I also take massive issue with you describing a 1:1 ratio or a 2:3 ratio as indiscriminate - if you compare those numbers to any large scale modern war, its undeniable that Israel has shown restraint and done what they could in a densely populated area to limit civilian deaths. Of course, Hamas deliberately makes this as difficult as possible, by surrounding anything of military value with as many civilians as possible to deter attacks from the IDF, since unlike Hamas, the IDF doesnt *want* innocent Palestinians to die - their deaths only serve Hamas, which is why Hamas policies maximise their own civilian casualties.In that proper context, its clear that the only way the militant to civilian casualty ratio could still be better than Americas in Afghanistan and Iraq, which were far less densely populated and didnt employ all of Hamas pro-death policies, is because Israel is the *opposite* of indiscriminate. If they *were* indiscriminate, the ratio of militant casualties to civilian casualties would roughly equal the ratio of the militant population to civilian population, meaning that the only way you can justify that claim is if 40-50% of the Gazan population are Hamas militants. Do you think that? If not, stop aiding the propaganda efforts of Iran, Russia and all their despicable puppets and proxies who all genuinely dont care about civilian lives.","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"And, they underestimate because of their estimation and normalization for turnout not because Trump is some old wizard and only he can be underestimated.In 2016 they had no idea how many never voted before MAGAs would show up and how many \\"I don't like Hillary Dems\\" would stay home.In 2020 they got wrong the Democrat skew on early ballots assuming it was less than it turned out to be.Neither of those things will happen this election but that doesn't mean they can't underestimate his turnout in some other way.

The clearest conclusions we can draw from your document -- assuming the Hamas numbers now -- is that males are killed at almost exactly twice the rate of women. In the case of indiscriminate killing, we'd expect a roughly equal number of civilian men and civilian women killed. Attributing excess male deaths to combatants, and generously assuming exactly zero female combatants, the mortality split looks to be [1 male combatant]:[1 civilian male]:[1 civilian female], or a 1:2 ratio of militants to civilians, which is generally in line with Hamas's estimates that about half of their force has been wiped out.With this in mind, the 50x-100x overrepresentation from before drops to 25x-50x overrepresentation, which is still orders of magnitude away from the 1x we should be expecting.","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"Okay, I know it has a website but that's still an untested legal theory and will absolutely be struck down by the current Supreme Court unless Congress writes a law to be as clear as day about the intent to allow blanket forgiveness.

I to was very confused about why anyone would vote for trump. So when he won I did what you are doing now. Which was with genuine curiosity went and asked people who voted for him why they did.I have a lot of inlaws from the mountains who grew up in coal towns. Think boomers who grew up heating up water over a stove so their father could take a bath when he came home from the mines.When I asked these people why they voted for trump over Hillary it was an easy answer for them. Hillary went into coal country and told these people who have been working on mines for generations she was going to close the mines and kill their jobs. What I didn't understand and had to be explained to me is that mining is not just a job. It's the only job for many of people in mining towns. They are taught from kindergarten about mining. They also love the mountains their towns and their people. Closing mines means destroying their way of life. Then one day I'm having dinner with some liberal friends and I bring up what I said above to them. I was shocked by the callousness of their response. \\"They should learn to code\\" they said and laughed and those dumb, backwards (in their opinion) mountain people. Zero empathy given. This was really the beginning of the end of my liberalism.I still didn't really like Trump he rubbed me the wrong way. I did however hold my nose and vote for him in 2020. It didn't matter my vote wasn't counted .When I bring up the fact with liberals that my vote wasn't counted. I'm typically given the MSM spill about \\"there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Georgia\\". Not sure what that has to do with my vote in particular not being counted. The fact my vote wasn't counted is proof \\"some\\" peoples votes weren't counted because I am \\"some\\" people. I'm told I should just get over it by any liberal I discuss this with. Why should they care after all it's one less vote for trump who cares about election integrity.Since Biden has been elected we have had a failed exit from Afghanistan, entered into two conflicts that have nothing to do with us. The border has been opened letting in who knows what kind of people. Inflation is out of control. The job market is a shit show because outsourcing has increased drastically.Many of these things have had direct impact on my life. I lived in Atlanta 11 years. I had to move last year. When Biden got into office and after the summer of love the neighborhood I loved living in for 11 years started going downhill. It was common for there to be gunshots and racing at night. A literal sweatshop moved in across the steet from me (into a residential house) causing constant noise. People started being less friendly. I eventually was forced to sell and move because they decided to tear down a reatraunt and dry cleaner and build a carwash next to the sweatshop. Now none of that has anything to do with Biden but I do wonder if Republicans would let that happen in a residential area, but Atlanta is run by Democrats. So anyways I decide to move to a small rural town and am shocked at how high the prices are. I bite the bullet and spend more than I can really afford because everything is expensive and interest rates are through the roof but I have no choice but to move and I'm not staying in Atlanta. Then my partners company re-orgs and lays off  many American workers to outsource their jobs India. His job became so toxic he quit this week with nothing lined up. Despite what the numbers say the job market is shit because something like 400,000 people have been laid off since 2023. I really expect it to take at least a year for him to find something. Compare that with when Trump was in office. We were in the first period of peace since 2001. Inflation was low, companies were hiring like crazy. Everything felt very optimistic and I think of trump had won a second term post 2020 would have felt like the post WWII era instead of feeling like the beginnings of the great depression. Maybe that's too optimistic but he did do a great job his first term and past performance is the best predictor of future performance. Was he perfect? Absolutely not he did things I did not like, but he also seems to be making much smarter decisions this time around. One example is picking JD Vance for VP. I think his first term he picked pence because someone told him he needed pence to win the Christian right. I think he picked Vance this time because he made his own decision about what he needed in a VP and instead of worrying about identity politics he decided he needed someone with a cool head who could debate. I think his first term he was listening to a lot of political advisors and surrounding himself with the wrong people. That's why he was constantly firing people in his cabinet.There's a lot more I could say here. I think the rise of identity politics has shifted my views more to the right. I think Obama was toxic for race relations and I could write another essay on my opinions of Kamala but it would be difficult to know where to start. So I'll stop here and you can ask questions OP.

Literally no efforts have convinced them to give up their stated goal of destroying Israel and replacing it with an Islamic state. Not negotiations, not periods of peace, not economic incentives, not limited military ops, nothing. So for 20 years Israel has lived with constant rockets and mortars, attack tunnels, kidnappings, stabbings, and shootings from Hamas as they squandered billions in aid money on their insane forever war.?Oct 7th was the final straw and Israel will most likely not allow Hamas to continue to rule the Gaza Strip, given that there is (by Hamass own admission) no situation in which they will give up their Jihad except in the event of Israels destruction. Im 100% confident no country would behave differently than Israel. If Hamas was on Americas border, they would have gone to total war 19 years ago.?So with that said, the elimination of Sinwar does not equal the end of Hamas militancy. Until there is an official surrender or until there are so few Hamas fighters left, there is little to ensure that, in the event of unilateral ceasefire, Hamas wont rearm, regroup, and start the whole cycle again a few years down the line. I will add that historically this is how wars work. The Allies fought the nazis (at astronomical civilian cost) until the Nazis surrendered unconditionally, and then Germany was occupied until alternative leadership was in place. The same is true of Japan after WWII. There is little historical reason to think that a different approach in Gaza would lead to a positive outcome.?I will just add in regard to this:?They're indiscriminate; even by the?IDF's numbers?they kill 1 civilian per militant in modern warfare terms that is exactly the opposite of indiscriminate. Historically recent wars kill 9 civilians for every militant. 1:1 is an incredibly good ratio, especially given the fighting in Gaza is arguably the most difficult urban warfare any military has experienced since Stalingrad.","title":"CMV: Now that Israel has killed off the leader of their opposition in Gaza, it's time to wind things down."},{"text":"Well, whatever it is, it needs to not be bombing and starvation campaigns.The previous situations for Gaza wasn't great; it could be argued to be an apartheid scenario.

Here Brett is too stupid to understand that the maga cancer does not disappear just because Trump isnt in the WH. * 18:21 do you think half of voters are stupid for supporting Trump?**Direct answer**. No, I would never call voters stupid. Im not the one who demeans people.* 19:36 heres a clip of Trump saying he doesnt want to use the military on Americans.She gives a **direct answer.** She points out that just because he says one thing in that short snippet doesnt mean that he hasnt repeatedly been filmed saying that he wants to go after democrats, and use the military if necessary. * 21:20 when did you notice that Joe Biden had diminished faculties?**Direct answer.** She emphatically details how Joe Biden does NOT have diminished faculties. * 23:50  What do you have to say to people who disagree with you that Iran is our primary threat?**Direct answer.** She goes into detail about things that happened that lead her to say that.

This is pretty particular to America, especially right now given a couple of things: the candidates, and the relative challenge of actually voting. (I know that it's pretty easy for some people in some places -- this does not refer to you.)Therefore, the strategy of getting voters who support your candidate to the polls is much more effective than trying to convince undecided voters to support your candidate. How do you get voters to the polls? Anger is an especially potent fuel. If you get them angry enough at the other candidate, than they will go vote, even if it makes them late for something, or fuel is expensive, or they need to wait in line for hours.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Even if this wasnt bullshit, which it obviously is, the fact that you care so much about this instead of the fact that your candidate is a pathological liar, a convicted felon, a serially accused and charged rapist, an admitted sexual harasser and assaulter, a close friend of the most known prolific sex trafficker of this century (the friend that he literally said likes girls on the younger side, even younger than I do), has records showing he visited Epstein Island, called POWs and especially war hero John McCain losers for getting captured, and said he prefers soldiers that dont get captured while simultaneously pretending to be patriotic and support our troops, and so, so, sooooo much more I could write if I cared enough too.Why dont we care a little more about policy instead of backgrounds and lies though? How about we go with the candidate that actually has policy plans! Because I seem to remember when Trump was asked about his policy plans, he said he had the idea of a plan even thought the election was just a few months away by then and hes been campaigning for god knows how long. Idk about you guys but there is no one I trust more to be president than someone that has an idea of a plan. Or we could look at past policies, where Trump kept exactly zero of his campaign promises! I seem to remember a complete border wall was supposed to have been built around 8 years ago, and that Mexico was going to pay for it? What ever could have happened to that? Because the vast majority of the border still has no wall and Mexico hasnt paid a dime for any of it! But dont you worry, hes going to be a day one dictator to get what he wants done and youll never need to vote again because he will continue to erode our voter protections and continue to try and manipulate and steal elections. Im also 100% expecting him to try and remove the two term limit near the end of his term if hes still alive by then.","title":"Well, it turns out Candace Owens has been vindicated.

I mean did he make a mistake when he had a fit when Fox election numbers wonks called Arizona for Biden in 2020?  Fox News likes to pretend it's unbiased in order to keep that \\"news\\" charade going, but make no mistake they are the GOP's entertainment and circus division.It's like in the '80s when anybody ever accused professional wrestling of being faked and the wrestlers themselves would have a fit and beat up on whoever said it. There are a number of interviews you could look up where they were having fits and assaulted people like when Hulk Hogan attacked Richard Belzer.When I was a kid back then I remember watching one of the wrestlemanias I think it was number three and there was a live shot of Hulk Hogan facing the turnbuckle and they had the camera on him on the \\"wrong\\" side. And I saw him reach into his trunks, pull something out, swipe it across his forehead and then return it back to his trunks. This was happening while the opponent was arguing with the referee about something, some kind of contrived distraction. Within a minute the opponent was driving Hogan's head into a turnbuckle when suddenly there's blood all over the place. It was at that moment at 12 years old I realized this is bullshit, this is fake.I remember that because of the Bret Baier interview of Kamala Harris. It's not the first time they exposed themselves as frauds but it's one of the more obvious ones for sure. Time and time again they show themselves to be biased yet they insist that they are fair and balanced. Notice that slogan kind of went away.They present themselves like the referee of a wrestling match they see very closely what they want to see and they ignore very much what they don't. All for the same reasons that wrestling does, the entertainment of their audiences desire to \\"oun the libs.\\"  Fox would do themselves a much-needed favor if they would just call themselves entertainment instead of news, at least they'd be honest for once.","title":"Bret Baier Says He Aired Wrong Trump Clip During Kamala Harris Interview: I Did Make a Mistake"},{"text":"      \\n \\n \\n \\n Their parent organizations are wealthNo, they are not It's not a double standard at all.

But I like all the people he has surrounded himself with, bunch of different ideas to have fresh and fertile ideas. With the abortion given back to the states we can move forward on other issues on a federal level. The wars I feel will be stopped and hopefully Trump can reinvigorate the American dream for my young children. Plenty of other reasons.

IE: Mike Johnson negotiating the BILLION$ being laundered in the Uke.It just came to mind that was the year the Dems discovered mail-in-ballots and the story on the news was that the Dems - for the first time ever - had more mail-ins than the GOP - older people tended to vote by mail from nursing homes or in-home hospice, so there were suspicions that the Dems had \\"filled in\\" ballots and told the old folks they were only helping and would turn them in \\"as a favor\\".","title":"Kamala Harris Fox Interview Transcript"},{"text":"Dudes Hilarious!!
