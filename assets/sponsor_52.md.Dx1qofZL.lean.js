Atrocious wealth inequality: Need I say anymore? These countries are sick to the core with greed and wealth inequality, especially America. The basic idea seems to be, if you have money, we will give you more of it, and if you're poor, we'll punish you for it.I think this is pretty accurate, but I also think it's why capitalism works so well. Ideally, you want the people best at allocating resources to have the most resources to allocate. Best in what sense? That's complicated; capitalism makes a crude approximation of people's desires in the form of dollars, with the hope that receiving dollars correlates strongly with wish fulfillment. Since dollars are not only a resource, but also the reward for allocating resources well, you get a positive feedback loop where those who are good at allocating resources end up with many more resources to allocate.Now, there are several inefficiencies in the system. First, receiving dollars only correlates with wish fulfillment, so people optimizing for the former may not do so much of the latter. Think of scammers or thieves. In fact, it also becomes extremely likely that the people with the most dollars have highly optimized for dollars over wish fulfillment.Second, the dollars are not just used to signal someone's rank in allocating resources, *they can also be used for private affairs*. They can be used to buy superyachts, or gifted to less deserving relatives. If you have billions of dollars, it's very tempting to spend 1% of that on yourself, no matter how inefficient the allocation is. I think academia does a better job in this: there, prestige is a separate currency. Your h-index can help you organize a research team, or get grants to work on the projects you find most important, but it can't be used to buy a mansion.Anyways, I think your critique of wealth inequality is accurate, but I think allocating resources poorly is far, far worse. That leads to systemic collapse (see e.g. the American education system, or the USSR). Are there better ways of allocating resources? Almost certainly. Are other countries doing it better? Not really.You mention the Nordic countries, but I think they are only doing so well due to an abundance of resources. From Wikipedia, The Government Pension Fund Global (Statens pensjonsfond utland), also known as the Oil Fund (Oljefondet), was established in 1990 to invest the surplus revenues of the Norwegian petroleum sector. As of August 2024, it had over US$1.71 trillion in assets, and held on average 1.5% of all of the world's listed companies, making it the world's largest single sovereign wealth fund in terms of total assets under management. This translates to over US$307,000 per Norwegian citizen.When you have $300k per citizen to throw around, you don't need to be as efficient with your resources.","title":"CMV: The Anglosphere Are The Most Unfair/Worst Societies In The Developed World"},{"text":"The guy stayed behind as a POW when he could have returned home.

Well outside of Athens, Patra and some popular islands, you won't feel comfortable to show up with your bf while holding hands. I live in Athens, southern suburbs. I still get weird looks when I'm with my bf in the team. And these are young folks. Also, being a disabled person in this country is miserable. The money you are provided aren't enough to live alone. Our safety nets are barely \\"nets\\". And by that, I mean they are inadequate to function as, well, safety nets. Housing costs are a problem for every single developed country (provided we are talking about urban and big cities). Back to my shithole of a country, imagine an old apartment on the second floor, costing almost 400k euros. Work life balance? Our work minister made working 2 jobs legal. How does any politician even top that? \\"Hey I know you aren't making enough money. As such I have decided to allow you TO WORK ON ANOTHER JOB TO LIVE\\", while also giving employers more power to force to you work 6 days instead of 5 (mind you, you aren't getting an increase of salary). I can't comment on the last point unfortunately. Mostly because, I don't know how bad that is on other countries (well baring America that is).

Less people going into prisons for something as arbitrary will likely mean less people come out more hardened people whose record makes gainful employment difficult, thus turning to crime to survive. Then there are the families of those that are incarcerated and the adverse affects it does to society.

Personally, if we, as a group of theorists had anything to recommend to the masses, it would be that if we fight each other, they win.However, with personal emotions as high as they've become, maybe we might be able to Dialectic our own folks to channel their rage in a more productive way.

I even see a lot of my single white dude friends that have bought houses and built a career seeing it all as an anchor and golden handcuffs more than something to be proud of.

Black Lives Matter has been a failure Black Lives Matter was a movement specifically focused on police brutality.It forced a lot of national discussion the topic, got a lot of DEI type training into police departments, and in many areas caused body cams to be mandatory.Thats meaningful progress on the issue that BLM set out to solve.I know a lot of people tried to morph BLM into every possible equal outcome grievance out there, and to some extent thats too big and amorphous to expect success on - but a lot of critical race theory type of framings have become much more mainstream, and you have to take that as success too. Crime skyrocketed during COVID (in part of police refusing to do their job in protest of BLM) Chelsea Boudin were ousted As a Bay Area resident I can tell you that while yes, the SFPD is fairly useless theyve always been low efficacy.Chelsea Boudin basically refused to convict black people for drugs and theft.When the DA refuses to convict on certain cases, the police stop arresting for it - police are measured by their case clearance rate (among other things, but heavily that one).So lets ask the question again: why did crime skyrocket?You can maybe blame the hardship of COVID, but the response to that - especially in my Bay Area - was a ton of extra unemployment assistance, super strong tenant rights (people couldnt be evicted due to COVID non payment), and on and on.If the liberal solutions of *less* police enforcement and *more* entitlements produced worse results - yes, the people will and did 180 on it.The conversation now shifting to the maybe more uncomfortable problem of crime in black neighborhoods where theres an accountability and cultural problem rather than pure grievance isnt really failure - its the inevitable next step.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"No honey, youve been owned","title":"Barack Obama contrasts John McCain with Trump at Arizona rally"},{"text":"Mhm, there were warning signs their current \\"rich, white, and woke\\" strategy was causing attrition among their most loyal voting bloc but they won't learn or care about that bleeding unless it costs them electorally on the national level.And the fools will get the wrong message it was because of a woman, and a Black woman, if they lose on top of the ticket thinking it was racism/sexism when it was because of how bad Biden was as a leader, how many lies/corruption there was in this admin just like Trump's before them, etc. that caused it not whatever the person on top happened to be IF they lose...","title":"Kamala Harris continues to underperform in critical states"},{"text":"But those same people have strong beliefs against estate taxes that apply to estates over 12? million","title":"Democrats travel deep into Trump country in fight for prize state"},{"text":"This is pretty spot on, IMO.

The proliferation of body cameras has revealed numerous examples of police attempting to frame or violate people during their interactions, only to go on and get caught because the body camera keeps recording at all times. 2. Police are significantly more likely now than at any time before to be held accountable for their actions. 20 years ago George Floyds murderer doesnt even get indicted. Hundreds of Oklahoma City Police officers would still be on the streets sexually abusing women. Officers routinely state that a big fear is that they will be caught on camera in a bad light good.

So I'll say what I can.1. While I'm not denying that Anglosphere countries tend to have more open immigration policies compared to East Asian or some European countries, I feel like it not only discounts the increasing intolerance for immigration in the Anglosphere and some other details. I also feel like it's unfair that you specifically compared Latino immigrants in the US compared to Middle Eastern ones in Europe. Those are completely different locations, so why not compare the exact same demographics. Moreover, Latino immigrants in the U.S. might have more economic mobility, but integration also depends on social inclusion, healthcare access, and cultural acceptance, and there still are many immigrant communities in the Anglosphere still face systemic racism and inequality (South Asians bearing the unfortunate brunt of it in Canada for instance). And we cannot discount the successful immigrant groups in Europe, like Turkish/Iranian immigrants in Germany, have been able to integrate successfully into middle-class and even upper class life for the latter, who have also made a significant presence in Sweden. 2 and 3. These are certainly valid. Those countries aren't without their advantages like superior healthcare, public infrastructure, and safety, but those are valid points. 4. I suppose this one is relative for sure, since if I go from Canada to Finland per se, the housing there will seem like a bargain. Again, I'm just emphasizing that among the housing crisis countries, the Anglosphere seems to be doing the absolute worst, since everyone wants to come to those more than other countries, probably because.. well... we're Anglo countries.Again, I'll honour the rules and give you a delta for your points about the Asian countries, but we must not forget the things they do well and what we lack.

It didn't even start in the 1950s. Michael King - who would later change his name and the name of his oldest son, named after him, to Martin Luther - was an active member of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1920s, and followed some of the civil rights leaders of the time into preaching. He, and many of the people who worked with him, failed by your standards: for over 30 years, they saw relatively little difference made in the laws and social structure of the time. In fact, in many ways, they lost ground as racist and conservative opposition pushed back against their efforts - which included lynchings, more laws to make their lives more difficult, and other legal retaliation.However, that work they were doing set the stage for what would come later. They created the organizations, discovered what did and did not work (mostly, what did not work - through their own failures), and started changing minds. Their efforts would grow over time - so that when the younger generation, including Martin Luther King Jr., came into their majority, that movement was ready to roll over the legal and social challenges it faced; and ultimately be successful....In the same way, Black Lives Matters has been a failure - but it's failing forward. The world is different than it was - which means old strategies don't work. The Civil Rights Movement needs new strategies, new organizations, new messaging - and while Black Lives Matters has had some successes, most of what I believe it has done for the Civil Rights Movement is find out what doesn't work. But that's the nature of movements.And at the same time, it's succeeding. More people are supportive of the idea of putting restrictions and outside oversight on the police. More people are looking at institutional and systemic racism - and other forms of discrimination. Social movements - not just BLM, but others like it as well - are learning how to make decentralized organization work; and how to identify spies, agent provocateurs, and other undermining influences without destabilizing the organization. These steps are likely to result in a successful Civil Rights Movement: it might be in the late 2020s, or it might be later; but the chances are it is coming.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"So did Trump","title":"Barack Obama contrasts John McCain with Trump at Arizona rally"},{"text":"Theyre all full of lies just like Biden who promised the same thing but made sure it didnt happen.

I would argue that it was actually harder to count the dead in 2023 because of the high amount of structural collapse.As it stands now, about 35% of buildings in Gaza have received heavy damage/destruction, most of which was in 2023. The rate of destruction has slowed as the number of strikes has decreased, so it would be logical to conclude both that there are significantly fewer deaths and that it's less difficult to get an accurate count.I should stress that just because I don't think this qualifies as a genocidal campaign doesn't mean that I support the way Netanyahu has conducted this war.

I dont see it as a failure bc it didnt make SUPER significant changes. If anything, I place the failure of BLM on society.As soon as BLM came out, it was quickly co-opted by right wing parties. All Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, etc it muddied down the true statement of BLM and caused discourse instead. So, instead of BLM being about a very common problem that black people experience, it became about defending the slogan and its existence. The spotlight was LITERALLY shifted by right-wing parties. It doesnt help that there was an organization that took advantage of people, so BLM was further condemned (even though the majority of the black community recognizes that the MOVEMENT is different from the ORGANIZATION. We support the MOVEMENT, not the org). Also also during that time, Trump was President, and a LOT of right-wing parties/ideologies started coming out of the woodwork. If it had been a left wing President, I SINCERELY doubt BLM wouldve failed. Like people who are more pro-gun, more racist, more conservative, etc they were all given a spotlight due to Trump being President. So it didnt really help get BLM off running since people were in direct opposition. Then you have to bring in racism and the fact that even before BLM was popular, people didnt really care about black people dying due to police brutality. They didnt believe that it was different, that they were targeted, that it was a problem, etc. Literally, everybody was against BLM before George Floyd, they just didnt know it bc it wasnt very mainstream. Most of the protests were also hijacked by right wingers (its like 92% of protests were peaceful; violence was categorized as anything small from an arrest to gas being deployed. ACLD? Ill find the source if you want lol) which added to hatred towards the movement, racism, the co-opting, police making it about themselves, etc. I guess in a roundabout way, I do agree with you that it failed, but I dont agree on how the failure happened? I dont agree with what led up to the failure. Side note: by everyone and people, I dont mean EVERYBODY in the world.

This means working hard, making good money, being the \\"protector\\" and \\"provider.\\" But this is becoming increasingly hard to live up to. in many ways this role has been usurped by the growing opportunities for women and PoC, LGBTQ folks and basically everybody who is not a straight white man. This is all a net positive for society, yet for a lot of young men it feels like the expectation to live up to those old expectations of masculinity are still there. And reasonably so. What does a woman want with a broke jobless dude?Yet that leaves men fighting harder for less payoff as far as opportunities for work, and also to find a gf, wife or family. Which is why, even if men are still making more than women, it doesn't feel like enough because they feel like they need to be making SIGNIFICANTLY more in order to be seen as a viable mate. And they don't feel like there will be anybody coming to save them if they fall short either.Yeah, you can argue that there's some inherent insecurity and lack of imagination in how guys are thinking about their lives in this scenario.

A few of them caught were charged with simple misdemeanors, essentially zero consequences, by the infamously hated DA Kim Foxx who was recently fired by the people (she still got 49.9% of the vote and the election was before this incident).Why? ... Ultra Woke Progressives like Mayor Brandon Johnson and disgraced DA Kim Foxx believe that \\"justice impacted\\" (that's the no joke word for felons by them) individuals shouldn't be punished for crimes because it won't solve the root issues they are facing which is lack of opportunity, lack of parental concern, need for more youth activities -- and that it might hurt their mental health to prosecute them as 'bad guys' -- etc etc.Some of their theories might hold some merit, sure, but like a pregnant women was beaten into losing her child, no consequences? ....

Fairness doesn't mean that the most able or the most resourceful people have to give to the less able or less resourceful. Fairness means that everyone has the chance to rise to the level where they belong. That means that some people are going to become massive successes. It also means that some people are going to become massive failures. It does make sense for a modern society to say that if you're a massive failure, we're not going to let it reach the point of animalistic starvation, exposure, and death. But it does not make sense to:- use that safety net to deny that the failure exists. There are choices that lead to failure, and people who make them should be called out on it. \\n- call individual failure systemic. Again, it's mostly about choices. If a person chooses to not get a job or to take addictive drugs or to just laze around all day, that's not the system causing them to fail. \\n- diminish success.

If Musk can propel Trump back to the White House, it will mark the moment that his own superintelligence merges with the most powerful apparatus on the planet, the American governmentnot to mention the business opportunity of the century.\\nMany other titans of Silicon Valley have tethered themselves to Trump. But Musk is the one poised to live out the ultimate techno-authoritarian fantasy. With his influence, he stands to capture the state, not just to enrich himself. His entanglement with Trump will be an Ayn Rand novel sprung to life, because Trump has explicitly invited Musk into the government to play the role of the master engineer, who redesigns the American stateand therefore American lifein his own image.Musks pursuit of this dream clearly transcends billionaire hobbyism. Consider the personal attention and financial resources that he is pouring into the former presidents campaign. According to The New York Times, Musk has relocated to Pennsylvania to oversee Trumps ground game there. That is, hes running the infrastructure that will bring voters to the polls. In service of this cause, hes imported top talent from his companies, and he reportedly plans on spending $500 million on it. ?That doesnt begin to account for the value of Musks celebrity shilling, and the way he has turned X into an informal organ of the campaign.\\nMusk began as a Trump skeptica supporter of Ron DeSantis, in fact. Only gradually did he become an avowed, rhapsodic MAGA believer. His attitude toward Trump seems to parallel his view of artificial intelligence. On the one hand, AI might culminate in the destruction of humanity. ?On the other hand, its inevitable, and if harnessed by a brilliant engineer, it has glorious, maybe even salvific potential.\\nMusks public affection for Trump begins, almost certainly, with his savvy understanding of economic interestsnamely, his own. Like so many other billionaire exponents of libertarianism, he has turned the government into a spectacular profit center. His company SpaceX relies on contracts with three-letter agencies and the Pentagon. It has subsumed some of NASAs core functions. Tesla thrives on government tax credits for electric vehicles and subsidies for its network of charging stations. By Politicos tabulation, both companies have won $15 billion in federal contracts. But thats just his business plan in beta form. According to The Wall Street Journal, SpaceX is designing a slew of new products with national security customers in mind.\\nMusk has only begun to tap the pecuniary potential of the government, and Trump is the dream. He rewards loyalists, whether they are foreign leaders who genuflect before him or supplicants who host events at his resorts. Where other presidents might be restrained by norms, Trump shrugs. During his first term, he discovered that his party was never going to punish him for his transgressions.[At least 30 election deniers and 2020 fake electors serving as Trump electors this year](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/2020-fake-electors-serving-as-trump-electors-this-year-dg/index.html)","title":"Obama: You would be worried if your grandpa was acting like Trump"},{"text":"It's closing time.

East Asian developed countries exist and are arguably worse on these issues than Anglosphere ones.Anyways, regarding some of your points:\\n- The Anglosphere countries are far friendlier to immigration than European or East Asian countries. They are able to successfully integrate vast communities of immigrants in a way that European ethnostates struggle to. The average Latino immigrant to the US will have a better chance getting their family into the middle class compared to the average Middle Eastern immigrant in Europe.\\n- East Asian countries are far more conservative than the Anglosphere on gender and LGBTQ+ issues. South Korea is infamous for its yawning gender divide, with what seems to be a full on war between men and women there. Neither SK nor Japan have gay marriage. (And TBH, the cities of Canada and the US are IMO the best places to live if youre queer, but thats another conversation.)\\n- Work life balance is absolutely horrible in East Asia. Japan is infamous for its karoshi, or death by overwork, and Japanese work culture is cited by many Westerners as the number one reason why despite Japans perks they will not want to move there. South Korea is arguably worse, with their current president wanting to institute a 60 hour work week.\\n- I think youre underestimating the housing crisis in continental Europe.

The funding, which will go to 38 projects in 42 states, will be provided through the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, a $10.5 billion initiative included in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Energy Department officials told reporters on a call. The projects range from installing new power lines to adding protections for infrastructure against wildfires in fire-prone regions. They would create an estimated 300 miles worth of new power lines and 7.5 gigawatts of new electrical capacity, officials said. Although the GRIP program predates hurricanes Helene and Milton, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on the call specifically invoked the storms, which devastated parts of western North Carolina and Florida, respectively. The projects covered by the funding include programs to strengthen the grid system in those areas, as well as a $250 million grant that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to add an additional 2,400 megawatts of transmission capacity. The devastating and deadly hurricanes, Helene and Milton, have put on stark display how extreme weather events continue to stress the nations aging electric systems; but across the country, the Biden-Harris administration is using every tool in the toolbox to make sure Americas power grid is hardened in the face of this challenge, Granholm said. The administrations Investing in America agenda has provided the largest grid investment in U.S. history helping us add more energy to the grid faster, improve reliability and resilience, and invest in innovative technologies so customers across the county can have access to more renewable energy and pay less for their electricity. The announcement comes after a report from the International Energy Agency that projected demand for electricity will grow at a faster pace than earlier projections, due largely to increased demand from data centers.","title":"Biden administration announces $2 billion in funds to strengthen electric grid"},{"text":"Forgetting the mound of other scandals surrounding Trump, he's just objectively too old to be President.

Black Lives Matter protests mainly attracted a younger, more diverse crowd. As these people entered or moved up in the workforce, they influenced a lot of companies to make their hiring practices more inclusive. Some of those DEI initiatives have been undone in the past couple years, but I think it demonstrates the potential power as these generations age. I would say it's too soon to declare BLM's impact. As younger generations become a larger portion of voters and politicians, it's possible that BLM's mission will become more central and we'll see real, lasting policy successes. It's easy to see BLM as a movement focused on police brutality, but there were many issues coming together, and even as (a few of the many) reformers lost their elections, almost all of their replacements endorse basic BLM principles around investing in BIPOC communities and fighting discrimination.","title":"CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure"},{"text":"2021","title":"Opinion | Why many Democrats find this presidential campaign uniquely unsettling"},{"text":"THIS is the comment Ive been looking for.","title":"No, Kamala Harris Did Not Lock Up Thousands of Black Men for Marijuana Possession and Other Lies Debunked"},{"text":"I'm sure he reads Atlas Shrugged to them at bedtime occasionally!","title":"Obama On Trump's Recent Odd Behavior: 'Can You Imagine If I Did That?'"},{"text":"Ive used this argument for many years with the MAGA crowd.

Many of those denominations are growing due in part to their active efforts to sway people to their cause (evangelizing). At the same time, religion overall is declining, and the mainline and progressive denominations are especially declining in numbers (due in part to younger Americans' distaste for conservative activism in certain churches). Basically, I think Evangelicals are becoming MORE important to Republicans and MORE conservative, and they are the driving factor in Christian nationalism.Catholic viewpoints are influenced by the Vatican, which doesn't fit neatly into America's culture wars. The Pope may criticize abortion while supporting immigrants and refugees, for example. Catholics are also more likely to be based in northeastern Democratic states whereas evangelical Protestants are more likely to be in southern and midwestern GOP states. I would imagine Catholics will increase their position in the GOP due to Latinos, but I can't see them supplanting Protestants by any means.Strict Muslims may agree with conservatives on social issues, but they are still a small minority of the US and most importantly they are viewed as outsiders. Trump is more transactional, so he'll talk about kicking them out of the country one month then welcome a Muslim leader's endorsement the next. However, they won't fit in with the rest of the conservative Christians, in large part because they are perceived as too different racially and culturally. Americans also view Muslims through the prism of Middle Eastern conflict. Some Christians actually look forward to the Apocalypse, when they hope to be welcomed up to Heaven through the Rapture while the heathens suffer. Some events that people think will lead to the Apocalypse include the destruction of Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount and a new Jewish Temple. Their thinking is that a conservative ethnonationalist Jewish state of Israel (as under Netanyahu) will achieve that vision. Muslims would only hinder it. Muslims are also spreading their religion throughout the world, competing with American Christian missions in places like Africa and southeast Asia. So conservative Christians who oppose multiculturalism will always see Muslims as a threat. Doesn't mean Muslim Americans won't vote Republican, but I can't see the Republican Party catering to Muslims in the same way it currently does to Evangelicals.","title":"CMV: As they move further right, the conservative side will gradually become more Catholic and less Protestant and also warm on Islam and sour on Judaism within the next generation or two."},{"text":"Extremely unsettling to know a large chunk of the people that surround you in your community are fascists and racist.

He posited a ban on Muslim countries because his core voter base didn't want non-white people in the country, and only tokenly hid that was the reason. You can't analyze the far-right without taking into account that racism is one of their primary motivations, and people who've tried to do that for the sake of politeness have ended up getting their predictions wildly wrong. The MAGA movement will never see how much common ground they have with Muslims unless the demographics of Islam shifts to mostly be white people.","title":"CMV: As they move further right, the conservative side will gradually become more Catholic and less Protestant and also warm on Islam and sour on Judaism within the next generation or two."},{"text":"Vote blue.

(Remember, DeSantis was supposed to be the Republican party's next big star.)Trump incited an insurrection, has been convicted of felonies and has more possible convictions on the way, and yet he STILL has as much support as he has.

When oil prices dip, the entire economy and social support structure can tank. In contrast, Anglosphere countries use broader taxation, which provides far more stability and resilience. Building a welfare state on a volatile commodity is hardly a sign of a strong system.\\n\\t2.\\tSelective Benefits: Lets be realthose generous benefits dont extend to everyone. They largely exclude migrant workers who make up a significant chunk of the workforce and often face brutal conditions with little access to these welfare programs. Anglosphere countries may have flaws, but at least their systems extend rights and protections more broadly, even to immigrant communities.\\n\\t3.\\tQuality Isnt a Given: Just because something is free doesnt mean its good. Services in petro-states are often inconsistent, lacking the accountability or competition that can drive improvement. The Anglospheres mixed model might be costly, but it tends to deliver better quality and holds providers more accountable.\\n\\t4.\\tWelfare as Control: The extensive welfare in these states is also a tool for political control. It keeps citizens dependent on the government, curbing their ability to criticize or demand reforms. In the Anglosphere, even with privatization, people have more freedom to speak out and push for change. The trade-off for those free services is often political subservience.\\n\\t5.\\tNot the Regional Norm: And lets not pretend this is the norm across the Middle East. Oil-rich Gulf states are the exception, not the rule. Most of the MENA region, like Egypt or Lebanon, doesnt have the luxury of oil wealth and struggles to provide even basic services. Its disingenuous to hold up these petro-states as examples when they dont reflect the reality for most of the region.In short, petro-states might tout their welfare systems, but theyre fundamentally unstable, exclusionary, and reliant on a single, shaky resource.

Trump is leading at 42%, Harris at 41%, with third party at 12%. More importantly, in the 2020 election, Arab Americans had a 80% turnout, and that has decreased to 63%. Biden also had around a 60% preference from Arab Voters in 2020.Lets run some numbers to see how many votes these numbers translate to with the 300,000 Arabs in Michigan.2020 election: 300,000 * 0.8 * (0.60 - 0.40) = 48,000 votes for Biden2024 election: 300.000 * 0.63 * (0.42-0.41) = 1,890 votes for Trump.Biden won Michigan by 154,188 votes in 2020, and Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, so a 50,000 vote loss may or may not make a difference. Also, this poll is ONLY considering Arabs. Muslim (non-Arab) voters also make a large voting bloc, and the majority of Arabs in America are actually Christian. There is no religious census data, so its more difficult to make number estimates on the Muslim population, but:[In this poll from August,](https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-2024-election-survey-of-american-muslims-shows-jill-stein-kamala-harris-tied-at-29-gaza-genocide-a-top-concern/) 29.4% of Muslims support Harris, while 11.2% of Muslims support Trump. [If we compare this to a poll from 2020,](https://emgageusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Muslim-Voters-Survey-Memo-2.pdf) we find that Muslims voted 86% for Biden, with 6% supporting Trump. There are a lot of Muslims in Michigan, but I cant give you more precise a number than a lot.I will also add that Sinwars death is an inflection point. Ive got a feeling that these polls are going to be useless because we can expect the nature of the war to change significantly in the next two weeks in either direction. If the USA takes the opportunity to say that Israel has achieved all of its war goals and puts the foot down, that will likely improve Harriss support significantly. If Israel continues with its current behavior, especially with its resettling Gaza conferences and the USA continues to support Israel, we can expect Harriss support to decrease significantly.","title":"Why Harris Remains Unlikely to Break From Biden on Israel and Gaza"},{"text":"If some homeless person came up to me talking like Trump does, I'd probably cross the street as quickly as possible.","title":"Obama On Trump's Recent Odd Behavior: 'Can You Imagine If I Did That?'"},{"text":"FUD so much FUD they are really getting desperate now.

Unlike the Anglosphere, many MENA countries dont provide the same opportunities for economic mobility, and factors like entrenched corruption and nepotism can make it incredibly difficult for anyone outside the elite to rise up. The Anglosphere might be far from perfect, but at least you have the chance to build a better life through education and work, even if its challenging.2. Privatization of Basic NeedsThe Anglospheres approach to privatization is a fair point, but the situation is more complex. Countries like Canada and the UK provide universal healthcare, despite criticisms about quality or underfunding. MENA countries, on the other hand, often have weaker public healthcare systems or rely heavily on private care thats unaffordable for most. And lets be realpolitical instability in many of these regions often means that even basic infrastructure can be unreliable. Its hard to argue that the Anglospheres privatization policies make them the worst when access to reliable services in MENA can be so much more limited.3. Societal InequitiesYes, social inequities exist in the Anglosphere, but theyre often less severe than in MENA countries. The Anglosphere has its flaws when it comes to race relations, LGBTQ+ rights, and disability rights, but the level of legal protections and cultural acceptance is still generally much higher than in MENA. In many MENA countries, LGBTQ+ people face outright criminalization and harsh punishments. People with disabilities often lack access to public accommodations and face severe stigma. So while its fair to critique the Anglospheres shortcomings, its a stretch to say theyre worse than places where certain groups face systemic legal discrimination or even persecution.4. Lack of Safety NetsThe Anglospheres social safety nets might be weaker than those in Northern Europe, but theyre often still better than those in MENA countries. Canada, the UK, and Australia have unemployment benefits, social housing, and other forms of welfare that can provide a baseline level of support, even if theyre not as generous as those in the Nordic countries. Compare that to many MENA countries, where safety nets can be almost non-existent, or severely hampered by political instability and lack of resources. Its one thing to critique the imperfections of these systems; its another to overlook how much worse the alternatives can be.5. Housing InequalitiesHousing is definitely a mess in cities like San Francisco, Vancouver, and Sydney. But skyrocketing prices and investment-driven markets are a global phenomenon. European cities like Paris, Berlin, and Amsterdam have seen similar trends. MENA countries face severe housing crises too, often exacerbated by rapid urbanization and political instability. In many MENA countries, theres also less protection for tenants, and informal housing often lacks basic services. So, while housing is a legitimate problem in the Anglosphere, its not a unique or defining feature of why these countries might be considered worst.6. Lack of Work-Life BalanceThe glorification of work in the Anglosphere, especially in the U.S., can be brutal, but even here, the comparison to MENA countries doesnt hold up as easily. Many workers in MENA, especially migrant workers, endure extremely long hours, often under exploitative conditions with fewer legal protections. And while Europe might win on work-life balance, Anglosphere countries like Canada, New Zealand, and even some states in the U.S. are making strides in offering more flexibility and promoting mental health. Plus, people in these countries generally have the freedom to advocate for change and push for better conditions, which isnt always the case in many MENA nations.7. IndividualismYou criticize the individualism in the Anglosphere, but this emphasis on personal freedom is one of its major strengths compared to MENA countries. Yes, the self-made myth can be toxic, but its also true that individual rights are better protected in these societies. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to criticize the government are things people often take for granted in the Anglosphere but are significantly limited in many MENA countries. In much of the MENA region, criticism of the state or certain social norms can lead to serious consequences, including imprisonment. The Anglospheres culture of individualism might come with isolation, but its hard to argue that the trade-offs make them worse than societies where freedoms are far more constrained.Additional ContextIts also worth noting that the challenges facing many MENA countries arent solely the result of Western influence. While colonialism and external interference undoubtedly shaped the borders and some political dynamics in the region, many of the deeper issuessuch as authoritarianism, tribalism, and sectarian divisionshave roots that long predate Western involvement. Even after gaining independence, internal factors like power struggles, religious conservatism, and regional rivalries have heavily influenced the political and social landscape. Blaming all of these challenges on Western influence oversimplifies a complex reality and overlooks the agency of regional leaders and populations in shaping their own societies. Recognizing this nuance helps put the Anglospheres issues into perspectiveshowing that while they have their flaws, they exist in a very different context compared to the systemic challenges seen in MENA countries.In short, the Anglosphere has real issues that deserve criticism, but labeling them the worst societies in the developed world is an overreach, especially when compared to the conditions in MENA countries. They offer far more opportunities for personal freedom, legal protections, and economic mobility than many places in MENA, which grapple with far deeper structural issues that cannot be attributed solely to Western influence.","title":"CMV: The Anglosphere Are The Most Unfair/Worst Societies In The Developed World"},{"text":"He called himself the father IVF, Obama said during a rally in battleground Arizona.

This is his way of favoring white immigrants. Miller probably considers it unfortunate that an English literacy test might also favor people of color from India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines, all countries with many millions of non-white who are fluent in Emhkish. But he presumably likes the fact that it would drastically cut the percentage of legal U.S. immigrants who are not white. In particular, it would be a huge hurdle to most immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas.By the way, the pro-life and anti-feminist agenda of the right is also race related. They want to increase the fertility rate among white Americans, and they believe abortion and feminism are responsible for reducing the number of white babies. This is an area where J.D. Vance and Trump think alike, although Trump is likely more cynical about it while Vance appears to be a true believer in his own pro-fertility rhetoric. This explains Vances disparaging comments about childless cat-ladies.As the opinion article in the link below notes, even if Trump loses this election the fact that his openly fascist rhetoric works as well as it does is deeply disturbing. Do 45% of American voters really believe this fascist nonsense? Will they come to their senses when Trump goes away?

Keep fighting the Japanese until all their forces had surrendered 2. A full invasion of the Japanese mainland by US forces, with a million (probably much more) dead. 3. An Atomic weapon that would assure complete annihilation. After Iwojima and the Kamikaze attacks at Okinawa it was clear that the Japanese Imperial Army preferred suicide rather than surrender and would keep fighting to that end to preserve national character. That made the first plan untenable and the second operation would have made the D-day landings look like an uneventful skirmish. Faced with that scenario its pretty easy to see why Truman looked at the Atomic Bomb and said Um, yeah lets go with that. In fact the second bombing in Nagasaki proved the Japanese maniacal resilience insofar as the imperial army was still trying to veto the surrender in the japanese Diet and had in fact plotted a coup to stop it.

General Wesley Clark revealed that the US had a plan to target  seven countries within five years, beginning with Iraq and followed by  Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and ultimately Iran.\\n \\n-Although timelines may have shifted and the PNAC shut down, it is quite clear that those \\"projects\\" remain active\\n \\n-To adhere to the UN Charter's Article 51, which outlines the inherent  right of individual or collective self-defense in the event of an armed  attack against a Member of the United Nations, it is crucial for the  United States and its western allies to present themselves as victims of a \\"unprovoked attack.\\" This portrayal serves to justify any disproportionate military actions, the decision to go to war, or, in the  cases of Ukraine and Israel, the provision of essentially unlimited  military support, as Article 51 does not impose restrictions on the  retaliatory actions of the \\"victims.\\"\\n \\n-This is exactly why the collective West and their compliant media consistently use the term \\"unprovoked attack\\" when referring to Russia's  actions in Donbass or Hamas' actions against Israel\\n \\n-We observe similar shaping and framing operations concerning China, depicting it as the aggressor while presenting the US and its allies as victims.\\n \\n-This is significant not only for invoking UN article 51 but also because  many American allies have similar provisions in their national  constitutions. For example, the German Constitution deems any action that could lead to a war of aggression illegal, with penalties including lifelong imprisonment.\\n \\n-Therefore, when the collective West, spearheaded by the United States, seeks to implement its revisionist strategy and ambitions for global  dominance, it is crucial to present themselves as victims.-\\n \\nPeter Lee @chinahand provided an insightful analysis back in July regarding the revisions planned by the US for the Middle East, it might just expanded to include Iran as well??\\"Butchery on top of Bullsh*t: Jake Sullivans Grand Plan for a China-Free Middle East\\" (the post I linked above)","title":"Trump &amp; Biden presidencies' controlled demolition of the 1990s post-cold war order"},{"text":"The Onion still had the best outrageous Obama headline.

Everything trump does, he does in order to glorify his own ego.I believe that Kamala Harris is exactly the person we need to run the country -- she is smart, compassionate, experienced, diplomatic, tough, everything you want a president to be. Even if you don't like some of her policies/positions, at least know that she had the best interests of the country and its citizens at heart, and will do everything she can to improve the lives of Americans and uphold the Constitution and the ideals of the U.S. Voting for Kamala Harris is the right thing to do, the best thing for this country; if you still cannot bring yourself to vote for her, for whatever reason, please at least don't vote for Trump -- consider voting third-party, writing in a candidate, or abstaining from voting.

This year, 70 percent have said theyre backing Vice President Kamala Harris, per a recent New York Times/Siena poll.As those numbers make clear, the group overwhelmingly supports Democrats, but their loyalty has begun to wane, a shift that stretches across the last several campaigns. That attrition has something to do with the candidates themselves, but also with voters longstanding disillusionment with the party. Despite being one of Democrats most loyal voting blocs, some Black voters have felt ignored and taken for granted as campaign promises and change have been slow to materialize.People are disappointed with the Democrats, says David Childs, a history professor and director of the Black Studies Program at Northern Kentucky University. A lot of people feel disenfranchised. They dont feel like they have a voice.An added twist is some evidence that the Democrats leftward shift on social issues may also be a factor. Reviewing polling on respondents views on LGBTQ issues, Thomas Edsall of the New York Times noted that views expressed by Black voters in one survey suggested that some aspects of Democratic liberal orthodoxy contribute to the exodus of conservative minorities from the party.The erosion Democrats have seen could be attributed to any number of reasons. But broadly, here are three theories that can explain why some Black men are feeling cool toward the party this cycle:1) A sense of economic stagnationIn the last four years, Black Americans have faced the same economic challenges as everyone else, while also navigating racial wealth and wage gaps that mean many Black families feel the effects of rising costs and inflation more keenly than their white counterparts.While Black unemployment reached an all-time low during the Biden administration, its still twice as high as white unemployment. Similarly, while the Black poverty rate reached a record low in 2022, that all-time low still meant nearly one in five Black Americans was living in poverty, nearly double the poverty rate of white Americans.In focus groups and conversations with party leaders, Black men have stated repeatedly that their material conditions have remained unchanged under Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, the New York Timess Maya King reports. And as costs have risen during a Biden administration  mostly due to inflation  that feeling of stagnation has only grown more pronounced.Such sentiments have prompted some voters to weigh whether voting for an alternative option C like Trump C could help produce a different outcome.Nothing has come to fruition. Look at the schools, the playgrounds, the parks. Downtown is struggling. In our community, typically, we vote for Democrats. How has that panned out for us? Ahmad Taylor, an undecided Michigan voter who previously voted for Biden, told the Washington Posts Michael Brice-Saddler.Multiple Covid-19 aid packages also helped stem the economic pain some voters experienced because of the pandemic during the Trump administration and the beginning of the Biden administration. These included stimulus checks, small business funding, and expansions to unemployment payments.A number of these payments, however, expired during the Biden administration because Republicans in Congress balked at passing a continuation of programs like an expanded child tax. Thats left voters dealing with both higher costs on consumer goods and a drop-off in aid that could help soften the blow.Because the first wave of stimulus checks was sent out during the Trump administration and also bore his name, some voters have been under the mistaken impression that hes solely to credit for them. That idea has taken hold even though the aid was passed by a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, and even though stimulus payments were distributed during the Biden administration as well.2) Resistance to the growing social liberalism of the Democratic PartyAnother dynamic at play is more conservative attitudes among some Black voters on social issues. In particular, as Democrats have shifted leftward on LGBTQ rights  just over a decade ago, Obama was hesitant to back same-sex marriage  some of these voters have chafed at the partys current stance.This cycle, Republicans have ramped up attacks on LGBTQ rights, particularly those targeting trans people, and that may be resonating with certain voters, including Black men. In one attack ad on Harris that played during football games, the Trump campaign has gone after her support for funding gender-affirming surgeries for trans inmates  something, it should be noted, that prisons also offered under Trump. Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you, the ad states.Charlamagne Tha God, an influential media personality and one of the hosts of the syndicated radio show The Breakfast Club, has described the ad as effective.Other voters have spoken of Democrats support for gay rights as a problem. Thats when I left Democrats alone, one voter, identified as J, told NPR, noting that the legalization of gay marriage, a milestone made possible by the Supreme Court but celebrated by Democrats, was his tipping point away from the party.Those socially conservative viewpoints can extend to gender as well. When it comes to Harriss candidacy, specifically, sexism might well be a real issue for some voters, including Black men.There are traditional values that come out of a lot of the Black homes that are still around. Even though many Black males were raised by a mother, by a matriarch, theres still this notion that women have a certain place in our society, says Childs.Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, notes that hes heard the sentiment from a small percentage of voters hes spoken to: You got some percentage that will come out and tell you, like in your face: I dont think a woman should be president, he says.3) An election cycle rife with disinformationA problem that only amplifies Democrats struggles is the rise of disinformation, multiple experts posited.Childs notes that influencers on the right have seized on real concerns Black men may have  like economic frustration  to advance false messages about how Harris and Biden havent accomplished anything to help members of this group.In one example that Charlamagne Tha God cited during a town hall with Harris this week, he referenced a viral clip from a Harris interview with The Grio that was taken out of context and has been cut so it looks like shes saying she wont do anything specifically for Black people.These claims often begin with pundits on the right, or even Trump himself, and get amplified over social media by celebrities, podcasters, and other prominent personalities. The singer Janet Jackson, for instance, recently elevated lies that Trump had told questioning Harriss ethnicity.Multiple surveys, including an August NAACP poll, have found a stark generational divide among Black men, with voters under 50 far less likely to support Harris than those over 50. Albright believes this points to the effect disinformation on social media has had, as younger voters are more likely to get news from these sources.Its like a living organism, this disinformation. It grows from a cell, and then it reaches the point where it takes on a life of its own, and it just grows all kinds of tentacles, Albright tells Vox. And  its touching millions of Black voters.","title":"3 theories why Democrats have lost support among Black men"},{"text":"Exactly what i was thinking.

When Rahm Emanuel, a former mayor, did it a decade ago, it may have tanked his mayoral career. Under Mr Johnson, Mr Martinez has done the opposite, allowing more money to flow to struggling schools. But the covid-relief funds that have made this possible are now running out. The school district faces a budget deficit of $500m this year.

For example, I think actual conservatives (as opposed to GOP nationalism) dont have a candidate for the past 3 cycles. I think its valid to say they dont have anyone that aligns close enough to have their vote.I suppose in theory, it is still best for them to write-in or vote for a 3rd party they align with, but in practical terms I wont begrudge someone staying home when they feel there is no good option. I personally would advocate that Trump is so bad an option that it makes it worth voting to prevent him, but if someone disagrees with that, I prefer they opt out of voting rather than vote for him.","title":"Watch Kamala Harris Roast Old Man Trump | If you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world."},{"text":"Bad mouthing Trump is helping citizens?\\nHe will do a lot of damage through his dementia addled brain?","title":"Kamala Harris questions Trumps stamina: Is he fit to do the job?"},{"text":"Usually this kind of person ends up diagnosed with ASPD.Real life psychopaths are usually not smart at all.","title":"Former Las Vegas-area Democratic politician gets minimum 28 years for killing reporter"},{"text":"Please don't jerk your cat","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://www.ctulocal1.org/posts/acero-closing-proposal-press/https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/09/25/as-mayor-and-cps-ceo-square-off-chicago-board-to-vote-on-barring-school-closures-until-2027/https://www.npr.org/2023/06/01/1178727834/after-10-years-chicago-school-closings-have-left-big-holes-and-promises-unkept","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Ive seen Obamas summer music list and hes completely correct - his playlist would be better.","title":"Obama roasts Trump's town hall where he was swaying to music for 39 mins"},{"text":"You can make that argument about pretty much any recent president except for Jimmy.","title":"Obama roasts Trump's town hall where he was swaying to music for 39 mins"},{"text":"People talk about project blue beam here all the time","title":"Rabbit hole I haven't seen anyone else mention - Song lyrics about the year 2025"},{"text":"Nice try, but that particular spin has been debunked.

Joe Manchin still won in 2018 when we had a favorable general environment, an environment which could end up being true for us again here in 2024 if the early signs of voter enthusiasm and our post Dobbs performances hold. Of course the incumbency advantage would no longer apply, which again makes that race difficult.If you are in the region, do not sleep on this race and do not be apathetic.

There are early signs of green energy investments in the state, which could finally give the region some much needed investment as the coal industry continues to transition to other parts of the country.

Are all those people definitely not registered with a party?? And if so, are they not getting polled?? Because 10-20% is a HUGE number and if they are not part of roll calls for polls, are the polls missing up to 20% of voters completely I really dont get this in terms of how the polls work because if they are calling likely voters.

Trump is a response to a society that allowed leftism to creep in. The role he's meant to serve is to make America great again by engaging in a wave of repression against leftism like the old days of american society. Any time large groups of people begin to flirt with ideas that don't align with the right wing liberal idealogy we see just how \\"democratic\\" american power really is. Anybody who has any sorts of disagreements with this isn't educated on the history of what led to this point. Ferguson Missouri unrest, Baltimore, all the moments of unrest spread by radical agitators was now on notice and the reaction had to be built fiercely. There comes Trump. You can find sources of right wing think tanks and pundits talking about threats of socialism since Obama. This isn't a coincidence that this occurred when right wing think tanks were studying the resurgence of left wing violence and political unrest  in European union states and comparing it to domestic patterns. This is why conservative pundits warned of unrest, communists and anarchists well before trump. Check the book Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.A win for kamala is another win for leftism because the plan of leftists is to weaken this reaction against them as they can continue to use the freedom of american society to embolden themselves and grow before the inevitable organized attack against them occurs. If trump wins now..the left will be hunted and won't be able to embolden and strengthen their movements further due to trump shutting off access of free society and rights for them. If kamala wins they'll continue to grow, using the free society to operate and gain strength and victories over the years. This means the reactionary force would be playing catch up rather than being able to stomp the left out before they're strong enough to respond to a state backed potential military witch hunt. This is why trump is so frantic to get elected. If the left isn't stopped while they're still somewhat weak then it will be a much much harder battle over the years to stamp leftism from american society. Compare it to HIV. Meds hit it before aids your immune system can live. Well you lose your meds (election) then it becomes aids and your battling something that has power to destroy you.That entire refusing to vote strategy of the left was an old strategy to denounce both parties and it's impact is already heard so not many leftists go by this anymore. When I say it's impact was already heard I mean more Americans under 45 agree with the leftist sentiment that both parties are mainstream war mongers with the same interests. Leftists whether we like it or not already have ended and won that battle. Regardless of what happens this election things aren't returning to \\"normal\\" and the recent past will never be again.\\n This leftist OP knows is responding to emotions and not even using their own theory properly. Unless they know something I don't and the American left is in bold letters like the pre Russian revolution Russia, or Spain 1936 and would happily defeat a fascist belligerent seizing parts of the state? Which I doubt considering protests can't even properly identify and avoid cointelpro tactics let alone a military witchhunt and internment.","title":"Help me explain to leftists.."},{"text":"Love Obama saying this because it will drive Trump crazy (well, crazier).","title":"Obama roasts Trump's town hall where he was swaying to music for 39 mins"},{"text":"But a ceasefire deal would get in the way the US / Isreal plan they've been  preping since 2009!2009 US Brookings report titled 'Which Road to Persia'One of the chapters is literally titled 'Leave it to Bibi', where the plan is for the US to allow Isreal to carry out small and continuous strikes against Iran (regardless of what Hamas or Helbozah ever did), in order to start a wider conflict.

It would need to be more like the current calls to tax the rich at \\"appropriate\\" levels, which means they pay an exorbitant tax because they have exorbitant wealth. So while the cap on political spending for middle-class voters, for example, might be 5% of annual income, the cap might be .003% for billionaires...which STILL significantly more than your average $60,000 a year employee, but waaaaaay less than they're currently allowed to spend.And corporations should not be allowed to contribute financially or otherwise to a political campaign or have any say or control over policy-making. Only living, breathing humans should be allowed to have a say in the political future of our country, with the exception of humans representing a business. Those people can have personal contributions, but not for their company.**Editing to add:** to be perfectly honest, the only scenario I think would be genuinely fair is if all candidates for political office have to raise their own campaign funding but can only raise up to a certain limit (let's say, for ease of conversation, $100,000) and all donations have to be less than say $1000, and can only come from real humans, no corporations or organizations. And once they're the official nomination for their party, private fundraising ends and the government steps in and gives every candidate running X amount of dollars to campaign with and that's all they get for the entire campaign. Every candidate gets the same amount, period.Of course, there are holes in my plan, but it still feels a million times more balanced across the board than our current bullshit system, which is so obviously unfair that it's laughable.","title":"Are we fooling ourselves?

In his State of the Union Address, President Al Gore celebrated the fact that more than 75% of US electricity is now generated by fusion, and a majority of new cars sold today are internal fusion-electric motor powered. In the address, he proposed to Congress a ban on new internal combustion cars being sold after 2010, although the measure will have difficulty passing the Republican-controlled House. He proposed another round of foreign development and military aid to the Russian Federation worth over $7 billion, arguing that the consequences of a Russian breakup would be dire for international security. The Russian economy has begun to recover with American investment, but it is still reliant on American funding to pay its soldiers. The recent withdrawal of Russian security forces from Dagestan underscored the dire security situation in Russia's ethnic republics. President Gore, a longtime critic of manned spaceflight, proposed cancelling the moon base program and refocusing on unmanned probes and telescopes. A key part of President George HW Bush's Space Exploration Initiative, the superheavy Hercules V rocket has taken 12 men and women to the surface of moon over the last 3 years, but CBO reports indicate that the cost estimates for the planned south pole lunar base have doubled since the project was baselined during Bush's 2nd term. Senators Bill Nelson and Richard Shelby jointly spoke against cancellation after the address. They argue that the recent completion of Space Station Freedom and the Superconducting Supercollider have freed up sufficient funding for the moon base. Without their crucial cooperation, Gore will have difficulty cancelling the moon base.The latter part of his address was focused on the so-called \\"Arab Spring\\". He was adamant that the US must not intervene in the ongoing civil wars in Libya and Iraq, and continued to push for a ceasefire in those conflicts. He expressed optimism and support for the new democratic governments in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE which took power after a wave of peaceful revolution in October. Middle East policy experts have expressed growing concern at the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist organizations in these countries. They worry that if this new democracy club isn't able to turn around its sky-high unemployment rates soon, Islamists may come to power.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Polls are literally meaningless at this point.

Biden decides to try and block them with the coast guard but this leads to some weird near misses with Cuban Navy vessels a la the Taiwan strait.Somehow this eventually leads to a kinetic action (Jake Sullivan was off the clock) and we get footage of Americans engaging Cuban vessels.

It sounds like you're looking for something that's hidden or not immediately obvious.

Here are a few examples:  Movies and TV Shows: Many mystery and thriller movies and TV shows incorporate rumors as plot devices. For example, in the TV show \\"Gossip Girl,\\" the entire premise revolves around a mysterious figure spreading rumors about the lives of privileged teenagers in New York City.  Books: Novels, especially those in the mystery, suspense, or gossip genres, often use rumors to drive the narrative forward. Authors like Agatha Christie and Gillian Flynn are known for incorporating rumors and gossip into their stories to create intrigue and suspense.  Social Media: With the rise of social media platforms, rumors can spread quickly and widely. Characters in movies, TV shows, and books often engage with social media, allowing rumors to become a central plot point.  Music: Some songs feature lyrics about rumors and gossip, either as a central theme or as a storytelling device. Artists like Taylor Swift and Katy Perry have incorporated rumors and gossip into their music, exploring themes of betrayal, speculation, and reputation.    These are just a few examples, but rumors can be found throughout popular culture in various forms, reflecting their pervasive nature in society.\\"      \\nSo in a weird way it's almost like saying: \\"We will never outright tell you this, but we're outright telling you this, through these mediums.\\"","title":"Rabbit hole I haven't seen anyone else mention - Song lyrics about the year 2025"},{"text":"I just read about Bluebeam the other week.

Over time, this influence expanded through large financial donations to political campaigns, allowing wealthy individuals and corporations to shape candidates and policies to their advantage. Furthermore, the wealthy often hire lobbyists to advocate for their interests, contributing to policies that prioritize the rich over the general population. Many wealthy individuals and corporations also control major media outlets, which allows them to influence public opinion and political discourse.","title":"Are we fooling ourselves?

That's not how any of this works. Even Trump acknowledged that deflation would be even worse than inflation, so he'll target an inflation rate of 1-2%, just like every other politician. The focus should be on wage growth. If people make enough money, they won't care about the higher prices. Well that and lower taxes.Trump's tariffs definitely won't help with this inflation situation. That alone should deter anyone who plans on voting for Trump because they are worried about inflation.

That said, I dont think that the centrist vote is as important as youre suggesting.I honestly could make my own cmv about this but Im broadly of the opinion that the democrats do themselves an enormous disservice by working so hard to carry over the marginal population who are truly in the middle and alienating a lot of progressive voters in the process. Donald Trumps victory should, I think, be taken as evidence that enthusiasm matters at least as much as broad appeal in electoral politics. It doesnt matter if someone would prefer one candidate to another if they dont actually vote for them when it comes down to it. To your point about there not being enough progressives to carry the win for her in swing states, I think that probably applies relatively accurately to Pennsylvania from my understanding, but I think is not true for some other states like Georgia and Michigan. With the caveat that I dont think the things that make these places electorally different are as simple as drawing a left-right line (ie Im not claiming theyre full of subaru outback driving NPR listening progressives lol)Georgia did not vote for Biden in the last election because a huge number of maga voters switched over. We can more or less thank stacy abrams and some incredible get out the vote campaigning among black communities in atlanta for that change. The people who caused that groundswell are not really among the group youre talking about, people choosing between the two. (Nationwide I think black women as a demographic overwhelmingly vote Democrat when they turn out). The issue is whether they can and want to make the effort to actually vote. I dont think you maintain that energy by running to their right. The Arab-American vote matters significantly in Michigan for the democrats, with that constituency having voted significantly for Biden in 2020, very likely accounting for most if not all of his margin of error. They are also not likely to be won over by campaigning to the center.In effect, my view of swing states is that a lot of them seem to be situated in such a way that the numbers of voters on either side and enthusiasm and energy from either side can fluctuate such that the state may go one way or another, but Im skeptical that a huge amount of that fluctuation is people switching between democrats and republicans, given that when polled a very small fraction of voters identify themselves as not having a lean.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Two things I'm surprised people in this sub don't talk about more is the Rapture and fake alien invasion, both of which I believe will happen very soon (this year or next).
