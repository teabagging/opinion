I watch both sides of the media, but by and large, the commentary on the left has always been doomsday: worst thing in the world ever, when his actual comments are rather benign. Just one quick example, (I wrote a whole thing in the comment above this one if youre interested in reading my long winded explanation), but quick example before the election, the word was that Trump will create a handmaids tale version of America and will pass a national abortion ban, Kamala repeated this as well constantly whod he nominate for department of health? A pro abortion guy. Hes said repeatedly that he wanted to get Roe overturned and leave those decisions with the states thats what happened that fight is over for him. Come back to this comment in a couple years and remind me if he ever passed that banShort version: actually question what you read. Then go and actually watch full clips of what he says in their entirety and then tell me if you have the same impression that was trying to be pushed on you by the article you read. Maybe you will in some instances, but I bet that if you look at it objectively, its not all doom and gloom as is portrayed. More examples: Trump call for execution of Liz Cheney (actually listen to what he said about Liz Cheney being a Warhawk)Very fine people on both sides, Charleston controversy(very clearly says he is not talking about white nationalists. This lie was repeated by Obama before the election)Trump wants to take away your vaccines(dude just did an hour and 15 minute press conference and addresses this very issue. I dont think Biden or Kamala commutatively did an hour and 15 minutes worth of questions from the press during their entire administration)There are literally hundreds of example of this Trump says something, media quotes out of context and spins, rinse and repeat cycle. Anytime you see a quote of Trumps and a doomsday spin, go and watch the actual clip. And Ill admit sometimes he says some batshit things, I wont deny it, but on the important things, hes not nearly as extreme as youd be led to believe.

But dispite the fact that the rules of chess are simple, the average person can't beat a grandmaster at chess. Like I could devote 100 hours into practicing chess and a grandmaster would still sweep the floor with me. That's because while chess is a game with simple rules, a lot of depth to understanding the full game.The point I'm trying to make here is that just because a system is simple it dosen't mean that there can't be a skill gap. Just as you're not going to be a grandmaster because you know all the rules of chess, you're not going to be an ace attorney if all you understand is the procedure that the court follows.","title":"CMV: private lawyers make the US legal system flawed"},{"text":"Why do you assume that public school socialization is healthy socialization?","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Oh?But he, who pathologically lies about literally everything, is somehow a stable genius?","title":"Trump says it's 'terrible' that some people are valorizing Luigi Mangione: 'That's a sickness, actually'"},{"text":"Call me when there are actual consequences ?","title":"Judge Merchan rejects Trump"},{"text":"Ugh, [yes this appears to be a real dissertation](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2285/) that somebody earned a PhD on.","title":"I hope trump destroys wokeness forever"},{"text":"Hey, at least Merchan delayed his drone-strike execution by at least four years.","title":"Judge Merchan rejects Trump"},{"text":"Ankle monitor for four years.

I think both sides have a lot of people, who rather than having an actual conversation with each other, they will just repeat talking points that they have heard and not actually investigated, and maintain a very tribal mentality, quickly dismissing the other side rather than actually listen to what they are saying. Ive got things Im liberal about, Ive got things Im conservative about. But I also extremely closely watched Trumps first administration and more importantly, the medias coverage of his admin and the social media response to the media. Any objective viewer who actually looks at the things that Trump has said, they can see how the media picks up and twists the things he says. There are too many examples to name them all, but just one of the oft repeated examples is the very fine people on both sides statement. More recently, Trump calls for Liz Cheney to be executed. And then those talking points get repeated in echo chambers like this one, and everyone gets reaffirmation of their opinion that is often started by misinformation put out their by the press (both pro and anti Trump). My only point in mentioning the racist and sexist rhetoric is that by and large people who voted Trump didnt do so because Harris was a black woman. Its how you explain the original commenters confusion at how people could vote AOC and Trump. It wasnt racism and sexism. It was a recognition that in our state elections, we could vote for the liberal candidates. My state voted to enshrine abortion in their state constitution, voted for a liberal senator, and also voted for Trump. People didnt think Kamala could get the job done, but that Trump would even if they didnt agree with every aspect of his platform. Kamala didnt separate herself from Bidens choices, she offered meaningless platitudes about Americas dreams and ambition, and people looked at their life under Biden, and their life under Trump and thought I was better off under Trump and because Kamala offered no concrete plans beyond 25k for a house down payment (exaggerating, but hopefully the point is taken), and because she didnt separate herself from the poor decisions of this administration (even going so far as to call herself the last person in the room on all the big tough decision), people voted for Trump for the nation, and voted Democrat for their state. That is a very long winded way to answer your question, but hopefully it suits to explain what I was driving at with my original pithy comments.","title":"Post-election polling suggests a new reason behind Trumps victory"},{"text":"Hes delusional to think that.

Basically it means that if you make a decision as part of your job and it turns out to be wrong you personally cannot be sued or prosecuted for it as long as it was not due to corruption or undue influence. To use an example that  has come up in cases I have been tangentially involved in, if the SEC receives a  tip that a financial institution has been insolvent and the SEC decides the evidence does not justify the expense of an investigation and it then turns out that the institution was in fact insolvent, the  people at the SEC who made the decision not to investigate  can not be personally sued or prosecuted for it ( as long as there is no evidence that the decision was made for corrupt reasons).THe supreme court  on the other hand, has basically decided that if you are the president you can do whatever for whatever reason.  For example here Trump was using the supreme court decision to argue that bribing  a porn star  in order to influence an election should be  an act from which he is immune. You will note that this is not a discretionary action undertaken as part of his duty as president and also that  it is an action that is blatantly corrupt.

The question here is simple: Does the NY DA's office spend 6 years and thousands of hours of manpower reviewing Donald Trump's business records but for him being a political opponent of the Democratic Party? Does this same DA, who has in every other case sought to turn violent felonies into misdemeanors, insist on elevating a misdemeanor into 34 felonies?No one actually thinks the answer to these questions is yes, they just think that it's good because it's Donald Trump.

Their prison sentence being excempt from pryiing eyes. At best current or future employers can request a \\"yes or no\\" answer from police if a person has commited any crimes related to the employer's field of responsibility. Though only if the person is applying for a job, or already work there, and only if the employer is within a field that's allowed to request (financial, childcare, handling drugs/alcohol, handling firearms/explosives, handling inmates, etc).   \\nThough in my own country most of these will also return \\"no crime\\" if enough time has passed. Minimum being 3 years after release/conviction. That being said there are other safeguards from ensuring serial convicts from returning to jobs with extended responsibilities. Imaging someone working for an employer for 5 years, get caught stealing, then serves 2 years in prison for it. The former employer might not be allowed to tell about the crime if asked for references, but can still informer new employer that they had full justification to fire the person.  The person applying for new job also will have a 2 year \\"hole\\" they'll need to give a rational reason for. That's not assuming they decide to \\"forget\\" to mention their former employer, and now have to explain a 7 year \\"hole\\" in their CV.   \\nA former employer openly telling they fired the person, and the person not finding work for 2 years is often by itself enough to make getting re-hired near impossible. You don't even need to commit a crime at all. Make no mistake. Prison should take away freedom. Freedom to move, freedom to choose, and freedom to information. But that's it. It should also be a place where whatever forced/caused someone to seek criminal activity is fixed/mitigated. Eg. drug use is often due to lack of access to proper treatments/medication, or to mentally escape impossible situations. Like being unemployed combined with being homeless, lack of formal education, and complex health problems. If none of that is looked into, then that person will just end up coming back. Likely costing more money than what investing in helping the person improve would ever cost. Last note. But what about people not commiting crimes should they also be helped. YES! Invest in the citizens. Giving them access to cheaper education, healthcare, social safety nets, support programs, etc. They might cost money, but they also reduce the chance of regular folks seeking criminal acts to live. Not having access to these does make people more motivated to seek income... however that also means income through crime. If legal work is impossible through lack of educations or health, then they will seek crime to survive.","title":"These convicted felons say if Trump can be elected president they shouldnt face a stigma when applying for jobs"},{"text":"Check the sidebar!

I'm always frustrated with laypeople's perceptions of our judicial system. As a lawyer, I can assure you that 99% of the differences between the \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" justices comes down to how they apply philosophical/theoretical perspectives (which have been around for 100 years by the way) to a particular legal problem. I wrote an explanation for laypeople some time ago and I'll try to find it and link to it. I promise the justices aren't just doing whatever they want. People only hear about the big culture war related topics like abortion, guns, etc., but the justices see things very similarly overall. There have been arbitrary decisions, yes, but those decisions came from all sides of the court throughout the centuries. I'd like to highlight two cases for you that are good examples. Justice Kavanagh wrote a fairly pro-environmental protection concurrence in Sackett v. EPA. He applied a theory typically favored by \\"conservative\\" justices. Justice Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in Bostock, which extended workplace protections, applying the same approach. I would write you a book chapter defending the institution of the S. Ct., but I have a job.3. Evidence for this? Would it be different from how the Democrat Party treated Bernie Sanders (three times), Tulsi Gabbard and a slew of other candidates in 2020, or RFK Jr. (lifelong democrat, environmental attorney, and *Kennedy*)? Talk about undemocratic... The Republican Party establishment *loathed* Trump when he ran in 2016. Even diehards like Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney and Nikki Haley clung to the Bush-era Party as long as they could. Liz Cheney is still clinging to it. Probably because her dad was VP at the time... who knows..4. Biden *currently* has a \\"stacked military\\" and could do it right now. Trump didn't last time and won't do it this time. He could have fired generals and \\"stacked\\" it last time. He is the commander in chief. *Every* president since George Washington has had the same extensive power to do this. Trump has been consistent in that he wants the whole country to succeed. Launching an impossible military coup is not part of that. Even if it were, it would be practically impossible because that's not what the military personnel want and it's not what the armed population wants (2A). There are enough checks and balances to prevent this from happening. You can dislike Trump all you want. I can relate. You can dislike his policies all you want. I could relate if we were speaking several years ago. But the idea that he will become a dictator is not going to happen. The thought is, respectfully, outlandish.

He threatened to \\"lock \\\\[Hillary Clinton\\\\] up.\\" When he actually came into office he refused to do so because he thought it would be terrible for national unity and bringing people together to prosecute a former first lady. He has said what I relay to you now in multiple interviews since then. Many people in the Republican Party were pressing him to do it in the early days of his administration. Hillary Clinton deleted tens of thousands of emails *in violation of a Congressional subpoena*! She insinuated that these were just irrelevant to the Congressional inquiry but there are two problems with that. First, claiming evidence is irrelevant is not a justification to destroy it forever. I've seen lawsuits where emails are subpoenaed and the first thing any honest lawyer tells you is not to delete anything relevant because it's a serious ethical violation that could get you disbarred if you advocate for things like that. Those deletions look extremely suspicious, but the world will never know what was on those hard drives. Second, a technician with the company that maintained the data on Clinton's servers told the FBI in the investigation that Clinton's team requested that the emails be deleted shortly after the Benghazi attack. **Bottom line**: Clinton was in deep sh-t and Trump refused to prosecute to help promote national unity. 4. I'm not sure how this fits \\"why he'll try,\\" but if it's true and people like you can see through it then there are plenty of other eyes on it if there is a threat in the future. Therefore, it becomes less likely, not more likely.5. Trump has promised to remove incompetent generals. Like the one who played a part in logistically botching the Afghanistan withdrawal. Generals may have started as field soldiers, but they are government employees in very bureaucratic positions. I've worked in government and the private sector. Everything I've seen tells me many (not all, but many) government employees and middle managers of the bureaucracy expect nothing to challenge their position in that bureaucracy. Trump fired a few people last time for incompetence and they lashed out at him. I've also heard the term \\"loyalist\\" being thrown around a lot. Every time Trump nominates or plans to appoint someone who agrees with him on policy the media call that person a \\"loyalist.\\" Guess what, Biden *only* hired loyalists. When is the last time you heard a top bureaucrat trash talk Biden? Part of the reason is he refuses to fire *anyone*. Mayorkas should have resigned years ago out of embarrassment for failure to do his job. Then when he didn't Biden should have fired him. That never happened, so you've never heard Mayoraks say anything bad about Biden. **Addressing \\"why he'll succeed\\":**1. Republicans have been complaining about this for years. Democrats have been fighting voter ID laws and paper ballots since I was politically active over a decade ago. We should have paper ballots and proof of citizenship required to register.

About one year into his presidency I thought \\"wow that article got so much wrong,\\" article after article. I started consuming media from both sides of the spectrum. Two years into his presidency I didn't care for him on a personal level (and still don't), but was happy with a lot of what he was accomplishing (paid family leave for lots of gov't employees, lowered my taxes, etc.). The covid lockdowns long after the science supported it broke me and turned me pro-Trump. Mischaracterization after mischaracterization and borderline lies were perpetrated by the media.

So he used that phrase to basically say \\"people who make that claim about me think enforcing border laws passed by Congress makes someone a dictator, so if people are going to misuse the term, f-ck it, I'll use it to describe me enforcing laws Congress passed.\\" He was talking about reversing illegal immigration and fossil fuel energy production on federal lands. Both things that literally every president for decades (if not a century) has done or tried to do. Finally, he wasn't a dictator during his first term. \\n2. This is not a violation of the First Amendment. Trump is entirely within his right to try to sue an organization that editorializes before it publishes content if that content affects him AND is untrue. Outside of the political context, those lawsuits are fairly standard as a species of libel, depending on the actual allegations. The First Amendment does not mean that the press can say whatever it wants; the Amendment only protects (simplifying) true statements or statements of opinion or statements that are very difficult to get to the bottom of. That's part of the reason that journalistic standards promote such careful wording. Trump thinks Ann Selzer knew or had reason to know that the poll she published was false or misleading in a way that effected his rights in the election.

That's why I did this post. NOW,  surprisingly, when I do that same search again on Instagram, I'm getting some videos and reels in my search results. Funny how the algorithm works. For any of you Interested to verify what I'm saying, message me, and I'll send you the screenshots from a fairly lengthy  conversation. I wanted to see what the bot would say to questions I had. For example,  was the Hunter Biden laptop store or  Donald Trump is a Russian agent, were those confirmed stories?  Were they true? It said no.  I asked, then why was it censored and completely suppressed for months right before a presidential election?

Sleep deprivation has been shown to decrease 1 point per hour of sleep deprivation, and builds on itself over time. So a week of lost sleep will have lost upwards of 15+ IQ points. I would really think this conversation would greatly improve if you did less guestimates and engaged with what I'm writing.I already provided multitudes of examples that show IQ isn't static - which goes directly against your point that IQ are preordained. I gave an accessible answer, but we haven't even gotten into the vast array of environmental pressures individuals face. Such as, neonatal nutrition. Say we get two identical twin zygotes - implant them in two separate mothers. There will be a huge distinction between the zygote that goes into the mother that has adequate nutrition compared to the one that goes to the mother that does not. Nor have we gotten into the impacts of exposure to pollutants, to traumatic events, to a zillion of examples. All of them lead up to the idea that there's no chance that results are preordained. The type of mindset I am perpetuating should never be applied on a day to day basisThis seems like a change in view. The title and body of your entire post was that IQ preordains all success. But I've demonstrated that other factors have a huge effect on success.Here:?such as unchangeable factors like lets say geneticsYou suggest that genetics are \\"unchangeable factors\\" but that has been thoroughly debunked. There's entire branch of research that goes into epigenetics - the study of how genes can be \\"turned on or off\\" via environmental cues. and many cases of success among people with lower IQ'sThis sub is called \\"change my view.\\" When people have changed your view, you should award a delta. This isn't a debate sub. This isn't \\"read a paragraph and try to find all the things wrong with it sub.\\" Your CMV was all about how it's impossible for someone with low IQs to succeed. This looks like a change in view to me.   \\nWeird argument.First - this isn't a debate sub. I'm not arguing. I provided an example. The entire evidence of Bill being intelligent has rested on the success of his company. Second - this case study proves my point quite a bit. It wasn't Bill being smart. It was Bill going to a high school that had access to a computer in an era where only elite institutions had computers. So he had thousands of hours of coding experience. It was this exposure that Bill even had the idea for a PC.Then Bill surrounded himself with smart people to help him build his company. Excel, for instance, was a program he bought the rights of. He didn't program it himself. He didn't come up with the idea. It wasn't his smarts. It was the capital he had raised, the foresite, and being at the right place at the right time.That's what this entire thing has been about. Your view has been IQ = success. I am showing all the various factors that help success that aren't IQ driven. like capital, access, of having adequate neonatal nutrition, of having childhood nutrition, etc. etc., all play into it.","title":"CMV: Success is mostly genetic and predetermined, and hard work beats intelligence is an entirely false sentiment."},{"text":"Two things happen to go up across different timeframes and at different rates is not a meaningful correlation.","title":"Trump on Vaccines &amp; Autism: \\"Something's Wrong.

I will give you three examples of mechanism that make the process complex to prevent frivolity. Res Judicata (preclusion). Preclusion is one way the law prevents dragged on trials that would make it impossible for 99% cases to reach resolution. It prevents duplicate litigation and harassment and promotes diligence, efficiency and accountability. Summary Judgments and Doctrine of Standing are two legal mechanisms against frivolity. The first allows the court to dismiss a case without a trial if there is no genuine dispute of material fact (lack of evidence). The second makes it so that the plaintiff has to show they have a direct, concrete interest in the case.Here are a few that act not to prevent frivolous lawsuits but to protect you from State Power in criminal court:  prohibition against vagueness (vague writing of the law), prohibition of ex post facto laws (retroactive criminalisation) and the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine (evidence). All of the things I mentioned have specific applications. Some need to be pointed out in specific moments of the trail. The other plaintiff will argue against. You need to demonstrate technically why your are correct. The judge is not there to help the weaker part, you will need to argue them technically. He is also not there to ascertain the truth but only that which can be proved. Those rules can make litigation longer and complex. But they serve real purpose. And they are only a handful. There are many more.","title":"CMV: private lawyers make the US legal system flawed"},{"text":"It's not about how I feel haha. It's about you being very biased in your risk perception.

In contrast, the Trump administration's policies, such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and rolling back environmental regulations, have been widely criticized by scientists and environmental experts.It's also worth noting that the Biden administration's increase in oil production is largely a result of policies put in place by the previous administration, and they have taken steps to balance this with investments in clean energy and reducing emissions.Let's not conflate the two administrations' approaches to climate policy.

If it is, then why is it that physical exercise, healthy diet, sleep, mental exercises, mindfulness, are all contributing factors to getting a higher IQ score? If IQ were static, how can one improve IQ scores?That is a good argument in the sense that IQ tests should always be done when someone is at their highest functioning, not sleep deprived and in a healthy mental state. Having a poor lifestyle can contribute to IQ to a certain degree. By certain degree, I mean very small deviations of maybe 3 to 4 points. That doesn't mean that your IQ was \\"increased\\", more so that it allowed you to perform at your highest capacity.I really invite you to read Carol Dweck's research on mindsets. What you're describing is a fixed mindset, which means that human abilities are static. That means success/failures are a commentary on your outer limits. It also means you can't learn from your mistakes since they're borne from your limitations.   \\n  \\nThe contrast is the growth mindset, which means that human abilities are dynamic. That means a failure is not a comment on your outer limits. Instead, it shows where you can grow. A person with a growth mindset will embrace challenges, learn from criticism, they can celebrate efforts, reflect on failures.I agree. The type of mindset I am perpetuating should never be applied on a day to day basis but only when discussing or debating something such as unchangeable factors like lets say genetics and intelligence. It is not beneficial and can actually stunt your progress and disable your ability to notice your true potential, if you have any.To a certain extent, IQ is necessary, but it's not sufficient. Where I really push back on is whether extraordinary IQ is needed for success. We know it isn't because success isn't shared evenly among those who have high IQs. You can be successful with an average IQ but have vision, drive, and surround yourself with others.There are variations and many cases of success among people with lower IQ's is often attributed to economic status of parents and available resources, as well as circumstancial luck, but it is rare, and usually can also be chalked up to other gifts such as networking ability (emotional intelligence). It accounts for a very few cases and doesn't disprove the fact that intelligence is linked to success on a broader scale, and I myself stated in my post that there are exceptions.The idea that Bill Gates is successful because he's, singularly smart, is funny because he isn't the only person in the company. What he did was be in the right place at the right time, had the right vision, and hired all the right supporting people that helped his company scale.Weird argument. Bill Gates worked together with other intelligent people to build a company. And obviously his ability to take advantage of the situation and have the \\"right vision\\" still required a high level of intelligence and critical thinking as well as cognitive ability. A lot of people have the right vision and still fail at the execution part.","title":"CMV: Success is mostly genetic and predetermined, and hard work beats intelligence is an entirely false sentiment."},{"text":"I literally mentioned both of those things","title":"CMV: Success is mostly genetic and predetermined, and hard work beats intelligence is an entirely false sentiment."},{"text":"That would indeed throw a wrench into things.

The collapse of civic groups in the US means people turn more and more toward online communities to find people who share interests. Form a group based around something you enjoy  hiking, basketball, board games, whatever  and advertise it any way you can. Its harder to be a troll during face to face interactions, especially if youre meeting up for a neutral (read: non-political) activity. Community building is vital, which leads me to the second recommendation.People function better when theyre have a sense of purpose. (You dont need to believe in the divine to understand that religion gives people a sense of purpose, and that rapid secularization can leave many feeling adrift.) Young men in particular are feeling like their lives lack meaning; when the dominant narrative is that men are supposed to be strong providers, income inequality can feed into feelings of inadequacy and anger. While you dont have to make your group explicitly about charity or civic organizing, it may not hurt to have your group do something once a month/a few times a year to give back to the community. Maybe you have a food drive that features some friendly competition (top donor gets a gift card, or just bragging rights), or learn a skill together that can be used to help people in need.

The system there is setup to help those not specialised on the law to navigate the legal system in smaller cases in which there is less on the line without a lawyer. As the cases get bigger, the system adds protections. Criminal court has more protections than civil court. Matters of minors have more protections than those of adults. Most cases are complex, in my experience. People tend to let it go of the more simple ones. Going to court is a taxing experience. If a person comes knocking on my door, it usually is for complex matters. (I will add that I work in a more specialised field and there are lawyers who feed on the simple ones. But the people who look for those, they would look anyway. They want the reassurance, not the expertise.) The technology is not there yet. Maybe it will be. Maybe one day my work will be obsolete. It has happened to many before, Im not foolish enough to think it couldnt happen to me. Filling your taxes is a matter of numbers and formulas. The law (even tax law) is a matter of context. You (mostly) dont go to court to argue the math behind taxes, you go to court to argue the application of the tax in a specific context. Evidence is important but only one slice of the process. There are so many more, that can be applied differently for more reasons than you can imagine it and than I could ever list of the top of my head. I dont disagree that the system if unfair and flawed. It benefits the rich and powerful. But the complexity of it is there to protect us all. Most matters I see on court are very serious. Even if they might not sound like it, for the people I represent, they are a top priority on their mind.

These are very subjective things. There's a fairly well known correlation between intelligence and depression, which would indicate that higher IQ people are less likely to be fulfilled in life.If your definition of success is financial success, then as another commenter mentioned you need to consider capital. Let's look at a few scenarios that may convince you of the importance of being born wealthy if you want to guarantee financial success:1. Two people take a medical school admissions test. One comes from a wealthy background, had ample time to study due to not needing to work and their parents paid for tutoring. They get 1% above the score needed for admission. The second person needs to work to keep a roof over their head, minimising their time and energy for studying, and also has no personal tutoring to assist them with their studies. Despite this, they score well but miss the score needed for admission by 1%. The person who got in is able to become a doctor and earn the relevant wage. The person who misses out makes far less money over a lifetime in comparison. Would you say the second person is lower IQ or simply had far less resources?2. The same situation as the above but in this case, both people score the exact same 1% above the required threshold for admission. However the fees for the course are massive, and the course also requires long periods of unpaid internship. Person 1 has parents who can afford to help them with the fees and support them when they're undertaking an unpaid internship. Person 2 is wary at taking such a large loan and doesn't know how they will survive while making no income. They either abandon their dream or they try and fail. Same as above for income differential. Is person 2 lower IQ?I know this is a specific example, but you can apply this more generally as well. People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to go to worse schools, have additional obligations and stressors, are reliant on scholarships, and once all that's done may also not have the familial connections that someone from a wealthier background may have. In fact, to use the medical school example again, in both Australia (where I am) and the United States the majority of doctors come from wealthy backgrounds. Is it possible that existing wealth provides resources and opportunities that make it more feasible for people to nourish and grow their intellect? And that without these resources an intellect with greater overall potential may be under-nourished, leading to the belief that you hold now?","title":"CMV: Success is mostly genetic and predetermined, and hard work beats intelligence is an entirely false sentiment."},{"text":"Not even the somewhat historical context.

Regardless of president or party, having that type of control can lead to trying to jam through hard to reverse core party policy and do so in ways that infringe on rights and freedoms of citizens. And trump at the helmand he is the guy who tried to overthrow an election (the magnitude of how dumbshit and unsophisticated his attempt was gives me a degree of hope in terms of his capacity to actually figure out the beauracratic abuse needed to become a dictator in the states)Its a bit of a perfect storm in that sense, and at a time the democrats are more or less in a state of disarray and largely incompetent at a party level right now in terms of how to navigate the situation.  And to a certain extent the key factor here to keep the republicans in check is a solid dem opposition because one thing Trump is *not* going to be able to do is stop the election process all together.The first thing the Dems can do is accept what the British Government did (labor, not conservative) which is ban puberty blockers (in the British case pause for more study which is damning they were ever used at all given science clearly was fudged and lied about including by dem party officials in a way involving childrens health) It was the first thing Trump brought up in announcing his election campaign, and he mentioned it early and often on the stump.  It also was mentioned by Putin in his last public statements before assaulting Ukraine (he called it child abuse).  Theres a code of silence in dem circles about it, but moderates have despised the dem policy and lies about science and their push to get it in schoolsand it looked like 14 million of them sitting this election out.  The next thing they need to do is get rid of the Clinton / Obama / Biden power in the dem party, nor ever, ever, run as their candidate someone who was selected by them without a primary process (Biden / Kamala basically became dictators of the dem party when he and she appointed her as the dem candidate).  Not going to get into all the problems with Obama Biden Clinton and their flunkies like Harris, but Biden was the head of senate intelligence in the lead up to the Iraq War, Clinton was making jest about killing the leader of a place where women and girls can no longer leave the house without male supervision and veils, and Al Queda just took Damascus with guns Obama gave them after 700k people died when Obama called for regime change war after 80% of the nations cattle died and 60% of the farmland turned to desert in the worst drought ever and flooded the Sunni Islamic fundamentalist strongholds with guns instead of Syria with water and food.Hopey Changey stuff sounds good but the truth is the Dems who promised to be the change from the Iraq War Cheney Bush crew in fact were just the same, and in fact Biden as head of senate intelligence was basically Cheneys hunting partner.These things matter.  And the dems need to drop this crew, now, and find better people who are better candidates who arent covered in blood and guts.If they can do that, and quickly, they will be back in control of the house and senate in two years because Trump and many republicans are in fact, schmucks.  But the dems have been so so so so bad since 08 about so so so so many life and death matters that to a certain extent many people agree that many of their high ranking members should be prosecuted *with good cause*They are way to easy beat right now and way to evil to support.  And thats emboldening the extreme parts of the conservatives to move in ways a moderate, competent, Democratic Party would quite easily prevent.In the interim, Trump is pushing 80.  He is not a threat in the sense of ending American elections and in a lot of ways has pretty much destroyed cultural conservativatism once and for all in the states - his base is WWE republicans who have a few rum and cokes and take a picture with Santa and then watch football.  I dont want to get cocky about that and speak to soonand his right hand man is the leading electric car salesman / climate change not denier in the world really whose company Tesla employee policy is not anywhere near the Christian conservative baseline and in fact socially is more or less a liberal.The best thing is to wait him out - Trump is a spectacularly unique figure in American history - from apprentice to Tyson fights to towers to WWE hall of fame.  He cannot be replaced.  There will only ever be one like him.  And hes near 80.  The best thing for everyone is to wait him out, support moderate reasonable dems and repubs, and oddly enough Im hopeful when he leaves he may have carved out a sort of odd middle ground space where 10 years from now there is actually a lot of room for the country to unite in this new ageOf course America is also super ready for a third major party and many more.","title":"CMV: Trump will be a dictator."},{"text":"Because doctors are well paid compared to public defenders.

Most of the success that comes from being smart comes from being seen as smart by people around you, (making scholastic achievement feel good) while still being able to connect to the motivators of people of more average intelligence. People with very high IQs expect different things, which means they find different things fun or funny, and can be less good at anticipating reactions for the general population.

Of course a talented or intelligent person will learn things much quicker, and nothing beats an intelligent person who also works hard.

It doesn't mean that there isn't a correlation between success and IQ (of course there's a correlation, it would be weird if there weren't one), but rather that there's also a correlation between success and hardwork, and that graph is steeper than the former. Another huge misconception you seem to be under is that you're assuming IQ to be some fixed number assigned at birth based on your genetics. Intelligence can be developed, and learnt over time, as it often is.I'm a music teacher, and I've seen \\"mediocre\\" students outperform \\"talented\\" ones because the talented ones weren't as disciplined or diligent.

I will seek out \\"field trips\\" with other homeschoolers so my kids can get hands on learning at a kids museum as well as social opportunities. I will also seek any once a week private programs so my kids can socialize and/or learn how to take direction from an adult who isn't me.My hard limit will be 11, but I'll start thinking about return closer to age 9.

Additionally if my kids want to go to public school before then I'll arrange a trial period and happily let them go full time if it goes well. If I'm missing anything I'll be happy to read it. I respect teachers on a per person basis, but I think even the best teacher is hampered by Americas school system. Basically I don't want school to be daycare.

You know many people who succeed with a high IQ, but there are also many people with extremely high IQ who fail because they fail to work hard or make smart life decisions.Secondly, a factor playing as an big of a role than IQ is upbringing. Only about 57-80% of IQ is purely genetic, and the education you get while you are still a baby plays a big role in one's intelligence. After all, poor living condition or malnutritions greatly harms prospects at success while good living conditions and educations can give you soft skills which are not based on IQ at all. Finally, in the right social class, you get a network which help you succeed : you know a friend of a friend who can get you an internship. Your father is an alumni who can get you into your university. You get a house and a stable life while creating your business. Upbringing and class is an even bigger factor in success than pure genetic. Finally, I think defining success as \\"the top of the literal social and economic hierarchy\\" is debatable. Success is different for anyone and even the dumbest people with enough effort can become an electrician for up to 87k a year, a good success in relative sense. For the average person, becoming an accountant and putting in enough time can get you quickly promoted and making above 100k a year, a success according to most. Finally, if one has a marketable skill, he can just go into business, forget all work-life balance and succeed in most regards. Sure, genetics plays a big role in the top of the ladder, but you don't need billions to succeed, a few hundred thousands can be enough.","title":"CMV: Success is mostly genetic and predetermined, and hard work beats intelligence is an entirely false sentiment."},{"text":"Yes and no.

If it is, then why is it that physical exercise, healthy diet, sleep, mental exercises, mindfulness, are all contributing factors to getting a higher IQ score? If IQ were static, how can one improve IQ scores?I really invite you to read Carol Dweck's research on mindsets. What you're describing is a fixed mindset, which means that human abilities are static. That means success/failures are a commentary on your outer limits. It also means you can't learn from your mistakes since they're borne from your limitations.The contrast is the growth mindset, which means that human abilities are dynamic. That means a failure is not a comment on your outer limits. Instead, it shows where you can grow. A person with a growth mindset will embrace challenges, learn from criticism, they can celebrate efforts, reflect on failures. What every successful person I've ever read has in common is their first ventures tended to fail. They aren't afraid of failure. They learn from them. They cultivate curiosity and have a generally positive outlook on life. Put this way, why would you go through the process of venture capitalism to get monies to grow your idea if you're not optimistic it'll work?To a certain extent, IQ is necessary, but it's not sufficient. Where I really push back on is whether extraordinary IQ is needed for success. We know it isn't because success isn't shared evenly among those who have high IQs. You can be successful with an average IQ but have vision, drive, and surround yourself with others.The idea that Bill Gates is successful because he's, singularly smart, is funny because he isn't the only person in the company. What he did was be in the right place at the right time, had the right vision, and hired all the right supporting people that helped his company scale.","title":"CMV: Success is mostly genetic and predetermined, and hard work beats intelligence is an entirely false sentiment."},{"text":"Reverse-RBG","title":"Another Federal Judge Reverses Decision To Retire, Ruins Trumps Plans To Fill His Seat"},{"text":"Still an absolute must win.

A lot of parents think their skepticism alone makes them more qualified to be an educator for their kids, when they themselves are not educated, or do not know how to be good teachers.It's not that the system is perfect, because it obviously isn't. My argument is more that you need to *prove* that your child will be better off, instead of just surfacing basic criticisms of a system.There are kids that are homeschooled *very poorly* and I can guarantee you that *all* of their parents *thought* they could do better than the school system. They couldn't. They got stuck in the trap of C \\"a system is imperfect, so I will remove my kid from it without a well considered plan to ensure they can succeed in spite of it\\". So the big question is C **what makes your approach different?**You need to demonstrate more than just criticism - you need to show genuine teaching capability, or that your kid will actually get more educational resources under you.

Particularly major platforms like Tiktok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc, that are riddled with misinformation, fearmongering propaganda, unsubstantiated rumors, foreign disinformation, and partisan political messaging. All of which receive far more engagement and \\"clicks\\" than anything resembling nuanced points of view or facts.Studies consistently show that the truth is, well, boring in comparison, and algorithms are designed to inundate user's feeds with the most divisive, incendiary, and propagandistic content imaginable. Which means that the more credible and unvarnished the information may be, the more likely it is to be buried beneath this gish gallop of \\"churnalism.\\"It also means that the people managing these social media accounts are encouraged to continue publishing this type of content because it's much more effective at reaching wider audiences. Combine this with the distressing fact that social media users have been desensitized and primed to engage more with online caricatures, internet trolls, political agitators, and clickbaiters, and you've got yourself a recipe for an uninformed electorate.Additionally, many Americans care far more about their immediate circumstances than say, Donald Trump's incompetency, or his threat to core Democratic values. An alarming percentage of the American electorate are also low propensity voters with short memories. So It can be challenging just to make the case that Donald Trump's foreign and economic policy was more disastrous than people remember. Walter Lippman, one of the most influential journalists in American history, in so few words, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" nearly a century ago. If he could only see things today, he'd certainly lose all faith in the American people.He argued that Americans aren't making politically informed decisions. This still rings true today, and perhaps more than ever.It's not just Americans who are to blame, it's the people responsible for disseminating information, the content creators, the news media and the multinational corporations that own and control the industry, the owners and overseers of social media platforms, all of the political players and organizations that enable and fund the circulation of this content, and as some might argue, even the government agencies not doing enough to hold these parties accountable. That last one is up for debate of course. We have to face it, we live in a country where our elections are often decided by low propensity voters and the misinformed. And a lot of people take advantage of that. Is this how democracy should function? I don't know, that's another topic entirely. But moving forward, if we want to fix this problem, the onus will be on the rest of the country to figure out a way to help Americans make more politically informed decisions, and instead of voter's *feelings* deciding the outcome of our elections.","title":"Trump Claims He Won Young Voters 'By 34 Points' As Election Results Show He Actually Lost Youth Vote To Kamala"},{"text":"Trump will probably sue Post Herald Times for not lying for him.","title":"Trump Claims He Won Young Voters 'By 34 Points' As Election Results Show He Actually Lost Youth Vote To Kamala"},{"text":"A) We DO have competent indigent defense attorneys.B) Going back to the issue you raised with the Simpson case, how does preventing someone from hiring the best lawyer they can find prevent cops from mishandling their investigation?","title":"CMV: private lawyers make the US legal system flawed"},{"text":"Then why doctors don't all tell their patients they all have terminal cancers and should just pack up and go home?","title":"CMV: private lawyers make the US legal system flawed"},{"text":"Awful President.","title":"Awful Precedent: ABC Gets Whacking for Rolling Over and Settling Trump Suit\\n | The network had previously tried to get his lawsuit dismissed"},{"text":"Is that the guy that repeatedly called Harris \\"Comrade Kamala\\"?","title":"Trump suggests reversing permission for Ukraine to use US missiles in Russia"},{"text":"The coup attempt was public, and he **was** indicted over it.

As you try to make the system as fair as possible you start to add obstacles to avoid abuse, from both the State Power and the parties involved. But you can never predict by the letter of law every case so you need to make them broad and generic and add many of them as you try to perfect the system. And that adds complexity to the legal system. The rules are not there to prevent you from partaking in it, they are there to protect you from the very many different ways it can be abused. And so people need to specialise in it to make it work effectively. Are there unnecessary rules? Sure. But there are many more that are there for a very real reason that doesnt seem obvious because the problem has been corrected by those rules for a long time. One important part of law school is learning how to think the law and for that you need to understand why that law was needed. Sometimes its obvious, frequently it isnt. If you simplify it so anyone can partake in it without specialising in it you will just run into the same abuses we already did and find yourself wanting to make rules to prevent it.

The commute to school (or the grocery store) is far more dangerous than being in a school.Cars are safer. With kids buckled safely into seats, my phone tucked away if not needed to be a GPS and the will to let the kid babble and ignore any screaming I'd feel safe. The thought of my child gunned down in a place they're supposed to be safe and happy feels so much scarier and more real.Schools occasionally use software on tablets or computers. For example, my grade school daughter has used a computer to type stories, and they used a math program to learn some math concepts. I think learning to type, and in limited situations using tablets for learning is just fine. It's not like they're zoned out watching YouTube.Kids vs IT staff is a battle thats been fought since the schools got internet. In my experience kids always win and share their tips with classmates. Weirdly I somewhat like that, it shows they can learn to use technology and problem solve. However, it can impede with learning and I'd rather my kids not be given tablets at all. This isn't even getting into why I want my kid walking around with a camera and microphone the school gave them. Yes I worry about my phone recording me and don't bring it into doctors appointments, even thought I'm less important to large corporations than my kid would be to a school.I haven't seen / heard any \\"I said so\\" learning. As far as I can tell, teachers are very interested in kids asking questions, explaining science/math in seventeen different ways to try to make them understand numbers. I think you should talk to a teacher at a local school before assuming some type of memorization style teaching. I've always been impressed when I talked to a real human.I'm sure they would. The reality is at least one kid who want to get laughs from classmates or make a teachers life hard because they don't want to be in school or are embarrassed at their lack of math essence. Somethings got to give and it makes a teachers day and mood that much harder. I don't blame them but I don't trust my own kid to learn well in that environment.Banned books make the news, but it's not a huge thing. It's not like there's a short limited list of books allowed in schools. And there's nothing stopping you from assigning your own kid some reading of banned books if you think an important one was skipped. But there's such a long list of excellent books they'll read in school.That's a good point, but the concept of a banned book makes it hard to trust a schools leadership. What else are they trying to make child avoid? Will my child be made into an outcast for bringing the topic up in class? Wouldn't that make a teachers job harder even if they agree with the topic, they'd still but their job at risk for allowing the discussion.I feel they did a really good job of history lessons. They barely mention \\"columbus day\\", which has mostly been renamed. They talk about native americans, and how they were poorly treated. I think the complex topics (long term racism impact on suburban demographics for example) take time to teach, but they're not \\"white washing\\" everything - they're giving them age appropriate explanations of topics their brains could understand. Not something you'd be able to credibly teach a kid before middle school anyway.That is reliving to know, but the concepts of \\"America perfect\\" start way too young and are way too broad for impressionable young brains.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"There is a huge problem with over-classification in this country.

A Russian victory would not only damage the United States interest in European security and increase U.S. military requirements in Europe; it would also compound the threats from China, Iran, and North Korea. * The Biden administrations apparent belief that Putins imperial ambitions could be managed with arms control and U.S. restraint was not dissimilar to right-wing isolationists misplaced interest in accommodating Russia.* As it became clear that Putin would launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, I urged Biden to offer meaningful lethal aid to Ukraine and expand the U.S. military footprint in Europe. But the president demurred. Even after the invasion, the Biden administrations assistance to Ukraine was beset by hesitation, needless restrictions, and endless deliberation. These delays repeatedly ceded the initiative to Moscow and diluted the effectiveness of U.S. aid, prolonging the conflict and diminishing Kyivs negotiating leverage. The weakness of the Biden administrations policies was drowned out by frenzied attention to some Republicans objections to supporting Ukraine.* For now, Putins indifference to his own peoples suffering has allowed him to increase his defense industrial bases capacity to pump arms and soldiers into Ukraine. His ability to do this in perpetuity is questionable; Russian victory is inevitable only if the West abandons Ukraine.* Trump will hear from neo-isolationists who discount the importance of American allies to American prosperity, ignore the need for the United States credibility among fence sitters in critical regions, and misunderstand the basic requirements of the U.S. military to deter or win faraway conflicts. Their arguments elide the fact that the enemy gets a vote, too, and may decide to confront the United States simultaneously on multiple fronts, at which point allies become more valuable than ever.* The unwillingness of the Asia first crowd to welcome European allies progress is curious. They ignore a glaring need to work with allies to counter Chinese threats to shared interests, raising the question of whether they are really interested in contesting China after all. Some even seem to have seized on the need to counter China as a rationale for the United States to abdicate leadership everywhere else, suggesting that Asia first is merely an excuse for underlying isolationism.* China has for years sought to drive a wedge between the United States and its partners. It is tragic that the Asia first crowd would so obviously play into Beijings hands, just as previous administrations that had turned their back on allies in the Middle East opened the door to Chinese influence in that critical region.* And yet for years, congressional opponents of military spending absurdly insisted that there be parity between increases in defense spending and increases in nondefense discretionary spending, holding military power hostage to pet political projects. Meanwhile, domestic mandatory spending skyrocketed, and massive expenditures that circumvented the annual bipartisan appropriations process, such as the ironically named Inflation Reduction Act, included not a penny for defense.* During this American holiday from hard power, China and Russia have invested in asymmetric capabilities to offset the U.S. military edge. Today, their munitions in many categories can outrange U.S. versions, and their production can outpace the United States. This is to say nothing of their numerical advantage in key platforms, from missiles to surface vessels. Quantity has a quality of its own. Whats more, the wars of the future may well last longer and require far more munitions than policymakers have assumed, as both Israeli and Ukrainian munitions-expenditure rates suggest. U.S. stockpiles are insufficient to meet such a demand. For years, the military services have shortchanged munitions in favor of new weapons systems and platforms. This is not to downplay the need to modernize major weapons systems but to highlight the harmful tradeoffs imposed by inadequate defense budgets.* Congress has given the Pentagon the authority to sign multiyear procurement contractswhich limit the uncertainty sometimes caused by the annual appropriations processfor certain critical munitions. This approach and the money to back it up should both be extended to other long-range munitions and missile defense interceptors for which long-term demand is nearly certain. To expand production capacity, the Pentagon can also use the Defense Production Act, a 1950 law that allows the government to prioritize and steer resources toward the production of goods for national defense. Unfortunately, recent administrations have used this authority for purposes that have nothing to do with national security. Biden, for instance, invoked it for the production of solar panels. It is past time to put the defense back into the Defense Production Act.* The Trump administration should consider dramatically streamlining the process for commonly used munitions or preemptively building up inventories for export. The military should also consider maintaining larger stockpiles of weapons that can be more easily shared with allies and partners in times of crisis. Once the shooting starts, the time to build production capacity has passed.* To build an allied coalition of cutting-edge forces that can work together seamlessly, the United States must also be willing to share more technology. AUKUS, the United States security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom, can be a model for greater technology sharing with other trustworthy allies and partners.* The United States would be foolish to compete with China by itself. U.S. allies and partners represent a significant share of the global economy. It would be simply unaffordable to replicate all their supply chains domestically.* Obama deserves credit for negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership with U.S. allies in Asia, and I do not regret working with him to overcome the objections of protectionist Democrats in Congress. Beyond lowering trade barriers and expanding market access for U.S. companies, the agreement was designed to establish favorable rules of the road for international trade in a critical region of the world. The parties to the proposed agreement represented 40 percent of the global economy. But rather than strengthen and harness the power of Western economies, the first Trump administration and then the Biden administration sometimes actively antagonized them, including with tariffs that have strained relationships with allies and tested the patience of American consumers. This abdication was an invitation for China to expand its economic influence in Asia at the United States expense.* There is plenty of evidence that the globalist optimism of the 1990s was unfounded. Welcoming China and Russia into the World Trade Organization has not transformed their governments or economies, at least not in ways beneficial to the free world. Rather, both countries have exploited and undermined this and other international economic institutions. I am not naive about the downsides of international trade, but there is no question that free markets and free trade have been responsible for much of the United States prosperity. Thats why the United States and like-minded free-market economies must work together to reform the international trading system to protect U.S. interests from predatory trade practicesnot abandon the system entirely.* The United States urgently needs to reach a bipartisan consensus on the centrality of hard power to U.S. foreign policy. This fact must override both left-wing faith in hollow internationalism and right-wing flirtation with isolation and decline. The time to restore American hard power is now.All fantastic points. This was such a surprisingly good read and gives me optimism that the Republican senate will push back on Trump's isolationist tendencies.

I really really do. However. There's a reason that lawyers in the US are generally required to complete a 3 year professional degree after college. As a current law student, learning even the basics of the law around what kinds of lawsuits are allowed, how contracts operate, and how lawsuits function in court took an entire semester of full time classes. Learning the basics of property, how crimes work, and the structure of the constitutional government took another semester. How to deal with divorce and adoption is a full semester class. Estate planning is usually a 2 semester class. The first amendment rights are usually another semester. How cops are allowed to operate and collect evidence is another semester. Income tax is another full semester class. What kinds of evidence are allowed in court is another full semester class.Ultimately those classes are the basics of their areas. There's a lot that doesn't get covered. Beyond that there's an entire year long class on legal research and writing. As it stands the legal system is complex and the American legal system incorporates literally 1,000 years of case law. So even knowing what things you can sue for and what kinds of evidence you need to have after a car crash is half a semester of a law school crash. Then the full class on the rules of lawsuits and then a full class on how evidence works.

Loss?What drives outcomes really are the economics and the clients. Think of Donald Trump stiffing contractors. It isn't about right or wrong or how good the contract is.

That is a complaining witness but it isn't person v person, that is civil.

I'd be afraid that they're taking the 3-5 highlights of homeschooling - without regards to the downsides - but weighing against their entire experience of in-class schooling. I see some internal contradictions. For instance, you're saying you'd home school for the \\"first few years\\" but also that history is whitewashed. I think it's too tough of a task to ask pre-schoolers to learn that Thomas Jefferson raped slaves, right? That's more of highschool/college topics. And the underlying issue that you never really answer is *why are schools expected to be the exclusive knowledge giver*? If certain items are especially important, then you can always supplement what your kid is exposed to. What I'm saying is I don't see the mutual exclusivity.I also see that you cite the status quo uses more screens - but how do you think that home schools give their information? Either via screens or via a parent. Which means either more screens or a parent has to lose income and dedicate their day time to instructing a child. That leads to the issue of how qualified are you to teach?I have a 17 month old - she goes to an early learning center daycare. The people that run it are amazing and have seen decades of children's worth of childhood development. They constantly teach us little tricks here and there; for instance, introducing table food to baby when she was hitting 1 year old. She's an oly child (for now) and the amount that she's been around peers is more than we could normally do. It's really helped her out and helped her confidence. Seeing peers her own size helped her realize she can walk, too, and has driven her for other mile stones.I think that benefit of peer socialization goes along way.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"* ??Russian bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan","title":"Trump Manages to Make Ukraine War All About Himself"},{"text":"Its a crazy thing that it was his one huge massive legislative achievement, and he couldn't even run on it.

Its surprising to me that people follow the law as much as they do.And even after winning the case, they most likely won't get their lawyer fees back, and they lose the time and money from doing the lawsuit. The rich on the other hand, have the ability to hire the lawyer, and sees it more as a business expense than anything else.This is called the American rule. Compared to the English rule where the loser pays legal costs for both parties. This means that abusive lawsuits are cheaper in the US compared to most other countries.The rich can use legal means to drag out the legal process so the poor side cannot continue to afford their lawyers. Then the poor side will have to drop the case and accept In the end, when the rich side wins, they get their lawyer money back and the poor is in an even worse position.They do that now, and the American rule makes it cheaper for them to drag out cases. Attorneys, who know the other party can pay, would have a lot of incentive to stay on cases when they are confident they can win.Lastly, the rich can mount frivolous lawsuits, and just in general use the lawyer card to see \\"if things stick\\", while the poor have to very carefully think over whether a lawsuit is the right things to do, even if a law was broken against them.This is a great example of the weakness of the American rule. Even if there's no way they could win at trial, the lawsuit on its own is enough to coerce a settlement.Amusingly, I work at an insurance company doing data. This includes some general stuff about lawsuits, I.e., how much we have to spend on defense attorneys.

Public school education took a turn in the last 15 years or so. Read the book the knowledge gap and listen to the podcasts Sold a Story and Knowledge Matters. Its moreso about the failings of teaching literacy and comprehension vs math but its fucking shocking. Heres my little summary to get you started. Weve, as a teaching society, decided that rote memorization was too boring, not important (kids can just google things). We stopped teaching little kids facts about nature, society, history, and favored teaching Skills like identifying the main point of a reading excerpt to enhance reading comprehension. Same with math, we dont teach memorizing the multiplication tables but instead teach several different strategies to figure out an answer. This was thought it would help kids be better at algebra. And what researchers have realized over this nearly 20 yr experiment is that you need foundational knowledge (rote memorization, facts) to build upon in order to use your mental energy to actually solve the hard parts of math. You gotta be quick at the easy stuff so you can focus on the hard stuff. The quick stuff is stored as a different type of memory that can be recalled quickly and allows you to use your mental resources to do the hard stuff more efficiently. For reading, comprehension, and memory, its a similar thing. Knowledge is sticky like Velcro and a new fact needs something to stick to in order to make sense and be retained and built upon. Teachers were told that facts dont matter, so they stopped teaching first graders basic stuff about the world and didnt build upon topics. And now kids cant remember anything and we blame it on social media or their parents. Sold a story is about how teachers were told that phonics didnt matter and stopped teaching it in kindergarten for the past 20-30 years. And at least 30% of kids were not taught that letters made sounds and put together form words. They memorized the shape of words instead and were taught to guess at what a word is based on the first letter and the picture above. This contributed to a lifetime of poor reading and horrible spelling because they never learned the phonics rules (yes English has a lot but its still learnable).

These attacks are easier brushed off due to partisanship.  \\"Of course they'll say they are bad!\\" Instead make the unfair economic system and the uber wealthy the top villain. This is harder to brush off as partisan, and better taps into current frustrations with the status quo.  Something that Trump is really just going to make worse in his 2nd term. That doesn't mean ignore Trump/GOP of course, but to tie them back to unfair system when need be instead.  And they'll give us plenty ammo to use for that.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"They spent a year demonstrating their word is worthless on this issue.","title":"Netanyahu Tells Trump Israel Must Complete Its Victory"},{"text":"But Kyle Rittenhouse was ok right?","title":"Trump talks about Luigi Mangione killing CEO."},{"text":"The conspiracy is that you think you should be getting news from a social media app. Try searching for pics of your friends kid and you should have more luck","title":"Instagram censors today's Trump's press conference, saying the Biden administration knows the truth about the drones."},{"text":"Well yeah, Rittenhouse killed middle class people standing up for black Americans.
