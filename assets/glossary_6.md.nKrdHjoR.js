Upvote it if you have seen hard evidence it is true, and downvote it if it is completely unsubstantiated.There IS effectively hard evidence already. The anomalies in the data are much too specific to be natural, and they necessarily demand further investigation.  But beyond that, the problem with this attitude is: at what point would you accept evidence as \\"hard\\" though? When an official government entity says it or...? \\"Court cases?\\" Seriously, tell me what would count for you as hard evidence? I bet you don't even have a real specific idea of what that would be for you, which is kind of the point and why your statement is pointless and unfair. Regular old citizens only have what they can access for data or potential proof. They don't  have any special access or resources to produce the kind of proof you're talking about, so you can't expect that BEFORE you consider the possibility in at least and agnostic way. Right now, with the evidence we DO have, it at LEAST implies shenanigans and SHOULD be investigated in a thorough manner by some sort of authority, or even just respected investigative journalist. Even THOSE sources though would be dismissed as fake news yadda yadda by a lot of people, so the question remains, at what point WOULD you accept some evidence as \\"hard evidence\\".  You mentioned \\"reputation to lose\\" but who decides one's reputation these days? Respected leaders in their field are called hacks and liars by MAGAs etc. I submit it's an impossible condition to actually ever meet in a satisfying way, and people can just repeat a version of your first paragraph even if there's a mountain of evidence right in front of them. What actually matters right NOW is raising the possibility often enough, and as widespread as possible, so that more people start talking about it and thinking about it as a real possibility. It needs to go mainstream (and it has in the past few days, much more than it was a month ago). It's not appropriate to demand a priori proof before you'll even consider it (which, you should, since there's actually a mountain of circumstantial evidence, including what Trump said, and some actual evidence in the data we do have).","title":"Trump on Musk"},{"text":"Ya polio being transmitted worse by the shot than the wild virus SURLY isnt a conspiracy ??

I don't believe Trump had that many votes. We should have had real investigations back when Clinton and Trump claimed there was fraud in 2016. Agree? Do you know why none of the sus ballots Trump rants about in the GA call were usable in court as evidence? I do.... He held up counting of early/mail in til election day in 2020. Inperson came in and cancelled out those hijacked ballots. Trump freaked out over *attempts* of fraud that had been weeded out and tried to frame Americans. There's a lot of things we could talk about in the GA call. What did you make of his blatant lie about triggered Provisionals ?(because again, counting/processing timing **allowed** those Provisionals to replace the hijacked fraud) That didn't happen in 2024. Dems are fighting to certify their rejected inperson election day Provisionals. Trump also justifiably mentions a suspicious batch of weeded out attempts of fraud that are all for Biden. 100% he says. I don't know about you, but you think someone might have been trying to get that caught? Can we agree that no one rigs anything 100% unless they want it caught? If these attacks are to get in a nom, could the election attackers not also have been looking to get one nom to frame Americans and accuse their own people and government of that fraud? Raff brings up the only real processed fraud mentioned in the GA call and its TRUMPS own 1k+ that were removed during the rectification process but Trump shrugs that off, because it's not about exposing fraud..only blaming Dems and claiming sole victimhood.  Can we agree that if the results are corrupt, all Americans are victims ? Had Trump not played these attacks off like he was the sole victim, would we have reacted differently ? We should chat. I've got all kindsa questions and I'm ready to admit where Left have been wrong. J6ers got scapegoated. We all needed those officials to contest and prove Trumps accusations in court.

With the motive properly identified my behaviors changed overnight because I realized I was masking insecurity. But it's not like I went back to the journal to tell it about my realizations. It served its purpose. If anybody finds that journal they will not get the entire picture.The only people who journal are introspective people. Introspection is GOOD it means you're not just following the crowd - you're examining things in detail. Pulling from somebody's private introspection doesn't paint a picture of the person.

Christianity though in its purest form, is about love, humility, and a transformation of the heartprinciples that transcend religion and resonate with every single person on Earth. Over time unfortunately, empires like the Roman Empire politicized and distorted it, turning a spiritual path into a tool for control. Once they saw they couldn't stop the idea multiplying because trust me they did try to kill all Christians, but their idea was greater, they joined them and introduced pagan practices, chaos leading to the split of the church, which was by design. The material world we live in thrives on distractions, social constructs, and confusion, keeping people trapped in cycles of greed and fear which is what many would call a matrix of deception. Whether you see this as human nature or idk something darker like the verse in Ephesians -\\"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\\", the truth is that breaking free requires love, self-awareness, and a rejection of selfishness. True Christianity, when stripped of its systemic distortion proves true over other religions, points to this ultimate awakening a way to live  life authentically joyful, beyond anything this world can offer, they didn't invent religion, they highjacked it just how they do with everything else in order to limit movements and revolutions, You're acting like the liberal who blindly defends ideas without seeing their consequences, or the conservative who preaches morality but doesnt live up to their own standards, both work together to cause chaos and brainwash you and group people into two categories making revolution impossible due to controlment with false hope and controlled oppositions, god is the truth and the light and the way out, most of these conspiracies, that Gobelin Paris is talking about due have to do with the occult, demons, fear, violence, manipulation of human psychology through the CIA in Hollywood, and just so much so much more that would take books of writing.

It's extremely obvious to anyone that pays attention to both.  Of course every country has it's own right wing garbage too, as terrible people have always existed.  But the world is always exchanging information, good and bad.  And right now, this right wing shift that's been happening over the past 10-15 years in much of the world, has largely been due to Russian propaganda (Russia is an imperialist mafia state, considers almost everyone else to be their enemy/robbery target, and acts accordingly), which intentionally amplifies existing tensions as well as fringe fascist groups within various nations, and also inserts fake narratives that come straight from the Kremlin.  They spread it on social media, scam \\"news\\" websites, and via agents planted in various institutions and activist groups.  And then well meaning but ignorant people, and various psychos, continue to spread it themselves.  The goal is to destabilize the rest of the world, and then annex and loot as much of it as possible.  Their propaganda operation seems to be doing pretty well so far.  They used it (and bribes) to take over the American government, for example (as did others, Russia isn't the only one influencing Trump and the GOP), though there have also been some setbacks (Ukraine rejecting their puppet, and putting up a fight, for example).","title":"Musk's 'Fascist Salute': U.S. Jewish Establishment Failed Its First Test With Trump 2.0"},{"text":"What? wtf are you talking about. ?The OP was saying apolitical doesn't mean \\"conservative\\" like some people on the internet claim. ?I provided a factual comment that the more people vote, the less likely it is conservatives win. ?I assumed that \\"apolitical\\" meant non-voting. ?What else could it mean? ?I don't care what your or my or anyone else's OPINIONS are because opinions are worthless garbage. ?Lots of stupid morons have stupid moron opinions based on nothing but ignorance and hate. ?I have no respect for opinions...I like facts. ?Meanwhile, Musk just went full Hitler on national television and who is out there defending Jim's and making excuses along with the right and Nazis? ?Oh, yes, self professed \\"moderate\\" and \\"centrists\\" and those apolitical people out there.So yea, being apolitical may as well be exactly the same as being conservative because that is ultimately the real-world outcome. ?If all these apolitical people paid attention and cared, then chances are the world would be a vastly different place and Trump wouldn't exist.","title":"CMV: Apolitical does not mean conservative"},{"text":"He already won unfortunately?","title":"Donald Trump Is at War with America"},{"text":"The bar is buried under the ground and these mfers still duckin under it with historic limbo capacity","title":"Tuberville says trans kids should live in fear of their parents after bishops Trump remarks"},{"text":"i dont care if someone is privately homophobic, racist of anything you can think of, you can think that and keep it to your self and not acting upon those thoughts. there should not be a thought police. and diary belong to thoughts unless you willingly publish them. but as soon as you express those thoughts and act upon them you should bare the consequences for your misdeeds.","title":"Pure propaganda: Trump Fans want to defund PBS for accurately covering Musks salute | The legacy media is pure propaganda, Musk said."},{"text":"Introducing EDS!","title":"It is just me, who doesnt think Elon is evil just autistic?"},{"text":"Leopards ate his face.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy quits Doge cost-cutting program leaving Musk in charge"},{"text":"Ok, and?

Here's a short excerpt for folks here in the comments:President Donald Trumps order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency aims to give billionaire Elon Musks team sweeping access to operations at federal agencies, revamping its structure after competing visions left one of its leaders seeking an exit.The new structure  which has DOGE taking over the U.S. Digital Service, part of the Executive Office of the President  emerged after months of behind-the-scenes maneuvering between Musk and fellow billionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, the DOGE co-leader who will depart to run for governor of Ohio. Deep philosophical differences over how the panel should operate helped spur Ramaswamy to leave, according to more than a half-dozen people with knowledge of the situation, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.The revamped project spurred speculation that Trump and Musk had reduced their lofty ambitions for DOGE, which initially promised to comb through the whole federal bureaucracy searching for deep cuts. But some of the people said DOGE is still poised to exert crucial influence in the new administration, in part because it could grant Musk far greater insight and control over federal operations from within the White House. Some Trump allies have even grown concerned about the extent of privileged government information that Musk could have access to under the new arrangement.","title":"DOGE revamp empowers Musk as frictions spur Ramaswamys exit"},{"text":"If one were scrutinized 24/7 I bet there would be neurodivergent instances with anyone.This Nazi bullshit is the same as the Russia, Russia, Russia bullshit.

Female organisms are literally determined by having the larger gametes. This becomes really important when you look at an organism like fish, which in some cases have no sexual dimorphism and no external genitalia. The use of large gametes and small gametes also exists in biology because not all gametes are eggs and sperm, for example female plants carry the large gametes, seeds while male plants carry the small gametes, pollen.It isn't used in medicine practically however. Medical sex is in practice just apparent sex. IE a doctor looks at the genitals and determines sex. In some cases hormonal sex or chromosomal sex is used when apparent sex isn't very apparent, but the only time gametal sex ever comes up in a medical context is when infertility is being checked.I would question the wording still even if large/small gametes have a place in biology, because this is a medical decision.

I was suicidal and absolutely hated every part of myself. The I came out, my mom accepted me, I was able to heal mentally, and now Im a trans adult living under Trump once again. The harassment towards trans people has steadily risen once more, my mom is terrified that Ill be assaulted or murdered over my protect trans youth and trans people belong here stickers on my car, and Im terrified that I will not be able to get the top surgery and hormones I need to be myself.

The US is the perfect breeding ground of all the exact things that can destroy a democracy. We have an uneducated, greedy populace that has been taught to never admit wrongdoing, that we're better than everyone else, and that they're allowed to think and believe whatever they want... even if those beliefs are believing other people shouldn't have rights. Worse than that, our population is intensely polarized among cultural, political, and economic lines to the point that traveling to different states can be a lot like traveling to entirely different countries. Nobody in this country can remotely relate to each other anymore, and the people who have been made to feel inferior by that have decided they have empathy for no one and have traded loyalty to the principles the nation was founded upon to using its symbolism to push their own agenda. And even worse than that, our entire political system has been constructed from the ground up for corruption. First past the post voting inevitably drove us to a two-party system due to Duverger's Law, winner take all elections leads to wide swaths of the American public being unrepresented, undemocratic institutions like the Electoral College make some peoples votes worth more than others, and centuries of loophole abuse has eroded the intricate set of checks and balances which were meant to prevent any branch of the government from becoming too powerful.America is simply not a sustainable idea the way it is constructed, especially with as dependent as it has become on imperialism. Outside interference may be a factor, but the collapse of this country would already be inevitable without them. America is a big tent and its systems have not been built to give everyone room to exist inside it. You cannot have worse economic conditions than those that preceded the French Revolution and expect stability. We dug our own grave and now we will bury ourselves in it.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy quits Doge cost-cutting program leaving Musk in charge"},{"text":"Further proof that Reddit is a psyop.","title":"Trump and Elon broke Reddits brain.

Whenever I talk about Trump, I point out that I dated a narcissist for a few years. Not that this makes me an expert, but because the way Trump acts is so similar to the way she acted its frightening. One of the similarities was that she let NOTHING slide. She could acknowledge that there were people who might have had more experience than her in different fields, but her decisions were the best decisions, her choices were the best choices, and whenever she was wrong it was because someone else had given her bad information. Sound familiar? This is Donald Trump. Of course hell demand an apology from the Bishop, because the Bishop didnt praise him the way she should have. We know Trump thinks hes on the same level as Jesus, or at least thats what other people have told him. Hell go to war with this Bishop and hurt them until he gets the apology he feels is due. And since hes President, he has an awful lot of resources he can use","title":"Donald Trump Demands Apology From Bishop Who Hurt His Feelings"},{"text":"Article highlight:Of the 14 people whose remaining prison sentences were commuted by Trump, nine were affiliated with the Oath Keepers and five with the Proud Boys, another violent far-right group. At least one other militia leader was outright pardoned: Enrique Tarrio, a former head of the Proud Boys, is now free long before the end of his 22-year sentence. Though he wasnt in Washington during the insurrection, Tarrio egged on Proud Boys who entered the Capitol, posting on social media that he was proud of my boys and my country and telling his supporters, Dont fucking leave moments after rioters entered the Capitol. In private messages, he took credit for the attack: Make no mistake, he wrote, we did this. Some of the Proud Boys, including top members Joe Biggs and Zachary Rehl, went inside the Capitol, where they overwhelmed officers, according to the Department of Justice. Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison and Rehl to 15.Of course, it wasnt just militia members who seemingly arrived at the Capitol with violence in mind. Also among those pardoned was Eric Munchel, who was sentenced to nearly five years in prison after entering the Capitol clad in a tactical vest and carrying zip ties, with which he intended to take senators hostage, according to the judge who heard his case. The most important part of the pardons isnt specifically who is released from prison, but the meaning of Trumps gesture: Radical militias are free to act with impunityas long as theyre loyal to Trump. Should an extremist on the right break the law, he can reasonably hope for Trump to pluck them out of the justice system. This is one of the key ingredients to the perpetuation of political violence across societya belief among those who might carry it out that they can do so, and that theyll get away with it.In that sense, the pardons mark whats to come. The insurrection was the culmination of increased militia activity during the first Trump administration. But after the riot, as law-enforcement agencies began to prosecute those involved, the militias went underground. Groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys continued to operate while many of their leaders and members were in prison, but in a less publicly visible way than before. Even without militia groups operating at their peak levels, political violence, particularly by the right, has been ascendant over the past several years. Now, after the pardons, right-wing extremists no longer have to hide.It's more than likely that over the next four years, extremists emboldened by these actions will be pushing even harder to center themselves in society and its discourse rather than existing only at the fringes.","title":"Trumps Pardons Are Sending a Crystal-Clear Message | After the January 6 attacks, right-wing militias went underground.

Because these drugs are coming directly from a producer or maybe through a single hop between yourself and the producer, the risk of adulteration (especially fentanyl or other opiate adulteration) is very low. I don't know how I feel about this, though. Because of how relatively easy it is to acquire drugs this way if you have really a fairly basic level of technical knowledge, and because of the significantly lower risk, it certainly makes it a lot more attractive to do drugs in the first place.

He doesn't give a flying fuck about the sermon, he wasn't paying attention.

That this became part of the story of HIS inauguration feels like an act of violence against his ego. And now someone has to pay for that slight so that the next person doesn't do it. Trump and his supporters only care about what the coverage of something is, they don't care about the thing. They are obsessed with the tone and tenor of how the media discusses right wing ideas and people. The reason why Trump voters are still so angry even though they won the election is that Trump is still not respected. What they desperately want is for the media and general society to talk about Trump the same way they do Obama or Carter, with an air of reverence and respect.","title":"Donald Trump Demands Apology From Bishop Who Hurt His Feelings"},{"text":"Fuck all of those fucking clowns in their fucking clown assholes.","title":"The Second Trump Presidency, Brought to You by YouTubers | Podcasters including Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Logan Paul are mobilizing Americas men to lean right.

The problem is though that it's not fine. What has Bernie done since the 2016 run against Clinton? He was the one leader that could finally bring all of the disparate factions of the left together into a coalition capable of victory, and instead of channeling that into something useful he's completely squandered it. He has done nothing to foster a clear successor to his movement that could keep the left together as a voting bloc, he completely capitulated to Biden in 2020 for a $15 minimum wage Biden immediately went back on only for Biden to basically hand the country back to Trump, and now instead of taking this moment with the grave seriousness it deserves - because our country has just been handed over to literal Nazis - he's still talking like this is just another election. Don't panic? Really? Why is there absolutely no one currently in power meeting this moment in American history with the urgency it deserves? We just handed the keys to the US over to fascism, I think it's about time we start panicking. More than that, I think it's about time America remembers some old habits about how we deal with Nazis and our leaders remember how not to be cowards. Because if the most shameful part of this sham inauguration wasn't America electing a convicted felon to the presidency, and instead it's that all of our leaders are sitting in there validating that proceeding instead of standing outside with protestors, then we've got a serious problem.You know what the worst part of all this is? They've all learned nothing from this, and Bernie is no exception. Trump winning in 2020 wouldn't have been nearly as bad as him winning now has been. So much work has been done in the past 4 years directly under Biden's watch to fundamentally erode the institutions of American democracy, to make it easier and easier for an egomaniac dictator like Trump to wield those institutions like toys to dismantle our rights and the systems we rely on to live. Not to mention that for as bad as Trump's last administration was, at least there were a few people in it who were almost sane and would restrain his worst impulses, who we now gave Trump 4 years to replace with psychopaths. Trump was supported by the rich but didn't have the strong public support he has from powerful cult-leader billionaires like Musk. All of that \\"blue no matter who\\", lesser of two evils, garbage they sold us literally made the situation 10x worse than it would've been if we'd just stayed home and didn't vote for Biden in 2020.

Recklessly ahistorical, I'd say. For example: you've probably only ever read about a Proud Boy. Their numbers are somewhere around 2000. In 1932, the SA had about 400,000 members. In 1933, it had **2 million** members. Most of them were aggrieved and unemployed WWI vets. These traits all go hand in hand. Whose gonna go be a brownshirt today? They work like 46 hours a week! Didnt Elon suggest he wanted to crash the economy and we were all going to feel a little pain? Would you say MAGA is in search of a national grievance or have they found one in hating liberals?A tweet is not, in fact, equivalent to major economic catastrophe that a nation suffered during the great depression and after the most devastating war in human history. If US inflation quadrupled right now, it'd still be nothing compared to the Weimar era. Unemployment was around 40%, dude.I dont see a large veteran population or a Versailles Treaty type of financial humiliation to be necessary conditions for fascism to blossom.Might wanna reconsider because historically that's the only time it ever has.

Over the past two years, a set of massively popular podcasters and streamers cemented themselves as the new mainstream source of information for millions of young men, and, according to a new Bloomberg analysis, used their perch to rally these constituents in support of Trump and the political right.In an effort to understand the media diet of a generation, Bloomberg watched and analyzed over 2,000 videos from nine prominent YouTubers.

They've got no evidence!\\" and nobody will be able to materialize any evidence because he knows he didn't commit the crime he implied he committed... so he discredits the left and makes more people believe that we're lunatics and morons so when he actually does something and we call it out he can say \\"there they go again, the looney left, lying as always\\" and people will believe him and tune out the critics so much they won't even listen to the evidence when the critics have it.The other reason is that Elon Musk doing outrageous stuff makes *him* a current event that drives demand for a platform where people rage about current events... platforms like the one that he owns... a platform that makes more money for him when more people use it so they can get more ads in front of more eyeballs.And I'm not saying that means there wasn't election interference.

Primarily, but not exclusively, these are storing electronics for sale to customers (B2B and B2C). Some of the warehouse inventory is made domestically and some outside the USA. Much of the foreign inventory originates from China (COO=CN).When the inventory is received from China, it is in a *customs deferred* status. Customs duties will become due, when the item is sold to a USA destination address. Inventory already in those warehouses will also be affected by the proposed 10% duty. Inventory shipped from those warehouses to destination countries will have duties applied to the sale as designated by the destination country (e.g. VAT to UK &amp; EU, GAT to CA, etc).So the proposed tariff will affect products already sold, shipped, and landed, in USA warehouses, where the warehouse acts as a bonded warehouse.What is not clear in all this is the status of Section 321 (the individual De Minimas exemption). That currently, until changed/revoked, gives an individual the ability to import up to $800/day in otherwise dutiable goods from China. It is the primary reason that Aliexpress, TEMU, eBay, et al, have had great success selling direct to USA consumers.I'm most interested in hearing about the upcoming status of Section 321.

They're reactionaries. They see society as a social hierarchy where they, for whatever reason, are special and should occupy a privileged position over those they look down on, fear or hate.This blend of identity politics, exceptionalism and selfishness also applies within the movement. Everyone within it identifies with the movement because they believe they personify it, they identify with and adore its leader because they believe he is just like them. It's very similar how religious fundamentalists always seem to believe in a god that condones and justifies what they wanted to do anyway, i.e. they are their own god that they created in their own image (not the other way round). These fascist / reactionary populist movements operate in much the same way. Every single one thinks he or she is central and necessary to the movement and every single one things the leader thinks as they do.Hence why they will denounce and \\"other\\" every other faction within it, turning on them in a heartbeat, but are at the same time always surprised when it happens to them. They can not conceive that the movement or its leaders will betray them because they think they are the movement. No matter how many cliques, cabals and factions tear into each other every single time they need to work together, each and every one of them will cling to that delusion of unity and identity because it is central to their perception of their own status and self-worth.","title":"Police union that endorsed Trump blasts Jan. 6 pardons"},{"text":"The immoral monster we helped create is loose, and now to ease my conscious about my actions contributing to this, I will join the many that try to make headlines with toothless criticism and empty pleas to stop.

The belief is that before the second coming of Jesus, Israel will face significant trials and tribulations, which will ultimately lead to the rapture and the second comingA lot of American Christianity as preached is folk religion based on stuff like this. The left behind series did a number on folks around here when I was a kid lmaoMore on it:  According to these beliefs, Israel will face severe trials and tribulations, often referred to as the Great Tribulation, before the second coming of Jesus. This period is thought to involve widespread destruction, suffering, and persecution for Israel, as described in passages like **Daniel 9:27** and **Revelation 12**. The idea is that these events are meant to fulfill biblical prophecies and prepare the way for the final battle between good and evil, culminating in Jesus return.So a fairy tale? Maybe.

Never reigned in by subsequent Congresses even when it was clear the power was being misused.\\n- National Emergencies Act (1976) - granted the Executive various emergency powers that allow them to redirect budget, use the military, ignore certain laws and oversight if they declare an 'emergency', used by various Presidents to achieve their policy goals instead of passing legislation. Never reigned in by subsequent Congresses even when it was clear the power was being misused.\\n- PATRIOT Act (2001) - gave the Executive the power to conduct warrantless wiretaps with no accountability, powers that Congress has struggled to rein in since.\\n- Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) - gave the President overly broad authority to take the 'war on terror' wherever they wanted, rather than Congress authorising wars as it's supposed to in the Constitution. \\n- Affordable Care Act (2010) - gave substantial authority to HHS to determine the detail, including subsidies and grants to states for Medicaid, enabling successive Presidents to mess with the ACA to try and stop it functioning correctly and create significant uncertainty for people trying to maintain health insurance.\\n- CARES Act (2020) - delegated vast spending authority to the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to stabilize the economy during the pandemic, which resulted in billions of dollars being handed out in business loans and contracts on very questionable grounds. Again, Congress has failed to rein in these powers now they've been granted, even though the coronavirus emergency is over.\\n- Inflation Reduction Act / Green New Deal (2022) - hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and grants for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other green initiatives, but all under the administration of Department of Energy which can decide whether to award them or indeed grant them at all, meaning Trump can stop the provisions working properly at the stroke of his pen. Likewise the IRS was given the power to create green tax incentives, which can also be cancelled by Presidential action alone.Also, Congress now grants the White House a huge discretionary budget that has creeped up every year and is now something like $1.6tn, to do whatever they want with very little oversight. This has led to Presidents creating all sorts of programmes that exist only in the Executive, and can be changed or ended on a whim. Critical programmes on immigration, health, climate, and aid are all covered under this now. Congress is supposed to control the purse, but they've absolved themselves of all control for a large % of government spending.It's ridiculous.","title":"Alarm Bells Sound as Trump Gets to Work on 'Extreme Authoritarian Agenda Trump isn't king, but if Congress capitulates, he could be,\\"warned the leaders of Popular Democracy"},{"text":"Good!","title":"Trump administration directs all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on leave"},{"text":"Note: nobody is saying the bishop was wrong","title":"GOP member wants bishop added to deportation list after Trump prayer service"},{"text":"Something something can't kill an idea.","title":"Trump says he's considering 10% tariff on China beginning as soon as Feb. 1"},{"text":"I hate to say this but if your friends are democrats you're friends with people who, deep down, are degenerates and immoralYou may have a few laughs together but don't forget what their true colors are.

Frank has made MAGA his entire personality and lives to be like the guy in your excerpt, a living nuisance that only wishes to get a rise out of every non-MAGA around him. He explicitly uses his time to cause arguments and advocate for causing people pain or anger. If hes anything like my family, his kids are probably distant from him and he has no idea why. The migrant worker on the other hand keeps to himself, works the job that nobody else wants and breaks ass doing it to support his family. He only wants a shot at maybe becoming a full citizen someday and pays taxes the entire time. He cant be a nuisance even wanted to because of the risk of deportation, not even considering what would happen if a MAGA took notice of him or his family. Heres the answer for you that Im sure youre aware of if youre not one of them; *MAGAs dont do a fucking thing for anyone but themselves or 45*.
