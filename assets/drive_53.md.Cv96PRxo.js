In fact, I'm pretty sure I could write it on other countries as well. heck, I'm pretty sure I could write one on the Palestinian society (they have their fair share of most of your point such as dehumanization, indiscriminate killings, and even denial of statehood). I'm not sure what's the opinion of yours you'd like to be changed or how, do you care to elaborate? cause I can go point by point and explain why they are not so similar, but I don't understand if this is what you expect.   \\n  \\nI don't think people who support Israel would back up the Nazis, nor do I think Israel is anywhere near the Nazis in terms of morality. In fact, I'm pretty sure that holocaust inversion is a classic form of antisemitism.

In fact, when an American citizen was murdered through the disposition matrix without fair trial, the case was dismissed by the supreme court. This set a precedent that extra judicial killings were okay as far as America is concerned.Is your argument a moral argument, and we are discussing the ethics of their actions?

I spent most of my career as an Officer in the British Infantry, and left as a Captain.I'm not Jewish, or Israeli, and I don't consider myself a particularly political person.Civilian casualties happen in virtually every war, unfortunately. You mention NATO, and I can assure you that NATO has killed more civilians both in sheer numbers and in proportionality to combatants, than Israel has.At NATO we study the IDF actions as the military organization with the latest best practices when it comes to fighting in very complex environments, such as the West Bank and Gaza. The IDF is known for reducing civilian casualties pretty much to an extreme. This shows in their tactics (roof knocking, high surgical ordinance rates, the most advanced use of ISTAR in the history of warfare, calling civilians on their mobiles to warn before attacks, well planned evac routes, etc etc). It also shows in the numbers, where this round of Gaza war for example has the lowest civilian to combatant death ratio in the history of urban warfare.This tends to come as a surprise to people that follow the conflict from afar, especially those that follow it on social media... But don't forget that this conflict is by far the most media-driven conflict in human history, and one side or another will dramatize events in order to present a narrative, pretty much to the extreme.There is plenty to criticize about Israel, especially its current government, but when it comes to how the IDF behaves in a war, there's no doubt in my mind that it acts just like any NATO-style military would.","title":"CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today"},{"text":"I looked and there's one at Best Buy for $600 even!but I'm afraid you'd find me hanging from the rafters if I had to live with 8gb of ram In the Year of our Lord MMXXIV","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Imagine running for almost a decade for President and claiming you have a healthcare plan that entire time that is to replace the ACA and not have a single sheet of paper to show for it.

Cut the far right capture of public institutions off at the source by actively challenging them in all these small local elections they keep winning, sometimes functionally unopposed. Everything happening now is enabled and worsened by all these \\"patriots\\" and \\"concerned parents\\" and other dupes / frauds fucking things up on the ground floor from their positions as county clerks or school board members or zoning committee members. The impact of these positions being filled by right wing extremists is already obvious, so consider what could be done when they're filled by people with integrity and real public spirit.\\n2. Colonize small states. There's probably a better word for this, but consider the comparatively miniscule populations of places like Wyoming and the two Dakotas. You still have freedom of movement in your country, yeah? A few million Democrats need to move to these states ASAP and start gentrifying. They don't count for a lot of electoral votes, and effective gerrymandering may still make it tough to pick up new Congressional seats there, but if you can shift the demographics enough to get those six senators (or even just most of them) turned blue you can functionally ensure that there will never be a GOP-controlled Senate ever again. The impact that could have on judicial appointments, cabinet confirmations, committee investigations, and many other things would be profound, and a step towards real checks and balances once again. I concede at once that this option is much easier described than achieved, as the people moving in will face considerable challenges and probably a distinct lack of options when it comes to employment and education, but maybe you can resurrect your pioneering spirit on this one in the name of the nation's good.","title":"What More Do You People Want from Kamala Harris?"},{"text":"Care to explain further?

Reactionaries, progs, academics, etc. all do this. When confronted with interpretations outside their own ingroups interpretation they seek entirely to discredit it as often dangerous and subversive delusions. Even making fun of reactionaries making dogshit interpretations falls into this as said dogshit interpretations aren't seen as bad interpretations but categorically and objectively wrong. Don't get me wrong, reactionary interpretations are quite bad and are borne from very bad readings of the text, but Tue still constitute as interpretations subjectively done by those readersIt's part of why I believe that revulsion to abstract art of all kinds is a good signal for authoritarian and especially reactionary politics.

One of these was that Argentina is the breadbasket of the world, and that no matter what happened, there would always be a piece of land here to grow a garden, milk a cow, or raise a lamb. The other belief was a cultural framework that certain species are simply not edible.The initial reaction of the authorities was to deny the existence of the problem, as they had in so many other cases. The then-mayor of Rosario, Hermes Binner, even accused a television channel of having paid slum residents to \\"stage\\" the shocking images in collusion with them. Both Binner and his predecessor, Hctor Cavallero, were determined to defend what they saw as Rosario's \\"honor\\" in the face of the allegations about what was happening in the city's urban belt.But reality eventually forced its way into reluctant minds. The extensive media coverage that followed the first images of hunger in Greater Rosario only expanded on the initial reports. With ten percent of its population living in emergency settlements, Rosario exemplified a problem of such severe deprivation and poverty that it spread to the urban belts of Buenos Aires, Crdoba, and Tucumn.EDIT: shorting some sentences to make it easier to read.","title":"So apparently it's impossible for humans to kill and eat pets"},{"text":"I read this headline like 12 times trying to figure out if I was not comprehending it correctly.

In January this year, three US soldiers in Jordan were killed by a drone attack from an Iran-aligned group, and dozens of others have been wounded in similar strikes.The extra spin is not a useful way to explain that \\"combat zones\\" is IRS legal jargon and we do, in fact, have troops there.**What youre going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again.**Fact check: The Heritage Foundation, an independent think tank, produced Project 2025, not the Trump campaign. Trump has repeatedly said he wasnt involved in its writing, does not believe in its policies and wont implement it.Remember when Trump appointed three heritage foundation members on order from the heritage foundation to the heritage foundation stacked supreme court where they then proceeded to legislate heritage foundation written bills from the bench? There is nothing republicans do that is separate from the heritage foundation.**Lets remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of five young black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution.**Fact check: Trumps 1989 advertisement did not call for the execution of the Central Park Five. He talked about a woman raped in the park, but did not mention the names of suspects or who they were. Titled Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back the Police, Trump simply bemoaned how generally unsafe New York City had become, and that criminals needed to be held accountable. His cri de c?ur preceded what would become a general backlash against disorder in Gotham that led to the election of Rudy Giuliani as mayor and more proactive policing.Just total bullshit, it's titled BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY and most of it is describing the central park 5 and the acts they were accused of and saying how much he wants to murder them. **I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States, and in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.**Fact check: Harris passed the bill because it was packed with left-wing giveaways. Those new leases were not the point of the bill, and only begrudgingly included to assuage Sen. Joe Manchin. Later, Manchin would accuse President Biden and Harris of going back on their word, saying new regulations were undermining the lease promises. This is bullsCt, he told Politico. So theyre gonna basically starve us out of energy that we have a tremendous, abundant supply of because of their aspirational thoughts?They admit her statement was factually accurate but maybe didn't open as many new leases as Manchin hoped for...?**\\"Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening.**Fact check: As the Daily Signal points out, Minnesota had a 2015 law that required doctors to report whether abortions resulted in the live birth of a baby. In 2021, it happened at least five times, but no measures were taken to keep them alive. In 2023, Gov. Tim Walz stripped out that reporting requirement as part of an abortion law that has no limitations on how late in a pregnancy it may happen.I don't know what \\"abortions resulting in the live birth of a baby\\" are but they sure aren't synonymous with 40th week abortions**Lets remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side.**Fact check: Harris, along with Biden, always leaves out what Trump said next: Im not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Snopes has labeled false the idea that Trump praised neo-Nazis.So he did, in fact, say it. The overall context was a protest against removing anti-American pro-treason white supremacist monuments, none of them were \\"fine people.\\" By pretending there were non-white supremacists among a crowd made up of entirely white supremacists, it's clear the fine people is still referring to white supremacists even if they happen to not be neo-Nazis or white nationalists.**ABC moderator David Muir claim: President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country, the ABC anchor interjected when Trump said crime is through the roof.**Fact check: Despite Muirs efforts to show up Trump, the former presidents response  that the FBI figures are not to be trusted  was absolutely correct. The Marshall Project, which focuses on law enforcement reporting, found that 6,000 law enforcement agencies were missing from the FBIs 2023 analysis. This means a quarter of the U.S. population wasnt represented in the federal crime data last year, it said. Moreover, whatever small reductions have happened in cities such as Chicago is barely a dent in how much crime skyrocketed in past three years.These reports always have about that many non-compliant law enforcement agencies, so it's still a useful in comparison to other years. Just a totally misleading framing and ends with just a blatant lie about crime skyrocketing.","title":"Heres the fact check that ABC didnt give Kamala Harris"},{"text":"He was always a broken man, but nobody  not Clinton, Biden, the DOJ, the court system or the media  had exposed that fact to all this nakedly.","title":"Kamala Harris Broke Donald Trump"},{"text":"No, I'm not familiar with that one.

To begin with, have you heard the story of the grains of wheat and the chess board?  Start out on square 1 with a single grain of wheat and double it every square, you end up with more wheat than there has ever been in human history by like the sixth row.At some point the wealthy have so much money they cant conceivably spend it on themselves.  Therefore they invest it.  They tend to invest it so the growth beats the rate of economy grows (thats a good investment).Now lets take two quantities, E and R.  E is much, much larger than R.  Suppose E grows at a rate of 5% (doubling roughly once every 14 years).  R grows at 10% (doubling once every 7 years).   Think of the chess board and the grain.  Will E always be much much larger than R?  Will R ever approach the size of E?What does it look like when R starts to approach  E?

I think that the hate may just be a symptom. Look deeper than that and you may find the underlying cause is *fear*.  Fear of change. Fear of different, of the unknown. Fear of the perceived loss of power, prestige and money compared to the perception of others.  Fear is *incredibly* powerful.  There were some very strict deeply religious people in one nice, quiet area that believed they were living in the equivalent of a lawless war zone. It was hammered into them every day by their religious leaders to fear the world around them. So they lived in fear, despite living in a very quiet low crime area. It kept them locked into that religion. That was the only safe place where they would be protected. It also kept the donations coming in to their leaders...  I think many people throughout the world can relate to what you and many other Americans are going through. You really are not alone.  I'm in the UK. I had an uncle that actually ranted and raved about foreigners invading *his* village and destroying it. He once let slip that they were actually white British people, just like him.  He also utterly loathed every sick and disabled person. We're all destroying his once great nation and for that we all needed to be harshly punished. He had memorised a long list of every sick and disabled person in his area that he wanted punishing.  He would have voted for the first party that promised to deport all the sick and disabled people. He thought the sick and disabled were as bad as, if not worse, than all the foreigners.  Yet he too was sick and disabled. He hadn't worked for decades. He had also lived in Europe for some time doing a job that any of the locals could have done.  His life sucked. He was stuck at home in pain. His friends were growing old and dying. The village was growing and changing over the years. He was stuck at home with plenty of time to dwell on all that.  He feared the changes, his life, the new people and the changing world around him. He wanted to turn back the clock and return to an idealised happy safe time that only existed in his dreams.  The newspapers and politicians redirected his fears and bitter hatred away from them. They gave him a powerless vague group to blame. They gave him a name to pin all his problems on, much like a rally cry. *Foreigners*.  We stopped visiting him as he would not talk about anything else. He was uncontrollably ranting and raving about all the imaginary foreigners invading his village. He was listing all the sick and disabled he so badly wanted to be punished. He *really* did want to hurt them.  It's actually quite sad. Once he was a nice funny person. It was like he died. Gone was the uncle I once knew. My dad said that he had never seen his brother like that before. He was like a stranger. He'd lost his brother.","title":"Aubrey Plaza endorses Kamala Harris with Grumpy Cat photo after Taylor Swift endorsement"},{"text":"Well, okay, then Ill amend my statement: She gave him the laxative but he shit himself.

Because about 50% of the new jobs are going to immigrants and NOT to American citizens - you know, the voters (okay, the ones who are supposed to be voting).The other issue that skews his model is that Harris both IS and IS NOT the incumbent.

At the same time, because she is not the actual incumbent, she does not get the advantage of the key of being the incumbent.

One thing I wanted to respond in your post: If an arms embargo were to be put in place, Israel would be exposed not just to Hamas, but to Iran, and it's proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.If Israel is in direct violation of the Leahy Law (which according to Patrick Leahy who wrote the bill Israel has violated it), Im not sure why that is our problem and not simply Israels. We have democratically decided that we will condition weapons sales and defense funds if the recipient is committing human rights violation. Why should we disregard our laws because Israel decided to disregard our conditions and put *themselves* at risk? Besides, Im not in favor of completely cutting off Israel but I do want us to pursue banning offensive weaponry. I do believe Israelis have a right to live just as much as the Palestinians.And this isnt an unpopular move. There have been polls showing that at least 70% of Democrats support a permanent ceasefire. A May poll even showed that number being up to 83% for Democrats. Is there any other issues Democrats would not act on with that kind of approval? A Gallup poll from May showed that 72% of Democrats find changing genders morally acceptable and the Ds have no problem supporting and platforming trans rights with that level of support (which I am in support of). As for the overall uncommitted movement and undecided, I have a lot of mixed thoughts. I dont think there are people under the illusion that somehow Trump would be better or buy into the notion that Trump was our most peaceful president (which is FALSE, Mehdi Hassan did a good short video on this). However, I can totally empathize with people who have seen and read countless stories and reports of civilians being slaughtered by the dozens, watched videos of children with blown off limbs bleeding out on the floor of hospitals because there are no more beds, seeing countless children who are now orphaned or parents whove lost all of their children. In fact, I dont just empathize with them, I AM one of these people who have been following this genocide very closely.Im not sure if I would vote for Harris but my abstinence would be ceremonial (Im in California). If I was in a swing state, I would most likely vote for Harris just to not have Trump in office. But its hard for me to urge these voters in good conscious to just suck it up and vote for Harris after all they have seen. To them, this is their never again moment and to be on the right side of history and not contribute to a system that is abetting a genocide.Do I think Harris will be better about Gaza than Biden? I think so. Do I think Harris will do better than Trump on this? Thats not even a question. But well see.

When they shot she was nearby and was hit. She was there with \\"International Solidarity Movement\\", its... bad.... just from the Guardian it is a real bad organization and I really do not want to read into it further. From my research:In 2003, its founder Adam Shapiro on a podcast justified killing of Israeli soldiers and civilians if it led to reducing Israel presence in West Bank Settlements, he did thankfully say he did not believe in suicide bombings. But how do you justify killings of civilians?In 2004, the group gained notoriety when it told college students to throw themselves as human shields during fire-fights to force IDF to be unable to return fire. Followed by and incident in a church, where 40 terrorists were cut off from an escape route and retreated into the local church. During this time ISM members broke there way past the IDF military cordon and blocked the doors and windows with their bodies.The organization unfortunately has hero-worship around a certain event that occurred in October, of at least some of its founders.

You had some of the top scientists in Europe flee to Israel after the Holocaust, so it didnt really surprise anyone that Israel was also developing nukes. The Eisenhower administration actually helped cover it up by calling the facility a textile factory. It would be a little hard to say Israel has been developing nukes for over 60 years but hasnt actually created one. Also, the US is likely the country responsible for Israel never going public with it, as then the US would have to admit it to its initial cover up.","title":"CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today"},{"text":" If I could, I'd donate locally.   since i couldnt donate alot of money,  i donated my time, and Ive got reminder postcards going out - only 150. they provided 100 stamps, but postcard stamps are cheaper than regular stamps , so that helped.   my cards are going to let voters know how special they are , and temind them their Votes are ALL , that matter, election day. \\n Ive never had an opportunity to feel so proud of myself before!

If you could prove the systemic killing and imprisonment of Americans, and point to specific policies that call for this, sanctions could be justified to the public at least, which is important. Iran was sanctioned in part for the systemic imprisonment and killing of Americans, but the real reason was its development of nuclear weapons. Iran had been doing that to Americans for years. The US considered sanctioning Cuba for holding someone prisoner around 2009-2010, but negotiated instead. Turkey was sanctioned in 2018 in part for imprisoning an American, but the real justification was turkey purchasing an S-400. Killing or imprisoning Americans tends to garner public support for sanctions, but have rarely, if ever, been the primary reason for sanctions. Its more of a bargaining chip than a primary motivation for sanctions. There have been several instances where sanctions were issued after a bombing where Americans were killed, such as Sudan after the 1998 US embassy bombings, but that was because Sudan was harboring terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda, which again, is a larger issue. The killing or imprisonment of American citizens seems to be what brings these issues to the public eye and gets support for the sanctions that are imposed. Rather than using killings and imprisonment to justify sanctions on a country, you should look for a specific policy that is harmful to the US and on a scale great enough to warrant sanctions. I did a lot of digging and couldnt find a single example of sanctions specifically for the death or imprisonment of American citizens.","title":"CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today"},{"text":"I dont wanna dance.

Anyone with sense should see that this is basically left conceeding that they are the rich people trying to bolster the rich people. The irony here is Taylor Swift is living the lifestyle of a deranged estranged girlfriend in a country song. The country lifestyle wasn't good enough for her, so she left it for the city. She pandered to the lowest common denominator and switched to pop music. She cares about her image rather that the people who made her famous in the first place.","title":"Taylor Swift Disables Comments After Endorsing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Donald Trump is the last person in the world who can talk about paying for anything.","title":"Donald Trump says Taylor Swift will pay for endorsing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Oh, I thought the Vermont legislature voted for it not the US Senate","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 11, 2024 - 55 days until election day!"},{"text":"Read for filth?

He was the only G-7 leader not to attend the meal; the White House told reporters in advance he wouldnt be there because it would be a jam-packed two days of meetings. Biden instead held an event with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and had a news conference.\\nThe next day, Biden followed through on his plans to forgo a Swiss peace summit on Ukraine to attend a California fundraiser instead, frustrating Ukrainian officials who had organized the conference in Switzerland directly after the G-7 in the hope that Biden would come from Italy....Two senior European officials cited a European Union-U.S. summit in October in Washington at which Biden struggled to follow the discussions. Both said he stumbled over his talking points at several moments, requiring Secretary of State Antony Blinken to intervene and point out the lines he should use.There were some other instances.

If it was truly Biden constraining Harris, I think he would have opened his position up to the degree that Harris could outline a policy to win those voters.But, hypothetically, if Biden is remaining hard-lined about funding genocide regardless of what would be best for the Harris campaign, why is that campaign behaving the way it is? Why would the campaign repeatedly and vigorously oppose an arms embargo, the most effective way to achieve a ceasefire, when they could just...not? If Biden was truly constraining Harris into following his Gaza policy when she wished to be less genocidal, why not give an open-ended non-answer to the arms embargo question (such as \\"at this stage we're looking at a number of possibilities and will not be getting into specifics\\") rather than a repeated rejection?","title":"What More Do You People Want from Kamala Harris?"},{"text":"some of his jokes about the actual debate got a chuckle out of me but the \\"handsome debate moderator\\" joke that lasted for like 25 full seconds really was a moment of \\"oh yeah this guy's still a boomer isn't he\\"same thing with making fun of the guy who said the weirdly specific thing about the tight swimsuit. like that's a funny thing to make fun of but Stewart dragged the joke out way too long","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 11, 2024 - 55 days until election day!"},{"text":"Fuck Citizens United","title":"The problem is not with the shitty candidates."},{"text":"When you increase the median cost of a house by 40%, which is the national average, and the average mortgage rate goes from 2.75% to 6.75%, what happens to the monthly payment.","title":"Why was Joe Biden disliked so much by such a large proportion of the US electorate?"},{"text":"Hmm.

Yes, once it was shown there were no WMDs it became a lot more open to ask questions about things, but it wasn't really until it \\"bogged down\\" into the occupation phase that it really got criticized and debated.

Definitely after that the dissent and criticism inside the USA took off and became \\"legit\\" especially due to Howard Dean's campaign in the dem primary. Kerry then took on a lot of those criticisms (tamed down somewhat though) and he came very close to winning in nov 2004. So yeah it DID tamp down but not until late 03 and 04 really. I threw in the comparison between those two conflicts because I feel like one is legit to have discussions about, there are people on both sides allowed on television and so on, and it's lively. While in the other it's entirely one-sided and there's a suggestion that any questioning or different perspectives has to only be \\"propaganda\\". Which to me is similar to the environment in this Bush/Cheney time period. Very closed-off.Yeah I suspected someone would bring up Jan 6 well... and also Trump denying he lost etc before then. I agree Trump denying he lost was for sure playing with fire and insane, but to me I view Trump more as an opportunist. He only did that because his supporters *already believed it* and he took advantage of that and just kept going with it. So it's always the situation with Trump, I don't like just focusing on HIM. He is a narcissist and egomaniac but WHY do so many people in the country BELIEVE him? And WANT to believe him? Those are the larger more difficult problems. Ultimately Trump DID leave office \\"peacefully\\", even though he skipped Biden's inauguration. And I don't think he intended for Jan 6 to go as far as it did ether, it surprised basically everyone what happened. If I thought Trump truly was trying to overthrow the whole government and stay in power, yes that would be pretty crazy. But again, his actions were NOT popular. Jan 6 was WIDELY condemned and attacked. People didn't overall believe his claim that he won.

From the US gov. perspective, it is absolutely dire that we keep what is essentially our only ally in the region. They're one of the US's most valuable intelligence partners. I guess I understand your point about it being cowardly that she doesn't take a hard stance against Israel or even just Netanyahu. I have a feeling her diplomacy with him is actually going to be a lot harsher but I realize she can't say that \\"in front of the whole world\\". So I have to not get my hopes up. I, personally, regret abortion becoming a states' rights issue. (Roe v. Wade was not watertight however, I think abortion should have been protected with legislation.) But what I regret much more is the outright lie that Republicans see it as a states' issue. And Trump confirmed that lie in the plainest way. I expect that the women in this country will deserve a lot of credit this time around for defeating him C if I may be so bold as to say, though time will tell. I did say nobody's leanings really changed yesterday but NBC did a short segment with some undecided voters, and the women indicated solid points to Harris on that issue if nothing else. Overall they all reported still not being sure either way. If anyone won the debate yesterday C well frankly, I *do* think it was Harris, even though I am ready to acknowledge flaws and falls short. But really it was the moderators. They let Trump talk a little more than he should have, but frankly that only hurt himself. I did like their questions C the topics overall tiptoed around some \\"real issues\\" and often focused on the distracting bullshit that both parties like to stick to. But honestly, fine by me, a little filler is what brings out their character. But the moderators seemed very prepared and had questions pointed directly at both candidates' stances and records. Would love to see more of that. The fact that Marco Rubio immediately bitched about how he didn't think the moderators did a great job, honestly makes me think they did.","title":"Donald Trump faces his own debate fallout just months after benefiting from Joe Biden's"},{"text":"Then we get more abortion to add on to our reproduction crisis and more justification for illegals to replace those who are not reproducing.","title":"Why liberals are so obsessed with abortions?"},{"text":"I'd beg to differ on the contention pro Israel voters are strictly voting Republican.

He definitely scooted around stances on Ukraine, but that may be a plus (strategically if he were to stick it to Putin). It was still a non-answer, though. He for sure was worried about his voter base. He should have loudly spoken the truth on his stances. Leaving it (abortion laws) to the states was a good thing- it was a step forward in letting area voters decide their environments, and half of the people not getting what they want. He should have said he would strike down the ban, given his actual stance. Jan 6th should have been an easy, that was as stupid as the riots in the cities, and it shouldnt have happened. He should have given a brief description about the health insurance situation, at minimal. She blurted out a bunch of giveaway goodies, that were for sure not going to make it through congress, to buy out her base. Zero mention of how, or if they were actually attainable. One could say, that refusing to oppose Israel is also cowardly, because she knows how many donors, democrats, and voters are jewish. They both played it up. Nothing gleaned from it all.","title":"Donald Trump faces his own debate fallout just months after benefiting from Joe Biden's"},{"text":"You won't be convinced until CNN tells you it's real.","title":"Kamala Harris is clearly wearing Nova H1 earrings during the Trump debate.

Then Trump came and pushed the party to be worse than ever.The thing is that I've never known the Republican Party to actually get less extreme. And, as I said, they're really gonna be in a shit fucking predicament if they lose this election and 2028.

Home ownership rate in 1965 was 63.9%. It is now 65.6%.https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156NThe idea that all moms stayed home is also a myth. In 1965, dual income households made up 48% of households. They now make up 66%, which is down from the early 90s when it was around 70%. That 18% swing is significant, but not as drastic as you think. The lower class and lower middle classes were all working for the most part. College was much cheaper, but there were no government loans. If you couldn't pay for it or get a scholarship, you didn't go. That's why we've gone from 10% college graduates to 40% despite the cost. But the big thing you're missing is the difference in standard of living. That family had 1 car and lived in a home that was almost half the size of homes today with no air conditioningin many cases. Vacations were more limited then than today. Road trips were a serious adventure due to crappy tires, unreliable cars, and limited infrastructure. Eating out of any kind was a rare treat. Food choices were very limited. Grocery stores were 1/3 the size of modern stores mostly due to limited choices. Healthcare was cheap because it was very simple. No bypass surgery, no MRIs, no arthroscopic procedures, no knee or hip replacements, etc. Hell, you couldn't even get ibuprofen over the counter. There was no such thing as on demand entertainment other than a book. You could watch 3 channels, half in black and white through a 19\\" screen at best on the schedule that it came on. If you had people out of your city you wanted to talk to, you could use up a day's wages with a 30 minute phone call.

If Trump loses, how will the Republican Party pivot? Clearly Trump would try to overturn the results again. And, there's a good chance he ends up in prison. I feel like there's gonna be a large group of disaffected Republicans if they're faced with the facts of 2 consecutive presidential losses, 2 failed efforts to overthrow the government, and a criminal president. They'll have to pivot to capture those disaffected Republicans. But of course they can't pivot too hard, since Republicans hate anyone that's compromised with Dems. And they'll have to pick up new voters if they lose this time (particularly minorities probably). And they'll have to appeal to the MAGA die hards. So they'll have to reinvent themselves. Again. They can't say their new candidates are in the vein of Trump, Romney, McCain, Bush, Quayle or HW, since large groups of Republicans will hate all those people by 2028. They could bring up Reagan again, but by 2028, 40 years will have passed since he was president. Most voters won't remember him, and a good portion of leaders wouldn't have even been adults when he was president.They can't point to any real legislative achievements, since the only major bill passed under Trump was tax cuts in 2017, and since then Dems have been in charge. They haven't even had a real party platform even in 8 years (this new platform is best described as \\"concepts of policies\\"). They're also gonna have the problem that their voters will have absorbed another 4 years of crazy bullshit by 2028. Like... 70% of Republicans thought Obama was born in Kenya in 2016. And today, 70% of Republicans believe Trump won 2020. So they can't pivot away too hard from insanity, but they're gonna have a hard time picking up disaffected Republicans and new voters if they don't.I don't really know how anyone on the bench is gonna be able to achieve this task. It's possible the chickens have kinda come home to roost for the Republicans.

I thought the CMV was based on that since Asians benefit, then people don't like affirmative action. Maybe that is true for California but they banned affirmative action 25 years ago (I am not sure how that tracks with how much success Asian students have had there).Essentially this is explained by white self interest and the fact that women have benefited less and less from affirmative action every year.I am with you in the first half but not with you in the second half. But that's because you look at who is funding the legal challenges and who is behind them. So, Edward Blume loses a congressional election in 1992. Then for reasons decides that he hates any sort of institutionalization of race consciousness. He sues in 1996 because certain districts were too minority friendly. [https://theconversation.com/edward-blums-crusade-against-affirmative-action-has-used-the-legal-strategy-developed-by-civil-rights-activists-215223](https://theconversation.com/edward-blums-crusade-against-affirmative-action-has-used-the-legal-strategy-developed-by-civil-rights-activists-215223)I just can't imagine Edward Blume thinking, \\"Gee, Affirmative Action was good in the 1990s in the 2000s because white people got in.\\" Blume also funded things like the Shelby County v. Holder decision which gutted the Voting Rights Act. I don't think it's because he thinks white women vote too much, though. Then in 2015, the Harvard case featured Asian students. He was searching for plaintiffs that could have standing so he can sue. This dude is a maniac that sees reverse racism everywhere. So, I think I agree that his view in dismantling race conscious public policy is because it doesn't benefit white people, but he doesn't strike me as a feminist. He was fighting this fight since the 1990s. But, the reason you're seeing it more post 2010 is because Citizens United made it easier for groups like his to collect huge sums of money. What that means is there's lots of rich white guys that don't like race conscious public policy and will spend money to dismantle the systems.Not to get too off topic but I also think there's a substantial mass of these same dudes funding the legal fight to get model codes for states to make it harder for women to get abortion. If you want to know some super interesting history - the entire anti abortion movement started in the 1880s in reaction to a wave of immigration combined with white women not having enough babies.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"She was wearing some pretty high heels, which I found hilarious because of how Trump had been laughing at her for wanting a platform or wearing platform shoes.

New York City deregularized heavily in the 70s, and maintained this for a few decades. However, the surrounding area, particularly cities without financial markets, did so at a slower rate or not substantially at all. Quality of life and healthy living metrics in NYC decreased during those times according to many historians, whereas in surrounding cities or towns, you didn't see the same decreases, in part due to \\"NIMBYism\\", people who aggressively wanted to avoid change in their neighborhoods advocating against new deregulatory policy. A simpler example is places like Poland versus the US. In the olden days, policymakers did not use sophisticated tools to regulates various kinds of products and services, they would just let businesses do whatever they want. Poland's quality of life and education were not substantially different from the United States at this time, and were arguably worse. Then after new regulatory tools came about in the last half of the 20th century, Europe really ran with them and implemented all sorts of bans on radiation, pollution, unsafe packaging or food, misleading marketing etc. Poland's healthy living trends and quality of life overtook the United States, which did not pursue as aggressive and specific a regulatory strategy as European countries.","title":"CMV: \\"Late Stage Capitalism\\" Doesn't Exist"},{"text":"It's not collapsing anytime soon.

Which is true but there's no evidence it wouldn't happen under socialism either. And then there's the common use of late stage capitalism, where basic capitalist goals destroy themselves, like Enshittification and VC buyouts. Under capitalism, it is mathematically ideal towards annual or quarterly gains to buy an IP, starve it for personal profit, and abandon the corpse. EVERY industry has faced this. Food, video games, doctor clinics, all have seen good profitable business models in ideal market locations still get bought out and then intentionally bled to death by their owners because that is more profit.  Or there's enshittification like Uber. Capitalist incentives reward Uber's actions to kill existing industry, then make it worse for buyers, then make it worse for their own employees.

It leads to an increase in government social spending to compensate for the poverty arising from concentration of wealth (a common consequence of capitalism, but not necessarily negative so doesn't fit here) In addition, income inequality actually harms those who are extremely wealthy. If the acquisition of extreme wealth is sudden, it can lead to paranoia and isolation (sudden wealth syndrome). In addition, according to some studies, people who are under the influence of power a person can exercise (something that is part of significant wealth) may behave similarly to people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI).

In theory, the decrease in operating cost for the corporation should mean whatever end product or service the corporation does should also drop in cost, but instead the extra money just ends up going to the people in charge, or stockholders, or similar.

OP specifically mentions affirmative action in the context of job placements and college admissions, so I'll talk mainly about college, but if you want to talk about job placements or some other context, I'm game.The idea behind race- or sex-based affirmative action for college admissions is, loosely, that because of structural inequities, histories of discrimination, bad childhood environments, etc, a particular underrepresented group does not have the same academic qualifications as a privileged group. So we need not just non-discrimination in admissions, but affirmative action, because otherwise we will simply replicate that earlier discrimination in a new setting. And then the metaphor is of starting on third base or of running with ankle weights or starting a quarter mile ahead in a mile race, and we say \\"You think it's unfair to \\"penalize\\" you, but actually we're just making it fair, because you started off with an unfair advantage.\\" But it seems to me this metaphor is failing to capture the most important fact about this: the underrepresented minorities actually ARE less qualified, academically. If I am \\"naturally\\" highly intelligent and academically capable, but grew up with terrible schools, in a terrible home, in a terrible culture, I don't just APPEAR to be less ready for an elite college.

Even if you hate capitalism, what is happening bears no resemblance to Marxist late-stage capitalism.I'm not a Marxist, but as I understand it Marx's hypothesis was that intense competition would drive profit margins down to the point that capitalists would reinvest nearly all their profits into expanding production to make it up on volume. The increased efficiency from this would cause them to also be able to lay off workers, pissing off the proletariat until an inevitable revolution which would allow the proles to simply walk in and take over incredibly highly developed means of production. When people say Russia was the worst possible place to have a Communist revolution, this is what they mean - there was barely any capitalism and no late-stage capitalism there in 1917, so the means of production there were in no state to be taken over by proles.The current situation in America is practically the opposite. Enterprises have consolidated, driving profit margins up, not down. The means of production have been allowed to wither and enshittify, rather than being perfected. Workers have been laid off, but the Gen Z military age kids you'd need for a prole revolution are too busy being rich to care that much (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-is-projected-to-become-the-largest-wealthiest-generation-according-to-report-185059231.html).   \\n  \\nIn some ways Marx actually overestimated capitalism, and in terms of its ability to buy off the bourgeois and even the proletariat with a high standard of living, he grossly underestimated it.","title":"CMV: \\"Late Stage Capitalism\\" Doesn't Exist"},{"text":"Only if there are no fact checkers.","title":"Kamala Harris wants another debate  will Donald Trump agree?"},{"text":"Sure but we're looking at a poll here not a prediction model.","title":"Kamala Harris nudges to a 4-point lead over Trump in Marquette poll of Wisconsin voters"},{"text":"Trumps sick,  Trump is the most difficult type of dementia patient, they won't quit driving, they hop out on their own, then they can't figure out where they are, they lose something and they accuse everyone else of stealing their stuff.

It's not simply that some bad things are the result of \\"late stage\\" capitalism, but that some bad things are indicative of capitalism reaching thar stageTwo examples people might use are climate change and pink or greenwashing. You may argue that climate destruction was also prevelant during stages of the industrial revolution, but supposedly we libereralized out of that, and we also definitely do know better. The neoliberal reliance on \\"free market\\" solutions creates a new situation, where in the past people wrecked the environment for profit and didn't know or care to do better, while now people wreck the environment for profit, know better, and supposedly even care a lot, but machinery in place means that nobody can do anything about it. Capitalism absorbs responsibility by gesturing with the invisible hand, and creates these situations of witnessing a car crash in slow motion where every driver involved has their foot jammed down on the gas peddle. They want to slow down, they want to not have to smash into another speeding car, but they can't actually conceive of anything that can be done about it. And it's not even their carPink washing should be self explanatory. Capitalism subsumes everything into itself, even direct criticism, and uses that to sell more t-shirts.
