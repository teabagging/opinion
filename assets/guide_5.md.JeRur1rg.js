The focus on high-profile figures isn't about \\"canceling\\" them in isolation - it's about challenging the mechanisms through which structural problems manifest and perpetuate themselves.Let's take Elon Musk. When people criticize him, they're not just attacking him personally - they're highlighting how billionaires exploit tax loopholes, manipulate markets, and wield disproportionate political influence. These individual cases become powerful examples that help average people understand complex structural issues.I am not convinced that Andrew Tate has created a single misogynist - he probably just tapped into something that was already thereThis is exactly backwards. Of course underlying conditions exist, but influential figures actively shape and amplify these problems. Tate didn't just \\"tap into\\" existing misogyny - he created a profitable business model around radicalizing young men and selling them a toxic worldview. That's a structural issue playing out through individual action.The left isn't being shallow - they're recognizing that structural change requires both policy reform AND confronting the specific people and institutions that maintain those structures. It's not either/or.Look at how Trump's presidency reshaped political norms and institutions. Individual leaders absolutely can strengthen or weaken structural problems. Pretending they're just interchangeable figureheads ignores how power actually works in the real world.The most effective movements in history combined structural analysis with strategic pressure on key individual actors. That's not a contradiction - it's good strategy.","title":"CMV: The left's tendency to analyze society through a structural lens is incompatible with their ruthlessly individualistic response to sole actors"},{"text":"This is what rational people are asking for: closing loopholes and abuse of the HB-1 visa system.

Romans 2:12-16:All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Gods sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.  (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) This will take place on the day when God judges peoples secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.This is basically straight up saying that non-Christians CAN be saved. That those who follow the law God put in their hearts may still be saved.Now Christianity does also state that whoever believes in Christ will be saved (though it later expands on that, in specifying even demons believe but the faith that leads to salvation must be accompanied by acts of devotion) and that non come to the Father except through Christ.I personally believe something very similar to Saint Augustine. Now this is my opinion here but its based on a fair bit of knowledge and largely rooted in the beliefs of one of the best studied Christians of all time.My thought is that on the day of judgment we will stand before God and be given full knowledge of who he is. And then we will have the choice to humble ourselves and accept his authority and be saved or to reject his authority and be cut off from him in hell.If this is true, living a Christian life where we continuously seek to know him better, surrender authority to him, and live in accordance with his will is the best possible way to prepare for the day of judgment. But it also means that people who are not Christians in life might still be able to make the right choice on the day of judgment.I dont think this is going to be an easy yes or no answer. I think for instance, if you have an addiction to porn there is going to be this painful moment where you choose between giving it up forever and living in Gods kingdom where it does not exist or clinging to it and dwelling in hell where sins of the flesh still exists. If you believe in a racist God who loves your race more than others youre going to have this painful moment where you must give up that false belief and submit to the true God who loves us all equally. I think judgment will be painful for everyone. Even Christians. But the closer you are to God when it happens the less painful it will be.Every statement in scripture Ive heard about faith and salvation seems to be consistent with this view.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I feel the law is bullshit but I dont really see how a president-elect can ask for a congressional passed law to be delayed?","title":"Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok sale deadline"},{"text":"A.

Then once he had rustled those folks and got them out to the polls (or mailing in their absentee ballot), he was able to turn his attention to and focus on the more reliable Republican voters leading into actual Election Day. Made a lot of sense. If we were to get rid of early voting, and just had voting on Election Day, its infinitely harder to get all our people to the polls. The problem comes with voting early by many weeks or months, ballot harvesting, mail-in ballots getting indiscriminately blasted out, no ID, no signature verification, vote count machines, etc.I think people  even Republicans  like being able to go to be polls a week early.I used to be in favor of one day of voting.

(If a religion is not true then it would be immoral to preach it, under the general principle that one should not promote untruths).If you think no religion is true, then how are you to rank them by morality? I would say, the more moral ones are the ones that do the least harm. The question of salvation is irrelevant to this, because salvation is not a real thing from an atheist point of view. You should only look at the real world effects of the various religions.

This time, the president-elects plan is to hold entire families together in tents. Undocumented parents whose children were born in the United States, and thus have citizenship, will have to choose whether to be deported together as a family or leave their children behind.Migrants without papers who have built new lives in this country will be apprehended in their homes and at their workplaces. National Guard troops likely will not be used to conduct these raids but instead transport detainees to the centers where they will be held.Trumps incoming border czar, Tom Homan, gave this sketch of what we will soon witness in a wide-ranging interview with The Post published on Thursday. In previous remarks, Homan has promised a shock and awe campaign against undocumented migrants. When the roundups get underway, the military transports start rolling and the tent-city detention centers begin to fill, no one will be able to say we were not warned.It is undeniably true that the southern border is a mess and the whole U.S. immigration system is dysfunctional. This has been the case for decades, under Democratic and Republican presidents. The solution has also been obvious for decades: We need comprehensive reform that secures the border; provides viable pathways for legal immigration; offers asylum to those seen as legitimately fleeing oppression or life-threatening violence; provides legal status to the dreamers, who were brought here as children and know no other country; and acknowledges the reality that uprooting and expelling an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants, almost all of them leading productive lives, would be an unrealistic exercise in national self-harm.All of that is clear. But it is also clear that Trumps send them all home demagoguery on immigration has been the most consistent theme throughout his three presidential campaigns. This year, it appealed not only to the far-right xenophobic fringe but also to many other voters who were dismayed by scenes of lawless chaos along the border.As Trump found out while in office, however, rhetoric eventually collides with reality. Mexico did not pay for his border wall, which went mostly unbuilt. And there were measures that most Americans were not willing to countenance.Homan found out, too. As Trumps acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he implemented the infamous zero tolerance policy that separated more than 5,000 children from their parents or guardians, often shipping the youngsters hundreds of miles away  and not even bothering to carefully track who was sent where.\\nThat time, Trump and Homan had to back down. This time, they will test the nations tolerance for seeing families held for extended periods in tents  and parents having to decide whether the only way to guarantee safety and opportunity for their U.S.-born children is to leave them here, with no guarantee of seeing them again.","title":"Trumps border plan keeps families together  by holding them in tents"},{"text":"It appears this MAGA hasn't gotten the memo that it is Elon's US","title":"Man accused of attacking TV reporter, saying This is Trumps America now"},{"text":"That the white supremacist, Nazi,accelerationists, MAGA terrorists who infiltrated those protests in every state in 2020 are domestic terrorists.

The issue is not the philosophies it is the humans practicing  the philosophies feeling morally superior and acting  morally superior and then treating any one not following \\"the way\\" with contempt; which is in fact something they are taught NOT to do at a young age. But then we grow and watch our elders and teachers all have an attitude of \\"I am right and you are a idiot\\", Which 90% of humans over the age of 15 have whether they are willing to admit it or not and 100% of humans have this attitude for quite some time before realize what they are doing and how they are treating people. At some point we all act this way toward at least one person or group. More is the pity.So this is what I feel is the issue most people have with religion, it is not the actual religious philosophy, in most cases looking at that you can find  things  you actually agree with, not everything but somethings. It is the people representing those philosophies and beliefs that suck.Humans ruining it for everyone else since 1,000,000 B.C.; or that apple incident, depending on what you believe..","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"right on cue, MAGA begins screaming about *investing* in the American worker while simultaneously promising to cut 2.5 Trillion to squeeze another corporate tax cut under the debt ceiling.","title":"Maga v Musk: Trump camp divided in bitter fight over immigration policy"},{"text":"I do not think this picture played a meaningful statistical factor in Trump winning; however, that doesnt make it a less iconic moment.

So its probably going to be China in that scenario.My opinion is that the West in general should stay together, undemocratic and tyrannical forces worldwide are getting stronger. The US and Europe have always been the bastions of freedom since WW2. For Europe, its a shame what happened to our countries the last 15 years. Weak politicians took over, while traitors like the AFD and LePen gained power. Luckily there are politicians like Meloni.And the end of the day we are too great nations, with a too great history, to limit ourselves to small dreams.

Some of them are **completely fucking fake**. On Judaism, specifically, to be holy means to be, as the text explains, to be chosento be a people for his treasured possession.This possession is the commandments, ie the rules and Torah and laws. Jews are commanded to follow more rules which do not apply to non-Jews. This does not make Jews better, it makes them the nation chosen to follow laws that Jewish tradition teaches make a person happier **while alive**. The idea is that they lead to a better life, not to salvation or superiority in a moral sense. You are misreading the intent behind the words as well as some of the interpretations of text itself. Deuteronomy 7:6 is in the context of other nations; Jews are commanded not to stray from the teachings of God and worship idols, not because they are better, but because they should remain faithful to the laws they (and not non-Jews) must follow to maintain the covenant signed with God for a bountiful life.Bava Kama 113a does not say this. It is really problematic to see upvotes and awards for fake quotes about Judaism. It does not say that if a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile (heathen) then it doesnt have to be returned. At all. There is no claim as such there. And anyone familiar with the Talmud can explain quite clearly that said Talmud section is actually a debate where the side that says you cannot steal from gentiles or dishonestly favor Jews over them in legal matters, nor is it allowed to rob a gentile (paraphrasing).The same is true of Avodah Zara 26b. This is an old claim that does not exist. It does not say anything about killing gentiles. It is fake. This quote is likely derived from internet neo-Nazis who made it up, and it persists. The closest you get is something from an entirely different book of the Talmud, Sofrim 15:10, which says to kill the best of the heathens **in time of war**, and is referring to the fact that even at war, you should kill the enemy, even if they are honorable and moral people, because they are still at war. It does not say kill all gentiles or anything close.Go to the source documents.

Now the children and grandchildren of these people don't undercut other people from my country as they want the same wages and benefits as everyone else. They have intigrated by now.

What's the point of comparing? ancient religions on hypothetical ethical claims about the afterlife. Within each religious tradition there will be many different versions of the afterlife anyway all with different ethics.?For example in 19th century Britain there existed people called sin-eaters who ate a ritual meal to take on people's sins so others could go to heaven and dooming them to hell. In the middle ages those who died fighting in the Crusades were given heaven as a reward for their martyrdom. Many people today believe that those favored gain material wealth as a reward for their piety. These are all quite radically different from your model. To me at least they seem worse.?\\nHinduism and Buddhism is also hyperdiverse and in actual practice I'm not sure the differences are as extreme as the theology might seem to imply. At some level what matters is what's on the ground, the reality of what people are doing day to day and year to year. Examining the ethics of a hypothetical model of the afterlife becomes too abstract and becomes an argument of definitions across languages.

With the narrow majority the Republicans have, there's extraordinarily little chance that they'll depart from precedent - which is the most senior member of the majority party.  At Grassley's age, the odds that he dies prior to Jan 20th are higher than the odds that someone else will be selected.  If Grassley dies, Moscow Mitch is next in line.  Given that he's also no spring chicken, and unlike Grassley, has significant known health issues, it's really unlikely but not implausible that _both_ of them die in the next month.  If so, Susan Collins is next ins seniority.By the point you get to Susan Collins, the odds are probably better that they dispense with precedent, but just any two of Grassley, the turtle, or Collins would be enough to ensure that tradition gets followed.  Maybe Garland as AG but I don't know if his Jon technically ends with Biden or of they stay on until the new Presisent replaced them. Cabinet members do not have a fixed term of office, but can be fired by the new President if they want to replace them.  Most recently, Obama carried over Robert Gates for a while as defense secretary - he did not require a new confirmation.  Had Harris been elected, she would have likely kept on most of Biden's cabinet for a few weeks until new nominees were confirmed (or may have had Biden submit nominees for her early, which is known to happen with same-party Presidents, although it's not an obligation for the outgoing one.)Traditionally, cabinet members resign to avoid being fired by the new President, but there's no legal requirement they do so.

St. Augustine wrote (around 300 C.E.) that the first 11 chapters of Genesis are allegorical and meant to teach us morality rather than a scientific blueprint. He was one of many early Church fathers building on top of the New Testament artifice in tension with the world as it was. It was certain Protestants who rejected this developmental process that St. Augustine was involved in that began to propose the 10,000 year-old Earth and biblical literalism. This is why Catholics and Orthodox have never had a problem with Old Earth.

For example, a significant part of the Jewish Torah details the process of sacrifices and, practically nowhere, details the organization of the Jewish liturgy, yet, Jews have not made sacrifices for nearly 2000 years and Jews have had a fixed liturgy for nearly 500 years. Religious beliefs and actions are the philosophical and behavioral superstructure for which holy texts are only one part of the foundation. Some of the other comments address these philosophical changes over time.When it comes to the philosophy concerning the treatment of other religions, these were philosophies that developed over time and through interaction with peoples of other faiths. But let's go through the particular citations you raise and point out why the mainstream beliefs within those categories don't follow the logic here from a purely textual analysis:Deut. 7:6/14:2 -- This concept of \\"chosenness\\" falls into the Jewish perception which I mentioned in the beginning, that Jews have a specific mission or purpose which is different from those of Gentiles. Different does not mean superior. Most Jews would phrase it in the way that engineers and lawyers are different and contribute meaningfully in different ways, but it would be absurd to claim that one was superior, even if we care more about what lawyers do on the express question of \\"what is legal?\\" as opposed to caring more about engineers on the express question of \\"what is possible.\\"Talmud, Bava Kamma 113a: -- The wording you provide is different from the wording in the relevant section, which concerns making change through exchanges with certain kinds of tax collectors' bursar (as opposed to their personal funds, which can be exchanged to make change). From Sefaria, a Jewish website that hosts Jewish religious texts:\\"One may not exchange larger coins for smaller ones from the trunk of customs collectors nor from the purse of tax collectors, and one may not take charity from them, as they are assumed to have obtained their funds illegally. But one may take money from the collectors house or from money he has with him in the market that he did not take from his collection trunk or purse.\\"Talmud, Abodah Zarah 26b -- This is a rather complex argument as discussed in detail at the link below, but to keep it as simple as possible, the context for the remark is with respect to enemy combatants (who may have been upstanding men) specifically in the case of the Egyptians pursuing the Israelites at the Red Sea. The Talmud has other lines in it which are opposed to the killing of Gentiles and the Talmud also respects that the Non-Jewish, dominant law of a country (which will almost always criminalize the killing of Gentiles) should apply whenever no Jewish law expressly contradicts it. So, this verse is out of context and not generally applicable.[http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/kill.html](http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/kill.html)Christianity:John 14:6 (New Testament)/Acts 4:12 (New Testament): -- This is a restatement of the belief that I wrote in my first comment to you, which is that only through the Sacrifice Upon the Cross can a person who is aware of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross achieve salvation. However, those who have not heard of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross are not required to have heard it to achieve salvation. As Romans 10:14 says, \\"How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?\\"Matthew 7:21-23 (New Testament): -- This actually proves the point that I made in the first comment, which is that being a Christian without a true understanding of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross is insufficient to achieve salvation. A person's belonging to the category of being Christian (and even performing wonders) does not substitute for the acceptance of divine grace that is necessary.Islam:Surah 3:85 (Quran): -- One of the fundamental issues with interpreting the Qur'an is that the Qur'an has many contradictory verses that are very context-dependent. You have cited a verse that is contradicted by Q: 2:256 and the verse that I indirectly cited in my previous comment Q: 2:62. Q: 2:62 in particular assures salvation for the Jews, Christians, and Sabeans (as I mentioned). Additionally, we should note that the Qur'an often equivocates with the word \\"Islam\\" between two different concepts: (1) the religion expressed by Muhammad and the Qur'an with five pillars and (2) the idea of monotheism in the Abrahamic tradition more generally. (This is why Muslims will say that Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were all Muslims despite not following the teachings of the Qur'an and Muhammad.) Q: 3:85, especially when given the context of verses Q: 3:81-85 looks much closer to definition (2).You've noted that Q: 2:62 is an arbitrary exclusion and I would push back on the arbitrariness (it is based on the concept that these are all Islam under definition (2)) but there is an exclusivity. All religions teach that certain people will not achieve salvation and the issue that Islam raises here is that salvation comes through certain behaviors and interactions with the world which older incarnations of Islam under definition (2) have, which brings them into the fold. When Muslims had more interaction with Zoroastrians (who have a different monotheistic or henotheistic tradition), Zoroastrians were often added as another accepted group. There were also occasions (although it was religiously contentious) by Muslim Mughal leaders in India to add Hindus to this group because Hindus also appeared to be moral and, therefore, touched with the same Islam under definition (2) as the other monotheistic faiths. So, it's not as exclusive as at first blush and the exclusion isn't arbitrary, it's based on moral character.Surah 4:56 (Quran): -- This verse isn't great, but it doesn't negate Q: 2:62 -- since those worshippers would still not be denying God's signs.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Prove they were taken on purpose to begin with.","title":"Trump Says Bill Gates Asked to Visit Mar-a-Lago in Bizarre Truth Social Post That Appeared to Be Meant For Private Message"},{"text":"\\"I called my congressman and he said quote \\"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote\\"\\"","title":"Trump has been awfully quiet."},{"text":"Crazy Maggie wanted ol' Muskie to be speaker, not no more XD","title":"MTG Wades Into MAGA Fight With Weird Screed Blaming Young People | \\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has decided to weigh in with an absurd take on the MAGA feud over immigration."},{"text":"How old is x?","title":"Trump and Bill Gates inviting Elon's son X to Mar-a-Lago for New Year's Eve"},{"text":"Dude Elon has BEEN censoring people on a supposedly big platform for defending free speechNow theyre upset its their turn","title":"\\"Divorce is coming soon\\": MAGA civil war erupts after Trump allies accuse Elon Musk of \\"censorship\\""},{"text":"of course scholarly opinion deviates. scholars have an interest in preserving the image of their religion. this compels them to change and bend things to fit various audiences. however, when we go straight to the source, we can quite easily find the truth.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Lol omg \\"the Jan 6th incident\\". ?? incredible.","title":"Congress has the power to block Trump from taking office, but lawmakers must act now."},{"text":"This is how the richest man on earth communicates?

If they are really from god, well, god doesn't really need to care what you (or really anyone else) think of him, because he is all powerful and stuff. You need to care what he think is moral, because well, he is all powerful and you are not (presumably). It isn't very fair, but supreme power comes with perks.I don't know if that tracks. I've never thought that \\"what God says is right is right because he's all powerful\\" is really a good justification for what is *actually* right.Think about it this way: A dictator comes to power in a country, and tries to get something completely eradicated within that country. (whatever the thing is doesn't matter, maybe say phones for instance.) If you're seen with a phone, it's taken away from you and destroyed. Protest the destruction of phones and this dictator will have you killed. He preaches that phones are the source of everything wrong in society and that destroying them and any people who use them is perfectly morally acceptable. Even though this hypothetical dictator is stronger than us, and has incredible power over our lives, that has absolutely nothing to do with the genuine righteousness of what he's doing.Now assume that this dictator, for all intents and purposes, has basically infinite power. He can snap his fingers and reshape the world in an instant. He doesn't need any military to support him, since no weapon can kill him. In this incredibly powerful state, his hatred for phones still isn't any more morally justified, but his ability to impose those morals on other people is.Maybe no one will speak up against him, for fear of being killed... But that still doesn't make his actions and opinions right.Like, if I decided to beat up someone who's weaker than me because they're doing something I don't agree with, that doesn't make my opinion any better or worse than his. That just makes me an asshole who can't accept people thinking differently without wanting them harmed.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Over half the nation this time got on board with the fuck you vote\\nThe total number of votes was 152 million.

But what you've missed is that salvation is explicitly *not* based on morality (or rather, it is expected that morality follows salvation).Because no one is sufficiently moral to be saved, God condescends to us and grants us the opportunity to be saved despite our inadequacy, merely by following Him.  Salvation is given by God for His own reasons.  This is exemplified in both the thief on the cross (who was promised salvation literally as he was dying, absent any good works) and the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16): \\"Dont I have the right to do what I want with my own [salvation]? Or are you envious because I am generous?\\"So yes, salvation is unjust.  But Christian doctrine is that it is not *salvation* which is just, but *damnation* - we all deserve to be punished and God will punish us fairly, except that He has chosen to show mercy to some simply because it is His will.I don't expect this to change your mind, because I don't think most people look for justice unless it indemnifies them, because people generally don't judge themselves to be bad people.On the other hand, though, I find that Eastern religions don't satisfy my sense of justice at all.  For example, I would desire reincarnation (because life is generally desirable), and the idea that only the best people do not receive it seems grotesque.  The idea that people cannot in one lifetime 'recover' from a misspent youth is bleak and hopeless.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"New Year's Eve in the question: https://youtu.be/o5Xkf8sOR90?si=XQefyd61POUiXPIF","title":"Trump and Bill Gates inviting Elon's son X to Mar-a-Lago for New Year's Eve"},{"text":"Clinton killed the office that actually handled this back in his term.

I have never heard of either. A google search only turns up references to extreme anti-Semitic and conspiracy type sites. They rely on people being too lazy or ignorant to actually read the Talmud, and in further not understanding what the Talmud actually is.The Talmud is in places a record of various Rabbinical debates over the correct interpretation of the minutiae  of Jewish law. It is not the case that everything written in the Talmud is a binding statement of Jewish law: its a record of *debates*, in which one Rabbi writes one thing, another contradicts him, and a third says why both the other two are wrong. So it is easy for the ignorant or ill-intentioned to take something said by a rabbi out of context, and claim Jews believe X when they believe no such thing.That said, I checked out your first quote, and it appears straight up invented. Here is the part cited, available online in translation: https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.26b?lang=biNothing there I could see remotely resembling the alleged quote. I havent bothered to look up the other one.Edit: just because Im bored, I also looked up the second cite. It may be found here:https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.113a.21?lang=biThe concept shows up - but in the context of a debate proving the exact opposite point. The commentary expressly states, after multiple debates using various tactics (what if a Jewish slave is attempting to escape?) with an absolute pronouncement: it is not permitted to rob or deceive non-Jews, because to do so would desecrate Gods name; and ultimately the law of the kingdom is the law, meaning Jews are obliged to follow local civil laws. With regard to items lost by gentiles, there is a whole debate, but the ultimate conclusion appears to be that  (a) it is prohibited to steal from gentiles, and (b) it is prohibited to retain an item lost by a gentile that comes into ones hands, as retention of an article lost by a gentile would result in the desecration of Gods name. It is actually worth the time to read this section (in small part - the Talmud goes on and on) just because it shows how this ancient form of Jewish law-making works  and how easy it is for haters to take a section from a debate out of context. The debate here involves various rabbis making arguments - why cant Jews manipulate the law to take advantage of non-Jews? - only to have these arguments shot down.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"RIP","title":"Trump and Bill Gates inviting Elon's son X to Mar-a-Lago for New Year's Eve"},{"text":"If Trump being an acquaintance/friend of a vile slime ball like Bill Gates is not enough for the MAGA cult to realize that Trump isn't the \\"savior\\" they think he is, nothing will","title":"Trump and Bill Gates inviting Elon's son X to Mar-a-Lago for New Year's Eve"},{"text":"Thanks for voting.","title":"Man accused of attacking TV reporter, saying This is Trumps America now"},{"text":"They will oh yes they will.","title":"Donald Trump tells EU to buy more US oil and gas or face tariffs"},{"text":" Shoot your shot  It could be the best thing for you both.

While early Christians may have had a more physical view of resurrection, the evolution of Christianity led to a more abstract, divisive understanding of the afterlife, emphasizing Heaven and Hell and often leading to oppression.The real-world consequences of these beliefsforced conversions, missionary work, and religious imperialismraise serious ethical questions. Its not just about the intellectual debate but how these ideas shape behavior and impact peoples lives. The history of how these beliefs spread and were enforced shows the dangers of such exclusivity.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I'm confused by Trump's America, are they deporting immigrants or bringing more in?","title":"Man accused of attacking TV reporter, saying This is Trumps America now"},{"text":"lol this should be good.

The irony is thick.You argue that the exclusivity of Abrahamic religions isnt inherently unjust because its supposedly based on an objective \\"truth\\" that people must recognize to \\"live properly.\\" But thats precisely the problem. These religions claim to possess *the* truth, and if you dont belong to the \\"right\\" group or recognize the \\"right\\" God, you're either punished or excluded, no matter how virtuous you might be otherwise. Its not just a minor flawits a moral blind spot that causes real harm by creating divisions between people based solely on belief systems that are out of their control. Thats not inclusion. Thats a moral hierarchy that arbitrarily separates people into \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" based on factors like birth and exposure to a particular religion.Now, you want to turn the tables and accuse *me* of being exclusionary, of creating an \\"in-group\\" and an \\"out-group.\\" Lets be clear: Im *not* the one claiming that people are condemned to eternal punishment because they happened to be born in the \\"wrong\\" place or never heard of a particular creed. Its you defending a framework that makes salvation contingent on the \\"right\\" beliefs while dismissing the worth of entire groups of peopleJews, Hindus, Buddhists, and otherssimply because they dont subscribe to the same belief system.I am not condemning people to eternal torture nor do I have the power to.

Buddhism included. That's the nature of truth, you are asserting one thing is true and other things are false. It must be exclusionary. In the topic of salvation, it's not even a concept in most of those other religions, so how could there be any comparison? Salvation is not a concept that exists in Buddhism. The closest parallel is nirvana and escaping the wheel, but that's not the same thing as salvation at all. The is the core of the problem with your thinking. Of course Buddhism and Hinduism don't \\"exclude\\" people from salvation, they have no salvation to offer. Salvation is a concept of Abrahamic religions, so realistically, you could only compare Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in terms of how they each gatekeep salvation.Why should someone who has lived an ethical and compassionate life be condemned simply because they didnt believe in a specific deity, while a believer who acts unethically is rewarded?That's not what Christianity teaches. It teaches that the person you are imagining that has lived a completely \\"holy\\" life, filled with ethics and faultless compassion doesn't exist (outside of Jesus). As in, there is not a single person you can point to that has lived a perfect life, that has never failed to extend compassion. They teach that it is because we are flawed in our nature that we need salvation to begin with. The idea that there's someone out there living purely good and is going to be punished unfairly is not one that lines up with the human experience. I'm sure you've never met a perfect person and I'm sure you're not going to claim to be one.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Civil war.","title":"Liberal Attorneys Propose 'Nuclear Option' to Bar Trump from Presidency"},{"text":"Where did you draw that conclusion from though","title":"Trump and Bill Gates inviting Elon's son X to Mar-a-Lago for New Year's Eve"},{"text":"Only reason why they would want to do this is to try to make it harder for them to investigate fraud from their rich besties.","title":"Republicans quietly cut IRS funding by $20 billion in bill to avert government shutdown"},{"text":"No Catholicism as the church stands today, is much more lenient than that. ?Much to the dismay of the old fashioned Catholics who many of them believed only those who are actually baptized can stand a chance of heaven. ?","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Next level?","title":"How do you know when it's the right time to take a friendship to the next level?"},{"text":"I don't think you read my comment properly.

They are features, not bugs.Parliamentary governments operate on the concept of supply and confidence, supply meaning being funded by an approved state budget and confidence meaning support of the majority of parliamentarians. Losing either only means a new election. The American system is not designed for any of that. Its a totally different political system with a different set of rules and norms.This is not normal for the American system with its presidential system, first past the post and two party system and fixed terms. The American system means loss of supply or the inability to approve federal funding results in a government shutdown. That doesnt happen in any other country. In other countries legislators being unable to pass such a bill would mean new legislators. The fact legislators cant topple a presidential administration and call for brand new election in a motion of no confidence means American politicians have traditionally put up a more united front.In the US there is no such thing as coalitions because you either have a majority or you dont. In a proportional system like Israel or Germany you never get a single party with a majority. The times when Likud failed to form government was because his right-wing bloc didnt have a majority of seats; they were between 2-6 seats short for three elections in a row. But in those cases when Likud and their bloc couldnt form government the opposition was also too small and divided to form a stable government either.","title":"MAGA Crisis Could Mean There Is No Trump Inauguration on Jan. 20"},{"text":"my thoughts exactly","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"It seems like you're trying to dodge the real issue by turning this into a personal attack on my beliefs.

The issue isn't necessarily that Gods morality is above reproach (if you believe in God, thats a given), but whether the rules were being told come from God actually *are* from Him. If theres no way to verify that these rules come directly from a divine source, then theyre just human interpretations of what they think God would want. And if those interpretations are wrong, then the whole system falls apart.You also have to consider the fact that power doesnt inherently equal morality. Just because God is all-powerful doesnt mean everything He does or says is automatically morally justified by His power alone. We can agree that supreme power comes with perks, but power without any standard of goodness or justice is just tyranny. If God's rules are inherently moral, they should stand up to scrutiny based on qualities like fairness, compassion, and consistency. If they dont, it raises the question of whether those rules truly come from a benevolent, all-powerful being or if theyre just man-made ideas dressed up in divine authority.And finally, if a religion claims to have divine authority but doesnt have a way to demonstrate that its teachings truly come from God, then its not just about whether its \\"true\\" or notits about whether it's actually useful or just a collection of cultural myths and social control mechanisms. At that point, the question of morality becomes secondary to the much larger question of whether the religion is even based on anything real in the first place. Idk, maybe this is just the atheist in me talking.Regardless, I still think we should try to understand religious morality in a human context via discussion and logical reasoning.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"They don't even try to hide the fact anymore that they're indeed mocking us.

Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS non-filer program ran sporadically since 2016 due to severe budget and staff limitations that did not allow these cases to be pursued. With new Inflation Reduction Act funding, the IRS now has the capacity to do this core tax administration work. In the first six months of this initiative, nearly 21,000 of these wealthy taxpayers have filed, leading to $172 million in taxes being paid.    The IRS in the fall of 2023 launched a new initiative using Inflation Reduction Act funding to pursue high-income, high-wealth individuals who have failed to pay recognized tax debt, with dozens of senior employees assigned to these cases. This work is concentrated on taxpayers with more than $1 million in income and more than $250,000 in recognized tax debt. The IRS was previously unable to collect from these individuals due to a lack of resources. After successfully collecting $38 million from more than 175 high-income, high-wealth individuals last year, the IRS expanded this effort last fall to around 1,600 additional high-income, high-wealth individuals. Nearly 80% of these 1,600 millionaires with delinquent tax debt have now made a payment, leading to over $1.1 billion recovered.

I have personally seen many of my skilled friends impacted by layoffs, while their companies make record profits and hire cheaper labor. Heres a brutally honest critique:1. A Smokescreen for Cheap LaborCompanies often argue that H-1B workers fill specialized roles, but lets be real: its often about cost savings, not skills shortages. H-1B workers are subject to wage standards that may be lower than what companies would have to pay domestic workers in the same roles. This practice isnt about solving a labor shortageits about maximizing profits at the expense of both American and immigrant workers.2. Disregard for American WorkersThe idea that there arent enough skilled Americans is a cop-out. Thousands of qualified tech workers are being LAID OFF, many with advanced degrees and years of experience. If companies were serious about workforce sustainability, theyd invest in reskilling and upskilling laid-off workers rather than taking the easy (cheap) route of importing talent. The reality is that companies dont want to invest in peoplethey want CHEAP ready-made solutions.3. Undermining the American DreamH-1B workers come here believing in the promise of opportunity but often find themselves trapped in exploitative conditions. They are tied to their sponsoring employer, limiting their ability to advocate for better pay or workplace rights. Meanwhile, American workers are sidelined, creating resentment and fueling toxic narratives about immigration.4. Corporate HypocrisyThese same companies crying about labor shortages are the ones laying off tens of thousands of employees. Theyre telling the world they need foreign workers because Americans dont have the skills, while simultaneously gutting their workforce and leaving skilled professionals scrambling for jobs. The inconsistency reeks of corporate greed and poor planning.5. Weaponizing ImmigrationThe H-1B visa system is being used as a tool to drive down wages and worker power. By keeping a pipeline of vulnerable, dependent workers, companies ensure they maintain leverage over their workforce. Its not about innovation; its about creating a compliant, inexpensive labor pool.6. Destroying Trust in TechThese practices erode trust in the tech industry. American workers feel betrayed, H-1B workers feel exploited, and the public grows increasingly skeptical of an industry that claims to drive progress while hollowing out jobs and livelihoods.Bottom LineThis isnt a labor shortageits a moral shortage.  Its time to call out the profit-over-people mindset and demand better.This post also doesnt even cover the jobs weve sent offshore.  Thats a whole other post for another day.

I have personally seen many of my skilled friends impacted by layoffs, while their companies make record profits and hire cheaper labor. Heres a brutally honest critique:1. A Smokescreen for Cheap LaborCompanies often argue that H-1B workers fill specialized roles, but lets be real: its often about cost savings, not skills shortages. H-1B workers are subject to wage standards that may be lower than what companies would have to pay domestic workers in the same roles. This practice isnt about solving a labor shortageits about maximizing profits at the expense of both American and immigrant workers.2. Disregard for American WorkersThe idea that there arent enough skilled Americans is a cop-out. Thousands of qualified tech workers are being LAID OFF, many with advanced degrees and years of experience. If companies were serious about workforce sustainability, theyd invest in reskilling and upskilling laid-off workers rather than taking the easy (cheap) route of importing talent. The reality is that companies dont want to invest in peoplethey want CHEAP ready-made solutions.3. Undermining the American DreamH-1B workers come here believing in the promise of opportunity but often find themselves trapped in exploitative conditions. They are tied to their sponsoring employer, limiting their ability to advocate for better pay or workplace rights. Meanwhile, American workers are sidelined, creating resentment and fueling toxic narratives about immigration.4. Corporate HypocrisyThese same companies crying about labor shortages are the ones laying off tens of thousands of employees. Theyre telling the world they need foreign workers because Americans dont have the skills, while simultaneously gutting their workforce and leaving skilled professionals scrambling for jobs. The inconsistency reeks of corporate greed and poor planning.5. Weaponizing ImmigrationThe H-1B visa system is being used as a tool to drive down wages and worker power. By keeping a pipeline of vulnerable, dependent workers, companies ensure they maintain leverage over their workforce. Its not about innovation; its about creating a compliant, inexpensive labor pool.6. Destroying Trust in TechThese practices erode trust in the tech industry. American workers feel betrayed, H-1B workers feel exploited, and the public grows increasingly skeptical of an industry that claims to drive progress while hollowing out jobs and livelihoods.Bottom LineThis isnt a labor shortageits a moral shortage.

That's why beliefs are important and make all the difference.Second, if you believe that everything just comes from nothing, or that we exist without any existential purpose, then you have no foundation to support any moral responsibility. What you claim is \\"good\\" has the same moral weight as what you think is \\"evil\\".If you look at human history, you realize people have rationalized all different kinds of contradictory actions to be good or evil. Atheists and many others often just rationalize the values and morals their cultural upbringing supports to be  good. Not realizing that there is no way you can objectively prove those things to be good, and that the same people would support entirely different morals and values, had their context be different. Third, it's a category error to treat gods with the Divine, or a higher power. Even some polytheistic religions have some variation of their group who understand Allah/God/Yahweh to be One Divine power. I think this misunderstanding comes from the English language, as the word \\"god\\" has multiple meanings. As the word can mean someone/something in nature or another human being or an element in nature that is praised or worshipped. Or it can refer to the supreme creator.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Did your Boomer dad put you up to this?","title":"MTG Wades Into MAGA Fight With Weird Screed Blaming Young People | \\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has decided to weigh in with an absurd take on the MAGA feud over immigration."},{"text":"Space unicorn!

It could an escape from a whirlpool into a rocky shoal for all we know (and likely this is true) but its still a direction that breaks previous trends in numerous ways and that gives hope in something other than the stagnation and trends toward government overreach that we've been barreling towards for decades.

It's more along the line of you can't help someone who doesn't want your help. Christians, depending on the denomination and it's hard to paint them all with the same brush, might believe in original sin, certainly believe that human nature is inherently sinful, so hell is just the default case if nothing is actively done to save your soul. It's not that God is refusing humans access to heaven unless they worship him, it's that God granted humans free will and one of the choices humans can make is to refuse God's freely offered help in achieving salvation.You're looking at different religions from the perspective of \\"what would you want to be true\\".

These religions you speak of are exclusive in the sense that they are monotheistic and their God demands that only He is to be worshipped and can save This goes back to the moral framework someone mentioned above.If you believe in absolute truth, as I do, then regardless of what you feel about it, there is one spiritual truth and according to Christianity, one God. A search for absolute truth and believing in the God of Christianity automatically precludes other religions from being true. So, regardless of how some may feel about Him judging people and not saving them, it might be true. The salvation through Jesus in the Bible is merciful and unwarranted based on humanities behavior and the Bible specifically states that all men have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The God described is perfectly righteous and cannot even be in the presence of the unrighteous., Out of mercy and love, He provided a way to save man. In doing so, He?is throwing mankind a life raft, so to speak. He didnt have to do anything of the sort.?The Bible actually describes hell as a horrible place not because of your standards of torture but because it is eternal human existence in complete absence of the presence of God. These people that reject God, the one true God, are not being torn limb from limb forever! They are being given just as they wanted- life apart from God. Unfortunately, if you believe man is designed by God in His image and is most complete and fulfilled in closest relationship to God, you will also believe this existence is one not worth having and thus torturous. That is what the Bible teaches.?Any moral standard that you have is irrelevant. Its nice that you think your moral standard is common to man but studying world societies and religions shows it is not. It is nice that you have empathy for the men who do not choose the one true God, but you are not the arbiter of justice if God exists, He is. He, as Creator and designer of the human race and universe has a better understanding of what is best for all and what is right.?What you describe thinking is that you believe your judgments of mens hearts and actions are just on par with what Gods would be and clearly God should save these moral men. Perhaps you are envisioning a small god who is more like a man and thinks like a man and can be in the presence of a sinful man. The God of the Bible is no such God and is beyond us in every sense. According to the Bible, the heart of man is deceitful and cant be trusted and there is some implication that man will be biased in his search for truth and it will prevent many from seeing truth. Once God opens your eyes to truth, these things become illuminated and you understand. Apart from experiencing that, it may be hard for you to comprehend how so many believe.?","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Im also Catholic.

Jesus dies in your place as a free gift to you so you don't have to die (in a spiritual sense). Salvation is just you accepting that gift.

For example, with Christianity, Jesus says that the only way to the Father is through me. But what does this really mean? Is Jesus limited to his form as a man, and one has to dedicate one's attention to this form? I do not interpret it this way.

The first written record of Christianity is Paul's first letter to Thessaloniki, a Greek city in the Roman Empire. His audience is probably a mix of Jews and Greeks, a quite radical notion of the time. This is evidence that from the litteral beginning of historical Christianity of that it was a universal religion. Paul would later spell out his ideas in another letter to Greece, Corinth. Anyone from any tribe or nation could worship in the same community. But the actual topic of the afterlife is the central problem of the letter. Paul makes it clear that death won't cut off anyone from salvation because the dead will be resurrected and will greet Jesus as their celestial king. The purpose of this letter was to correct an apparent idea in the city that those who died would cut off from this utopian kingdom.?\\nSo we can see that the problem you have raised is derived from this solution. Because everyone would be resurrected all people who in Paul's words \\"For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,?who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him.\\"?\\nAnd Paul thought that this would happen in his own words, again from the first historical document of Christianity.\\n\\"For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangels call and with the sound of Gods trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.?Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever.\\"Heaven clearly isn't some abstract nowhere place where souls chill out in bliss. He's talking about Earth's atmosphere.?You can see that your view might be placing a focus on a very abstracted idea of souls being sent one place or another; to bliss or torment.?In the actual historical context these ideas play out?very differently, the focus is typically about the fate of dead family and friends. It's not realistic to ignore both the historical context where these ideas started from nor the social problems they were designed to solve.?\\nThe exact way that these ideas changed over time from culture to culture overtime is also fascinating and sometimes horrific. The horrors of forced conversion are very real both today and in the past. What matters is lived reality not the intellectual debate on whether a given afterlife is ethically optimal or not. This lived reality gives us far more insight and raises for interesting and pressing ethical questions such as: when is it ethical to enforce your beliefs on others, what is the best social role for religion, and the ethical problems around missionary work.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Christianity shows that all are sinners and are incapable of saving themselves.

To accept the premises of the argument the OP must have a prior rejection of these faiths, as they are not consistent with the Christian, Jewish or Islamic ethical premises.

The aim of Buddhism is to achieve enlightenment. These are both salvations. What is immortality? It means that you never die. What is enlightenment? It means that you will never be reincarnated again. And surprise surprise, the only way to get to immortality is to practice Daoism. The only way to achieve enlightenment is to practice Buddhism.

In the Abrahamic religions, a very immoral sinner can go to heaven by converting at the last second before he dies.

D+a billion, but it's a jungle primary, so it may not be filled immediately.  Runoff March 29 if no one clears 50%.* Louisiana Senate District 23: R+a billion seat where the incumbent got elected to the Public Service Commission.  Again, March 29 runoff if needed.**February 25th: **California Senate District 36 primary:** Mark your calendars, circle this one, highlight it, do whatever, because we've got a flip opportunity!  I don't have Harris numbers, but Clinton and Biden both won this GOP-held Orange County seat while the GOP incumbent kept holding on.  But she's gone to the OC Board of Supervisors, and we've got a prime flip opportunity on **April 29th** when the general is.* California Assembly District 32: A deep-red Central Valley district held by CA-20's Vince Fong, where hopefully we can get someone into the April 29th general election.Elections are popping up all the time, so if you've got a tip, let us know!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 27, 2024"},{"text":"Storm Thurmand wasnt available?\\nEdit: *Strom.

A short history of ethics (2nd ed) and Three Rival views of Moral Enquiry.Here is the ultimate problem, the religious believer, whether you agree or disagree, is within his or her epistemic rights to hold an ethic derived from his or her religiis beliefs, which means he has grounds to reject this argument on the basis of his adherence to that faith. (See Plantinga for one case on this point in Warranted Christian Belief, along with Warrant and Proper function, looking at issues related to the transmission of warrant/justificatoon). You can make a modus tolens case from ethics, but only by demonstrating a necessary ethical conclusion from within that systems ethic is false or incoherent (care should be used, as those outside the tradition rend to make a believers eyes roll with bad argumentatIon).

Two points:- in Judaism, any person - Jew or not - is exactly equal in righteousness if they follow certain basic moral laws. These laws are known as the Noahide laws after the Prophet Noah - who was, in the mythology, a righteous man, but who was not Jewish (Judaism did not exist yet) and was the ancestor, in the mythology, of everyone on Earth. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_NoahThis is one of the oldest attempts to create a universal morality applicable to everyone. It certainly is not perfect (they waste, in my opinion, one on not worshiping idols and another on not blaspheming god), but it certainly is not the case that in Judaism only Jews can be righteous. In reality, someone who is not Jewish but who follows the Noahide laws is equally as righteous as the mist religious Jew who follows the mitzvot. - The chosen people point: This repeats a common (common to non-Jews anyway) misunderstanding of what Jews being the chosen people means. As noted above, it simply died not mean chosen for a superior fate in the afterlife (as stated, everyone following the Noahide laws is equally righteous to the most observant Jew - and following the Noahide laws is a **choice**). So what does it mean? Basically, that as a result of an ancient covenant between God and the Jewish people, Jews are expected to follow a multitude of laws not applicable to non-Jews: in return, God had promised them that they will never be destroyed. The reason for this (allegedly) is so that Jews can, by existing in this particular way, be a light unto the nations (that is, to the non-Jewish peoples of the world) each of whom may have quite different laws and customs. **According to Judaism itself**, there is no need for non-Jews to adopt Jewish laws and customs (as long as they follow the Noahide laws of basic morality). Thus, *Judaism does not seek to proselytize*, and indeed that would have no point: each people should, according to Judaism, follow their own ancestral customs  as long as these adhere to basic moral law. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_peopleNow some Jews, specifically some in the Reconstructionist community, expressly reject the chosen people idea - because it *implies* that Jews are superior to others. However, most Jews (including many Reconstructionists) reject this criticism as being a straw man based on accepting the misunderstandings of non-Jews as fact: Jews generally do not believe Jews being the chosen people makes a superiority claim.But whether that is true or not, one thing is absolutely certain: there is no mainstream Jewish belief among any major branch of Judaism that believes being a chosen people means Jews have a superior afterlife than non-Jews simply by being Jews.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I'm not in tech, is TikTok's algo really so much better than everyone else's?

It implies that morality and virtue are secondary to belonging to the right group or reciting the right creed\\" but this is not correct for any of the three monotheisms:With respect to Judaism, Judaism does not teach that Jews are somehow superior relative to other peoples or that Judaism is the correct religion for all people. When it comes to salvation, further, Judaism claims that it is harder for a Jew to achieve salvation than for a Gentile to achieve salvation because Judaism would argue that Jews have a distinct purpose and mission in the world and Gentiles have a different purpose and mission in the world and these two missions are complimentary. So, Judaism does not argue that morality or virtue are contingent to belonging to the correct group or reciting the correct creed.With respect to Christianity, the fundamental teaching of Christianity is that no human being can achieve salvation. The Sacrifice Upon the Cross is God providing an avenue for an individual to achieve salvation through the grace of God himself. Accordingly, it is the virtue of understanding human limitation and divine agape (selfless love) that leads to the Christian achieving salvation, not dint of birth. A person could be born into Christianity but not understand what the Sacrifice Upon the Cross is or how humans are limited. This person will not be saved. Further, as others have stated, a person who is not aware of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross with sufficient understanding to grasp this point would not be punished by God. So, Christianity does not argue that morality or virtue are contingent to belonging to the correct group or having the correct creed, if such creed was logistically impossible to have.With respect to Islam, the Qur'an recognizes Judaism, Christianity, and Sabeanism as acceptable faiths for achieving salvation, calling these three religions: Peoples of the Book (Ahl al-Kitaab) or People under Protection (Ahl ad-Dhimma). These became legal categories and classifications under Muslim-majority states and those categories often expanded to include peoples of other faiths like Hanifs and Zoroastrians. If other religions are acceptable, then having an Islamic belief is not key to achieving salvation.Perhaps more importantly, we should understand that the Dharmic Concept of Salvation is to escape Samsarra, a condition which none of the Abrahamic Faiths claim either exists (since reincarnation is widely rejected across Abrahamic Faiths with some minor exceptions) and life is considered a gift, not a source of pain. So, the salvation that the Dharmic Faiths promise would seem absurd to an Abrahamic believer since there is no \\"imprisonment\\" in the mortal coil and no forced reincarnation. Salvation in the Abrahamic traditions is achieving a closeness to the Divine such that soul is content and at peace as opposed to being spiritually tormented for its wickedness.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Well yes!

Even if Eastern religions conceptualize \\"salvation\\" differentlynirvana, moksha, or simply ethical livingthe key distinction is that these systems generally dont bar people from spiritual fulfillment based on adherence to specific doctrines. They prioritize actions, intentions, and personal growth, which creates a more inclusive framework.If we were to focus solely on linguistic or doctrinal differences, wed miss the underlying ethical comparison Im making. Regardless of what salvation or faith means within each tradition, the question is whether excluding people based on belief alone is morally justifiable. Eastern traditions largely avoid this issue, while many Abrahamic systems struggle with it. Language doesnt obscure that differenceit highlights it.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Your understanding of Abrahamic religions seems oversimplified. Let me address a few key points: This strikes me as morally problematic, especially when compared to the more inclusive or flexible perspectives found in many Eastern religionsThis is a common misconception. Eastern religions can be extremely exclusive in their own ways. Try being a beef-eating outcaste in traditional Hinduism, or violating Buddhist precepts while seeking nirvana. These religions often have rigid hierarchical structures and strict requirements for spiritual advancement. Why should someone's birthplace or exposure to a particular religion determine their spiritual fate?Many Christian and Islamic scholars actually address this. The concept of \\"invincible ignorance\\" in Catholicism suggests those who never had a real chance to know about Christianity might still achieve salvation. Similarly, Islamic scholars discuss the fate of people who never properly heard the message of Islam. It implies that morality and virtue are secondary to belonging to the right group or reciting the right creedNot really. The logic in Abrahamic faiths is that if there is one true God who created everything, then acknowledging this truth is itself a moral imperative. It's like saying \\"you must accept reality to live properly in it.\\" The exclusivity isn't arbitrary - it's based on the premise that there are fundamental truths about existence.I'd argue the Eastern religions you praise can actually be more problematic. The karma system essentially victim-blames people for their suffering (you're poor because you were bad in a past life), while Abrahamic religions often emphasize helping the less fortunate regardless of their \\"spiritual status.\\"Finally, calling religions \\"morally inferior\\" is itself a kind of exclusivist thinking. You're doing exactly what you accuse these religions of doing - creating an in-group (inclusive religions) and an out-group (exclusive religions) based on your own moral framework.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I encourage them to demand audits of every election, weed out fraudulent votes, etc.","title":"Dem Lawyers Urge Congress To Ignore Electoral College, Stop Trump, Make Kamala President"},{"text":"Its change my view not your view.

For Christianity, the idea of the \\"cosmic church\\" is intriguing, but it still relies on being unknowingly aligned with Christian principles, which feels like a backdoor rather than an upfront acknowledgment of pluralism.These nuances are steps in the right direction, but they dont fully address the core issue: salvation remains fundamentally tied to specific doctrines or frameworks rather than a universal focus on virtue or morality. It still prioritizes belief systems over a truly inclusive ethic, which is why I find them morally lacking in comparison to systems that don't impose these barriers at all.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Of salesmen!","title":"MAGA Crisis Could Mean There Is No Trump Inauguration on Jan. 20"},{"text":"You might be a Christian who subscribes to a non-exclusive idea of salvation, but there are many Christians who do not.The post is about exclusive theology around salvation, not the correct interpretation of Christianity.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Yup.

If we are talking about the first, religion's position in society is not only to keep moral order, but also to keep everyone united. Nationalism/fear of outsiders is an incredibly powerful force for a state or group which allowed monotheistic religions to become the masters of a big part of the world. After all, devotion to a cause and a group can be the foundation to a society, so as a purely social construction, I believe western religions are better.If we are talking about purely ethically and morally, we must first recognize that this discussion in a bit absurd: people view religion (wrongly in my opinion) as truths. A religious fanatic wrongly sees the edict and commandment of his faith like a physicist view the laws of physics. Therefore, evaluating whether it's more moral to believe in a central divine entity rather than universal laws/forces - like karma and enlightenment is quite strange.However, I still believe that it's better for a moral system to be based on centralization. Most religions are willing to get new believers at any price - sometimes even forcing conversions- meaning that it's not about keeping people out, it's about having a united belief system. Therefore, my argument is that an unified moral system based on doctrines is better than personalized ones. Most humans are morally idiotic: they don't ponder about good and evil. They do what they are told from their parents (that's why a big part of religious population had religious parents) and do what they \\"feel\\" is right. After all, why do you think appeal to emotions through the presentation of shocking consequences is such an effective oratory technique? Therefore, if you just tell people to \\"do good\\", \\"be ethical\\", most people are going to ask \\"how\\". If let to their own design, everyone will have their own version of \\"morality\\" and \\"doing good\\" and most of those morality will be full of holes. From my reading on psychology, people tend to use logic to justify their preconceived notions rather than basing their beliefs on logics. Therefore, a vast part of the population will be able to gaslight themselves into thinking that anything is acceptable and justify any terrible thing they want to do. Of course, I am not blaming or insulting people: no one ever taught you how to think \\"what is good?\\", \\"what is evil?\\", why XYZ is good or evil?\\". We were just told to \\"follow the rules\\", \\"do what your parents/teachers tell you to do\\". Therefore, what better than religion, the threat of the ultimate punishment, to get everyone on the same line?","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Not like that office was doing a bang up job anyways, but still","title":"Republicans Quietly Kill Office to Combat Foreign Propaganda"},{"text":"The book says a lot of things.

Abrahamic religions wrote the creation story in a very poetic and non-literal way, which upsets western readers who want clear literal answers of creation, but it teaches that the universe had a beginning which goes in line with the Big Bang theory.Anyways, I cant speak too much on behalf of Judaism and Islam since Im Christian, but the central theme of Christianity is grace. You arent saved through works, you are saved through belief since God has grace for us. In believing in Jesus and forming a connection to God through prayer and community in the body of the church you will be compelled to do good works and be a morally righteous person. However, nobody is saved from their works alone because everyone since at heart.?Its also not exclusive at all. You dont have to do anything to be Christian, you just have to believe. The religion isnt centered on being moralistic, but good morals are just a by product of belief.?If you want to talk about a broader sense of justice, you need some source of objective morality. Having a God who has a sense of objective good and evil who gave us all some sense of right and wrong answers this question pretty well.?Ofc plenty of people will practice Christianity badly, myself included at times. However, the central theme of grace is pretty bulletproof and I dont see any religion which offers a more loving view of the world.?","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"After 4 persistent years of revolution, Republicans finally block the certification of a presidential election. /s","title":"Pretty soon even the right will need a safe space from Musk."},{"text":"Pretty sure Twitter fell when it lost 80% of it's value when Musk took over.

I'm arguing that corporations want to drive down their costs - which you seem to agree with. Where we diverge appears to be that I'm also arguing that a corporation should be interested in developing talent pools, which means contributing to taxes and lobbying for legislation that furthers that goal. You say that's the sole role of government. I disagree because corporations don't want to raise their costs, and that raising their cost is incompatible with developing that talent pool. They want to come in and exploit a preexisting talent pool for their benefit. Which is why I believe companies are left with poaching from other countries.These are corporations that are taking large tax handouts for developing corporate campuses in different locations. Under the presumption that it will improve the local/regional economy. These companies are not parting with any more of their money than they can wrangle a deal to.Your anecdote of the person that was moved to Canada to retain them is well taken. There definitely are exceptions and people who are worth retaining at significant cost.What percentage of the population do you think could perform the $500K+ jobs that you're referring to? And what percentage of the population do you think could if we invested and gave everyone that was capable a shot at them?When I'm referring to \\"cheap labor\\" I'm speaking in relative terms. I'm talking about $400k vs $500k for the same level of talent. (I'm making this number up, I forgot what the laws in the US are about requirements of competitive compensation levels for H1B employees.)I do think that the US should be making itself an amazing place to live with lots of opportunity and benefits.

For Gods sake, its a common trope that teenage boys need to be reminded that Rick (literally the smartest man in his universe) and Walter White (who all-but single-handed creates a vast drug empire as a result of his intellect) *are not role models*. If anything, the current cultural zeitgeist *actively excuses* terrible behavior if the person is portrayed as being the smartest person in the room, which should make being such a person ridiculously appealing. Seriously, one of the biggest sitcoms *after Vivek stopped watching TV* (?) was The Big Bang Theory, which had literally the exact opposite theme that Vivek suggests is commonplace.","title":"CNN's Scott Jennings Pokes Fun at Vivek Ramaswamy For Blaming Shift to Foreign Workers on 'American Culture': 'Somebody Got Stuffed in a Locker'"},{"text":"I'm a 56 year old Iowa native and don't remember anyone else in his seat.

The plutocrats in charge would prefer to not pay *any* taxes for *any* reason (especially not to help peasants and undesirables) and by the same token they'd prefer to pay no wages either.  So, to distract the stupid-by-design electorate from the fact that their employers are deliberately paying them a microscopic fraction of what they deserve for their labor, they blame the tax man for daring to take what's needed to keep the country running from those already painfully paltry paychecks.  In addition, the electorate has also been sold the lie that if the uber-rich are allowed to have super-low taxes, they'll be able to pass the savings on to the lower classes with lower prices and higher wages.  This has, of course, *never* happened no matter how many tax cuts they get, but again, it's all just a distraction to keep the people mad at the government (among other scapegoats) while the rich continue to amass and extract obscene amounts of wealth for minimal cost and zero repercussions from the people they're using and abusing.It's a win-win for the plutocrats... at least until the system collapses, but they themselves are *also* too stupid to realize that inevitability.","title":"Republicans quietly cut IRS funding by $20 billion in bill to avert government shutdown"},{"text":"Wow dudeI suggest some mindfulness excercises: [https://www.mindful.org/mindful-strategies-to-ease-election-anxiety/](https://www.mindful.org/mindful-strategies-to-ease-election-anxiety/)Its alright if your chosen party didn't win.","title":"2025's Big Question: Can Republicans Govern?"},{"text":"Source?

In the next election there is going to be more than 156,302,318 (the number of people who voted in 2024) With that many votes to count it is better that they take their time and get it right.Think about it like this, Imagine if you had a book you checked out from a library. To turn it in you can't turn it in before the date, they make it so you can only turn it in on the date. This is silly. It is better that you get a good amount of time to turn in your votes early.What needs to change is they need to set a day two weeks out from election day where it gets announced who is the presumed winner. The media needs to step back, and stop calling elections on election day. There are a number of required recounts mandated by a lot of states, just to be sure, and it is presumptive to announce the winner too soon. I want the votes counted thoroughly, carefully, and diligently before anything is officially announced and called. Wanting things to be done all on the same day is just inviting error. In an elections there is a series of stages before they actually officially know who won. Election counters really don't have it fully sorted out until early December. Statistical Victory - The odds are in favor of a specific candidate - November 7th, Mathematical Victory - The number of votes is larger for a candidate than the remaining votes left to count - November 13th, Official Victory - They know for certain who the winner is - December 7th. This video has a good break down. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXQ1ieFRr0oPaper ballots. See the 2000 election. Those were paper ballots. It was still an issue. They used punch card versions in Florida, and those were terrible. I've only ever used paper ballots where you fill in the ovals with black ink. I know this is also flawed because I've had to check on my scantron tests at school and uncovered shenanigans. There is no fool proof version of this, you just have to trust the people counting the votes. Luckily there is a huge division of labor here and it isn't handled by a single entity. This makes it very hard to rig an election in the US. There are too many moving parts.Government issued voter ID. The way it works in Arizona is I have to register first before I can vote. I give them my drivers license number. In Arizona voter registration is handled by the DMV.  When it is election time I get a ballot in the mail. I fill it out. I do not have to wait in a line. I can mail it, or I can drop it off. I drop it off because mail is slower than I am. I do not need to show an ID twice. There is no redundant show of ID. There is a signature on my ballot affirming I'm not lying. Which, I suppose is fine, maybe pointless, but how do they know what my signature looks like? The process is smooth in Arizona.","title":"??BREAKING: President Trump plans to make Election Day a national holiday, implement single-day voting, paper ballots, and government-issued voter ID ..

It ended well for the Americans that were involved in the class-action lawsuit against the electricity/utility company- my cousin received somewhere over a million dollars, &amp; in those times, ~50 yrs ago, that was a lot of money.  However, as Ive lived to see many American companies bought-up, dismembered, broken-up &amp; sold off in every way any Corporate Board of blood suckers can think of, it most of the time didnt turn out well for the guys who were replaced.  The lawyers &amp; State &amp; Federal legislators, judges, have convoluted the laws &amp; exploited all the loopholes for Corporate gain (&amp; thereby independent gain by those MF-ers who do the dirty work for the Corporations, but then again, theyre also just people who need to eat &amp; provide shelter for their families too).  Yeah, next 4 yrs are going to be VERY INTERESTING.  A lot of us, those who pay attention, will be learning a lot about labor laws &amp; where the weaknesses are for the protection of the workers.  The Libertarians (Koch Bros, etc., joined the GOP just before the Reagan era) have been trying to bust unions &amp; pass laws preventing or limiting the rights of workers &amp; the middle-class for 50 yrs. And, they have LOTS of money to use to do it.  Musk is clearly one of those guys now.","title":"Republicans' X Verifications Disappear After Criticizing Elon Musk's Comments on American Workers: 'Doesn't Really Believe in Free Speech After All'"},{"text":" Where are you?

The fact that many tech companies have offices in foreign countries and are willing to relocate workers to avoid paying US taxes suggests that their priorities lie elsewhere. Furthermore, the current job market in the tech sector, which is experiencing downsizing, belies the claim that companies are struggling to find qualified workers.

The other beams holding concrete spanning between different columns unaffected are likewise not effected.The middle dropping causes the Outside to be pulled inwards. The exact opposite would happen if you clipped the whole side. That would cause the towers to topple like a tree.Once the center panels dropped it made a huge force on the entire slab below as that slab is all still interconnected and the load distributes. However, a load distributing that is more than 300 times what it should be causes that slab to collapse . You then end up for a whole slab dropping on a whole slab.

If you study those things, you've known for quite some time that this was coming and that it's going to get a lot uglier before it gets better. Conflict is inevitable; conflict inevitably begets change.- Karl MarxConflict theory. This is first semester Sociology stuff. The conflict Marx is referring to here is largely the disparity between haves and have nots. He believed that all of human history had been written in this fashion. Inevitably, in every human society there will be haves and have nots. Inevitably, some type of conflict will form out of this dynamic. And inevitably, this conflict will force some change to come out of it, for better or worse. \\"Something's gotta give\\", as they say. \\"The sociological eye\\" (that's what sociologists call it when observing society through a scientific lens) has been seeing an alarmingly wide disparity that is still continuing to widen, and even a layman would know it spells trouble. Take all the UH news as of late - conflict theory in action right there in our daily headlines. A have creating economic conflict out of something as essential as healthcare to the have nots, and he gets killed by a have not over it? Marx would laugh his ass off.As for the change? That's yet to be seen. But if Marx is correct, then the real conflict has barely even begun.","title":"Consumers Finally Realize That Trump Could Worsen Inflation: Fearing high prices, some are stocking up for what could be an expensive four years"},{"text":" A majority of Americans did not vote for whats to come.

America has been fair enough to still call democracy  there are lots of disenfranchised people, gerrymandering, and polling place strategy. But still pretty fair (overlooking the fact that modern presidential elections are always decided by tens of thousands of voters in the same 7-8 states, no matter what the popular vote holds). Not so sure about the future, but we will see. The GOP does consistently attack voting. But to be clear again, I strongly support voting. Its the easiest, most peaceful step to protecting your rights. Voting doesnt work well when corporations fund the politicians, so mainstream views that go against donor interests need massive, almost impossible levels of support to overcome the status quo. It also doesnt work well when the population cannot connect their beliefs or needs to the correct policies. Misinformation on traditional and social media, AI its bad out there, as we both surely know. The election of Trump, twice, is prima facie proof of this. And what boundaries can an elected politician cross before the system that was supposed to keep them in check has clearly failed, and you must resist beyond the normal political process? Thats a big question, especially with a fascist president immune from criminal liability for official acts, with a radical Supreme Court. I agree that people arent engaged enough to protest and fight en masse. I do think many people who dont vote would be energized by something that feels more real  I recall recordings of early 20th century unions singing labor songs, connecting people and thus making them feel the community they needed to vote, demonstrate, and resist even when police murdered them for picketing. These days, we are more isolated. My hope  maybe irrational  is that when things get bad enough, people will snap out of it and begin to blame the right people more often and get organized. As common people did during important periods in US history where we reasserted old rights and sometimes gained new ones. Our technological advancements and overconsumption in the 20th and 21st centuries have led to an unusual situation: even the poorest people in the USA can afford ice cream, and the lower-middle class has video games and television. People arent as likely to risk their lives/livelihoods engaging in disobedient and disruptive political participation until they arent so comfortable day to day. Im not excited for this, but sometimes the public should feel angry and steep in it rather than being perpetually distracted.","title":"Election lawyer warns GOP majority plotting new \\"voter suppression laws\\" to get \\"partisan advantage\\" - After winning trifecta in White House and Congress, GOP plans to make voting harder, Democrats say"},{"text":"Dang they are raising the insurance rates in the state of DeNile!","title":"As Trump mulls his FEMA pick, a political land mine awaits in Florida | The agency is hiking insurance rates and punishing flood-prone construction in the president-elects favorite state."},{"text":"they got so mad now they theyre the DEI hires. welcome to club dumbasses","title":"MAGA backlash as Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy defend visa program for skilled workers: Live updates | The Independent"},{"text":"If anyone can appreciate a good insurrection plan...It is the MAGAts.","title":"Proposed plan to block Donald Trump from taking office sparks MAGA fury"},{"text":"I'm from Canada, and we've seen what happens first hand when the government gives companies free reign to hire \\"skilled workers\\" from overseas.
