Up until I would say the minutes leading up to his announcement, I am convinced Biden had 100% of an intention of serving another four years as President. It didn't just show in his campaign and their desperate moves to rebound post-debate, it showed in his demeanor, his voice, everything he was doing told me, \\"I *want* this. I want to keep being your President.\\"The very notion that this was somehow planned out from the beginning feels like Monday-Morning Quarterbacking to the nth degree. The entire Dem Party was preparing for the worst, for Biden to take his campaign all the way to election day, but instead he swallowed his pride and stepped down. Not only did he do it early enough that the party was able to then take the critical steps of solidifying behind Harris, but it was all still while he was probably still in his heart hurting from admitting that he was no longer up to the task of leading this country. I don't think anyone else in his position could have accepted it as graciously as he did.","title":"Kamala Harris Pulled Off a Miracle"},{"text":"Kentucky guy here, voted as soon as I got out of bed.

Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.This is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?Internationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, \\"impolite\\" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.You also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.If I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.Tl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.","title":"Ron Perlman Says Donald Trump Is Fing Terrified of Kamala Harris and I Dont Think Its Going to Be Close on Election Day: Shes Fing Brilliant!"},{"text":"I hope Donald Trump and his cronies all see punishment for the damage they caused to the democratic process.

Nate Silver himself said that there should be more outliers and variability in the data at this point and he hasnt seen much which is a sign of herding.

Also, not every neighborhood has ample stray cats. At least where I have lived any cat you see out and about is already someone's pet. Not everyone lives in an area where free stray cats are common and friendly. Is it more ethical to take in a stray than buy a kitten if you live in a place with lots of strays? Yes.

If Republicans run a Romney-style candidate in 2028, I'm sure most of the party will fall in line behind him or her, but will the weirdos that Trump attracted still vote (R)? I'm not convinced of that at all, and I think they're the only thing keeping the party competitive in a national election. If the Republican Party wants to win nationally, it's probably stuck with some form of Trumpism, and the normal Republicans will have to fall in linebut I don't see that happening, either. I think the party is in a bad place.","title":"Former Georgia lt. governor: Republicans could start hemorrhaging to Democrats if Trump wins"},{"text":"... did you not live through covid","title":"I ve never seen propaganda this heavy since the Iraq war!"},{"text":"Alternate demographic: \\"People who leave Bible verses as tips\\"\\"Guys who think the barista is flirting with them\\"","title":"Breaking News: As American Elections Open, Trump Surges Ahead With Key Demographic:"},{"text":"Welcome to America.

In the most recent debates the issue is entirely about protecting human rights, not about picking sides in a religious confrontation. Finally, the last aspect that shapes this narrative, is that progressives in the US are often dismissive of criticism of Muslim nations. This entirely depends on context, but most often where this occurs is when the Muslim nations are brought up as a form of whataboutism or as a deflection from discussion of the religious right in the US. You clean up your own house before you worry about your neighbor. In the appropriate context, when not used as a deflection, most progressives are critical of sharia law and the hyper conservative misogynistic nature of Islamic culture.

Changed party to democrat and voted for Kamala to end the crazy !!"},{"text":"At a fundamental level, this opinion confuses the perspective on the Left.The Left tends to have a strong anti-Imperialist bent, which they read as a Western act (ignoring Non-Western forms of Imperialism) and that bent often manifests in an ideological defense of Non-Western states, especially those operating either without Western assistance or in direct defiance of Western demands. This is a support of those countries and their choices, which indirectly supports the elements in power in those Non-Western states. In some cases, like Iran, this results in an indirect (and perhaps unintentional) support for traditionalist reactionaries and in other cases, like PR China, this results in an indirect support for entrenched social revolutionaries who actually have Leftist ideals. However, the Leftist is not supporting the particular result of any power structure in a Non-Western state; they are supporting localized self-empowerment. It could be traditional, non-traditional, or explicitly anti-traditional.The problems I would argue with the Left is that they fail to recognize that their support of the elements of power in Non-Western states, especially those operating either without Western assistance or in direct defiance of Western demands, are (1) that this often leads to a support of autocracies that violate the very rights that the Left argues are critical in their homelands (freedoms of expression, rights to vote, gender/ethnic/religious equality, etc.) and (2) it fundamentally ignores that many Non-Western countries, by their own agency, have decided to align with the West because of the governance and economy that the West can offer and assert that these relationships are imposed by the West rather than freely chosen.All of this said, I agree with OP's claim that any form of traditionalism can be criticized. The Left will condemn any traditionalism that is similarly condemned by the government of the relevant Non-Western state. For example, PR China's government openly rejects the sexism of the Qing and Guomindang periods (a violation of traditionalism) and the Left agrees with PR China that such sexism in China would be immoral; however, the agreement is conditioned on PR China making this assertion. The Left will only avoid criticizing traditionalism if the Non-Western state has a traditional entity in power as a method of indirect support for that entity.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Very few republicans today are old enough to remember what the party was like before Nixon, this is how its been their entire lives.","title":"Former Georgia lt. governor: Republicans could start hemorrhaging to Democrats if Trump wins"},{"text":"Could you explain further?

Biden is famous for his political mastery and bargaining- a lot of Obamas best successes in his tenure are owed in part to the amount of support and leverage afforded by Bidens strategies - and even with the pressure for him to resign, he outwitted Pelosis own machinations to have an open election (not that shes complaining).

In both cases i allocated my money toward not helping a stray cat?maybe you say, well if you don't want at cat then it is fine to spend your money on other things.

I agree that AIPAC and the Israeli lobby is a massive problem in American politics. It's absolutely corrupted both parties, to the point where the US Govt is supporting and facilitating a genocide. So my question is, why would anyone support a political party that is beholden to a foreign power in this way, to the point where they become complicit in a genocide? If you vote for either Trump or Harris, you are actually helping entrench a deeply corrupt system. You're now part of the problem because by giving them your vote, it's your way of saying, \\"no matter what you do, you'll still get my vote because i think the other guys are worse\\". It entrenches a system where people in government aren't accountable for their actions. And that decision actually emboldens BOTH parties to become more extreme and more polarising. If both parties know they get votes based on deep polarisation, no matter what they do, they become incentivised to divide people. And AIPAC has cleverly understood that. They fund both sides and they also influence the media landscape, which also profits from extreme polarization. In this situation, it then becomes in the Democrats benefit (and AIPAC'S) that you have an extreme character like Trump. Because Trump makes it much easier for the Democratic Party to support and fund a genocide AND still get good people to vote for them. That's the system AIPAC has helped create. The more polarised people are, AIPAC wins. The Muslim travel ban and the immigration issue in general helps both parties as they can sell these extreme issues to their base.  But it's not just AIPAC, this pretty much applies also to the biggest corporate donors. So by participating in this increasing polarised system, it actually perpetuates a continuing corruption of democracy. It's a race to the bottom.","title":"This is going to be a no win election"},{"text":"I don't think Rs will have a normal candidate in 2028 if Trump loses.

Their model didnt reflect the fact that if Trump outperformed the polls in PA, he would also probably be outperforming in MI, WI, etc.For what its worth, FiveThirtyEight avoided this second problem by correctly assuming a fairly high covariance in errors across states. Thats why 538 gave Clinton only a 71% probability of winning.

Mostly they laugh at him, but they also know how stupid, demented, and fascist he is, and the untold damage he could inflict in the US and on the rest of the world. This is not only a US issue, it is a *planet-affecting* matter.\\nWhen a Democrat is in office, the US is afforded respect -- especially in the case of Obama, a highly intelligent, compassionate, well-spoken President.

No culture is inherently oppressive.On another CMV today someone even explained how there are progressive scholars within Islam, the most often touted \\"inherently oppressive\\" culture/religion. While they might be a minority within a largely conservative religion/culture(s) - they still exist, and they show how the religion/culture(s) in question could grow;[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gk33fs/comment/lvi8qg1/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\\\_term=1&amp;utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gk33fs/comment/lvi8qg1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)Criticising conservative / oppressive aspects of cultures is not something that is genuinely taboo on the left. Sure there are some people who take it too far and will view any criticism as racism, but oftentimes those are the types who want something to weaponise. Most sensible leftists (including leftist commentators and news outlets) will criticise those aspects when pertinent.One example would be the recent Iranian protests over the hijab laws, which have been widely supported by the left, along with criticism of this oppressive aspect of Iranian / Islamic culture.But in the same breath they will defend that culture's right to exist against conservatives who will often use these aspects of these cultures to paint the entire culture as \\"barbaric\\". Ironically, often it is the right who want to replicate those same forms of oppression.And one key issue here is that of colonialism, which has set most nations apart from those in \\"the west\\" back in terms of both economic and social development. Is it a wonder that these nations are more conservative? The demand for them to change their entire culture is a continuation of that cultural colonialism. Is it not better instead to criticise certain aspects and encourage development of their own progressive movements?","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"I would say Israel is the deep state.

I think you're assuming maybe that I support everything Muslims do. I do not. Banning face coverings for identity purposes are one thing but that is not what I am objecting to, I am objecting to hijab bans which are the scarf coverings.Also, when France bans all religious imagery all it really does is Force atheism.It would be like if there was a law that said that anyone who was pregnant could not hold public office, while it apply to both men and women equally it clearly obviously is meant to Target women. A law that says that it is illegal for people to sleep under a bridge May apply to both rich people and poor people but it clearly is meant to affect only poor people. That is the point of critical legal analysis, where you understand that just because a law may look like it is applying to everyone equally it can still affect only certain groups more than others and therefore it can still be targeted.A person wearing a hijab is a personal decision. I reject such a ban. All it does is prevent Muslims and typically Muslim women from being able to participate. Because if a Muslim woman had to choose between participating and not wearing the hijab they would choose not participating.It is not up to other people to the determine what the hijab means or whether or not it brings dignity to the person wearing it. It is completely arrogant to do so. I do not support everything that Muslims do neither do I support everything that Western cultures do. This is the problem that people have. They feel like it's an all or nothing thing, you either support a culture completely or you reject it completely and there's never any kind of nuance which is what I reject itself. I reject the idea that we should remove nuance but instead understand that culture is not a all or nothing thing but instead a thing that is alive and complex. It's not made by a single person but by a collection of people and that it is itself a human creation and so therefore should be judged as such.https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/india/schoolgirls-hijab-ban-udupi-karnataka-b2006773.htmlhttps://thermtide.com/14034/popular/my-hijab-is-a-symbol-of-power-not-oppression/","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Republicans just have an obsession with cockblocking any legislation that will help this country, and then blaming it on Democrats.

Prejudice is not the norm. Suspicion, dislike, jealousy, and scapegoating  none of these things is the transcendent facet of the human personality. They are the diseases. They are the cancers of the soul.  But again, on this spring evening of 1964, a little of mans awareness has shown itself. A little of his essential decency, his basic goodness, his preeminent dignity, has been made a matter of record. There will be moments of violence and expressions of hatred and an ugly re-echo of intolerance, but these are the clinging vestiges of a decayed past, not the harbingers of the better, cleaner future.

Cultural expressions differ based on gender, ethnicity, education, etc. Even in Saudi Arabia, for example, there are progressive political movements. Even in the South not everyone is an Evangelical Christian who believes in patriarchy. It's a diverse area with many different cultural and political expressions.And politics is very fluid. For example, I think today we will see many women in the South come out and vote against the Republican party based on the issue of abortion. They might have voted differently 8 years ago. Maybe this policy has shifted their outlook not just on the Republican party and Trump but also on other issues. So people move around a lot politically and a lot depends on how issues affect them and what they are willing to compromise on at any given moment (things like economic class and gender can overcome cultural indoctrination).It's also important to remember that the US throughout the post-war years has backed right wing movements and repressive governments in order to crush progressive social and political movements in the Middle East and Asia. The US funded the spread of radical Islam and armed right wing Islamic militias and governments from Afghanistan, Pakistan (General Zia), and Indonesia (General Suharto, who came into power by massacring a million people and crushing a millions strong Communist and feminist movement), to Iraq and Egypt, etc. The non-Western immigrants in the US come from these places and are influenced by these things. When a progressive movement is completely repressed, the conservative side becomes dominant. But we can see how culture and religion can shift based on people's environment. This is where Marx's theory of historical materialism is useful. A lot of Muslims in the US tend to be more progressive than many white Christians. I think it's a right-wing talking point that progressives just simply overlook bigotry by racial minorities. I don't think it's based in any reality. Progressives are simply standing up against oppression regardless of what someone's personal beliefs are. We want everyone to be able to live their lives. No one deserves oppression or suffering, even if they don't believe in gay marriage or whatever. What I see a lot from the right-wing with regards to Gaza is a justification for violence and genocide against Palestinians because apparently they are all homophobes (ignoring the illiberal aspects of Israeli society). We have to be wary of this kind of broad strokes being used to a describe an ethnicity or religion that ignores the nuances and internal political and social conflicts, especially when it is used to justify violence and oppression against people.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"(secular humanism with constitutional democracies)Is that the solution to oppression?

If this was literally a 50/50 race, there should be polls with Harris +7 and Trump +7 in the same state. There should be some variation across the swing states; is it really the case that GA, PA, NC, and WI are all within 1 point? That's extremely unlikely.https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state For a poll of 400 people, the smallest sample size in our October swing state database, the chances that it will hit this close to the mark are only about 40 percent. For the largest sample, 5686 voters, its almost 95 percent instead. But most state polls are toward the lower end of this range, surveying between 600 and 1200 voters. All told, wed expect 55 percent of the polls to show a result within 2.5 points in a tied race. Instead, almost 80 percent of them did. How unlikely is that? Based on a binomial distribution  which assumes that all polls are independent of one another, which theoretically they should be  its realllllllllllllly unlikely. **Specifically, the odds are 1 in 9.5 trillion against at least this many polls showing such a close margin.**","title":"The final Nate Silver forecast.

It is completely arrogant of us to assume that we have the answer for them.Liberation can never come from outside, it can only come from within.

[In 1953, the United States and the United Kingdom orchestrated a coup to remove Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, primarily to protect Western oil interests after he nationalized Iran's oil industry, which had been under British control. The CIA, in collaboration with British intelligence, initiated Operation Ajax, employing propaganda, bribery, and orchestrated protests to destabilize Mosaddegh's government. This operation culminated in Mosaddegh's overthrow on August 19, 1953, leading to the reinstatement of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's autocratic rule.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)We removed a democratically elected leader from Iran because they wanted to nationalize their oil.

You will see praise from some Western cultures and not praise from others. It is not an All or nothing thing. You'll see left-wingers or leftists or whoever praising a certain cultures which of course and not praising others as well as praising certain aspects and not praising others. When people who are part of the progressive or left-wing movement talk about non-western cultures, it is important to treat them as you would any other culture. A lot of times people just simply stigmatize non-western cultures simply because they are non-western which is what left wingers and progressives are trying to fight against. The idea that a culture is simply bad because it is non-western. Meanwhile the very people who are criticizing those non-western cultures do not make those same criticisms towards Western cultures which is where the problem comes about. For example, in France, the government enforces strict secularism in public schools, prohibiting the display of conspicuous religious symbols, including Islamic headscarves, to maintain religious neutrality. In 2016, police officers in Nice were photographed compelling a woman to remove her burkini on the beach, enforcing local bans on full-body swimwear. These actions are based on the principle of la?cit, as outlined in the 2004 law banning conspicuous religious symbols in schools. In places like Denmark, the government enacted a law in 2018 prohibiting the wearing of face-covering garments, including burqas and niqabs, in public spaces. Similarly, in Belgium, a nationwide ban on full-face veils in public was implemented in 2011, reflecting a broader European trend towards restricting religious attire in public areas.If it is wrong to force women to wear the burqa or hijab then it is equally wrong to force them to not wear it. Otherwise it is just bigotry. It is wrong to force women to wear or not wear a particular piece of clothing. That is what people who are progressive are talking about.If you found out on the news that a particular computer exploded in someone's house and you found out that it was a Chinese computer many people would probably just assume that it exploded cuz it's Chinese and therefore would stop buying Chinese computers however a person who is actually interested in computers would buy the computer as well as buying more computers from the company to figure out what exactly went wrong. Was it because the computers were Chinese and how did that contribute to the explosion? Were there certain parts that were used and are those parts in other computers from other countries? Was it because of something that the person who owned the computer did, did they stick something in there that they shouldn't or was it truly because of the manufacturing? A person who actually cares about computers would want to know the actual cause and the same goes for cultures. People who are actually interested in other cultures would want to know exactly what makes a culture a culture and if their truly is something bad about it then trying to explain it simply through biology just isn't good enough. That's not scientific. Biology doesn't make you a bigot. Simply explaining something as bad because it's non-western is just as much of a problem as saying that something is good just because it's non-western.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Good to hear.","title":"51 -  registered republican for 30 years.

We recognize that many \\"traditional cultures\\" are just as reactionary and oppressive as western reactionaries are. It's just that we also recognize that criticism of non-western cultures that comes from a place of cultural superiority and imperialism isn't going to help. The only people who can reform a culture are the people actually from that culture who understand it and can make meaningful change. There's a famous piece that anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod published shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan that summed up this position extremely well. She observes the focus in western media on the oppressed Afghani women as a justification for the invasion, but argues that westerners unfamiliar with Afghanistan didn't really understand what Afghani women wanted or needed. Moreover, nearly everything that westerners could do to intervene in Afghanistan would just end up making things worse, by making the lives of the few Afghani reformers  much harder, while causing significant backlash that just enabled and emboldened the conservatives. I think we can all agree that history has completely vindicated her: everything that the west did to \\"save\\" the women of Afghanistan has massively backfired and in the end just made it all worse. This isn't to say that it isn't always the place of westerners to criticize things that are bad, no matter where we see them. But it is to say that a lot of that criticism is counter-productive.

I think people forgot where they are. ?","title":"Hard to believe this is the same woman who has every democrat in line to elect her."},{"text":"Here's his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UIzsPIrZdc)Here's the original speech written by the Twilight Zone writer Rod Sterling he performed up on stage with MLKJr. Like he said, \\"1964a lots happened, not so much as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of, but its a start.\\" Ladies and gentlemen, this may be the most non-political speech you ever hear. And, indeed, if you look for controversy, what Im about to say conjures up little conflict.\\n \\n We have reached a moment in time when restless men, dispossessed men, angry and impatient men, and anguished men look up and reach out for an elusive justice oft promised them, long denied them, but in the eyes of God and mans conscience is their due and should be their expectation. I say this is non-political and non-controversial. Were not talking now about miscegenation. Or whether a man can fence his yard. Or a hotdog vendor carefully select his customer. Or an innkeeper choose not to accommodate a particular traveler. These are the ramifications of the problem. They are not the problem. There have to be some bridges built; but first we have to acknowledge the rivers.\\n \\n \\n This is what I think is basic. This is what I believe to be the most common denominator in this spring of 1964. This must be first, the recognition and then the admission  that the dignity of human beings is not negotiable. The eminent worth of man has no pro and no con. And the desperate need for an understanding and a respect between all men is as fundamental as the process of breathing in and breathing out.\\n \\n On this spring night we look toward Washington, D.C., and hear the the echoed overtones of a debate. We watch the struggle to invoke a cloture. We hear the voices of the willful foot-draggers and the hopeful sprinters as they trade and compromise and give battle for what they believe. But again, there is something happening on this earth transcendent of the Senates, the governments, the temporal voices of the champions of rights and the filibusters of wrong.\\n \\n What is happening is that a whole world has suddenly become cognizant of its oneness. An idea of brotherhood has ceased to be an abstract. It has taken on a form and dimension and breadth and meaning. Every mans death diminishes me  a lyrical stab at truth from another century. But in this nineteen hundred and sixth fourth year of our Lord, every mans indignity, every mans hunger, every mans search for freedom, every mans life reinforces me and revitalizes me and rededicates me. We cannot be half-free and half-slave, Mr. Lincoln said. And now, a hundred years later, we find that we cannot be half hungry and half content; half with dignity, half with shame; half with freedom, half with a simple yearning to be free; half with prerogatives, half asking for just a few; half superior, half denied the right to prove even equality.\\n \\n \\n You cannot legislate human love. Have you heard that phrase? You cannot pass a law to stop people from hating  a battle slogan of those who dont want to be bothered. A statement of philosophy from 20th century non-philosophers who would probably melt down the test tubes used to look for the microbes and the bacteria and the virus that caused cancer. Cancer is with us, so why fight it? Leave it to the individual patients. But dont make waves. Dont stir the river bed. And above all, dont contemplate the beauty of this earth. The deeds of love. The small, gradual, but inexorable move upward of the human animal toward an enlightened moment in time when the person next door is the neighbor, the Negro is the darker neighbor, the South American is my Latin neighbor, the Japanese is my Oriental neighbor.\\n \\n You cant legislate against prejudice? You would rather perhaps accept it as part of the innate personality of the homo sapien? You would rather say that its with us, its here to stay, its part of the social phenomenon of our time. If this is the premise to be lived with, accepted, and  God help us  embraced, then let us throw away theology. Let us unencumber ourselves of the premise of God. Let us tear up our art, our literature, all of our culture, and let us retire to a rubble of our own making and manufacture barbed wire instead of stained glass.\\n \\n Hatred is not the norm. Prejudice is not the norm. Suspicion, dislike, jealousy, and scapegoating  none of these things is the transcendent facet of the human personality. They are the diseases. They are the cancers of the soul. They are the infectious and contagious viruses that have bled humanity over the years. But because they have been and are, is it necessary that they shall be?\\n \\n \\n I think not. If there is one voice left to say welcome to a stranger; if there is but one hand outstretched to say enter and share; if there is but one mind remaining to think a thought of warmth and friendship, then there is also a future in which we will find more than one hand, more than one voice, and more than one mind dedicated to the cause of mans equality.\\n \\n Wishful, hopeful, unassured, problematic, and not to be guaranteed. This is all true. But again, on this spring evening of 1964, a little of mans awareness has shown itself. A little of his essential decency, his basic goodness, his preeminent dignity, has been made a matter of record. There will be moments of violence and expressions of hatred and an ugly re-echo of intolerance, but these are the clinging vestiges of a decayed past, not the harbingers of the better, cleaner future. To those who tell us that the inequality of the human animal is the necessary evil, we must respond by simply saying that first, it is evil but second, it is not necessary. We prove it, sitting here tonight. We prove it by reaffirming our faith. We prove it by having faith in our reaffirmations.\\n \\n Horace Mann said, Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity. Lets paraphrase that tonight. Let us be ashamed to live without that victory.","title":"Kamala Harris Notches Another Big Hollywood Endorsement: Dick Van Dyke"},{"text":"His grandad was banished to Bavaria for refusing military service.

You're post concisely suggested that neither campaign would be any different or bring anything new to the table than they were when they were incumbent. That historically hasn't been true for second term presidents, and these campaigns literally involve new people in powerful positions. Hell, the cabinet positions will all be new too, and they hold a lot of power in their own right. It's a blatantly obvious observation that can easily be made without the influence of propaganda - and is a topic apart from \\"does our vote matter\\" or \\"are both campaigns just working for the same people\\" - which wasn't even addressed in your post. *If* you wanted to suggest something different, where propaganda has bearing on the matter (those issues do exist) then you should have stated it in your post. It's a bit late to bring the idea of \\"propaganda\\" into it when that has no bearing on the points I'm making. And while I'm at it, the sense of moral superiority you experience from posturing yourself as enlightened relative to another person, as somehow or immune to propaganda or whatever you're trying to put yourself out there as, is false and contrived. You actually haven't figured anything out we don't all already know.

You can google scholarly articles where the impact cats have in their environment are studied. &lt;Abstract. American birds face an estimated 117 to 157 million exotic predators in the form of free-rang-ing domestic cats (Felis catus), which are estimated to kill at least one billion birds every year in the United States. Cats have contributed to declines and extinctions of birds worldwide and are one of the most important drivers of global bird extinctions. In this paper, we review recent scientifi c research on the impacts of free-ranging cats on birds, with an emphasis on threats to migratory landbirds in the United States. Studies have shown that cats pose threats to many bird populations, including priority species for conservationThe fault does not lie with the stray cats. And the fault does not lie with pet adopters. The fault lies with people letting their cats breed indiscriminately. Be the backyard breeders, retail rescue or just negligent owners. Sadly bird populations are the ones paying the price.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"You're the one that claimed Dems are authoritarian with no proof.

The fact that the polling is close is telling you important information (i.e. a blowout is roughly equally likely in either direction, the magnitude of a possible blowout is relatively constrained, etc.), you're just not impressed because you're not imagining worlds where the election doesn't look very close.Polling will obviously remain useful in many cases, but if elections remain within MoE, then herding will make models pointless for presidential elections.The counter to this, of course, is 2016. One of the things that a good model (e.g. 538) was able to show was that correlated polling errors could deliver a surprising result that mainstream punditry was missing. And again, obviously, to know the election is within the margin of error requires polling, and given the convoluted election system and the abundance of pollsters out there, some degree of modeling/statistics.

Now we're talking about *production*. I understand that you're arguing that buying a purebreed supports the industry, but I think I can draw a distinction between the ethics of the buyer and the ethics of the seller. If someone gets a purebreed, then they've adopted a companion (which was likely already born or about to be born) who needed to find a home to live a hopefully long life. I think I can say that *that*, on its own, is not necessarily unethical behaviour, while still leaving room to separately criticize the ethics of the cat breeding industry. There's a link between seller and buyer but I don't think it's strong enough to condemn the ethics of anybody who buys a purebreed. That feels like a capitalist argument where we conveniently shift all ethical duties to the consumer. Some strays which I couldn't find homes died. And my neighbour bought a purebreed cat despite our neighbourhood is full of socialized cats needing homes. Am I wrong to feel extremely upset about this situation? You're right to be upset. Stray cats dying is very upsetting. But I think you put too much on your neighbour. Adopting a purebreed doesn't mean he was personally committing a stray to die. I see the link that you're making but again I would argue that if we follow the same logic, adopting a purebreed is at least caring for the well being of an animal, whereas many, many people do not adopt any cats at all. And those might be valid choices that we have to respect, even if we would prefer they change their minds. I'm not saying purebreed cats should diminish. They can be produced in lower amounts. Fair enough. But I think that's a change in your view. It's not okay to spread misinformation and look down on stray cats.Totally agree! And this helps clarify your point about placing too much pride in the breed. But I don't think that what you're describing means that the mere fact of buying a purebreed is necessarily unethical. It's possible for someone to adopt both a purebreed and a stray, for example.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"Being known as a conman since the 80s should have been enough.","title":"'Disqualifying': Critics Torch Trump After Ugly Last-Minute Attack On Nancy Pelosi"},{"text":"Another \\"Turn Coat\\" that bites the hand of the working class &amp; deserves to be boycotted knowing convicted Felon Trump doesn't deserve to be in OUR Oval Office!.?","title":"Joe Rogan endorses Donald Trump after calling him dangerous and an existential threat to democracy itself"},{"text":"If everyone actually bought a well bred healthy cat and actually kept up with it as a pet we wouldnt have thousands of ferrel cats messing up ecosystems.

But after a few years with my dog (rescue cats had already died of old age before I got him), I realized that the only way for us to get a cat like my husband wanted desperately was to get a kitten so they could grow up with and sort of be raised by the doghe was already almost middle aged and was way to excited by cats.\\nHe would chase and bark at them because he was interested and intrigued by them. No cat would ever allow him to get close enough to discover that he didnt want to eat them (Pom mix) he really just wanted to play but couldnt communicate properly with cats.\\nSo when we were ready we got a ragamuffin kitten and integrated them carefully; it really only took about a week. Its been almost 5 years now and they are best friends. She loves brother so much, and he, her. They play and cuddle and everything. Also - now because of this bond he has built with her her no longer barks at or chases cats, hes just totally chill around ANY cat.In our case I feel like we did the right thing. However we still participate in the local trap and release programs in our community to keep the stray problem under control which admittedly is super helpful to the neighborhood and local feral cat population in the community.We didnt shop just to get a cute cat and I find it hard to believe that all ppl that shop only do so for aesthetic reasons. I think if you can get what you need for your situation and still participate in the animal rescue community then I see no wrong in that. We all just need to do our best to do right by the animals and by our own situations so that these animals can truly be cared for long term. (If it matters we recently moved in with our elderly parents and now share a house now with 6 additional catsall rescues, or street cats and everyone gets along fine - though it took a lot of time and work lol)EDIT: my writing and grammar is horrendous in the post.

That being said, I dont think not selecting a stray cat and going to a breeder instead is unethical. Stray cats often have a lot of health issues. Fleas being a common one, but cat leukemia being a real possibility, malnutrition, and many other possible health concerns. These could require lifelong treatment, which would not only be expensive (because yes, buying from a breeder could be expensive too), but taking cats to and from a vet to get the care they need, giving them medication or whatever else is necessary takes a significant amount of time. Not everyone who wants a cat has that time. And yes, taking a cat to a vet occasionally is of course necessary, but a super sick cat would require far more visits and more attention with medication and the like. I think it would be *more* ethical for a person who doesnt have that much time or knowledge of cats to research breeds of cats, trust a breeder who is familiar with the process and can ensure they have a healthy cat, over taking in a stray cat. Because if they dont have the time to take care of a possibly sick cat, it would be more harmful for the stray.Again, I can see a case being made for it being more ethical to adopt from a shelter, but I dont think its a blanket statement especially if youre talking about strays.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"More spam!","title":"Reminder: This election doesn't matter.

Feeding them generally increases predator pressure on both them and on local wildlife that cats hunt, increases likelihood of fighting/spread of disease between them, etc.As someone who has worked in shelter medicine and been on the \\"N\\" side of TNR, I personally believe there are many unethical shelters and rescues and more than people like to admit or recognize. I do not agree with shelters/rescues who, for example, require I allow my cat to free roam outside (both irresponsible as an owner and ecologically harmful), or regularly lie about or downplay medical/behavioral issues (resulting in more pets being returned to the shelters they were adopted from), or have over-the-top requirements for adopters that inherently exclude most interested adopters (thus self-reinforcing their own overcrowding issues), or want permission to breed shelter animals to keep up with demand when they do not actually have a large stray issue (shelters attempted to get permission to do this in the state I was living in during covid!), and so on. If I am surrounded only by shelters I *know* personally to be unethical, is it still *more* ethical to adopt from them (thus supporting their unethical practices) than it is to buy from a small ethical breeder? (I have only ever adopted or accepted rehomed cats, to be clear - but I have lived in places where I was not happy with any of the local shelters because I knew their conditions very well.)Some people want to support ethical breeders, who are breeding for breed preservation and for betterment of the health/temperament of the animals they breed. Some people have serious cat allergies and benefit from cats more likely to be hypoallergenic (while there are no default hypoallergenic breeds, there are several breeds that *can* be). I know someone personally who lived in an area without stray overpopulation issues (rural northeast USA) where there are very few shelters at all and had severe cat allergies. Was it unethical for him to buy a cat from an ethical breeder who breeds with allergies as a goal of her cattery since this was the only way he could safely have a cat? He would NOT have adopted, period, because there are virtually never hypoallergenic cats in shelters, let alone in an area like his where the closest shelter is small and over an hour away. There was not an alternative scenario where he \\"saved the life\\" of a shelter cat or stray cat. It would not have happened. It was either zero cats, or a purpose-bred one.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"[Archive.md](http://Archive.md) does a good job of getting around paywalls","title":"Kamala Harris Philadelphia rally draws big crowds and celebs"},{"text":"Shes not a Republican.

Both dogs are rescues from Romanian kill shelters. 2 cats were local rescues and 1 cat is a purebreed from a licensed and reputable breeder. How do we rate in your ethical spectrum?The ethical problem, as I see it isn't about licenced breeders producing animals that people want, keep and look after responsibly. The absolute vast majority of cats in shelters are not purebreeds. They are the result of owners of normal cats that don't bother to neuter or spay them and don't prevent them going out and meeting other fertile cats. Then they come home and produce a litter of kittens that can't all be kept and looked after by the owner and get dumped into adoption centers if not worse fates.Ethically speaking, it's not the responsibility for anyone who wants to own a cat to respond to the selfishness of irresponsible owners. In our circumstances we're fortunate that we could choose to do both. The ethical blame in my view is on irresponsible owners, whether they choose a purebreed or not.

At the end of the day it's still a living creature and a domesticated pet and if you care for it and give it a good life then I think it's hard to cast the entire endeavour as unethical. Sorta how I feel about how some people have more ethical diets than others. Perfect behaviour doesn't need to be the enemy of good behaviour. I'd rather someone gave a purebreed a good life than got no cat at all. I also think that purebreed cats are just genetically and visually interesting. 99% of cats are mixed domestics, so seeing a cat with papers is always kind of a curiosity. The breeds are so young, they're not yet really breeds in the same sense as dogs. I wouldn't want them to vanish entirely, even if I'm always going to opt to pick up a stray from the shelter rather than shell out for a cat with papers. Lastly: It's a way of showing off. Which is extremely unethical. They are sentient beings not objects to show off. I think pets can be both? Taking pride in your pet doesn't *necessarily* amount to unethical behaviour - it can become unethical in some cases, but I don't think it has to be unethical for you to, say, have some nice Instagram pics of a beautiful cat. Also, it's a cat. Cats love to be admired.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"As a fellow GWOT veteran, I concur.

Some people are starting to come around to the idea that the party needs fundamental changes to maintain relevancy but sadly others think everything is fine.  Admittedly it took me nearly a decade to realize the rot at the top of the party, particularly in state leadership but once I realized it, it was terribly difficult to ignore and ultimately lead to my complete withdrawal from leadership, volunteering, donating and campaign management as I really was just trying to piss upwind and getting nowhere.    Now granted a lot of the Democratic Party issues are leadership, but they do have policy positions that don't make sense as well (Israel for example).  Republican's on the other hand are crazy good at organizing and their leadership (of their party) is well organized, it's just their policy positions are absolutely horrendous and they have this unending game of who can be the largest asshole they can't seem to get over.  This is why I say both are broken, just in different ways.

Yeah.A study on male suicide revealed that 70% of men that took their lives contacted support in the month before they did it, and 80% were marked as low or no risk of suicide.Contacting a suicide helpline is not the same as having access to actual mental healthcare, especially early on.Biden and Harris have worked to expand such mental healthcare access, notably by increasing mental health services.

Republicans did.https://truthout.org/articles/205-republicans-vote-against-bill-to-expand-school-mental-health-services/Reminder: actions speak louder than words.And I'm not entirely sure what Vance has to do with anythingTrump and Vance are **actually attacking women**.

You need more men in public education to be positive role models for boys. The best way you'll do that is by paying teachers more.

There are organizations that help women obtain an abortion within their own state and out of state. I have volunteered for one in the past. They help with travel, a place to stay when they travel. They provide interpreters if needed and local transportation to and from clinics and airports. At no cost to the women.The Democrats screwed the American people over with regard to abortion. They had 5 decades to codify Roe into permanent federal law. But they never did. They used the issue to convince people to always vote for a Democrat president. They used the issue to maintain political power. I can prove it. Democrats legalized same sex marriage by passing a bill that Biden signed in 2022 (many Republicans also supported the bill). Seven years after the Oberfelt case. They were afraid the Supreme Court would overturn that case. So, again. Why didn't they do the same for abortion? We are in this situation because of Democrats.

If they do it, it's \\"capitalism\\" because they created the marketplace.  But if a country charges taxes to maintain the society that made it possible, it's theft.

Is it that they are simply unable to determine what policies benefit them?  That's an education issue and the Dems could fix that over time if the GOP are on board (they probably aren't).  Is it that they are prioritizing other political issues higher?  That's tough because it's so subjective, but perhaps the disappearance of Trump would help reset the discourse and let us focus on real issues again.

The issue isn't just access to it - look at the UK. A study on male suicide revealed that 70% of men that took their lives contacted support in the month before they did it, and 80% were marked as low or no risk of suicide.  The issue is understanding men's issues and addressing them.

I felt that it was not a given that all of Bidens voters would just hop over to Harris, no questions asked.  Both loyalists and people who swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.Furthermore, I didnt think the please anybody but Biden or Trump I promise Ill vote for them voter was actually real.  I felt like that was just an easy copout people were saying, and that wasnt a real demographic, so it was unclear how Harris could improve on Bidens coalition.There was a 3rd point I cant remember, but whatever.Anyway, the polling thus far has refuted both of my theories, well see if the election does too.But I will admit Harriss chances seem higher than Bidens, for now.That being said, I was still relatively pessimistic.  Being a toss-up just doesnt seem like a great situation to be in, and frankly, if the polls are on a complete knifes edge, they have to fall one way or the other, right?And well, I guess inherently I had a gut feeling which error was more likely.That being said, this has somewhat changed in the past week.  Im not sure what caused it, maybe her healing in the poll aggregators, maybe some fundamentals news, or maybe just contagion.For one thing, Ive stopped trusting the polls, like, at all.  Theyre clearly just bullshit herding around tossup margins.  Maybe its actually a tossup, but I dont know that and they likely dont either.  For all I know the real number could be +3 in either direction, and at that point, what is there to even analyze from the polls?  How am I supposed to figure out which side will likely outperform their polls if I dont know the polls?So with the polls not really helpful, what does that leave us?  Fundamentals and vibes, which are kind of the same thing at the end of the day, but whatever.Maybe Ill have the energy to type up the fundamentals for either side tomorrow morning, maybe I wont.  But theres plenty on both sides, so theres not much solace there.  I dunno, I guess maybe its the closing vibes?  Theyre pretty gnarly.  Like if the polls werent telling me its still a tossupSo I dunno.  I still buy that the race is too close to call, but, in the final week, maybe Ive started to experience the phenomenon known as hope.  Either a terrible or a great time for it, I suppose.Regarding states, despite the sorry state of the polls, Im confident in making some predictions - unless polling is completely dead, only the 7 swing states are in play.  Of those, I suspect Harris might have trouble with Arizona and Georgia (though people have recently been blooming Georgia, so who knows).  I thought PA was looking good but nowadays the polls and EV are saying itll be tight?  I dont know.  Michigan, polls and vibes wise looks nice, which is surprising given the Dearborn stuff.  Interested to see how that turns out, but if Michigan is having issues today Harris probably isnt winning.Wisconsin is going to be a PITA, so Im hoping we dont need it (easier said than done).NC is NC.  It always polls close and always blue balls us, but maybe today it wont.  I figure the hurricane helps Trump more than us, though.  And while thats callous, lets face it, it has political effects, theres a reason Trumps campaigning off of it.Nevada - I mean the election is kind of already over, Ralston says itll be +0.3 harris, but given his error bars that can be anywhere from +2 to -2 in reality.  Whats to talk about there?  See you in a few days or weeks!What I think about Iowa after Selzer - I honestly wish the poll had come back with like a Trump +2, where thats still a nuclearly bad poll for Trump but it doesnt seem so insane as to be trolling.Like, right now Im legitimately wondering if Selzer is trolling or if shes just publishing an outlier.  If it was like Trump +1 or +0, Id have 100% faith that Selzer captured a real Trump weakness.But if shes right (again), thats good news for the blue wall.EDIT: one last thing, if there is a polling error in Trumps favour (and there can be), I suspect it'll be smaller than 2020.  2020 was Covid which did fuck things up, a whole lot of red wave pollsters are now producing \\"patriotic\\" polls, and even good pollsters are openly saying \\"yeah we really don't want to underestimate Trump again\\".  All of those are factors that ostensibly reduce the error, otherwise I mean, yeah we just can't poll Trump at all then.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Bodies - Drowning Poolhttps://youtu.be/04F4xlWSFh0","title":"Which song best epitomizes the pandemic era?"},{"text":" Anyone else hate that Democrats always get the blame for not fixing problems that Republicans either created in the first place or refuse to come to the table on to address?No, the opposite, tired of democrats fixing the economy at the cost of social programs to then see republican wreck it again...third time last 40 years...meanwhile minimum wage is still at $7.25, $15,000 a year working full time, before payroll taxes...","title":"Im a Republican for Harris, but Democrats have big problems that victory wont fix"},{"text":"Just don't do it.
