Or they did and they decided that a war to weaken Russia was more important than the lives and livelihoods of everyday Ukrainians. Don't mistake me for some Putin fan. My point here is that despite a reluctance to actually get our hands dirty in the conflict, the US played a significant roll in instigating it. All war is horrific and should be prevented at all costs. We took a risk with Ukrainian lives and our gamble did not pay off. The reason Ukraine wasn't in NATO earlier was because they were not eligible for membership and by many criteria still aren't. Even talking about adding them was specifically to piss off Russia which is a bad idea for obvious reasons.As to their other point, actually yes. Japan was our main source of cheap manufactured goods for decades before China started to really hit its stride industrially. It was a calculated investment in the same way that China was later on. As times change who has cheap labor changes and we tend to move production there. Industrialization is always built on cheap labor initially no matter where it is. The US did a lot to suppress workers movements and unionization during our industrial revolution. Big business runs the government in capitalist countries and they want low workers protections, low wages and cheap basic goods so they can maximize profit.  Japan's economy stalling in the 90's is a very interesting bit of history that is best left to others to explain as I am not as knowledgeable about that. Generally speaking I come from an anti-imperialist and anti-war perspective which stems from my understanding of how powerful nations in general have a tendency to instigate armed conflict for the personal benefit of their ruling class.  The US is no exception despite our posturing to the contrary. I would suggest you look into the history of US intervention in south and central American countries as well the history of colonialism in Africa. Learning about the actual history of those conflicts very much changed my worldview as imperialism is still very much alive, just under a different guise. I see the conflict in Ukraine primarily through the lens of great power proxy conflicts which is a long standing tradition in the area. In my view the facts speak for themselves and paint the American Government's intent as at the very least questionable.","title":"CMV: The U.S. will no longer be an independent nation by the end of this decade, and this is a sober view."},{"text":"I was absolutely shocked when Trump had Russian spies in the White House the first time.

Politicians like Trump can lie right now to get voter turnout, but if it means the voting power is diminished directly because Trump lied so much, then I would say this is overall good for the poorly educated groups. As you said, voters may feel that they are broke despite the economy doing well, but it would be great for them to actually know why we are where we are right now, instead of some grifter like Trump taking advantage of their lack of knowledge and anger to blame immigrants and offer quick solutions like tariffs that actually get voters to vote against their own interests. What you seem to be arguing right now is that because they are not as educated, them voting on misinformation is fine, when a knowledge test could make the whole process more honest overall. Times change. I wouldnt expect that something like this would ever get passed, because republicans would vote against it in droves. I never argued if it would ever get implemented, I argued that it *should* be implemented. The definition of what is and isnt constitutional also changes with time. In the beginning, it was deemed constitutional for only white men who owned property to be able to vote. If people said well it was deemed constitutional in 1776 so why are we talking about it, progress would never be made. Per the 14th amendment, I would argue that we could certainly preserve civil rights while acknowledging how pervasive lying has become in the political process, thus requiring a revisiting of knowledge checks. Again, why should we allow candidates to exploit their voting base, under the guise of it being constitutional, when we could analyze it closer to come up with a solution for candidates lying? Fines do nothing, as weve seen repeatedly with Trump. Its next to impossible to remove a candidate from the ballot, as weve again seen with Trump. Having their lies have actual consequences in the form of hurting their voting power would be devastating to a candidate like Trump. Also I know I keep saying Trump but its just because hes the poster child of this right now. Having it apply to all politicians would be the goal.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"\\\\ changeThat's the most overloaded word of this election.

Many of these building are cathedrals and orphanages coincidentally.8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.It says he gathers them to (the way I read it) siege the camp of the saints.

(not allowed to explore Antarctica freely btw) Antarctic treaty only thing on this planet all major countries can come together in agreence upon, also look into hyperboreansIn order to deceive the masses to attack Jesus and the camp of the saints there would need to be some obvious deception occurring. Satan would essentially be required to obfuscate the true 2nd coming and subsequent millennial reign if he's going to trick people into attacking Jesus and the saints. So the motive is clear why it would be concealed.A lot of people think of Satan as God's quality control manager and not a true adversary.

But, by the time the primary got to PA and it was down to Trump and Haley, I of course went with Trump. And then got more excited to see him win, given how bad both Democrat candidates were, and how he ran such a fun campaign. The tone was mostly different than the bitter tone he adopted after losing in 2020.In retrospect, his election denial COULD have been a plot to help him win the primary in 2024. Candidates who lose a presidential election rarely get a second chance to be the nominee. But him convincing a bunch of voters that he didn't lose, and that their votes were stolen, shored up his support.

Did you ask yourself why people choose cheap goods?Imagine a religious group that believes chickens are sacred and object to intensive chicken farming (this is not even hard to imagine as this is India for cows). To kill a chicken or even exploit it would be considered blasphemous and would result in public shame or punishment. Within such a system, chickens would be unharmed, despite their incredible economical value and even in situations where food was scarce. We are born into systems that we largely cannot control and that system will instil values and beliefs by adoption or coercion. You wilfully accept them or youre forced to.Capitalism is a system just like this example - do not work and you will be publicly shamed, do not pay the interest on your mortgage and you will be made homeless, do not adopt the legal framework of your country and you cannot do business. From the moment we are born we begin to view most human interactions and the trade of goods as financial transactions, through the abstract ideas of economic value and price. We commodify animals and people in this system because we believe that the trade off for economic prosperity and wealth/consumption is worth it (its the same argument for slavery, where the moral objection to it did not exist at the time).Capitalism by fixating on the price mechanism, obscures the intrinsic, natural, spiritual.. value of objects and reduces it to a simple equation of supply and demand. It then becomes easy to view the life of a chicken as worthless. Populations within capitalist societies, whether they know it or not, hold an outline of these beliefs in their mind.Also, you keep saying that people have the option to choose. Its estimated that around 50% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, where most of their money is spent on necessities, so yes, this position is often forced. Youre forgetting that ethically minded goods are niche luxuries that most people cannot afford - I never said they didnt exist. Its the same for the concern of climate change. Polls regularly show that climate anxiety is a privileged opinion to have and most of the working class do not have the same mental capacity to entertain these ideas. They are much more concerned about their immediate wellbeing and economic security.I think people underestimate how much societies and their belief systems shape how they view the world and often these systems are planned in such a way that you have very little control over them.","title":"CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing"},{"text":"How can that be?

You initially brought up the actors strike as proof of the strength of collective bargaining in the US. This is a group that includes billionaires, and so is not really a good reference point for the collective bargaining powers that exist in general.I give you another specific, factual example that can be used as a much better entry point into unpacking how right to strike in the US has conditions attached that reflects a general theme in the US that legal rights are often established to pass constitutional scrutiny while being undermined from a policy standpoint to being practically unusable. So its entirely possibly the UK, even without a right to strike, has better labor protections that make unions less of a factor in the big picture. For example, UK does not recognize at-will employment last I checked, which makes a 1:1 comparison using right to strike alone difficult.And your response to my example is Of course thats terrible with no further elaboration.You can see why Im not exactly being rewarded for my engagement with you.

The majority buyers dont like me, they can now vote for me to be removed because I am only a 33% owner of the company and my position is only shrinking.My point is that any moderately sizable company will be acquired and disrupted by businessmen instead of led in its original direction. This also removes all incentive for individuals to grow companies. Besides the original creator of course, making it worse now than ever. What incentive does a person with a billion dollars have to make good decisions for any company if not for more money? Original founders will be uprooted and replaced by people who have no incentive to grow the company. A stagnant company that I have $1b in shares in is good enough for me.

Also the problem is that theres no way for a required voter test to be constitutional as it was ruled unconstitutional multiple times by the Supreme Court due to it violating the 14th amendment and the civil rights act. You cant just pass a constitutional amendment or even change a existing one, it requires two third of states to support it before it even gets to the federal level which is a decades long process as 2/3s of states houses and state senates have to approve of repealing the 14th amendment . Also Theres no way either political party would survive running on a platform for getting rid of the 14th amendment that offers guaranteed civil liberties and rights to over 40% of the population of the country. theres no way the supreme courts would allow it and it would be ruled as unconstitutional due to previous rulings on voter tests by the supreme courts. Also how would you make the test unbiased? Ask if the economy is doing better which would vary on a state by state basis, what job industry the voter works in, and if they have stock investments.

Fitzhugh called the Northern industrialists workers wage slaves that the industrialists could work to death and not think twice about itthey will just hire another wage slavebut, to a Southern slave owner, each chattel slave had intrinsic value that they could sell like livestockso each slave was worth keeping alive.Fitzhugh also argued that if you take the arguments of the principled abolitionists of the time, once again, the Northern industrialists fall short.  Fitzhugh quoted one principled abolitionist, Stephen Pearl Andrews, and his arguments against the idea of value being the best incentive of the marketespecially since that value can be manipulated by those in position to do so.   Andrews proposed that the market should be based on costs and not the more manipulative value that the Northern industrialists honor so much (not on what covers their costs but more so on how much they can inflate their value to whatever the market will bear).And, among other examples in the book, Andrews had an example involving medicine.  He proposed that, what if I could develop a pill that cost me 10c to produce (probably paying my workers slave level wages to do so) but I could convince you that pill could save your life.  Ten cent cost to mebut how much value would it have to you?  Probably whatever I wanted to charge you, right?   Is that a fair value?   There are modern equivalents to thisall it takes is convincing you it will save your life.   Thats one example of how the market can be manipulated.   And, even if Im lying, as long as I have already convinced enough people, I would have made a killing (pardon the pun) before thats realized.   Then, I can take my money and run, sucker.   Money has no moral value.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"No she wouldnt.

(Yes, that's how a lot of voters are thinking).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 24, 2024"},{"text":" While I agree, the difference is that so many believe that THEY are being screwed but others aren't.I would disagree with this statement. More people, today, believe that they are being screwed, **but no longer care that others are being screwed**. Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, awareness that a number of groups of people were being treated grew substantially. Blacks, Women, LGBTQ+, Hispanics, etc. Each of these groups made themselves more seen, and pointed out inequities in society and in treatment. Things improved substantially, year after year, battle after battle.What is different now is that the inevitable backlash has begun. The group that had the most power at the end of WWII (CIS White Males) has finally begun believing that they are losing out to other groups, and that it's okay to push back on the erosion of power that has been happening. To be clear - this \\"erosion of power\\" is not oppression, it's not a loss of any right that they had - it's merely the threat of a loss of privilege. In the late 70s and early 80s, evangelical Christian groups began to proclaim that they were under attack, because they were no longer seen as the default religion of the nation. This translated into them giving support to politicians that either agreed with them, or saw them as useful allies to bring out the vote. The success of these politicians gave them political power, *but made them beholden to the same evangelicals* - who continued to grind their axes against anyone that wasn't them. Abortion was a wedge issue, and general disdain for the women meant that their basic rights were under attack - because the bible says that the man should be head of the household or something, I guess. More likely, it was that women were agents of change in the workplace, in society, etc., because they wanted the same freedoms as CIS White men - you know, being able to work, get a credit card, or a mortgage, live on their own, choose how to deal with their personal health, etc. Each of those was cast as TAKING something from cis white men, instead of as giving the same rights to women. The same things happened with minorities of all sorts. Add to this the influence of some keen-eyed and amoral capitalists, who saw this time as an opportunity to get a bunch of things that got in the way of them accumulating wealth. Consolidation in media got the message delivery system under their control. A whole host of pesky regulations were eliminated, starting with Reagan's first term, and led to them making more money than any time in history. That lead to even more consolidation, to the point that the concentration of wealth is greater in the US than at any prior time in history. And with more money, comes more influence. And the message to the voters is effectively \\"You have little. The Dems want to take what you have and give it to people you don't like. Vote for us and we'll cut taxes instead. You deserve to keep your money, after all - that's the American Way!(tm)\\"And, after 50 years of beating these drums continuously, we have everyone convinced that they are an oppressed minority that has to \\"take back\\" the America that they were promised. Women are oppressed because their rights are being threatened - which they are. Racialized minorities are oppressed because the gains they've made over the last half century are being peeled back, bit by bit - which they are. LGBTQ+ folks are told they're oppressed because religious groups of several stripes are protesting against their existence - which is true. And Christian voters are told that they are oppressed because people don't listen to them any more like they are supposed to - which is blatantly false and a naked power grab. And men are told that they are oppressed because women (and liberals) want to take rights away from them. Which is blatantly false, because men haven't lost any rights, women have just gotten the same ones that men already had. And poor conservatives have been told that they're oppressed because the Dems want to take money out of their pockets and pay it out to groups that they don't like. Which is blatantly false, because they are oppressed by low wages, erosion of workers' rights, elimination of things like safety regulations, and a punitive \\"health system\\" that puts them at risk of bankruptcy from a workplace accident. The poor conservatives have been fed a steady diet of influence and now vote against things that would directly help them, like banking regulations, the EPA, Universal Healthcare, taxation of high earners, and corporations, IRS enforcement, Social Security, etc. All things that benefit the few (billionaires) at the expense of the many (the rest of us). People have been convinced to vote against helping anyone, for fear that it will cost them pennies. People are convinced to vote AGAINST their best interests, in order to \\"keep\\" the power that they still are told they are clinging to. It's all been really effective marketing for half a century or more.","title":"CMV: Many of our problems come down to people believing they are being screwed.

Some sectors of the economy have been hit pretty hard, e.g. the tech industry has been significantly slammed by high interest rates, but most industries are going fine.

Absentee ballots are technically for people who can't get a voting place physically due to disability or something similar, but in practice it's the same mechanism and most people use them interchangeably. Let me give you a scenario. You're a political operative and you have access to a state government's datebase for it's people. Anyone working at a DMV or a similar government office would do. So you have access to everyone who is in the system. You have their names, addresses, social security numbers, and even their signatures on file. You also have their current voter registration. You mark down the information from the database for every person you find who is over the age of 40 and hasn't registered to vote and have never voted, and are thus unlikely to vote this time around either. There are tens of millions of these people. You then take that information and submit a fake voter registration with a change of address request, sending your new mail-in ballot to the address of your choice, where you can then fill it out. You and your co-conspirators do these for tens of thousands of individuals and ballots over the span of months in the lead up to an election. The election comes. You have unmonitored drop boxes that allow for people to drop off any number of ballots off through ballot harvesting, which is still legal in most places. These ballots then get processed on election day by a handful of election workers who are barely trained on signature matching, which is inexact unless you're an expert on the subject, who have to process hundreds of thousands of these ballots quickly. As long as the signature is vaguely close to what's on file, it gets approved and counted. Congratulations, you have just undetectably committed mass voter fraud. The only real way to 'catch' this kind of scheme is if the fraudsters fuck up and get overconfident in step 1 when filling out voter registrations and get sloppy with what they put down, which is what happened in PA this year. The only real 'sign' you could find with this otherwise would be statistical abnormalities....which 2020 was full of. As long as mail-in voting is allowed, a scheme like this is possible while also being incredibly difficult to prove that it's actually happening. Which is why most countries do not allow mail-in/absentee ballots to any significant degree.","title":"Biden Was the Fluke in 2020, Not Trump in 2016"},{"text":"- **46% of American adults** demonstrate proficiency at or above a 7th to 8th-grade level, capable of understanding and synthesizing complex texts[5][8].\\n- **34% of adults** read between a 5th and 6th-grade level[1][2].\\n- **20% of adults** read below a 5th-grade level[1][3].At the end of the day it comes down to this-\\n- **19% of all American adults** struggle with basic literacy tasks[4][8].Sources\\\\\\n[1] 48+ US Literacy Statistics 2024 - Percentage by State https://www.thinkimpact.com/literacy-statistics/\\\\\\n[2] 55 US Literacy Statistics: Literacy Rate, Average Reading Level https://www.crossrivertherapy.com/research/literacy-statistics\\\\\\n[3] 45 US Literacy Statistics Exposed - ABA Therapy for Autism https://www.abtaba.com/blog/us-literacy-statistics\\\\\\n[4] Literacy in the United States - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States\\\\\\n[5] Reading the numbers: 130 million American adults have low literacy ... https://www.apmresearchlab.org/10x-adult-literacy\\\\\\n[6] Literacy Statistics 2022-2023 https://www.thenationalliteracyinstitute.com/post/literacy-statistics-2022-2023\\\\\\n[7] Adult Literacy in the United States https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179/index.asp\\\\\\n[8] Fast Facts: Adult literacy (69) - National Center for Education Statistics https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=69\\\\\\n[9] What's the latest U.S. literacy rate? - Wylie Communications https://www.wyliecomm.com/2021/08/whats-the-latest-u-s-literacy-rate/","title":"Biden's legacy is Donald Trump."},{"text":"Arrest them","title":"Democrat mayors vow to defy federal law"},{"text":"Typical GOP say its rigged, or hell fight to keep his power instead of peaceful transition like respectable Democrats do","title":"The Long, Slow Defeat of Pennsylvania Sen.

The people who saw the highest wage increases were people who switched jobs, taking advantage of the hot labor market. So they had to literally apply for an interview for jobs and when they got the job they saw the effort they put into it. Meanwhile they did nothing as prices went up. One thing was a thing THEY did and the other thing was a thing done to them. Even though they are related. So what the Democrats needed to do was both reduce inflation and also convince the public that the inflation that did happen was not their fault. The Democrats did a very poor job on the second part of this and whatever their strategy was didn't resonate with the public. Meanwhile Republicans over the pandemic years were able to parlay mistrust of the vaccine amongst low propensity disenfranchised voters who often were more online and listened to more podcasts than traditional media. Elon Musk took a rightward turn and bought Twitter and used that platform to boost conspiratorial and right wing points of view.

More specifically, people who have publicly opposed him *who* also retracted those statements and later bent the knee to him. Rubio may have personal principles he believes in, but he is obviously more than willing to put them aside to stay in Trumps favor. We know that based on the fact he condemned Trump after J6, but today, he supports him openly and has backpedaled on his criticism of him, *hard*. As is the case with many others in the party and in this slate of cabinet picks. Like with other republicans who have done the same, its hard for me to extend much credit to them. The threat posed by Trump isnt lost on them, and yet, they decided that holding onto their own power and influence was preferable to standing up to him. Unfortunately, it is likely Rubio will continue catering to Trump, even it comes at his own expense, because its the only way he can stay in the GOP.

What do you actually want out of your society, and how will your rule make this more likely to occur?I think the reason most people are (justly) upset that billionaires exist, is because dollars are only a proxy for contributions to society, and most billionaire's are much better at gaming that proxy than contributing to society; don't get me wrong, they still need to significantly contribute, but for every Mark Zuckerberg there are several Winklevosses who have made equal or greater contributions, but lack the dollars to prove it.Now, suppose everyone has some \\"value-generating\\" constant. If I give you ?1.00 today which allows you to create ?1.20 tomorrow, your constant is 1.2. If you want your society to be generating the maximum number of utilons, they should be distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution: people better at generating value will have exponentially more (i.e. Z * e^(beta * generation-constant) where Z is a normalization term and beta is the inverse-temperature).However, there are some important constraints to consider. People's constants can increase (e.g. if they educate themselves) or decrease (e.g. if they become sick). It's often better to invest extra utilons to lower-generating people so they can improve their situation and become a higher-generating kind of guy. This is the point of public education, welfare, etc., and the free market cannot replace these.Now, there will always be scarcities, which are often used as a proxy for utilons. For example, the dollar used to be backed by gold (so, in a sense, it is a proxy for a proxy of value). Gold is great as a scarcity, because people don't need gold to live. Property though, is not-so great, because everyone needs somewhere to live. I think this is the other strong complaint people are making: utilons are being distributed by land as a proxy, which means the bottom 50% of society will own only a few percent of the land, meaning the majority of society will have to be renters.However, this doesn't mean the solution is to eliminate billionaires! The poor are already subsidized above the \\"idealized\\" version of the scenario. The solution is to get better proxies for wealth, that are harder to game and unnecessary for survival. Maybe going back to a gold standard would help with the latter. The former is much more difficult (re: Goodhart's law)how do you even create a meritocratic system? Most countries just used standardized tests as their proxy (for university admissions), or tech companies do \\"LeetCode\\" interviews. The more subjective the process is, the less likely it will be meritocratic, which will reward unethical behavior, which will make the billionaire class consist of unethical people instead of those that do the most for society.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"2008 i was still in school and it was better for me at least personally XD to be able to go back and live those days again would be the best","title":"CMV: Many of our problems come down to people believing they are being screwed.

There is a margin of fraud and Trump's support was beyond that this time, both because he had more support and their ability to cheat was reduced (e.g. election reforms, no covid, more scrutiny, and since they outsourced the fraud those they outsourced it to were less motivated to do it this time).\\n*\\"The third party firms like Dominion to which they outsourced their fraud were less motivated this time\\"*... says the man who scolded me for making \\"wild assumptions\\". \\nMaybe because Rs actually won those by much larger margins and there was no way to make up the difference. Some close House races were decided by tiny margins which they could have made up with ease.

Rs were much less popular in 2016 yet had a much larger majority for example.

Taking away one's property above some arbitrary figure because someone is considered to have \\"too much\\" is a violation of that person's rights.  It is reasonable to have a proportional taxation of one's realized income to cover the common costs of a community and nation, but simply taking from people for no other reason than they have more than someone thinks is a maximum is unreasonable.Such caps also impose other issues.  The ultra-wealthy generally derive their net worth from ownership of a business.  The wealth is not held in cash.  So when one takes away the wealth, one also takes away from the billionaires' rights to control the companies they have built by diluting their ownership and voting stakes.  This is even more problematic if the business is not a corporation with publicly traded stock.  What is done with those shares of ownership?  Does the government simply keep the ownership in the business?  Who is the ownership sold to?  Also, selling large chunks of a publicly traded stock to go down, harming people on a widespread basis, even those who do not have high levels of wealth. There is no good reason to be so fixated on the amount of wealth someone else has.  At least in the developed Western world, there are widespread opportunities to increase one's own wealth.  Focus on utilizing those positively to build one's wealth.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"In winter 2021, Biden should have demanded the intelligence services investigate trump's espionage in office, and then he should have presented the findings to the american people and had trump detained pending trial.  \\nThis was the only way to stop America's hitler and now Democracy is dead forever.

Both of them are awful.The progressives (the woke movement) are bats insane. They have zero good policy ideas. The states where they implemented some of their policies (Cali, Minnesota, etc.) are losing jobs and residents.  The ideological 'core' of the progressive movement is ethnic hatred, be it white shame or minoritarian retribution (Ben Shapiro's \\"coalition of losers\\"). To be blunt, it doesn't work because it can't work. Their economic and social policy proposals are disasters. So, the Democrats, if they want to 'win', have to disregard the progressive ideology wholesale. Due to the stupidity of the academics, the progressives have a lot of votes from the college-educated. More progressivism will mean alienating more voters because of the insanity of it all, and that means losing elections. The neoliberals are ultimately responsible for jettisoning the labor vote (unions et al.) from the Democrat party. The American people never really bought into Neoliberalism; it's another elite-imposed elite-centric ideology much like Dubya-era Neoconservatism.  Meaning, people do not like and will not vote for more Neoliberalism. So, the Neoliberals have a lot of donor money, but few votes.  More neoliberalism will almost certainly mean losing more voters, and that means losing elections. So it's a DNC civil war in which both of the competing factions must lose if the Democrats are to be a viable party in the future. The progressives are too crazy and the neoliberals are too elite-centric.  The progressives are focused on minorities, and the Democrats are losing the minority vote. The neoliberals are focused on money and deep blue areas are going broke.  Neither of them are working.  The best bet is create a third faction and sweep the board, but that would be an uphill battle. The third faction would have to beat the progressive zealotry and the neoliberal tenacious policy complacency. That's a tall order. For comparison, Trump fought and won the GOP civil war in 2016 and again in 2024. The populists Trump rallied beat the Neocons in 2016 and the right-leaning Neoliberals in 2024.  In contrast, Clinton attempted to sweep the DNC civil war under the rug in 2016 and failed, which almost certainly cost her the election, and Biden attempted to find a middle ground in his term and failed. Personally I think the Democrats are screwed for 10+ years. The cultish nature of the progressives means that new ideas are seen with hatred, and the stagnation of the neoliberals mean anything that isn't short-term corpo profits are ignored. Their party is busted, they knew it was breaking for years, and they failed to course correct. I say let them fight and get the popcorn.","title":"After 2024 defeats, Democrats turn on each other in battle for soul of the party"},{"text":"?produce more slop designed for people who get their worldview from Facebook and other social media. 6th grade maximum vocab/sentence structure.?This was already the case until recently.

I don't have some great answer for how a redistribution would work, however, I don't necessarily think this should be a reason to not do it.You're wrong here. The fact that there is no great answer for how this would work is indeed a reason not to do it. You don't even have a \\"concept of a plan\\" on how to accomplish this, so you're statement is basically just meaningless words. I think you're going after the wrong phenomenon here. There really is no problem with an individual accumulating a ultra high net worth, as long as they do it legally and ethically. Net worth is not even a tangible thing. It's a theoretical number that represents the estimated value of a person's assets. Any potential capping or redistribution of those assets would not really do anything to benefit the poor. It would just have the ripple effect of devaluing everything for everybody and would reset the bench mark. The richest people under the correct system would still be the richest in the new system, and the relative gaps between the rich and the poor would still exist. Your post presents you as someone who does not know what net worth is and i suspect you are thinking if it as the same thing as cash on hand. What you should be more concerned about are the ways that ultra high net worth people leverage their network to stay rich and disproportionately benefit themselves. Additionally the things that allow generational wealth to persist unchallenged and undiminished across multiple generations. Circling back to my initial point, anyone earning their wealth in an above board way deserves it. They are playing within the rules and taking advantage of some supply and demand market. If people don't like that, with Jeff bezos as an example, then stop buying so much from Amazon. Don't buy so much to begin with. He's providing goods and services that people want, so he reaps the benefits. Whether or not he has done so legally and ethically i can't say for sure, but giving the benefit of the doubt for sake of the argument","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"Yes?

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.  \\n  \\n  \\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century  \\n  \\n  \\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. Youve already done this, havent you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.  \\n  \\n  \\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of our institutions unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions dont protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.  \\n  \\n  \\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.  \\n  \\n  \\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of terrorism and extremism. Be alive to the fatal notions of exception and emergency. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.  \\n  \\n  \\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Dont fall for it.  \\n  \\n  \\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Dont use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Vclav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes?aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.  \\n  \\n  \\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.  \\n  \\n  \\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.  \\n  \\n  \\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.  \\n  \\n  \\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.  \\n  \\n  \\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.  \\n  \\n  \\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.  \\n  \\n  \\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.  \\n  \\n  \\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.  \\n  \\n  \\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.  \\n  \\n  \\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.  \\n  \\n  \\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.  \\n  \\n  \\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)  \\n  \\n  \\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.  \\n  \\n  \\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  \\n  \\n  \\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.  \\n  \\n  \\n?

This model maximizes the economical stability as company can make tougher decisions when problems arise. Owner risks the outcome with his own investment and workers not - that is why they are able to get more.The issue starts when we allow the same market initiatives to take over parts that aren't bound by the rules of market. Housing, education, food production etc. are sectors that enable country to be stable as they are responsible for safety nets in case of failure. And they are rigid - you can't really have more houses than people, more schools than students in area or more patients than sick people. The main driving force of capitalism - expanding the market is just not possible. We need to assume that base level of those needs to be secured by government in some form. US currently falls flat on that, other counties mitigate it to varying degree.As the productivity per person grows, the safety nets should grow - because we want a situation where people who want to do something are ones that take risks and succeed, while those who are comfortable at a level should be able to maintain it. Full redistribution of profits or full representation of workers in a company are going to have negative outcomes for the same workers.

There is a margin of fraud and Trump's support was beyond that this time, both because he had more support and their ability to cheat was reduced (e.g. election reforms, no covid, more scrutiny, and since they outsourced the fraud those they outsourced it to were less motivated to do it this time). What about this is so hard to understand? Why didn't they cheat enough in three of the ten or so House races which Republicans won by a margin of less than 2%Maybe because Rs actually won those by much larger margins and there was no way to make up the difference. And each locality is different and has different people doing the count. Not all of them would be activist. You'll see the usual suspects all flipped seats for dems that's why the largest public opinion victory for republicans resulted in the slimmest of majorities in congress.

I think it's a logistical nightmare and unrealistic.Unless you could create a country where each school district has an equal economy, you'd get variation in quality in education I'd imagine.You can move the same school to a zone with a worse economy, and the school performance is worse. This happens where I live in Europe. Some schools are owned by private businesses but are free, public and subsidised by the government. But all their systems and processes remain the same. So the same school effectively duplicates across the country, and they get varying results.The equal access to the same education standard is there. But so much depends on student behaviour, which can depend on parents, which can depend on the upbringing and education of parents etc. Classes are also learning at the speed of the lowest common denominator, so classes get separated between worse performers and better performers - and although this access isn't equal, it allows everybody to get the best results possible, for as far as what they're willing to put in.I have no idea how the education system works in the US. I like the education system I had in the UK and I think it's about as good a system as you could get. Haven't been to university (college) so I couldn't comment there.

Also, keeping people from getting to 40 hours or full time so as to not pay benefits. Continuously raising prices out of greed. Layoffs bc you made 490 million instead of 495/500million.

Whether buying or renting, things are substantially more expensive than before, so if you weren't locked into a house by the time interest rates went up during the pandemic, or maybe even before the pandemic when housing costs were already exploding, that's where all the money has gone. Housing has doubled in the last decade, whether that be rent or newer mortgages, so an extra $500-1500 per month per household is just killing everything. Sure, groceries may cost more, but that's far less than the increase in housing costs.","title":"High growth doesnt tell the story of the US economy: Impressive headline figures didnt help the Democrats"},{"text":"This is the case. The poor people were manipulated. Also I think Ezra Klein made a good point where people see their wages increase as something they achieved and see price increases as something imposed on them. So people think \\"If I had this type of money five years ago I could have bought a house.\\" So they feel like they are a day late a dollar short despite their overall better position. Also, I think it's worth seeing that specifically if people who make money on the lower end of the spectrum make more money that puts more pressure on inflation than of higher income people make more money. Lower income people spend their money on material goods and if supply doesn't quickly ramp up to meet the demand then inflation will happen. Furthermore to ramp up supply there needs to be more hiring and that creates pressure on labor costs going up which also increases costs. So for lower end workers unless there is an equal increase in productivity the higher wages there in more ways than one create a ton of inflation pressure. Meanwhile higher paid workers are much more likely to invest or spend on non tangible items since they already have what they want. They create inflation pressure but not as much when they are increases. So this catch-22 situation is created. Where Democrats in particular really want to help low wage earners, but when they actually achieve this they are punished for it.  Springfield Ohio is a perfect example of this. The entire reason they have a Haitian population is because they actually achieved building more factories. For decades people in the Rust Belt have been saying \\"we need jobs not welfare\\" the issue is introducing factories into an area where the workforce has long moved on from being attuned to actually do factory work means they have to import workers. So immigrants or people from out of the state come in to do the factory work. This creates higher rent as vacancy rates go down. It becomes harder to use section 8 vouchers. If you want to do serious construction in housing you again have to find immigrant workers. Again the prime-age workforce is smaller and more educated, they already have their niche. The older population is not able to work at these types of jobs anymore. So...immigrants are needed and people don't want that either. So really what has happened is a malaise that is spurred by demographics. People want an impossible thing and Democrats responding directly to what people want makes them less popular than if they did nothing and ignored \\"the people\\" what \\"the people\\" want is to go back to a time they see with rose colored glasses. A time when things were less complicated and that made more sense to them.

Since they have the most income, they have the most political power (especially after the Citizens United decision) so they're obviously going to control the propaganda that is espoused on the news stations they own so that it serves their interests. Since they enjoy the income inequality, they have a vested interest in ensuring fingers are pointed every way but theirs (there'll be some, but it can't reach critical mass).

In fact the US government would prefer the standard of living to be as low as possible so the goods are as cheap as possible which keeps food prices down and prevents poor people in the US from complaining too much. The reason I said it isn't a core strategic interest is that the US can actually grow most of its own food and imports mostly from countries much closer for obvious reasons. Ukraine is much more important to European countries than to the US which is really why we helped them in the first place. We do look after our European allies' interests but not with a great deal of enthusiasm. Congress realistically can't be trusted to follow through financially on supporting our overseas obligations. Maybe that is a sign that we are overextended but I don't think we will change our ways soon. Personally I think this whole war was a result of miscalculation on the part of Obama/Clinton and later Biden about how to address Russia. We still had a foreign policy mindset that would could get our way all the time without consequences. Obviously that is not the case. We should have come to a long term agreement to keep Ukraine a neutral country that had close ties with both Western Europe and Russia to prevent this kind of war. Ukraine is a core strategic interest of Russia. Remember how the US reacted to Cuba being in the Soviet orbit. In terms of real politics Ukraine being in NATO is actually a bigger threat to Russia than the Cuban missile crisis was to the US as defending against a land invasion from Ukraine into Russia would be very difficult. Wars are generally speaking the failure of diplomacy. Sometimes the conflicts don't have another possible resolution but I would need some serious convincing to believe that about this conflict as opposed to say the American Civil war. Even the American Revolution was super preventable. I actually find it quite likely that Trump did sell the secrets but again, it was to people who he would consider potential collaborators. Ukraine also has large offshore oil deposits that both the US and Russia want access to. this war is all about resources and which bloc of nations has access to them.

Even if you forego the jab, in other words, you could still end up becoming vaccinated if someone you come into contact with was recently injected.\\nIronically, this would make vaccinated people the true superspreaders.Self-spreading vaccines C also known as transmissible or self-propagating vaccines C are genetically engineered to move through populations in the same way as communicable diseases, but rather than causing disease, they confer protection, the JHU paper explains.The vision is that a small number of individuals in the target population could be vaccinated, and the vaccine strain would then circulate in the population much like a pathogenic virus. These vaccines could dramatically increase vaccine coverage in human or animal populations without requiring each individual to be inoculated.\\nThe paper goes on to explain the two different types of self-spreading vaccines: recombinant vector vaccines and live viral vaccines.

Workers create profit not only at their own cost or their employee's. They also put a burden at society and shared spaces - that is why taxes are needed to fund things that mitigate those externalities. Someone has to mantain security, public roads, courts etc.In the latter case you actually have no representation. So the issue is moot.Of course you are, those things are according to laws and regulations, which are introduced by who? Representatives they vote for. They vote for schools, healthcare or infrastructure bills and people should support those who they believe secure their best interests.

When someone gets really rich, it usually means theyve built something that helps a lot of peoplelike jobs, products, or services.Take Elon Musk, for example. He made billions because Tesla builds electric cars that are better for the environment. His company also hires thousands of workers and supports clean energy progress. If wed capped his money, would we have more electric cars today? Probably not.Also, rich people dont just sit on their money. They invest it, which helps businesses grow, creates jobs, and funds new ideas. They also pay taxes, which go toward things we all need, like schools and roads. And many of them give away billions to help with things like education and poverty.The real problem isnt how much money someone has; its making sure everyone has a fair shot to succeed. Instead of focusing on cutting people down, lets work on building everyone uplike making education, healthcare, and good jobs more available.Putting a limit on wealth sounds nice, but it wont fix inequality.

The overall trendline is much flatter under the Biden admin than under Trump.Fact 2: [Average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees, adjusted for inflation via CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1BHmo), are higher in the most recent period (Oct 2024) than in Dec 2019. This measure spiked up during COVID due to composition effects: average earnings artificially inflated when those with low incomes were disproportionately likely to lose their jobs during the pandemic. After that effect washed out, real average wages are up, though at a flatter trendline in the Biden admin than in the Trump admin.Fact 3: [Real (inflation-adjusted) median usual weekly earnings among wage-and-salary workers employed full-time](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/seriesBeta/LES1252881600Q), are higher in the most recent period (Q3 2024) than in Q4 2019. This figure tells a similar story to the average wage data.How to reconcile these:* These series are collected on different intervals: the median income figures are not yet available for 2024, when a significant chunk of the real wage gains under Biden have occurred.* These series are looking at different definitions of income: the median income data includes non-wage income like self-employment income, retirement income, government transfers, alimony, child support, etc. It could be that the real value of these income sources fell while the wage composition of income increased during this period. The series are also confounded by hours worked: median incomes and median weekly earnings can go down while average hourly earnings are going up if hours worked are also going down.* The series are compiled from different sources: the median income data is from Census Bureau surveys of households, the average hourly earnings data comes from Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys of companies, and the median usual weekly earnings data comes from BLS surveys of households. These sources can diverge simply due to methodological differences.","title":"High growth doesnt tell the story of the US economy: Impressive headline figures didnt help the Democrats"},{"text":"Yep i lost my salon because of it..","title":"I Cant Forget What Was Done to Us During the Pandemic"},{"text":"What does \\"with money\\" mean?

Hell, I'd like *everyone* to get personal infinite utility, but until we get Replicators I'm fine with doling it out unevenly as an incentive for doing good works.The problem is that money isn't just *personal* utility, it is also *power*.  Political power, most saliently, but also economic power and the ability to manipulate markets and coerce or exploit employees, social power and the ability to coerce and buy and sell people behind the scenes, etc.But the political power is the big problem. Rich people have huge influence over politicians and often buy their way into direct power over the populace.  There's no legitimate justification for this, money just has the power to do it regardless of who it hurts.So until money doesn't buy power, it's simply not safe for the rest of us to let anyone have too much of it at one time.

Even if each individual measurement is noisy and wrong, they will tend to center on the true answer.Wat scientists typically do *not* do is try to get a very small amount of 'good' data instead.  This is because trying to pick out the 'good' data can introduce *systematic* bias, which does *not* leave you centered on the true answer underneath the noise.  You could be mistaken about which data is 'good', your method for finding the 'good' data could include an error that alters the measurement, the thing that makes the data 'good' could be a third factor that also alters it, etc.If you let 100,000,000 truly ignorant people vote in a two party system, about a third of them will vote for party A, about a third will vote for party B, and about a third will not vote.  They tend to cancel each other out, and it doesn't hurt that you let them vote.If you try to only let 'the right people' vote, then *no matter how you choose the 'right' people*, you will be opening yourself to systematic bias.Like, forget the obvious opening this creates for corruption and designing a test that favors your own voters; that's how it *would* fail immediately in reality, but lets pretend everyone designing and administering the test is a perfect angel forever into the future.Maybe the 'right' people are almost never farm workers, and are ignorant on that one specific topic, and your agricultural policy collapses.Maybe the 'right' people overwhelmingly live in cities, and everyone in the country suffers for their picks.Maybe the 'right' people tend to be much older because you are testing some knowledge that accumulates over time, and the rate of social/political progress drops tremendously.Maybe the 'right' people tend to have a different religion or moral system from the rest, and implement things that the rest genuinely dislike on valid moral and aesthetic grounds.Maybe one party already has control of the school system, and can teach the answers to the test to students in their own areas while not teaching it to students in opposed areas, corrupting the test without writing it.Etc.  Reducing the value of someone's vote instead of failing them certainly mitigates these effects, but only to the exact same extent it mitigates the intended value of having a test in the first place.  You are still pushing towards some kind of systematic bias, importantly a systematic bias that *you cannot predict ahead of time*, by filtering your own data like this.That's why scientists don't do it.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"What?

They benefit not only a tiny proportion of the target group, but also proportion least affected by disadvantage and already most successful.? EDIT - if you disagree name such a policy that benefits people who have low academic achievements, rather than those who have high academic achievements.  Only a small fraction of the population have high academic achievements.Likewise, those who are negatively impacted are already successful.?? If a prestigious college offers a spot to a minority student via \\"affirmative action\\", that's already a student who must have done fairly well and would have gone to college somewhere anyway.?

Colleges have admitted in court that their goal is to create diversity on campus for the benefit of their institution, not for the benefit of minority communities.

This isn't even a hint of a plan, this is a wild guess at the possible existence of an undefined plan later; characterizing it as Trump himself having a definite plan to purge disloyalists isn't even hyperbole, it's a lie.I can conclude that over the next years every U.S. ICBM silo location will be revealed, in addition to the location of every nuclear submarine, as there will be no accountability left in the military.US ICBM silos have been visible by satellite for decades, and nuclear subs are constantly on the move while out of radio contact; literally no one not on board actually knows where they are. Russia already has effectively the same information on them as the President now.Following the nullification of U.S. nuclear strength, we will see a flow of information from the Pentagon to the Kremlin so catastrophic, it will be on par with the Enigma decryption, thus ending the decades long struggle between the U.S. and Russia with a Russian victory. The U.S. will collapse into multiple states or become a Russian satellite state....What?1. A disarming nuclear strike is literally impossible. Firing nukes into the ocean won't hurt a nuclear sub thousands of feet down, even if you did magically determine its position, and Russia doesn't have anywhere near enough submarines of its own to kill all of ours at once.\\n2. Firing nukes at the US would instantly trigger NATO to invade and destroy Russia. Considering that they're unable to take out a country vastly smaller and weaker than itself even after years, while the country is supported with nothing more than NATO's castoffs, can you even imagine that they'd stand up to a determined push from NATO itself? This would be literal suicide by Putin.\\n3. Trump's last administration was already so leaky that we got transcripts of private calls and meetings. Can you even imagine that everyone would somehow manage to keep quiet while leaking our entire collection of national intelligence to them?\\n4. Even if that did somehow happen, how exactly would this turn the US into a satellite state? It could be argued that having direct control of Trump would turn the US into a puppet state, but not really; the President has wide power, but is ultimately constrained by Congress and the courts and would have extremely hard limits on what he'd actually be able to do.Independent nation = all 50 U.S. states and territories as one country with a head of state that isnt influenced by other nations.All nations have some level of influence over each other.

It was released all of nine months into Trump's Presidency, and commented on problems with their own internal processes that had been plaguing them for years:Acknowledging that recruiting spies is a high-risk business, the cable raised issues that have plagued the agency in recent years, including poor tradecraft; being too trusting of sources; underestimating foreign intelligence agencies, and moving too quickly to recruit informants while not paying enough attention to potential counterintelligence risks  a problem the cable called placing mission over security.You can't blame this on Trump unless you believe that he somehow took control over the CIA's internal affairs years before taking office.Trump has now tapped Tulsi Gabbard to be Director of National Intelligence.If he actually wanted her to influence foreign policy, he'd have tapped her for Secretary of State, ambassador to Russia, or similar office that actually can control our response to Russia.

Their rhetoric is muted, mild, and promises more of the same. This is why we've been losing elections across the globe.I'm a leftist, I've always been one. I'm a democratic socialist. And we've failed entirely because we don't have the balls to offer anything besides milquetoast policies. Ask yourself, when's the last time you heard a leftist politician hold a fire-and-brimstone speech demanding we tax the rich elites and break up their monopolies or else? Or demanding better pay for the average worker? The left has lost its way and slowly morphed into a watered down, neoliberal establishment movement instead of what it's supposed to be. There are good policies, but they're too few, too moderate, too little too late, and they're served up in a way that just does not reach the voters.People want radical changes to society, and we're not offering them that.

A US boomer sub surfaces ever so often partly to refuel (they're all nuclear and thus don't need to refuel, but the crew needs fresh food), partly to signal they're still around, then dives down and can then no longer be found, unless it decides to reveal itself. Even if the Russians had the exact plans to the sub, they couldn't find them because there's no technology they have that could find one.The US nuclear triad also encompasses a third leg, the aircraft launched nuclear bombs, whose locations are *also* known by treaty and spycraft.Lastly, the US already knows the location of every Russian silo and warhead, and probably has a decent guess at where the Russian subs are - who are much fewer in number, and their stealth tech is way worse and the US detection tech much better. There's a decent chance every Russian SLBM sub is constantly shadowed by two American attack submarines.Your horror scenario for the US *already applies to Russia*.And while Russia has parity, more or less, with the US on the nuclear front (ignoring for now the US' NATO allies, with France and the UK owning enough SLBM firepower to kill a hundred million Russians every day of the week), Russia is a much weaker state on every other level. It's much poorer, its conventional military might is a mere fraction of the US (again ignoring NATO allies), it's corrupt, it's technologically behind, it's diplomatically isolated, it's in a strategically terrible position - that's why the Russians are so paranoid, they're surrounded by enemies (Poland, Ukraine, the Baltics and Finland are not a day's worth of tank travel away from Moscow and St Petersburg), compared to the US which is the mightiest nation in the world on any metric and in a *fantastic* geostrategic position - protected by two vast oceans and on a continent with friends.So, on every metric the Russians are *already at this time* in a worse situation than the US would be if your horror scenario - its entire nuclear arsenal revealed - came true; its nuclear arsenal *is already revealed*, and everything else about it is terrible, whereas everything about the US is in fact enviable.Nevertheless Russia has its territorial integrity uncompromised, it is in fact expanding.How then would the US fall apart when it changed from \\"way, way, way safer than Russia on any metric\\" to \\"way, way safer than Russia on any metric but for one, on which it's now only somewhat safer than Russia\\"?On the other hand:Independent nation = all 50 U.S. states and territories as one country with a head of state that isnt influenced by other nations.I think there's around a 2% chance there'll be 51 or 52 states after Trump buys Greenland, or Puerto Rico becomes a state or DC.And: *every* head of state, including Kim Yong Un, is influenced by other nations.

American Empire is on the decline anyway, and our further loss of power and global influence is assured following this election but that doesn't mean that Russia will control us. They are only interested in preventing our interference into their affairs and a return to multipolarity. This is not the first cold war, they are not seeking to gain the upper hand in an ideological struggle like the USSR was. They in fact are of a very similar ideology to the republican party which is why they get along so well. Russia is a very conservative country right now that serves as a bit of a role model for how the far right Republicans want the state to enforce Christian Nationalism.The issue here is not that the US will be a puppet state so much as the republican party has been convinced to ally with Russia as a more ideologically aligned long term partner or at least frequent collaborator. Lets be honest, the US only got involved in Ukraine because we wanted to contain Russia. We really don't have that much to gain from our involvement there in terms of core strategic interests. That part of the world does not matter to us that much from a strategic point of view. The democratic party still wants to maintain complete hegemony over world affairs but we just aren't that powerful anymore and we have significant competition from new or resurgent powers. Our relationship to Saudi Arabia and Turkey is kinda similar at this point as on paper we supposedly support countries that \\"love freedom\\" but realistically that means whichever despots have oil or are willing to fight our proxy wars. Honorable mention goes to the European Imperialist powers (UK and France) who assist us in destabilizing developing countries so our corporations can extract their natural resources for cheap. I agree that a withdrawal of support from Ukraine is quite likely and will lead to very predictable results. That being said, there was never that much conviction in the support that congress was willing to give to Ukraine. I agree that this stuff is all quite concerning but I don't think the independence of the US is at stake. I do think that there is a great deal of internal destabilization on the horizon. I really wonder what the consequences of a military purge will be and I am not sure how the military will respond to that. Personally i find it quite disturbing and I am sure many soldiers and officers who are not trump fanatics also find this quite disturbing. At the same time I think it will galvanize people against the impending fascist takeover of the country, whether or not that is enough to prevent us from bringing our brutal habit of violence home to our own people in force remains to be seen. Personally I find a civil war  unlikely but that's only because the far right is in a much more organized position with regards to being armed and ready to inflict violence on their political opponents. Liberals are still clinging to the idea that we can \\"save our democracy\\" by voting. Clearly the democrats were not up to the task which means people need to take matters into their own hands with regards to protecting and growing our rights.  I'll put it this way, I gave up faith in electoral politics a long time ago but I still have hope for the future, provided people are willing to actually take a stand when push comes to shove.

Why certain groupings have lower literacy rates and IQs is not important. I'd say it is, are these differences inherent or the result of discrimination? Assuming IQ is even a useful number in the first place, if IQ is going to be affected by societal factors, like access to education and nutrition, then using IQ as a standard for who gets to make political decisions that involve how education and nutrition are distributed risks creating a feedback loop. If some people are too illiterate to vote that their children deserve to be taught to read, then their children are going to grow up without a say too and you're entrenching the problem. Unless you think people who benefit from discrimination are going to vote to end a system they benefit from. And yes you're right. But the pendulum has swung to the opposite end, with diverse ethnicities being favoured in colleges. The correct balance is in the center - you get a job or college position based on merit.The trouble is then how you measure merit and again whether merit is inherent or circumstantial. For example are the students who score 80% on a test inherently better students than those who score 60%? Or do we want to account for the circumstances people come from?Say we have two students who scored 80% and 60% on our entrance exam and we want to decide who is more likely to be a successful students in college? Now 80% is an achievement and that's impressive. But if we have the context that the other student achieved 60% while going through chemo therapy it's worth factoring that into our assessment of who's going to work harder. Part of the reason programs like affirmative action are valuable is because no every student is going to have the same access to help in schools so even students with equal ability (if ability as a quantity exists) are going to preform differently given their circumstances. A single set of tests can't capture the range of factors that go into how well some students do. Not to mention not all circumstances are permanent, someone who did okay within an underfunded school system could do more than okay when given access to more resources at a prestigious college and so we can't judge their potential just on their performance before now. There's also the question of how we correct for systems that historically have been discriminatory, just saying 'from now we will be 100% fair' doesn't necessarily work when the consequences of the unfair system are still present. You're also assuming that selection is entirely about finding the best individuals, vs forming the best group. It's not necessarily true that just getting the best people will inherently make the best group. A plurality of perspectives could be more valuable. A college with academics with a range of backgrounds and experiences is potentially better than one that just has the very best professors. Historic discrimination can mean that the very best professors have noticeable gaps in their experience and understanding. Especially if we want to make changes going forward to address underserved communities, having people from those communities in positions of power to express their views and address issues that kept people from their communities out.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"The US was winning in Vietnam in so far as it was holding territory and had very positive KD ratios.

Right now, wealth is seen as a proxy for success, security, and even self-worth. People strive for extreme wealth not just for what it can buy, but for the validation it brings. Changing the system requires changing this perceptionshifting the narrative so that fulfillment and success arent solely tied to material accumulation.One idea is to create systems that incentivize people to prioritize impact over accumulation ??For exampleWhat if we had structures where those with immense resources were celebrated not for how much they own, but for how much they REINVEST into societywhether thats through innovation, public works, or tackling global challenges.We already see glimpses of this in philanthropy, but it could go further if society collectively redefined what success means. Perhaps, Elon Musk is a good example of this in todays times?To tie this back to emotional &amp; societal growth: Wealth inequality isnt JUST a financial issue; its deeply tied to our emotional and cultural conditioning ?For generations, most people havent been taught how to process and understand their own emotions, which leads to external validation becoming the ultimate goal. If we could teach emotional intelligence and fulfillment as foundational skillson par with reading and mathit could reduce the impulse to hoard wealth as a substitute for happiness or security.Imagine a world where emotional maturity is ingrained in our education systems, helping people to derive their self-worth from intrinsic values like connection, creativity, and contribution rather than their bank acct balance. This kind of systemic emotional shift might address wealth inequality at its root, making the redistribution of resources feel less like of a restriction and more like a natural extension of a healthier society. I definitely dont have everything figured outbut Im confident &amp; hopefulWe can achieve greatness Please share your thoughts, if youd like to ??Do you think we can shift the narrative around wealth and success without hard restrictions?

But one of them has transcended its original context: Its the economy, stupid. What then to make of the decisive swing towards Donald Trump against a backdrop of low unemployment, falling inflation and economic growth rates most of the rich world would envy?\\nDo voters no longer care about economic performance? Or were they misinformed about how strong the US economy really is under Joe Biden? Or is there another explanation for why the Democrats presided over strong growth, yet lost?\\nLets take these possibilities in turn. Many people are so tribal in their political loyalties that their satisfaction with the economy depends almost entirely on who is in charge. You can see this in the sharp swings in sentiment whenever the presidency changes parties. For many years, it has been the case that when a Democrat is in the White House, registered Democrats are much more confident about the economy than registered Republicans. When a Republican is in charge, that pattern reverses.\\nThe scale of these politically inflected shifts in sentiment is as large, perhaps larger, as that in response to actual economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, or the Covid-19-related contraction. In other words, when you ask people how confident they feel about the economy, they actually tell you how confident they feel about the president.\\nBut it would be wrong to conclude that the actual performance of the economy simply does not matter to voters. For one thing, voters tell pollsters it matters very much indeed. In October, Gallup found that 52 per cent of respondents rated the economy as an extremely important influence on their vote for president. This is the highest percentage since 2008 and the highest of any issue this election. This suggests a puzzle. Americans voted decisively for change, yet most headline indicators suggest the US economy was doing well. Were the voters just misinformed?\\nThe simplest metric for economic performance is real GDP growth, on which measure the US performance has been enviable. The US grew more than 10 per cent between the end of 2019 and the second quarter of 2024. The best of the rest in the G7, Italy and Canada, grew about half as much. The UK grew less than 3 per cent. Germany didnt grow at all.\\nOr look at unemployment: the US unemployment rate fell to just 3.4 per cent at moments in 2023, the lowest level since the 1960s. Now it is a little over 4 per cent, still better than at any moment during the 16 years in which George W Bush or Barack Obama were in charge. Both were comfortably re-elected. If US growth is the envy of the developed world, even after adjusting for inflation, and unemployment is close to record lows, what sort of a fool would vote for change on economic grounds?\\nPerhaps it is the commentators who have been the fools. Look beyond the standard headline indicators and there are plenty of signs of economic stress. Jason Furman, who was a senior economic adviser to the Obama administration, has pointed to several. Theres the prime-age employment rate, which is the proportion of people aged between 25 and 54 who are employed. This indicator shows how many people are engaged with the labour market and it falls if people give up looking for a job, are too ill to work, or simply feel they have better things to do with their time than work for money. In the US, this rate has barely recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In the supposedly struggling euro area, its significantly up. Low unemployment rate notwithstanding, perhaps the US economy has struggled to satisfy the people most likely to feel they should have a job?\\nAnd while wages have grown faster than inflation, the trend has been much less positive since 2019 than it was in the years before. Real median household incomes have fallen since 2019, and the poverty rate has risen.\\nThe FTs Alphaville column has also spotlighted the soft underbelly of the US economy. They point out that while wages have, on average, grown faster than inflation, that may not be true for lower-income households. Weve seen plenty of signs of cheapflation, a tendency of cheaper products to increase in price more than expensive varieties of the same good. The cumulative effect has not been small, and poorer households are almost certainly more vulnerable.\\nThe point of all this? The economy is a complicated system and just because some things are going well for some people does not mean that everything is going well for everyone. And, in particular, not for swing voters on the issues that matter most to them.\\nDefenders of President Bidens administration might reasonably point out that he has done his best to fix what weaknesses the US economy has, and even more reasonably point out that Trumps medicine of mass deportations and ubiquitous tariffs is more likely to harm the patient than heal. Fine.\\nBut if the question is why didnt American voters understand that the economy was doing brilliantly?, the question itself is the problem. The economy has many facets and a strong economy for some does not mean a strong economy for everyone. With that in mind, its still the economy, stupid.","title":"High growth doesnt tell the story of the US economy: Impressive headline figures didnt help the Democrats"},{"text":"These kind of election qualification or \\"literacy tests\\" have only one goal.

That your say should be worth more and the system is designed to fail? Why weren't these concerns aired over the last few years? Weren't the Democrats supposed to be saving democracy? Did they drop the ball? Or do you all actually just fucking hate democracy when it works as designed? Would anyone be pushing ludicrous ideas voter tests if your candidate somehow managed to win? Of course not.Every proponent of this concept needs to change their mind. It's just bad on every level. A change of attitude wouldn't go astray either. None of you are better than anyone else. It's true your current system is ridiculous and is rightly mocked around the world for the unserious trainwrexk that it is.

What happens when the side you disagree with inevitably gets into power, and the questions start becoming \\"is social security bad for the economy?\\" or \\"does human life begin at conception?\\".I agree with you that voting should be more restrictive. But I don't see how this proposal works, logistically or practically without making the US less democratic when the questions become biased and subjective.The problem with widespread suffrage in general is that the population isn't knowledgeable enough to know what they're voting for as a whole. If you had symptoms of a medical problem, you wouldn't give a list of conditions to 100 people at random and get them to vote to diagnose you, regardless of their previous medical knowledge. So why do we do it with governance?And you can't decide who votes based on \\"education level\\" because a lot of degrees are irrelevant to politics. The average Reddit user on this sub knows more than the graphic design graduate - regardless of whether the average Reddit user is formally educated or not.Historically, the most common metric to decide this, in dominant democracies, was male land owners (over 21 years old in the case of the US). Rome also had a similar system. Athens was somewhat similar, with male citizens who completed military service being given voting rights. Whether this is a better system or not, who knows.

Ventures of this kind tend to require many years of upfront investment, where the product or service you're creating doesn't generate much (or any) revenue.Traditional banks are unlikely to finance a business that risky. So you turn to venture capital instead. VCs don't really care if you only have a 10% chance of succeeding, or even a 1% chance. What they care about is expected value. If they get nothing 99% of the time, but 1% of the time they make a 10,000x return on their investment, their finances are structured so that this becomes an attractive proposition for them. They only need one 'fund returner' to justify at least a few dozen investments.In a world where the amount of wealth a single person is allowed to own is capped, this presents a problem for venture capital on a few fronts.  \\n1. Fewer people will be willing to take the risk of starting a business, given that they know an already extremely unlikely outcome is now even more difficult. You may say 1 billion is a high enough cap that most people wouldn't be affected by it, but the margin really matters when there are only about 10 companies founded a year that are of the fund-returner variety.  \\n2. If everything goes well, and the CEO/CTO become billionaires through owning stakes in the company they founded, but then the government says they have to relinquish some of their wealth in order to stay below the billion dollar threshold, what that actually translates to is the founders having to give up a potentially large share of their ownership. This means the companies will no longer be founder-run, which has historically been a bad idea for tech companies.  \\n3. VC funds usually have investors who are high net worth individuals, ex-founders and other people involved in startups. If there are fewer billionaires and centi-billionaires, the arguably somewhat insane exercise of investing millions of dollars into hundreds of 23 year olds on the off chance that one or two of them become the next Google or Apple becomes a much harder sell. The pool of funding dries up, and the venture industry is essentially kneecapped in scope and scale.All of this is to say that venture capital would more or less cease to exist under a wealth cap. You may not think it's a particularly valuable part of the economy, but I would disagree with that. Most of the growth in the US economy over the last 20 years for example has been carried by big tech companies. 10 tech giants account for 30% of the S&amp;P 500. Those companies cannot be created without venture capital. I agree that it's weird that some people control millions of times more resources than the average person, but in practice there's no way around that without essentially killing the golden goose of capitalism. The prosperity of much of the Western world depends on a few unbelievably productive companies, mostly in tech, and it seems like a bad idea to mess with that.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"What weighting do you give to someone who gets a 0 on your test?","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"Agree with everything you said","title":"Is there something wrong with being Paleolibertarian?"},{"text":"Was it easier or harder to spread misinformation to lots of people back then?","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"Even the examples you gave are politically motivated, though.

Advertising and broadcasting are forms of speech.  Cash is not speech and shall not be treated as such.How you choose to spend your money is both a matter of freedom of conscience and freedom of speech.Government may not discriminate against individuals on the basis of their speech, regardless of whether that speech has money attached or not.If the government is deciding which speech is political, then that is going to be an issue, and there are very few circumstances in which such a power can be legitimately granted.It doesnt actually prevent any ban on creating media.

In limited circumstances, this may pass strict scrutiny.The only scenario I can see a politician fitting this rule would be, If a politician owns an entire Cable provider, TV network, ISP, Mobile Carrier, an online advertising platform like Google ad sense, then they can broadcast themselves using the communication means they control without using the funding of someone else and directly costing $0.

The BRCA doesnt prevent creation of media or political speech. This is referring to funding and creating mass donations to fund such speech. If you want to make political speech out of your own personal finances and personal property without donations from another interest group or produce political advertising that costs indirectly $0, go figure. Cash is not speech and shall not be treated as such.3. It doesnt actually prevent any ban on creating media. The broadcasting thing refers to PAYING people to air it on demand. In a world where the 2010 case never was held. Paying for services is not free speech. The only scenario I can see a politician fitting this rule would be, If a politician owns an entire Cable provider, TV network, ISP, Mobile Carrier, an online advertising platform like Google ad sense, then they can broadcast themselves using the communication means they control without using the funding of someone else and directly costing $0. Which is a rare scenario of a politician using the means to advertise themselves without paying. If Donald Trump and his personal team wants to make out all the ads, go for it. If he wants to use his own wealth to pay for legal fees? Fine. If he got his own personal money to pay for things without someone else paying for it. Good. This bill and ruling is about FUNDING of political speech, not political speech itself. You want to make political speech in the 30 days period before the election costing $0? Good go ahead.

What else do you think broadcasting and electioneering means?The BCRA defines campaign contributions in several provisions such as hard money, soft money, and broadcasting.Okay, please go on. In fact, you should probably stop reading about the BCRA and start reading about *Citizens United*, since you seem to be under the false impression that *Citizens United* overturned all of the BCRA.Here is the simple wiki summary:The majority held that the prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act violated the First Amendment.And this is just obviously true. The government has no legitimate power to define what speech constitutes a campaign contribution by a non-party entity. Disney does not have to register as a lobbyist if it wants to create media featuring gay individuals just because some conservatives might view that as a pro-Democrat agenda. These are the kind of decisions the government was making under BCRA, and the 1st Amendment specifically guards against that.Quit your fucking bad faith and actually respond to an argument being made instead of a strawman.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Excerpt from the review of a new Australian crime series:We see a uniformed (male) police officer with a non-regulation hair cut.

This meant my husband, as a essential worker could not leave work to see his dad on the ~10 days he possibly could have. His dad was randomly diagnosed with cancer, with a decent prognosis. No one was allowed to drive him to appointments. It had to be done via their medical transportation contacts and no visitors allowed during the appointment itself.

With more capital, the right person could push that capital further.Whatever you think of Elon Musk for example, affordable electric cars, neurolink to cure diseases, and innovation in space flight could all be considered noble goals that are in the national interest.Would you ever consider changing your position to \\"no single person should have a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars... if they make any of that wealth at the expense of others, and the expense of the nation?\\"Because redistribution isn't the answer.

In most cases, a billionaires net worth is based on capitalisation, which is make believe value that the market accept as truth. Their real wealth lies in using that make believe wealth as leverage.Elon Musk didnt pay for Twitter shares out of his own pocket. He gathered a pool of investors that were willing to put money based on the expectation that he could back his own money. So in some cases, the leverage is bigger than the billionaires net worth, and you cant really put a number on leverage, which is actually what we should put a cap on, if it came to that.Furthermore, even the nominal net worth keeps flux day by day. Say the billionaire owns 5 properties around the world and shares in a publicly traded company. Those amounts have to be revised on a daily basis, based on how the shares perform on the stock exchange or based on how the real estate market changes.____When it comes to redistributing that wealth, I think that tax on consumption, incremental tax brackets, tax on capital gains and tax on inheritance above a certain amount should be applied.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"doesn't feel very awesomefeels like we gave the worst people in the nation near-unfettered power","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"My mom was adopted so Im bias here.

Are you saying, capitalism and exploitation are a necessary evil to survive and that without it, costs would go up?If so, this is exactly my point. Capitalism is a belief system like any other and it espouses a certain set of values. One of them is that we excessively fixate on the idea of price, whilst ignoring other important considerations. This happens both on the consumer and producer side. There is a great case study of a nursery that wanted to eliminate parent tardiness by introducing a new late fee, however they found that the problem worsened as the moral obligation to arrive on time became obscured by the new price - commodification can lead to unintuitive and undesirable distortions.Also my example of ethical egg farmers being priced out of the market still stands. They are driven out of business because of the profit maximising behaviour of other firms, where considerations of the environment, exploitative behaviours, and other externalities are not priced in. Unconstrained capitalism does not do enough to address these problems, in fact the opposite is encouraged, and more ethical options will always suffer. Also youre assuming that most people can freely choose what they want to consume which is not true. Most have to budget according to their salaries. For example, people recognising that junk food is bad, but will still limit fruit and veg consumption because it is expensive.You seem to have the attitude that everything can be reduced to the economic argument of input costs and prices - to the point that youre willing to accept the exploitation of people and animals as inevitable - but human societies can be motivated by other things and have done so in the past.This can be religion, honour, survival, artistic expression, leisure, subservience etc. Theres no right or wrong here, but your argument is implicitly suggesting that having more (consumption) at any cost is always better - just another value of capitalism.Im not making grand claims to overhaul capitalism or saying that one system is better than the other, but my original post called out that capitalism can be unnecessarily cruel and we should recognise it for its faults. I do believe that if you give people time, space and resources, they could make other, more informed choices. This is not to say wed all suddenly become vegan.Also to address your points. It was the use of fertilisers and the mechanisation of farming that boosted agriculture. Yes, exploitation is not exclusive to capitalism but not sure what point youre trying to make here. The small villages argument was an example which was not meant to be taken too literally. Youre also making arguments about socialism, which you seem to suggest is the antithesis of capitalism, but I never alluded to socialism in the first place.","title":"CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing"},{"text":"What, is he posting edgy atheist stuff?

It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up \\"true shooting percentage\\" or \\"win shares\\" I know they know nothing about basketball.Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever.

They even shouted anti-Christian remarks in parliament. Then, in the mid-1990s, they noticed a gap on the political right, so Orbn began steering Fidesz in that direction, though their anti-Russian stance remained intact. Until 2009, Orbn was one of Russias loudest critics in all of Europe.  But in 2009, when it became clear that Orbn and his party were going to win the 2010 election, Putin requested a meeting with him. After that meeting, the critical rhetoric against Russia disappeared.  In 2010, Orbn won the election and, with the help of EU and state funds, quickly turned his family and friends into billionaires. These billionaires acquired the two largest online news portals, the biggest TV channel, all regional daily newspapers, 90% of radio stations, and all billboard advertising spaces in the country. Through these channels, they broadcast Russian propaganda.  Today, Orbn is Putins biggest defender in all of Europe.

For me at least, one of them should have been when Eastern-European ambassadors (but especially from the Baltics) started raising concerns.For this, three key reasons stick out to me.1. These nations are very much in with the US, ride or die. They don't have the Western European factionalism or desire to be a key power-broker in the EU at the expense of other nations. They want to not-die to Russian aggression, first and foremost. So there's rather reduced concerns for \\"secondary motives\\" compared to say, Western European diplomacy, or internal Dem power brokers.\\n1. These nations care about more than just US military power and are much more tied to Pax Americana in general. They understand the capacity for Russian/Chinese hybrid warfare and disinformation better than most, as they've copped it from Russia before. So to them, their concern over Biden's mental faculties is as much about their commitment to overall US support over the long-term as it is a \\"proper\\" shooting war.\\n1. They're in a position where they'd just about take anything over Trump. So if they are saying Biden's condition scares them, a pretty high threshold of concern had to have been reached.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"People aren't pretending it didn't happen, the world has just moved on, which is sadly always what happens with every disaster.

Its usually from a place of\\nHoarding wealth, as youve already stated you would like to redistribute their wealth.Wealth is not a fixed amount. Wealth is created and lost. The issue is no one who is significantly wealthy, think millionaire, has their money in a Scrooge McDuck style vault. That money is invested in the economy. Its what businesses use as capital. Its what drives growth and innovation. Its why we have more wealth today, and not the same amount as yesterday.What you are asking to do is tax or simply appropriate unrealized earning gains and assets. People with businesses would have to sell significant portions of their businesses to pay those taxes. Money would bleed out of the system, the economy would stagnate and then slowly collapse.Most of the companies we have today would quickly cease to exist, and everyones retirement and investments tied to the economy would dwindle to a fraction of what it is now. Because not only can no one afford to own such businesses, but no one has the money to buy them. So the market is now a race to the bottom.Finally the government is probably the worst entity at resource allocation on the planet. No government on earth has been able to manage a market more effectively than the free market. People who are wealthy are typically at the absolute pinnacle of resource allocation management. People like Warren Buffett.

Those people usually work under companies and those companies develop a system of arrangement of human and non-human resources that brings together the work done by those thousands of people. They act as parts of a machine, parts of a system and the sum will always be greater than the parts.

There isnt anything inherently wrong with wealth inequality either - if we lived in a world where everyones needs are met, and some are richer than others, no problem right? So the issue isnt the mere fact of being extremely wealthy.The practical question is more pertinent, since we dont live in a society where everyones needs are met (though its worth noting that as a whole were doing better than at any time in history). What happens if we prevent people from owning more than a billion dollars? It means that anyone with capital over a billion will prioritize safe assets over risky ones. Why would you invest in a medical startup when you cant legally make more money anyway? Hell, why invest in even a safe index fund that still fluctuates over time? Better to prioritize an asset that is guaranteed not to lose money, like government bonds.Essentially, youd be removing a huge amount of capital that any company with a nonzero risk level uses to fund expansion (jobs) and research. A wealth cap means that less money gets funneled into risk taking, which is the heartbeat of innovation.

Although some remnants remain such as certain unexplained architecture that sometimes gets attributed to things like \\"Tartaria\\".[This Guy](https://youtu.be/AciFWtSu-2s?si=lybpJw2fT7_lzg9H) gives a pretty compelling entry level course into the eschatology if you find it interesting. In my experience and through debate/conversation with futurists, this eschatology is more supported by scripture and requires way less mental gymnastics and interpretation of scripture.","title":"what's going on and what does covid have to do with it?"},{"text":"It's one of these things which sound good in theory, but in practice gets quite complicated. Consider Jeff Bezos for example. The vast majority of his wealth is in the form of Amazon shares. Through his efforts and leadership as CEO, Amazon grew up to be worth much more than a billion dollars. So in fact what you are saying is that we should be taking Jeff Bezos's shares away from him. Otherwise I don't know how you want to achieve this. But how do we actually do this?We can put a wealth tax that is so prohibitively high around the 1 billion dollar mark, that it will force billionaires to sell to be able to afford the tax. Something so insanely high that their capital gains can't pay for it. The problem with that is that [wealth taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax?wprov=sfla1) have a lot of problems, capital flight, tax avoidance, valuation issues, deadweight loss, etc. So much so that most countries that adopted a capital gains tax ended up abandoning it. All these problems will be exacerbated by the tax being extremely high. Jeff Bezos would already be moving to Switzerland or whatever in order to not pay the tax.You can say the government should just seize their property, but that is highly unconstitutional and very dangerous government overreach. Otherwise, you're pretty much out of options.But let's say you successfully got Jeff to stay in the US but still sell most of his Amazon shares. What now? The government shouldn't have any business owning Amazon shares. Governments tend to inefficient at running companies, especially when the government has no business running these companies. So in reality, the only other people who can realistically be good stewards of Amazon stock and make sure the company stays profitable are other rich people and financial institutions. Hardly a better choice than Jeff.So why not go for the much more sensible option? Tax billionaires on their income, not on their wealth. There's nothing wrong with Jeff Bezos owning a huge company, what's wrong is that by doing so, he earns absurd amounts of money that he spends on mega yachts or whatever while others live in poverty. The problem is the money that he gets to spend, not the fact that he has some stocks that are worth a lot.Now while taxing billionaires highly on their income is something that I believe should be done, I just want to highlight that this is still quite difficult, for several reasons:- Billionaires are highly mobile people. If you put the tax to high, they'll just move somewhere else, and you lose all that tax revenue.\\n- Billionaires employ all kinds of tricks to avoid paying taxes. It's very important to not leave any loopholes.That being said, income taxes are significantly harder to avoid or escape than wealth taxes, which is why that should be the way to go","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"The ACA definitely saved my life and I will always appreciate Obama and everyone sticking with it through all the opposition bullshit.\\nI don't have kids but I am absolutely with you on hoping the scales balance out some time soon.

There is a distinction between \\"wealth\\" and \\"money\\". Most \\"wealth\\" of the ultra-rich is tied up in speculative assets and what are known as \\"capital goods\\". The first, you have things like real estate, or stocks. The second, \\"tangible assets\\" used in the production of consumer goods. This can be things like buildings, machinery, vehicles, equipment, etc. Further, the statistics are misleading because they deliberately leave out real assets people own but don't get thrown into the equation. Their vehicles don't count. The \\\\~$30k my family spent recently on home appliances don't count. So it makes the lower classes pile look smaller than it actually is.I don't have some great answer for how a redistribution would work, however, I don't necessarily think this should be a reason to not do it.Now that we've established that most of this wealth is tied up in speculative assets and capital goods, we can address the issue of redistribution. How does one redistribute real estate? How does one redistribute a single share of stock? The answer is, you can't. You can't cut up a building and give it to people. So then the question becomes, can you liquidate it, and then redistribute the proceeds? This might work when you're confiscating a criminal's assets and selling them at auction to recover some of the money to pay for overhead/restitution -- but realistically in this widescale \\"redistribution scheme\\" it would never work. The overhead costs would eat away at the proceeds. Liquidating speculative assets would also reduce the value of them. You can't sell 30% of a company overnight and expect to recover 100% of it's speculative value. Even if you could, who would you sell it to? If all the rich people are having their assets seized, who's the buyer? I take the position that no individual should possess more than 1 billion dollars.This typically stems from the idea that \\"wealth\\" is one big pie and the rich are hoarding too much of it. This is objectively wrong. Wealth is *created*. Take Musk for example. He didn't just go out and *take* something. He went out and created something. In order for him to be this wildly rich, he had to build the world's most successful car company. So, he had to basically serve the public with something they wanted. In that process, he's employed hundreds of thousands of people at any give time, directly (millions in total). And multi-millions indirectly (all of Tesla's suppliers, vendors who rely on the company for business). Who is poor because of Musk's success? How does the speculative valuation of his Tesla ownership make anyone poor or more poor? The answer is, it doesn't. In fact, just the opposite. Next, what good would it do to penalize him by capping his success? Would Tesla be as successful if one he hit the $1B mark, he sold off, cashed out, and went sailing for the rest of his life? Would he risk his capital to start other companies like SpaceX or Neuralink if he has absolutely no financial benefit of doing so?I'll end with this fact: After Musk first hit billionaire status, he's went on (personally) to pay billions of dollars in income taxes. That's several times over, in taxes, than what you are arguing his wealth should have been limited to. So in your world the government would end up with less money to \\"redistribute\\" and use for whatever socialist pet projects they have in mind. So the math doesn't even support the idea that capping people at a billion is a net positive for anyone -- them, or the tax man.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"Oh yes lets just implement the democratic platform as a minority party while Trump follows the rules.

Both sides benefit. There are usually multiple options to choose from, and the one that solves the problem best or fulfills the desire best gets paid the most, because maximum people buy that solution. So it's naturally based on merit too.This is simply how businesses are built. You solve a problem and sell the solution.  People benefit from the solution you sell and they pay you in return.This process of selling a solution or fulfilling a desire is called value creation.The more number of people you create value for, and how much you create value for each person determines how much money you accumulate. You can either be directly involved in value creation (like being a business owner or employee) or you can be indirectly involved (like investors, that help these value creating businesses get money to solve problems better, and thus both the businesses and investors are rewarded).\\nNow, what this means is that the richest people in society are usually these high quality problem solvers either directly or indirectly (not talking about wealthy royals or people who obtain their wealth through illegal activities) and they made their money by solving problems for a lot of people. Their work usually benefits the people and people pay them back.Limiting the net worth of these individuals will de-incentivise them from solving more problems after that net worth limit is achieved. That's like saying the best engineer in the country is allowed to only build 10 bridges and no more, or the best scientist in the country is allowed to only publish 10 research papers and no more. \\nThis will only serve to waste their useful skills that everyone can benefit from.Also, you might say that people can become wealthy through inheritance too, but you cannot inherit from nothing. It is usually the people who solved problems through business and became wealthy that pass on their money to their children. I think it also serves as another incentive because if my family is not going to benefit from my work, there are chances that I might not put my best into the work I am doing and that's no good.","title":"CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars."},{"text":"Yeah but lets not forget presidential electionsWe can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time","title":"Forget presidential elections, lets talk about how you can be involved in change locally"},{"text":"I think you're right in principle.

It was some of the only escape or peace I ever got to feel and I only permitted myself to do it once a week and I was constantly made to feel guilty for endangering the lives of the people in my building, out on the street, and even inside the park where they had big signs with red arrows and the words \\"6 feet apart.\\" Everyone outside, the few people walking their dogs, they all had masks, they were all hundreds of feet apart but they never took them off. I wore a bandanna around my face and would pull it down whenever I got far enough away from anyone who could see me. I took deep breaths of the air and relished in the outdoors. Being always home, always crammed into an apartment with paper thin ceiling, floors, and walls with everyone inside the building always home. I heard their lives and involuntarily memorized their daily patterns. Everyday i thought the monotony would end, and every day it kept on stacking. I looked at my jogs in the park near my building as a religious escape from the prison that the city had become.When I was jogging, If I saw someone walking the opposite way on the path I quickly raised my mask back over my mouth and nose. Even with these hasty precautions, I was still made to feel like I was needlessly endangering people when they would sometimes look at me in a mix of fear and disgust as I jogged on by. I always took the stairs in and out of my apartment because there were people in my building who absolutely refused to ride the elevator with other people. Walking in and out of the building was like passing through a judgmental tribunal.  Those jogs were the best part of my existence from mid 2020 till beginning of 2022 when I finally managed to move out of the city. Pushed out for being a free thinker. A place I once heralded as a place of free thinking had quickly sunk itself into a snickering and overbearing, Orwellian, Kafkaesque nightmare. Yeah, of course I think about it a lot.

Most glaring example is Trump's bizarre antagonizing of NATO... NATO is the western world's defense against Putin and therefore a key asset to the US but Trump appears set on weakening NATO.Another example is Trump apparently preparing to end US support for Ukraine's defense against Putin. Again a position that for some reason is at odds with US interests but aligned with Putin's interests.In person Trump seems nervous and anxious of Putin and scared to challenge Putin. For example this is clearly seen in the video of the press conference after their 2018 meeting in Helsinki when Trump shocked everyone including his fellow conservatives by refusing to challenge Putin about Russian election meddling which had been confirmed by US intelligence and acknowledged by both Dem and Repub parties.","title":"Despite White House Pressure, 19 U.S. Senators Back Bernie Sanderss Bills to Block Arms Sales to Israel"},{"text":"Hell yeah, do you have a link to donate?","title":"I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.
