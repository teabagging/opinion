How does a simulated relationship, where the ai is telling you whatever you want to hear teach you to deal with people who have different opinions, see and understand the world differently? We will be more agitated because other people won't tell us what we want to hear and fully understand what we mean. There is already a problem of people trowing tantrums when a person behaves differently as them (like, i heard youth feel like they are being scolded when a person uses proper grammar and ends their text messages with a period ( . )).So a simulated relationship where the other side is constantly pleasing you will create an expectation that other people will please you. And then you will get devastated when other people won't please you as they have their own opinions and thoughts about stuff that aren't the same as yours. So people will be mad at each other because the other isn't pleasing them and telling them what they want to hear.Navigating different opinions, worldviews, expressions, people being their own persons, being rejected, people challenging your opinions and worldview are one of the most important social skills. And simulated companions with their people pleasing is doing the opposite of it. In a way they are dumbing you down socially.It can create anti-social people. So it is the opposite of a benefit for society.

The idea that women should not be allowed to testify against men (women inherently cannot be believed, due to their status as women) was enshrined into our legal system for centuries. It was literally written into the Magna Carta. The very idea of womens testimony having legal weight is a civil right that had to be fought for. So, even though now womens testimony legally/officially carries equal weight as a mans, functionally it still does not. And one of the reasons why SA is underreported is because reporting SA (unlike reporting simple assault or theft) opens you up to being personally interrogated.  Your character is immediately questioned, etc. If a man to testifies that another man had SAd him, wed probably think that something bad happened. Even if we were presuming the innocence of the accused, we dont immediately jump to the idea that hes a liar just out for attention and money. There isnt the frothing counter-accusations. Even when theres lots of money at stake, like the cases involving Kevin Spacey, the accusers arent household names that have had their character attacked by the armchair SA detectives in our media ecosystem. A civil court found that Spacey had *not* molested Rapp, yet I had to look up his name. Still, when 15 accusers step forward, the men *as a whole* are believed. The fact that there are 15 of them *means something.* They cant all just be dismissed.

Most are left-leaning, in fact. In fact I think a corollary to this issue is that when lonely men (some incels, some not really incels at all, all lonely) embrace right-wing politics, they are finding a sense of welcome community and fulfillment that they aren't getting from the progressive side of the nation. In a lot of cases, especially in more conservative parts of the country, they're even finding dating success when they move that way. I myself could go out this month and find a physically attractive and even fun/outdoorsy/somewhat intelligent girlfriend if I could stomach a relationship with a maga supporter. I'm not an incel by any means, but trying to date women whose values otherwise appear to align better with my own is certainly a more frustrating experience than it seems like it should be. One thing I've observed about more conservative or \\"traditional\\" women is that in many cases they really are more compassionate to the issues faced by men in their lives. I'm not sure what the underlying point here is. It might be that progressive women are too fixated on a sort of gender war and their notions of the patriarchy. There's certainly a sense at times as a cis-man of not really being seen as a real human with meaningful feelings or problems. Of course this can be seen sometimes from conservative women as well, and we all know that conservative men treat are more likely to give this treatment to any number of different groups, including women as a whole. Idk. The problem definitely isn't just about dating and romantic or sexual relationships, but those things are definitely a huge element. There are also a lot of social changes in general that can drive this loneliness. A lot is made of the age of social media and the internet and so on. We are able to exist in bubbles of our choosing to a great degree. We're able to cut people out of our lives who do as little as annoy us (or fail to tolerate out annoying traits). Political and economic factors interact with all of this, and one result is a growing divide along those lines, where the political sides are much less able to see eye-to-eye than they were in the past (at least back to the 90s, probably quite a bit further than that). Men and women are different, and respond differently to so many of these social changes. There's an argument to made that women are simply better adapted to sustain productive relationships (not just romantic, in fact I'm mainly talking about other types), find education/career success, and in general navigate the modern western world. Some of the strengths and weaknesses men tend toward are arguably outdated and make it harder to find a place. But at the end of the day, recognizing the issues men face and the gravity of the loneliness epidemic shouldn't be a hard ask. There's one thing you will often here that women want and need from partners and friends, that men are apparently poor at providing or understanding. And that thing is simple validation of their feelings and acknowledgment of their problems. We're taught that men are too dismissive or simply want to offer solutions and move on rather than validate the women in their lives. But the treatment of the issue of male loneliness exposes just as great a failure of women on exactly the same front. It seems to me that women and men are each okay at validating others of the same gender (and of the same social status in general). But they are both worse at doing so for others more different from themselves, including of another gender and/or sex. Which ultimately goes to OP's original point: women often do very poorly to even the idea that this epidemic deserves serious consideration or investigation, and this response is only going to push disenfranchised men further into unhealthy places. On a historical tangent: large numbers of single, disenfranchised men is an indicator for major societal problems and upheaval. One lens of viewing history is that directing the energy of this portion of the population is a main concern in politics, and often the successful solution is to throw them into wars or find other ways to spend their lives and frustrated energy to political advantage and keep them from upsetting the social order. I don't have any solutions to anything, but no matter how you cut it, it's a problem, and I don't think it's on course to resolve itself or fade away.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Well, both of those are wrong, the person who swung the election is trying to get us to Mars, and refusal to care about such things and stem illegal immigration is one of the other major causes for said election result.

For example on lack of toughness on crime that progressives push that impact voters in urban areas, which probably had an effect on Philly and Detroit and Milwaukee turnout crashing which led to Trump (barely) winning their states. Sadly, immigration looks lost now though I have a feeling the deportations being extreme and publicized might change the tune there (though we shall see if the media even reports on it this time around). But that doesn't mean and shouldn't mean throwing away all the socially liberal stances that the base will support Dems for. Like I get the vibe a lot want Democrats to just straight up stop running at all on abortion rights as an issue post this election, which to me would be stupid especially when future Republican candidates in 2026 and 2028 wouldn't be able to get away with supporting (or doing) unpopular things based on certain issues like Trump would. That and stepping back on trans rights just because of how one campaign weaponized it in one election. Don't go overboard in suddenly not supporting that due to one campaign, take an actual step back and analyze and find ways to not allow it to weaponize your campaign but don't use that as an excuse to stop supporting or minimizing supporting a cause your base supports. I think another comment below said it best: run on your policies being policies that support personal freedom and personal liberties. It'd be the one ideal way to fight back the \\"Dems support being the uppity and anti-fun\\" party which Trump and this current Republican apparatus was able to push, at least with young men. The Dems had the right idea on that with abortion rights, they just ran into the one Republican candidate who had teflon effect when it came to being attacked on abortion rights and other issues. 2026 Republican candidates for midterm and 2028 Republican Presidential candidates won't have that luxury (especially DeSantis or Kemp).

Most of the time, these posts just get more clicks from people who already agree with them, and they might even make some folks on the other side feel more confident in their views.But here's the thing: even if it doesn't directly sway voters, these posts are doing a few things behind the scenes. For one, they're keeping people informedespecially those who are already active in trying to make changes. They also help create a sense of community among like-minded individuals, which is super important for staying motivated.Plus, there's something to be said about raising awareness. When more people talk about an issue online, it can push it into the mainstream conversation, making it harder for leaders to ignore. It's not just about winning votes; it's about shaping the narrative and putting pressure on those in power. But here's where it gets tricky: relying solely on outrage posts isn't enough. Sure, they get people fired up, but what happens next? There needs to be more than just complaining onlinelike actually getting involved in local politics or supporting candidates who stand for the things you care about. And don't forget about those social media algorithms! They kind of herd us into bubbles where we only see content that matches our views. So even if you're posting something important, it might not reach the people who need to hear it most. All in all, while social media outrage has its place, it's just one piece of a bigger puzzle. To really make a difference, we need to pair online activism with real-world actions and smarter strategies to break through those bubbles.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Literally Trumps least controversial pick for any post, and the left wants Rubio out of Florida.

Now since most people have to meet online, men are put in a system where women get all the attention from guys and are vetting them, picking the most attractive, whether that be looks, status or finances, which leaves a majority of men struggling for little to no attention from women which leads to no dates. Then these men that arent participating at all in the dating world have to listen to women complain about men being so horrible, but the men these women are choosing are the ones pulling this behavior because a majority of men are simply struggling for any sort of attention which breeds resentment.At least you women can date and find men that are interested in you and can attempt to find a partner, I cant even get a match or a swipe and when I do, I still deal with the same ghosting or shallowness that you experience its basically complaining to someone that all the food tastes like shit, when you are choosing the food that youre eating, while the person you are complaining to is starving.I think the problem is that humans in general are not kind or respectful towards each other men or women.

Human reason reduced to its own resources is perfectly worthless, not only for creating but also for preserving any political or religious association, because it only produces disputes, and, to conduct himself well, man needs not problems but beliefs. His cradle should be surrounded by dogmas, and when his reason is awakened, it should find all his opinions ready-made, at least all those relating to his conduct. Nothing is so important to him as prejudices, Let us not take this word in a bad sense. It does not necessarily mean false ideas, but only, in the strict sense of the word, opinions adopted before any examination. Now these sorts of opinions are mans greatest need, the true elements of his happiness, and the Palladium of empires. Without them, there can be neither worship, nor morality, nor government. There must be a state religion just as there is a state policy; or, rather, religious and political dogmas must be merged and mingled together to form a complete common or national reason strong enough to repress the aberrations of individual reason, which of its nature is the mortal enemy of any association whatever because it produces only divergent opinions.All known nations have been happy and powerful to the extent that they have more faithfully obeyed this national reason, which is nothing other than the annihilation of individual dogmas and the absolute and general reign of national dogmas, that is to say, of useful prejudices. Let each man call upon his individual reason in the matter of religion, and immediately you will see the birth of an anarchy of belief or the annihilation of religious sovereignty. Likewise, if each man makes himself judge of the principles of government, you will at once see the birth of civil anarchy or the annihilation of political sovereignty. Government is a true religion: it has its dogmas, its mysteries, and its ministers. To annihilate it or submit it to the discussion of each individual is the same thing; it lives only through national reason, that is to say through political faith, which is a creed. Mans first need is that his nascent reason be curbed under this double yoke, that it be abased and lose itself in the national reason, so that it changes its individual existence into another common existence, just as a river that flows into the ocean always continues to exist in the mass of water, but without a name and without a distinct reality.D Joseph de Maistre,?[Against Rousseau: On the State of Nature and On the Sovereignty of the People](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3372480)","title":"CMV: People dont care about democracy as much as they like to say"},{"text":"Very few rapists even see court, let alone are convicted.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Because its not as catchy.

My frustration has led me to believe we need our own hard-hitting figure that can say f_ck you, is sharp and can bully back.This is absolutely correct. This has been the Democrats' biggest weakness from a strategic perspective for quite some time now. Most Democrats with any amount of leadership have been unwilling to treat the other side as enemies, even as the other side treats Democrats as enemies. This needs to change immediately. The kind of conciliation we see Democrats offer habitually should only be on the table when the other side makes concrete unilateral concessions toward conciliation of their own - and the fact that a part of you is laughing at that notion tells you exactly how likely that is without any kind of genuine red-blooded primal opposition from us. Progressive agenda needs to be thrown on the f_cking back burner for now because clearly overwhelming voters in America dgaf about pronouns when theyre digging deep in their pockets to meet milk, eggs and bread in the grocery line. We need to start collectively acting on housing, inflation, jobs and healthcare. The anti-capitalism discourse must be ejected from our party. Not a single peep on DEI until weve consolidated power. Once we do then we can start thinking about incorporating progressive ideas into legislation. It is so f_king insane to me that we failed to adapt our strategy to maintain our territory on minority voters.You're wrong about this. Not because I think protecting trans folks or overthrowing capitalism is somehow secretly a winning issue per se, but because of the nature of our coalition. Simply put, we are a coalition of different issue groups whose primary bond is the idea that moving forward on the issues of one of the groups will ultimately be beneficial for advancing the other groups. Each group only has the power it has because it has worked, however remotely, in concert with the others. As soon as you start pruning issue groups, you are literally pruning your manpower for the remaining groups. Furthermore, moving your ideology to meet the demands of the electorate is the precise opposite of fighting and demonstrating strength/willpower, which was the exact thing you were right about. It literally doesn't matter how out of step we are about trans folks - IF we are willing to say \\"to hell with all of you, this is right and you can't make us back down.\\" On top of that, jettisoning your beliefs to chase some middle ground does nothing to actually win new people - the people who found your old positions discomforting aren't going to feel reassured, they're just going to assume you're untrustworthy because you don't stand up for something. Plus, public opinion can be changed if someone actually stands up to lead it; the relationship between public opinion and a leader's positions doesn't have to only flow one way (as can be seen, for instance, with how quickly the other side has embraced militarism against our allies based on the mere suggestion of it by their new god). On anti-capitalism specifically, trying to jettison that is a losing issue because capitalism as practiced in the United States has, for all its past successes, clearly failed to meet *this particular* moment, and when the economic shit from Trump's policies hits the fan, having critics of capitalism within our tent pissing out will put us in a better position than having them outside the tent getting themselves killed trying to do a dumbass revolution on their own. It's also simply a fact that we need to make reforms that take power away from the large capitalist institutions in media - and that's easier to do with anti-capitalists backing your moves (or, at least, not fighting your moves), rather than opposing them. Besides, you're never going to rhetorically out-capitalist the current opposition, regardless of how fraudulent their pro-capitalist rhetoric is, and as mentioned before it's not like you'll win any trust by retreating from a position you were believed to have held (even if it's not the case that you held that position). But all that was just one thing you were wrong about. The other thing you're wrong about is more implicit: that you only need a political party with the right attitude. Our strategy *must* be bigger than that. We are going to need to conduct no less than medium-scale economic warfare. We need to organize general strikes and tax strikes. (Yes, I am saying that we need to get a critical mass of people to risk the wrath of the IRS. I know how nuts that sounds, but we're up against literal Nazis, so settle down please.) It may be necessary to organize covert societies, just like the days of liberal organizing under the heel of Metternich in 1848 or the Romanovs in the late 1800s. If Trump really invades Canada or Panama or another ally, we may need to be willing to attempt to physically stop military vehicles, knowing the risk to ourselves (but with the organization to have our comrades nearby, capturing the video in order to spread it widely). I realize some of this shit sounds like stuff out a movie, but that's kind of my point - We *must*, we *must must must*, think outside of the normal course of political activity. I can't guarantee that anything I've suggested above will be an ideal strategy, but it's at least a place to start the conversation. If we leave this to \\"normal politics but we say fuck more and compromise less\\" then we are effectively just assuming that the other side will be unwilling or unable to antidemocratically consolidate power in a new regime, and that's a fucking stupid bet to make.","title":"Dems need a strategy overhaul + sanity check?"},{"text":"It's probably because Israel did it","title":"President Trump has pardoned approximately 1500 January 6th political prisoners of the Biden era"},{"text":"So government needs to spend more for renting offices and spaces that the taxpayers will pay for?","title":"Trump Revokes Biden Orders, Ends Federal Work-From-Home Rules"},{"text":"Would be nice to learn what actual parents think of this not just read random over-politicized opinions from those without any children as dependents in their household","title":"Biden Administration Warns Against Forced Surgeries on Intersex Children in Historic Report"},{"text":"Umm..

But I think it turns people off the topic when every time it's mentioned, it's preceded by \\"nobody takes me seriously they think I'm an incel\\".  One of the common defining traits of an \\"incel\\" - the thing that separates an incel from a dude that simply has a hard time with women, is the constant woe-is-me complaining about how society is stacked against them and nobody takes them seriously.  And so when you start the conversation about male loneliness by specifically bringing up incels and lamenting how nobody wants to talk about the issue, you're just further reinforcing that stereotype.  Doubly so, in fact, because another common defining trait of incels is \\"being oblivious to the fact that they're doing incel shit\\".  I suppose I'm not actually challenging the OP, because I do actually agree that the vitriolic response does make things worse.  Certainly if people were willing to look past the incel warning signs and have an honest conversation it would go a long way toward helping the kinds of people who have this issue express their frustrations in a healthier way.  I guess my point is that by framing the topic the way you have, you've invited the vitriolic response yourself by playing right out of the \\"incel\\" playbook.  You could just as easily argue that women refusing to date incels \\"only makes things worse\\" too, but in that case, what is your proposed solution to that problem?","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"The sub is compromised its clear as day","title":"This is what you call hook, line and sinker America.

I don't find it disputeable that people forgo real relationships with distractions that are stimulating enough to occupy and distract them.

One is that theres [more genetic difference](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/161/1/269/6049925) *between* groups of black people than between black people and eurasians, so its already a bad category right out the gate.

I genuinely don't think so. Conservatism in Canada takes multiple forms. The English speaking conservative movement in recent years is very nearly the same as the American one, to the point where they actively closely follow Trump, just look at the Truck convoys. It doesn't help that Trudeau and Biden are fairly aligned politically. Yes, conservative candidates in Canada are not exactly the same as America, as the two countries are in a very different situation politically and economically (like most large countries), but I'd argue that the political left in America is far more reactionary than in Canada (for good reason, you guys don't have healthcare and a lot of social benefits we have here). In fact, the issues most Canadians have with American conservatives is social policy, such as the healthcare system, nothing to do with \\"unlawful\\" or \\"too conservative\\", However, I would make the point that American conservatism is practically the same as Canadian conservatism nowadays, and if you take into account the more liberal portions of Canada (basically Ontario and Quebec), you'd still get more or less the same results in the elections. Quebec votes Independent (Bloc) most elections since the early 90's, so I'm not sure how much of a liberal presence you'd have. The oil provinces in Canada are forking over huge amounts of money to sustain the larger cities in Ontario, Quebec, and the Eastern provinces, not to mention the immigration issue, or the deep unpopularity of the Liberal party.Overall it's a dumb scenario, as Canada and America are two different countries, and a lot of things makes the merge an impossibility. No joke, your government wanted to close the border between our two countries a few months ago because of the sheer amount of extremists that are now Canadian citizens and who successfully crossed.

The main type of identity that people had was what religion they were. The problem was, Catholics and Protestants lived very close to each other. As a result, when there were wars of religion they were impossibly bloody. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) was the most destructive conflict in history until World War 1 because the front line was everywhere.So they invented a better system. Nationalism. It didn't matter what religion you were, said nationalism. Your identity should be based on a shared bond with people in a whole country. That way, if you wanted to hate an out-group, at least they would be far away and you wouldn't encounter them very much. And indeed, when nationalism was enshrined into international law at the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), it led to a more peaceful Europe afterwards.Until it didn't. European nation-states, driven by national identities, could now form larger armies, and they waged war on people who weren't in their nation. Sure, the 18th and 19th century European wars were less bloody than the religion-based civil wars that happened in the 17th century, but they were still bad.Racism is a more universal idea than nationalism. It didn't matter what nation you were part of, said racism. The people in your neighbouring country had the same origin as you, so there was no need to fight them. This meant that the out-group who you were allowed to hate was much further away, and national armies were less likely to encounter them. These ideas probably helped with relations between Western European countries. For instance, France and Britain had hated each other for centuries, but they never went to war after 1815, as early ideas of racism took hold.The problem was that by this time globalisation was a thing, with European nations conquering people much further away on whole other continents. Racist ideas made things worse, as you correctly point out in your original post. And of course, not everybody living in the same country belonged to the same \\"race\\" so it led to persecution of immigrants and minorities, and then the most destructive war in history (World War 2).After which they invented the best system so far. The long peace after World War 2 was based on having not really having any identity at all, just rule of law. You were technically a part of a nation, but it didn't really mean anything outside of sporting events. You could have any identity you wanted, as long as you obeyed the rules of the government. This is much better than racism, which in this age of globalisation belongs in the dustbin of history.But the concept of race, while inherently harmful, is still better than the identities that came before it - pure nationalism &amp; religious wars.","title":"CMV: The Concept of Race is Inherently Harmful"},{"text":"You have a population of people with random variance.

Sure, the idea of race has definitely fueled some of the worst injustices in history. But dismissing race entirely ignores the important roles it plays in identity and social justice today.First off, many people find empowerment and community in their racial identity. Its a meaningful part of who they are, intertwined with culture, traditions, and shared experiences. By saying race is harmful, you might be dismissing these aspects which are very real and valuable to many folks.And when it comes to tackling systemic issues, ignoring race doesnt help. Acknowledging race helps highlight disparities that need addressing, like in education, healthcare, and the criminal justice system. The data often speaks for itself: disparities exist. Colorblindness can lead to ignoring these issues rather than solving them.Plus, racial categories are crucial in crafting policies aimed at reducing inequities. For instance, affirmative action and other reparative measures rely on understanding and acknowledging racial differences as they relate to historical and systemic inequalities. If we throw out the concept of race, how would we address these specific needs?Lastly, while you say theres no such thing as race, in a biological sense thats largely true. But race as a social construct is very real with tangible impacts. Dismantling the negatives associated with race doesnt mean getting rid of the concept entirelyit means redefining it to promote equality and justice.Totally understand the frustration with race being used negatively, but maybe consider how acknowledging it can be part of building a better, more equitable future.","title":"CMV: The Concept of Race is Inherently Harmful"},{"text":"Great timing ??","title":"This is what you call hook, line and sinker America.

Slavery, was never based on race, every single race has enslaved other races, and most races have been enslaved at some points themselves. The Romans enslaved many people of all sorts of different backgrounds, including those of African descent, and those of Anglo-Saxon descent. Slavery was a business that everyone capitalized on, you seem to focus your arguments on slavery towards the African enslavement in the Americas and Europe, but you make it sound like it was the fault of Europeans as a whole. This is wrong, nations in Africa simply had the largest and most effective slavery business, it is why slavery still exists in some parts of Africa. It is also why so many slaves were sent to the Americas and Europe, because they were the biggest purchasers of slaves. Do you think African nations enslaved other Africans because of their race? No, they did it because the other groups were weaker, and easy targets for exploitation. This doesnt even apply to just Africa, the Aztecs and other Native American tribes did so as well, they were all of the same descent, but enslaved the weaker ones. My point is, it was never based on race, it was based on who the easy target was. Next your argument on segregation, is also wrong. You seem to believe that skin color is the reason for it, but this is not true, it was primarily based on cultural differences. To put it simply, many close minded individuals had saw that X races culture and Y races culture just didnt mix well, so they created segregation, its why they called it separate but equal. Yes I will admit that in times of segregation(in America), African-Americans got the short end of the stick, but that didnt change the fact that there were also restaurants specifically for black individuals, and other businesses and groups specifically for what you call the other. Basically what Im saying is that white people couldnt drink from the black water fountain either. It was not a matter of skin color, it was a matter of cultural differences. This is why it wasnt just white discrimination against blacks, but also against Latinos, Jews, Eastern Europeans, and more and more.","title":"CMV: The Concept of Race is Inherently Harmful"},{"text":"it sounds like you've rearticulated the point by describing race with extra steps ... not that I can fault this version of the argument","title":"CMV: The Concept of Race is Inherently Harmful"},{"text":"There is no history of Trump\\nMaking things up to persecute his political rivals.

When someone breaks this unwritten rule, it creates uncertainty and forces other drivers to suddenly adjust their speed and position. That's both unsafe and inefficient.That's a matter of road design though. To road designers, understanding the drive to fairness is crucial as it allows them to channel good behaviour. As a driver though, it's very difficult to enforce this rule upon others. The best thing to do is to carry on following the rule behind the offending driver.Your approach basically rewards aggressive drivers and punishes courteous ones.This is precisely what I'd like to avoid. Honestly I'd agree with you if I thought honking made a difference, but the truth is that it doesn't. That's because people often honk when they're pissed off or when others are in their way when they're trying to do the wrong thing. There's no real way to express the difference when on the road. The study I provided relates to how expressing the drive to fairness can generate road rage.  \\n  \\nWhen I cycle, on the other hand, I am very different. I react with aggressive indignation when someone puts me in danger. That's because I have a broader range of gestures available to express my indignation, and because it's much clearer when a driver is bullying a cyclist.

Claiming there's a problem and then saying nothing is a problem in itself tbh.I'm pretty far left leaning so if anyone does not address the corruption and one sidedness of capitalism and claims they are a democrat, they aren't any better than the conservatives they condemn. They claim conservative manipulate through fear, yet they manipulate the highly emotional and talk of issues and then do nothing about it until its too late, or not at all.Anyone who further divides people aren't our friends, as anyone here knows. Its a constant pull until one side wins, yet both are pumped up through super pacs and claim to try and fix our issues (citizens united could have been worked to be reversed so many times, yet all we got was abortion reversed), yet they're paid by people who created our issues.In my eyes, this is what done against us on a daily basis to a point where it feels like a game.  Specifically?The mass wealth inequality, mass ideological subversion, fueling wars that encourage genocide, constantly undermining human value for profit (like encouraging an abysmal healthcare system), creating education that encourages dogmatic thinking towards America, pitting people against each other every cycle that further takes advantage of those who are susceptible to authoritarianism and those who lack critical thinking skills, helping to push propaganda through news cycles that don't address real issues, supporting the imperialism of America itself and other like minded countries, not addressing homelessness, the constant back and fourth on climate change and not pushing harder on laws that uphold our stances on climate change, destroying people who speak out against the danger of capitalism and also staging coups in countries that don't uphold the corruption of capitalism (I.e the 2009 coup of Honduras, my home country, under the presidency of obama, don't even get me started on other countries they've done this to), allowing countries to heavily influence our ideologies and doing nothing about it (remember all those youtubers and influencers who were proven to have received money from Russia and then... nothing?).Just a couple of reasons I, personally, don't see much difference between democrats and republicans.

Even the current vice president admitted the \\"immigrants eating our pets\\" thing was a lie but people on the right loved and it worked for them.And regardless, no matter how wrong you feel democrats went about the campaign, they accepted the results and participated in a peaceful transition of power, which is the most important test of your belief in democracy. And it's one that the other side fails. They failed it the last time they lost and were already saying they would fail it if they lost this time.I don't know what democrats would think of a Trump assassination but it's worth pointing out that the guy who actually took a shot at him this summer was a republican.

The problem was Bidens decision to widely stop using both detention and credible fear interviews for people crossing the border. I personally believe the lack of CFIs was as issue if available manpower - which itself could be an argument in favor of detention, in that people should perhaps be held in custody while they wait for a process to play out.Between Title 42 and the recent-ish 1,500 people per day executive order (cant recall the name), it actually was catch and release at the border, to the tune of well over a million people. Thats not misinformation. The truth of the matter is that some of these folks have experienced persecution and merit humanitarian relief, but significant amounts do have non-meritorious or frivolous claims. The immigration court dockets have now exploded with cases (over 5 years to a final adjudication in some cities), and the majority of migrants will bomb and lose when that day comes. So IMO its not so much an issue with asylum law - the current mess is all due to law enforcement decisions.And also, we desperately need more immigration judges, ICE attorneys, and USCIS asylum officers. Its been the case for a while that Congress needs to flush the DOJ and DHS with cash to properly handle the migrant crisis.

For most of the Biden administration, Remain in Mexico was kept in place (more on that in a moment). But even after that ended, most asylum seekers did still either end up in detention or were swiftly deported for not having solid enough claims.Second, the alternative to residing in the US is Remain in Mexico. While this policy was in effect, asylum seekers were targeted by criminal syndicates along the Mexican border. There was widespread crime, rape, and murder, which then caused people waiting for their asylum adjutication to just give up and pursue illegal immigration.Remain in Mexico is not the answer. The answer is comprehensive immigration reform and actually devoting the resources to our immigration system so that there is not a backlog of asylum cases in the first place. However, Republicans have refused to allow any such reforms...so we now have this mess.And Trump suspending CBP One is about to make it all a whole lot worse.","title":"Trump ends CBP One, a Biden-era border app that gave legal entry to nearly 1 million migrants"},{"text":"Cause they die or end up fed in jail?","title":"Wild protest ahead of Trumps inauguration in Madison, Wisconsin.

There is no Male Loneliness Epidemic, if anything there is a 'Male Isolation Epidemic' because men are choosing to sequester themselves and blame women for it. Men with decent attributes and minds that aren't filled with woman-hating male-supremacy vitriol are not struggling to find partners or even **friends** but the men who only see women as either their date-able mommies or objects for carnal pleasure are only digging their graves deeper. They are only looking at the opposite sex for sex and then wondering why both women and men want nothing to do with them. This issue is that that group of men (nice guys on steroids, if you will) is getting bigger as their ideologies are easier to spread and are becoming almost normalized in certain spheres. Do I think those men deserve to be called insults even if some of them might be true? No. Do I think we need to concede on the issue even the slightest bit to feed into this delusion that despite their repeated issues making friends and/or finding romantic partners they 'couldn't possibly' be the common denominator and, thus, the problem? Absolutely not. These are just 'nice guys' taking it to extremes and calling them anything other than that is giving them way more credit than they deserve.

He made a lot of good criticisms of how the vote was collected.Unfortunately, every one of those criticisms were criticisms of Democracy itself. I don't know if he later realized what he had just denounced, but Dawkins problem with the Brexit vote basically amounted to his view not winning.People are told they have to praise Democracy and Freedom of Speech. And then they'll insist that their anti-Democratic or pro-censorship views aren't really... well... exactly what they are. And they'll believe it. Because they have Good Ideas. And Democracy and Freedom are also Good Ideas. And so they can't be at odds!People mouth the platitudes because they've never really thought about them. Too many people who believe in Democracy (or Representative Republics) and Freedom of Speech can't actually defend them as concepts.I've noticed a lot of the free speech right has been very pro Tik Tok ban. I'm open to the idea, as there are some legitimate concerns. But if you can't articulate why it's okay to violate your principles, or explain why this one exception won't become the norm, then you can't argue the case. It's been a lot of knee-jerk hatred of Tik Tok, and using the governmental hammer when we should simply be talking people out of using it, as it's bad for everyone. Or passing some general social media bill that addresses the harms of social media in general, even if it happens to affect Tik Tok more.shrug a bit off topic, but as the zeitgeist changes, and the people in power change, you start to see who has principles, and who was hiding behind them. Or... at least... who was sufficiently consumed by anger and fear that they forgot themselves.

But when we're talking about less densely populated cities, it's not as important as a robust metro transit system (for people living within 20-30km) and good local rail (for people withing 100-200km). Metro transport systems are usually handled by the municipalities so they do fine, but local rail is handled by the same people that do HSR, and they've been under constant pressure for decades to prioritize HSR to the detriment of their own financial health and local rail.  \\nSo when you live in Lyon, you have a train that goes to Paris every 25 minutes and takes 2 hours for 400km. If you want to go to Dijon that is 150km away, the train will still take 2 hours and you only have a train every hour. And if you want to go to Bourg-en-Bresse, which is only 70km away, it will still take you an hour, with trains spaced one hour apart. Going by car it would also take you one hour **from station to station** and you get to go anywhere and any time you want.  \\nSo the vast majority of people living within 100km of Lyon and potentially working there, will be 100% better served going there via cars, than via trains, which they do. And then this sub will demand congestion pricing and to ban cars from cities and wonder why it's unpopular. Simply because it would add 1-2 hours to someone's daily commute, cost them more and be unreliable due to the French rail propensity for strikes.The cost of High-Speed rail (270-320km/h) is anywhere between 4-10x the price per km of modern conventional trains (160-220km/h). The problem with France is that so much has been invested in HSR that most of our conventional rail network has not been modernized and runs at a maximum of 160km/h or even 120km/h (or 60km/h0 in especially worn out areas. In turn, this bad conventional rail offering drives up public clamour for HSR, even though a much cheaper modernization would satisfy local demand better.  \\nFor every km of HSR we build, we could renovate 4-10km of conventional rail to increase it's speed from &lt;160km/h to 200km/h. So we can increase the theoretical max speed half as much as HSV, but for 4-10x cheaper. We can keep the stations inside cities where they're well connected with existing urban networks, keep the cost down and maintain most of the serviced intermediary stations.For lines under 200-300km or if you have to stop every 50km HSR isn't really worth it.  \\nWhat you need is 2 big cities, distant of at least a few hundred kilometres with basically nothing in between. Paris-Lyon is the perfect poster child for this, the biggest and second biggest French cities, distant of 400km and with pretty much nothing in between. So you end up with a single stop at Le Creuzot (which most trains even skip) and a train that can go at 270-300km/h most of the way resulting in very real gains compared to a train going at 200km/h.But this is a fairly uncommon configuration, and having a HSR has become more of a prestige element for cities and a subject of political bickering between regional capitals, so local politician put pressure on the executive to get their lines approved as \\"projects of public utility\\" before any financial analysis is even done. And then they just keep ramming those projects through regardless of how many negative economic or ecological reviews they get from public accountability organs.","title":"Dutch liberal leader Jetten seeks to increase military spending to 3% GDP and establish the European Army.

Do you tell them to hit the gym and make a lot of money so that he has \\"more value\\" (the \\"personal responsibility\\" model)? Or do you introduce him/her to another friend of the opposite gender who is also looking for a relationship (the \\"we live in a community\\" model)?More and more it's the former, but historically people find love primarily through their social circles. If their social circles ain't social-circlin', then there's a fundamental problem with how we're interacting with the people we supposedly care about. I'll throw this out there to drive my point home: you are personally responsible for the happiness of your friends. Your friends are each personally responsible for your happiness. If you know they're single and looking, and you aren't helping them meet people in some capacity, you *are* a shitty friend. Accordingly, if your friends are not helping you meet people when you're single and looking then *they* are shitty friends. A huge problem right now is that *most* friends are shitty friends.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"You mean prisoners convicted of trespass, vandalism and asdault","title":"President Trump has pardoned approximately 1500 January 6th political prisoners of the Biden era"},{"text":"Dark Brandon FTW","title":"Biden commutes life sentence of Leonard Peltier, Native American activist imprisoned for almost 50 years"},{"text":"Tribe like behavior... yes, definitely.

Typically, the Fed aims for a rate of around 2% inflation.I don't quite see what mechanism would cause actual deflation. Inflation is currently at a relatively healthy 2.9%, but that still means prices are rising; for prices to drop, we'd need something very unusual to occur. Trump has promised to set high tariffs, which would typically increase inflation, not decrease it, as imported goods would become more expensive.That being said: in the event that grocery prices undergo a significant and long-lasting drop within the next year, and the economy otherwise stays strong for a couple years after that... I would likely be forced to admit that all the experts I've listened to are deeply, deeply wrong about how inflation works, and Trump or those in his orbit likely know something I don't.What seems much more likely is that inflation will stay around 2 or 3 percent, and that over time, grocery prices will continue to rise, but at a slow enough rate that consumers *feel* them to be less expensive. (E.g., maybe a gallon of milk goes up from $3 to $3.10 in a year, but meanwhile wages are rising at a slightly faster rate than that, so we all feel like milk is getting just a bit cheaper.)If that happens... I won't be surprised, and I won't give credit to Trump. Inflation already dropped to 3% on Biden's watch, so this would just be continuing the pattern that already started under Biden.One thing I *would* give Trump credit for: if he implements a policy that drastically decreases the rate at which home prices are increasing in the US, or the cost of a college education. I haven't seen a policy proposal from him that I think would do that, but that'd be pretty great.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Cry more","title":"TDS has morphed into EDS."},{"text":"The GOAT is back!!! ?","title":"As a former Democrat, what a beautiful day it is!!"},{"text":"Do Nazis usually yell about sharing their hearts while they salute?

But the men that are my friends are some of my best friends in the world.

But they're 100% not looking for friendship.And I think they're missing how fulfilling friendships are. Beyond having more male friends, having more friends in general. Having women in their lives that they don't want to have sex with is often not something that this type of man can't get on board with.

This is not a problem for women to solve. This is an issue that has come about due to the dissolution of male-oriented third spaces. Not to put on my old guy hat here, but i'm 42. When I was a teenager and in my early 20s, as a guy you did one of a handful of things with your free time:1. Team Sports - not for everyone but it was popular and guys made friends with each other there.2. Skating - this was huge. Lots of skater guys terrorizing the outdoor malls and encouraging the development of skate parks.3. Video games - Yep. Just like today. Difference was our internets sucked, and most games were couch coop. You wanted to kick your friends' asses in Tekken 2 or 'Dead or Alive', you sat on a couch together and did it.4. Nerd Games - I don't know how else to categorize it. D&amp;D, Magic the Gathering, and for my younger brothers' friend groups, pokemon. These things got teens together to do shit in person. There are probably others, but those were the ones i personally engaged in. I knew other guys who did boy scouts, or were in hunting/fishing clubs. One guy had some friends who flipped cars in one of their garages. They bought an old broke down clunker freshman year and fixed it as a hobby, then sold it to buy another clunker. They did this for years.You know what the common denominator of all of those activities was? Almost none of them included women. Sure there was the rare skater girl and the far more common skater groupies. You had women show up here or there in some activities, but they were just participants. This was something we did together as guys without women needing to enable it.That's what is missing today. Leave women out of it. It's not their problem to fix, and they have every right to get upset when someone tries to act like it is, or comes to them for sympathy when they're not doing anything to fix the problem.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"We had a senile pedophile 4 years before that, and we'll now have one 4 years after.

The more I read up on it, the more it looks like the Fed screwed up the first two prosecutions rather badly, so they dumped everything on this guy.  Their witness was coerced and ruled mentally incompetent.  The agents lied to get the conviction.  And they were white guys chasing natives around in the backwoods of Pine Ridge reservation where a bunch of natives had been murdered by white guys.  That's actually how the first two guys got not guilty verdicts, the FBI agents basically rolled up into the camping site which apparently is how several natives were recently killed.  They used a different set of legal tactics on Peltier, and managed to railroad him.  The witness who claimed she was there, couldn't have been but was admitted anyway over the defense's objections.  The judge on the trial and most experts think the case was sketchy at best.  So Peltier is 80 now, and in home confinement for the remainder of his life.

This is obviously not true. The Republicans have changed quite a lot in recent years and they would have no trouble adjusting to a new political situation in the future. I think point 2 is wrong because of this.You also just assert point 1 without any real evidence. (I know that people on the internet love to say tacky bullshit like \\"our right-wing is ACkshuALLY left of the Democrats.\\" But that's certainly not true in Canada, and is not even true anywhere in Europe either.) The only policy that is meaningfully left-wing in Canada is their healthcare system. It is administered at the provincial level with some federal funding and regulation. Because the Republicans tend to be happy with federalism, a very easy way for them to get conservative Canadians on their side is to substantially reduce federal involvement in healthcare. The new states could easily keep their healthcare systems mostly as they are. In fact, I think this is the biggest adjustment we would see in Republican politics. They would strive to push as many things down to the states as possible. eg. Abortion is currently a state level issue, and with Canadians joining American politics, that would definitely stay that way. So Abortion is a non-issue too.An issue you didn't mention is immigration. Canada is experiencing much worse immigration-related issues than America is. So in the last few years Canadians have become more anti-immigration than Americans. Immigration is the number one issue that is about to lead the Conservatives to their biggest parliamentary majority in Canadian history. Republicans would win way more Canadian votes that you are expecting.","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":"\\"I've taken the liberty of hiding a number of eggs around the office.

The real important story that happened since the Cold War is perhaps best illustrated by this Margaret Thatcher anecdote: in 2002, she was asked for her greatest achievement. She replied: \\"Tony Blair and New Labour. We forced our opponents to change their minds.\\"And guess what: she was right, that was indeed her greatest achievement.That's what happened throughout the West: the ideological takeover of the \\"left\\" by \\"social democrats\\" who had no substantial difference to their opponents across the aisle. And in order to maintain the pretense that they were different, they decided to focus their platform on cultural and identity issues while abandoning any challenge to economic or imperial power - reducing civil rights struggles to convenient diversions from questions of class and systemic change. It's not the left that's unpopular, it's this sanitized ersatz of it. Voting essentially became a choice between the same product with different packaging, the illusion of choice.Even more contemptible: candidates who emerged who were actually on the left, who wanted to drive actual substantial and meaningful change, were endlessly demonized with some of the most dishonest and disgusting tactics in politics. Jeremy Corbyn in the UK is a perfect example of this - smeared as a national security threat (and an antisemite) not just for his economic program but for questioning the wisdom of NATO expansion and opposing Western imperialism. In France we're currently seeing much the same playbook being applied on Jean-Luc Mlenchon.This ties back to the concept of \\"extreme center\\" described by thinkers such as Tariq Ali, Pierre Serna or Alain Deneault. A radicalized form of liberalism that presents itself as moderate and reasonable while actually taking extremist positions in defense of the status quo - whether through unwavering support for imperial adventures abroad or the suppression of democratic alternatives at home. This centrism is 'extreme' in how viciously it reacts to any genuine left-wing challenge to the established order, whether through media smear campaigns, lawfare, or the cynical weaponization of identity politics to defend both domestic inequality and imperial power.The irony and the situation we today find ourselves in is that this \\"extreme center,\\" in its zealous defense of neoliberal orthodoxy and its refusal to address fundamental economic grievances, ended up creating the very conditions of social instability and political polarization it claims to stand against. And, ultimately, the conditions of its demise as we're currently seeing throughout the West.The sad result though is that because the actual left has been so thoroughly demonized, legitimate popular anger and resentment largely get directed towards nihilistic movements that, far from solving our fundamental problems, channel these sentiments into scapegoating and division. These movements won't solve our fundamental problems - while they may break with certain aspects of neoliberal orthodoxy, they mostly offer the aesthetic of rebellion while dropping even the pretense of serving the common good.That's where we are: the victory of the 'extreme center' over the left has proven to be simultaneously absolute and self-defeating. Thatcher's boast about Blair might have been premature - her true legacy may not just have been making the left compatible with neoliberal economics, but creating a world where our only choice is between the plague and cholera.","title":"@RnaudBertrand None of these people are even remotely on the left.

It sucked. What sucks more is being raped. What sucks more than that is being raped and having no one believe you.I think it's very important to take a woman's (*or man's*) word for it, and to investigate things fully. We have a history of dismissing women as \\"histerical\\" and ignoring their claims, but it turns out far more women have experienced sexual assault than you would think. Thise who have grown up during/after the #MeToo movement may not understand this, but that movement has made a *huge* difference in the way we treat victims of sexual abuse. It's also very recent.Having said that, I have a friend was the primary suspect in a murder case. The way the media made a circus of things was incredible, exaggerating details and sometimes outright lying. In one case a paparazzi put a camera up her underaged sister's skirt to provoke outrage from the family, and dispite dozens of \\"reporters\\" being present the headline the next morning was: \\"Father of accused murderer attacks journalists\\". It is important not to believe everything you read, even if it seemingly comes from a credible source. If the court case calls them innocent you should imagine there was information that the public didn't see. In the end the actual murderer was caught and my friend was exonerated.I agree that we shouldn't take everything we read online as gospel. Someone being accused is not the same as someone being convicted, and it's very easy to lose the trial of public opinion. However as far as public discourse goes, I would rather people defend rape victims than acxused rapists. The conversation itself sets the tone for how this concept will be treated, and if we spend all our time focusing on \\"those poor men who have been falsely accused\\" we will neglect our responsibility to the actual victims. And I say this as one of those \\"poor men\\".The fact that this is the second post *Today* where I have said this shows either that we have a false flag operarion of some kind going on, or that people's priorities are more concerned protecting potentially-innocent men from a potential-wrongdoing than about protecting actually-innocent women from actual-wrongdoing.The number of sexual assaults is higher than you think. The number of false accusations is lower than you think. Yes, be sceptical if you don't know all the facts, but don't dismiss women's safety issues. We're talking about this so much now because ~10 years ago we were ignoring it. Don't amplify the voice of those who wish to continue ignoring sexual violence (*or any violence*).","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"It's definitely bots.

Ive seen it myself with my own family members who didnt even vote for Trump, but were pressed on views that were aligned with his. It was clearly motivated by things like being around certain people and living a certain lifestyle. These people could get forced into schooling for several years against their will with everything they say and do watched and controlled, North Korea style propaganda, torture by CIA methods, and more and they would still never change their minds. They respond to group things which were influenced by the right wing gas-lighting of covid-19 precautions. This was utilized not just for that, but also various other policy positions as well. Easier and unquestionable to them as they made themselves the cool person authority to these people. With their experiences,it will never change even if they are proven wrong in front of their eyes. Fox news and others can simply either shift blame and/or reframe everything that is happening as varieties like untrue and a good thing. Said cool person authority cant be done by anyone else due to their experiences along with motivations and biases driven by reasons that either drove them to vote ad they did or were already voting as such to start with.Democrats should have caught on to right wingers trying this appeal as far back as 2015 to young generation Z online. Many people including various left wing YouTubers, warned them about this along with never addressing the claims and the lack of well grounded political education to sway people away from consuming and/or believing any of the mess Bannon, Trump, DeSantis, RFK Jr, and other throw rapidly. Democrats and others made these people off as cringy and old out of style religious stiffs who never could have that type of appeal. All while these people made these appeals quietly, conspiracy theorists also went in on it and gained more traction than they ever have, and they had quite a noticeable influence in the mid-2010s around Trumps election. Not many of these people, but was just enough along with an audience spread out enough with democrat apathy to allow Trump to win. This continues with some opposition until covid-19. Covid-19 causes chaos and makes Trump less popular while making people more somewhat conscious of what is happening and educated. But then, precautions were decided to be optional after Biden takes office and with this, the gas-lighting started. Wearing a mask and vaccinating was made to be seen as crazy and/or uncool, unnecessary, and/or fringe. People would listen to the other things these cool people who were right would say and take it at their word. Having enough education to understand some things, but not enough to understand the whole picture of what is going on. Making old regular appeals much more difficult to pull off and energy expensing. Something that already was such with Trumps campaign tactics from 2016 and 2020. Resulting in an election of mental exhaustion, hesitancy, confusion, apathy like 2016, mis-information, and mis-understanding of what they are even voting for. Resulting in various urban areas getting that right wing shift. Especially California where the propaganda was blasted the most with the state being used for mis-information while being mis-represented to both California residents and those who love outside California. Also mis-representing states like Texas and Florida as places of perfect paradise utopia that have no flaws and cant be criticized. Resulting in the biggest shift to the right. This attention is also noticeable with its concentration and with who it swayed as various rural areas saw a shift to the left with rural northeastern California being the only area that moved left in California.For what to do now, I dont think there is anything to do other than to leave what used to be the United States. If one wanted to change the land, the land would need to be conquered through war, have states leave the union, and/or taken. The world saw it with the January 6 coup with many doing it just for even being asked to wear a mask. After this with what they will deem as a perfect Christian utopia with a perfect leader who is to never be questioned, they would fight way harder to maintain it. Those types of people cant be reasoned with. They can only be defeated and forced to give concessions. Areas of the constitution and various legal previsions to the founding of various countries all over the world were specifically designed to keep people like Trump and these people away from power and keep them under control so they dont harm anyone. The United States or what it really is, the Confederate Emirate of Trumpistan, is the land where Trump and people like him can do whatever they want without any consequences. Trump proved it himself by defying the fourteenth amendment that automatically disqualifies him from being president. The harm to people who implemented covid-19 policies that were never reciprocated in punishment. Including actual killings. Anti-abortion killings to at least one doctor. Attempting to ban drag. Attempting to ban no fault divorce. The courts dismissing his prosecution for sex offending with false justifications. It is all about the land being theirs alone and for no one else. They complain about being disliked over political disagreements when they dislike and harm for far less reasons. Not counting the fact that political positions are valid to dislike people. Especially socially when said political positions are harming and even killing people. Frankly, this also goes to how many conservatives treat homeless, undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants, and for men, treat their families. They see it as all theirs to rule and decide on. Ironically more authoritarian than the left which they claim to be authoritarian and anti-freedom. Said people are also going to see themselves as the saviors of the union if land is being taken and/or having states leave the union. Said outcome also leading to war except a far worse war than the original civil war that devastated the South region and killed hundreds of thousands. Especially as the confederates would have the federal government this time with some of the most sophisticated military technology in human history. Specifically in Arizona, Montana, Nevada, and others which all went to Trump and would side with the Confederates. In winning said war without as much bloodshed and guarantee of victory, California, Canada, and Colorado and/or others would need to pull a Blitzkrieg to seize the weapons and defeat forces before the federal government would have time to act. For value of said posts, organization and communication. If one seeks mass migration outside the US, separate from the union, and/or to conquer the US in a war, social media is very effective. It is how some governments outside the US got changed and it even influenced this very election. Albeit for right wingers, one would need to go to places like X and facebook, reddit and other places are still good for education and organization. Definitely worth their usage for these changes. It is just that most of the time by the left, these are mis-used and/or not used as effectively ad they could be. One also cant expect instant change as it is like voting. Each one counts and with that, everyone has to play their part and contribute.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"looks like one of the cheneys who must not have gotten a pardon.","title":"Biden Justice Department tells court an acceptance of pardon is a confession of guilt."},{"text":"If you say you want to absorb a country that says no, what options are there?","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":"I've been having a shitty day (not due to politics) and this made me laugh.

Now one can think of it as one might, but looking at society, we rarely apply \\"innocent until proven guilty\\". If a kid in a class is \\"known\\" to bite pencils, others won't lend them theirs. If a family member is \\"known\\" to not pay back loans, others won't give them more money. There doesn't always need to be a court to determine legal guilt for us to be careful and I am of the opinion, that trying to apply \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" mainly benefits the perpetrator. Especially in crimes that are hard to prove. I don't think it's a coincidence that socially it's usually used when a women accused a man of SA, abuse or rape. While I agree that it is important for courts to hold that standard, history shows time and time again that women's lives are saved because they don't wait for a court to maybe confirm. \\nIf a man in your area is dangerous, chances are you heard it through the whisper network of other women warning each other. Often way before police did anything or before a court gave a verdict. Trying to silence those networks by shaming them because \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" mainly helps perpetrators. Does everybody need to decide how truthful those stories are? Sure. But holding the stance that warning each other of danger is inherently wrong? I don't think that's as helpful as it may seem. I also want to point out that I don't encourage any revenge or proactive violence based on stories that are meant to warn each other. They should be used to be more cautious, see red flags clearer and avoid harmful situations. For any punishment, there is the law that has the \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" standard.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"And the suffering of the 50,000 women and children killed?

Trump promised he'd share his long list of Biden crimes from the laptop, and he lied. Just like he kept vaguely gesturing at Hillary's sinister emails not being secured, which got someone shot. Trump lies, all the time. If Biden was corrupt voters would support charging him, not random family for personal drug use, people want to charge politicians with political crimes. Voters will stand by Biden, because Trump made it clear he will target Biden with false accusations.Trump profiting off the presidency, defrauding banks, not paying taxes, refusing to return top-secret documents, should result in consequences. Same if it was Biden. I see little hypocrisy on this. Democrats were compliant, they stuck to propriety, cooperating with countless hearings as Republicans accused Hillary &amp; Hunter of everything, the only evidenced crimes were her unsecured emails &amp; him lying on a gun registration.

No other major city in North America can claim a comparable feat: New York City increased its housing stock by only 30 per cent over the same period, and Los Angeles and San Francisco had similarly modest gainsEven basic research would have helped answered this question.

Just a quick google gives the number 2.5 for 2021.If we do that math they laid out (and take it entirely at face value) lets say in 1970 there were 1,000 homes. By 2020 they claim there are now 3,000 homes. In 1970, on average, those 1,000 homes would house 3,400 people. They claim this number has risen by 70% to 5,780 people. This would put the average household size at 1.93.It does not account for all of the difference but it gets us A LOT closer to making sense of reality. Since their stats are not sourced, my next guess would be that they are not comparing apples to apples, say for example, the boundaries of Vancouver changed between 1970 and present and more people or homes were included than should have been.More research could also likely look at average household size for BC or for Vancouver specifically. Also, my number of 2.5 for 2021's average household size is the average over all households not just urban. If I use the Canada average of 3.5 for 1971 in the above example, we get an average household size of 1.98, a little closer to our number of 2.5. I would also guess that there is an even bigger difference between downtown and suburban and we would see the average household size in Vancouver being below the 2.5 national average.And in fact, if I google \\"average number of people per household Vancouver\\" the AI thing tells me Vancouver's average is 2.1 and I would say we are now close enough to say case closed. If for example, their idea of the number of households tripling was only 2.8 then I am almost bang on.","title":"Canadian Housing Crisis More Than Just Supply And Demand"},{"text":"A whole bunch of crazy shit, that if said by a homeless guy at a bus station, would garner some glances, but when said by the president of the United States is very troubling and concerning","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":"Thought the same thing.

For example, climate change and its connection to human activity challenges the conservative position on deregulation and the protection of industries like fossil fuels.

I'm not going to get into the reasons for any sort of female loneliness epidemic in detail because that's not what the post is about. but i did think talking about and illustrating this is important. we have to remember that most fascists and extremists are still human. it makes them capable of great evil, of course, and it's not necessarily an excuse. but if we write off every member of those groups even tangentially associated with the bad stuff  inherently evil, it only furthers the divide. they made up the us vs them, but if you call them evil they get to point and shout and say \\"we were right\\". \\nannndd thanks for coming to my ted talk","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"I could be wrong, but I believe this nullifies their 5th Amendment right against self incrimination.

They will go on witch hunts. They will try to dig dirt. They will argue in bad faith. They will downplay any faults on their side. They will play dirty. They will pull all the strings.I see what you're trying to do here, but this is a \\"both sides\\" argument which once again doesn't actually consider both sides.Pointing out criminal or corrupt behavior is not a \\"witch hunt\\" if it's being done in the open and without remorse.    Because the person you wish to shield from culpability is obvious, lets change the tack.Mayor Eric Adams has complained about being the victim of a political \\"witch hunt.\\"  And yet, he's the one appointing his family members to highly paid government positions despite having no experience.  He's the one being caught demanding political favors for big donors, and the one who has very clearly been accepting bribes.  It's only a \\"witch hunt\\" if it isn't true, or if it's being done without a target.  An investigation into a pay to play scheme by the Turkish government isn't a witch hunt when we have Mr Adams flying first class on Turkish airlines all over the world for free.  Even holding up Mr Adams as an example is a perfect illustration of how your view should be changed.  When Democrats/liberals commit crimes or do something corrupt, they get held to task.  Not always: sometimes they get away with it, sometimes they don't get caught, sometimes the machinery of justice grinds too slowly, but there is at least a nominal desire on the part of one side of the political aisle to hold their own accountable.That simply doesn't exist on the right.  There is no attempt *at all* to hold the powerful to task.  Mr Trump, for example, was out there subverting the State Department for his own ends, and not only do his supporters not shudder at this, they turn around and *defend* it because \\"it's a witch hunt!\\"  He's clearly using the office of the Presidency to enrich himself and his family, and yet somehow that's okay because *he* claims that the Biden family is doing it, too (without evidence, naturally).  Do you not see the difference there?  Republicans/conservatives are out there, openly parading their misdeeds, and you're sitting here and saying \\"well it's okay because maybe Democrats do too.\\"They will even support shooting/killing someone who was democratically voted for because they feel that persons policies are a threat to the country. On the surface they will denounce it, but secretly they will support it.Such as who?  Again, I love that you have this super secret insight into the thoughts of millions of Americans in regards to an assassination attempt on Mr Trump, but when he comes right out and says we should be locking up or shooting people, that's no big deal.This kind of \\"whataboutism\\" is really pretty sickening.  And it is pretty uniquely found on the political right, which is what makes it even worse.  Al Franken took a picture of himself pretending to grab a woman's boobs and got run out of the Senate (and rightly so).  Matt Gaetz is a literal pedophile and was nominated to be the Attorney General.  If that doesn't change your view that both \\"sides\\" are not the same, then I doubt there is anything in the world that will","title":"CMV: People dont care about democracy as much as they like to say"},{"text":"Oh, those about to be deported will be joining them","title":"Migrants weep in Mexico as Trump admin cancels all appointments for Biden's CBP One app immediately after swearing in"},{"text":"Even after adding the 10 new states from Canada?","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":" If you think it will only be people you agree with doing so, I have a bridge to sell you.

Historically, one region (the Laurentian Corridor, Windsor through Quebec City) dominated all of Canadian politics, with about 80% of the votes in the House when the country was founded. It still has a bit over 50% of the votes, but the alliances finally shifted when the West grew enough in population.Canada's Conservatives represent an alliance of Western Canada and rural Ontario (along with an area around Quebec City), while the Liberals are concentrated in urban Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. The 905 belt around Toronto is the largest swing region, with the Vancouver area and Atlantic Provinces being the other main ones (rural Quebec is the Bloc).Canada is more left wing largely as a result of the Laurentian Corridor benefiting from a large centralized government, which has allowed it to use its voting power to profit off other provinces and control the country. The West has been the largest right wing area, as decentralized power has been the best way to counter the centralizing forces in Laurentian Canada. Rural Ontario joined the alliance largely because it also feels disenfranchised from a centralized government that primarily benefits the largest city centers.So, in a version of Canada that joins the US, does Ontario or Quebec still benefit from centralized power? Quebec certainly wouldn't, as being a French region in an overwhelmingly English country, it would be a small minority, and thus would prefer decentralized power. Realistically, there's no way Quebec would agree to join the US period, but theoretically, if it did, it would be joining as a state of its own, to protect its French culture.For Ontario, it would no longer have the economic and demographic heft it did in Canada, so it wouldn't benefit nearly as much from centralized power. Ontario is the biggest beneficiary of this. Unlike the US, Ottawa is not its own territory, so all public servants in Ottawa pay their taxes in Ontario, while Toronto is the center of Canadian finance, and would lose that position as part of the US, where NY is much larger.Ontario probably also wouldn't join the US for those reasons, and would demand statehood on the off-chance that it did.The West favours decentralization because it has spent 150+ years being dominated by Central Canada. But, in the US, it would probably be more of a swing state, and have the ability to make decisions to go either right or left, depending on what is being offered. Alberta is probably the most likely to actually consider joining the US, as its deal as a state would be so much better than it is in Canada (Alberta contributes more net taxes, minus expenditures, to Ottawa by a factor of 3+ than any other province, and more than twice what any state contributes to Washington by percentage of GDP), and would probably be a swing state.The whole picture has more parts, but I will run out of space if I discuss them all.The point is that Canada joining the US would likely result in each of the main parties adapting to a new voting base who would shift the power dynamic, and Canadian provinces adapting to a shifting power dynamic that makes centralized vs decentralized power more or less favourable to them than it has historically been.","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":"Time will tell, but I expect not.

You as an individual are not a court. Your analogy suggests that you are.  The poster asked if you or your family would still be friendly with someone who may have murdered someone. Your response suggests you should respond to that proposition as if you are the court itself - which can have a much higher standard of proof (beyond a reasonable doubt) in criminal matters. The comparison is not apt. The reason the court requires such a high standard for criminal issues because of the extraordinary power of the state to curtail someone's freedom requires certainty (to the extent it can be given). In your example however, the answer might still be yes. People have and will continue to be convicted of murder based on circumstantial evidence. Other legal contexts require a balance of probabilities (is it more or less likely). But you are not a court.  You are not taking away someones liberty. You are making an assessment based on interpersonal dynamics and limited evidence. Which is why you can, and should, weigh external factors when making a determination of who to believe and why. For example, general statistics about false accustation rates should be a factor. The impact on you believing someone or not believing them should be considered. Your own biases (as well as our cultural bias to not believe people who say they have been sexually assaulted) should be factored in. They may not be determinative but they should impact your assessment. When people say believe women they mean a lot of things - but what they generally mean is that sexual assault and harassment are not uncommon. The estimate is that between 1/4 and 1/3 women will be sexually assaulted in their life time. It is likely that people you know have been assaulted or will be assaulted. Given how often this happens when you hear of a friend or an acquaintance who has been sexually assaulted - the chance that it happened is high. That should factor into how you assess any given accusation of sexual assault.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"Lots of people forgot what he said","title":"Biden pardons his family in final minutes in office"},{"text":"So should Trump get no pardons, since his name isn't on the ballot next presidential elections?

The right's depiction of it is fodder for their own people, not something that liberals need to consider, unless they agree.The self-reflection I'm talking about is that people on the left need to decide if they've moved too far to the left to attract enough people to win elections. Or perhaps they just did a bad job picking who'd be their presidential nominee. I tend to think that the left has gone too far to attract the average American voter, but it might be that the left just picked a not particularly viable candidate this time. Perhaps they would have faired better if Biden had dropped out earlier and there was a chance to really vet replacements in a robust primary.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Please show me a video of Trump saying that.

The biggest issue with this idea is that a lot of men don't actually care about the issues you mentioned.* Secondary education? A lot of men nowadays think that college is overpriced woke garbage and that real men should rather learn a trade.* Circumcision? Well, when a bunch of Republican states banned gender affirming care for minors, they specifically included exemptions so parents could still circumcise their kids without consent. A lot of queer people showed up during these sessions and gave really passionate speeches against nearly every aspect of these laws. If lots of men supposedly care so much about involuntary circumcision (and yes, they absolutely should), where were they and why didn't they speak up?* Male rape? A lot of men would rather not be reminded that this is a thing at all and will openly mock you for bringing it up.* The Draft? Yes, plenty of people complain that it's unfair against men, but even more people regularly complain that it's unfair that women in the military have lower entry requirements, or that they aren't suited for combat and shouldn't be in the military at all. You kind of can't have it both ways at once.Let's be real, outside of a ratively small bubble of reddit MRAs, most men, and especially the kind of disenfranchised men who feel left alone by politics, don't really give a fuck about the topics you mentioned. You can't build a large populist base among men on these topics.In fact, the biggest political group that actually agrees with and cares about most of these things and would consistently vote in favor of issues like ending circumcision or better recognizing male rape, are probably those exact same woke feminists who supposedly already dominate politics. In fact, if you polled on the one hand feminists and on the other hand men who feel misrepresented by politics, I suspect that feminists would agree with what you said significantly more often than men.","title":"CMV: Both Political Parties should start campaigning under men's issues in order to make the male vote more of a competition."},{"text":"1. No, I'm saying that there is more competition for seats. Let's say that a college used to accept 1k students per year. They didn't just magically double their capacity when women started going to college. Essentially, what we are going through is a market correction. It seems temporary to me, and to the extent that it isn't temporary, it should be solved by simply expanding education across the board. It doesn't need to be a mens' issue.2. Well, assuming that you're referring to the United States, I practice in West Virginia, one of the most conservative states in the union. If it's reached here, it's everywhere.

I'm saying that your statistic of 100 deaths per year is essentially the bare minimum risk for any medical procedure, and shouldn't be treated as an authoritative reason to end the practice. Circumcision is already significantly in decline, and will likely die out on its' own, without government intervention.

We get all sorts of medical interventions as babies that we don't consent to. I agree that circumcision isn't ideal, but I also don't think that it's nearly as big a deal as it's portrayed in some circles. As for your figure of 100 babies dying each year from it, to put it in perspective, powered lawnmowers are responsible for 950 deaths per year, but nobody is all that concerned about it. That's a ridiculously small number.So you are saying that because not enough children are dying per year from circumcision, it's not an issue that should be solved?

Sometime in the late 50's, the rich decided that houses in my city would make perfectly fine investment properties and went on a decade long blockbusting campaign that just wiped out whole communities. People who lived in West Baltimore at the time really had no recourse- when you have money, you can buy a property and do what you please. We can argue about how effective the Fair Housing Act of 1968 really was but it was something- a legal tool that the average homeowner or maybe a not-terribly-wealthy city can wield against sleazy (and rich) investors. The other thing that working and middle class people compete with the rich for is political representation. Rich people got money. The can work directly with politicians through lobbying, they can buy news outlets and run stories that are sympathetic to their cause. There's always outright bribery.

The education gap is essentially the result of women getting access to post-secondary education where they didn't have it before; there are more candidates for fewer seats. The only way to completely reverse that would be to reinstate gender discrimination, which would itself be wrong. The better answer is to expand college and reform it so that it is much more widely accessible. We also need to end our obsession with \\"elite\\" colleges and universities, and rely more on our robust community college system. 2. As a former public defender myself, I can say that rape and violence against men is no longer treated less seriously. It is true that it often gets underreported, as those men don't want to admit that they were victims of violence or rape. But, that's a cultural issue, and not really something for government to deal with. From a legal standpoint, it has been thoroughly addressed.3. Babies have never had bodily autonomy. We get all sorts of medical interventions as babies that we don't consent to.

That's a ridiculously small number.4. It remains to be seen whether the draft would be constitutional if called into service again. I don't think that the gender gap would be. Regardless, I sincerely doubt that we will ever have a draft in the United States again, because war doesn't need untrained boots on the ground to the degree that it used to.Now, having addressed all of these, the real problem is that these issues are being championed *specifically for the purpose* of driving discontent and pushing men towards conservatives. These concerns don't really need to be addressed in a gendered way. But, even if they were, and even if a Democrat wanted to champion them, the so-called mens' rights activists would simply move on to the next thing that they don't think that they can get a Democrat to sign onto. To my mind, men's rights are not the goal, they are merely the means to an end. Because the goal is to push men towards Republicans, no level of campaigning or dedication on these issues will matter.","title":"CMV: Both Political Parties should start campaigning under men's issues in order to make the male vote more of a competition."},{"text":"You have addressed my personal argument but what about the second half?

Your issue seems to be more that those sorts of crimes against men are not prosecuted in the same way as against women. You're also having to take into account domestic violence there, which is statistically a higher chance to happen to women than men, though that gap is not what I'd have initially thought. Again, the age when circumcision happens for children in religions where it's a practice is a long standing religious practice. Yes, I don't personally agree with it but I don't think the stats support an overwhelming problem where the government needs to step in.

Its a goddam dictatorship led not by an individual but by the majority, and what the majority wants, goes - its what we see in the US for example, people over the world might disagree with trump policies but the ones that had the power to decide said otherwise. Democracy also means its easily manipulated, seeing how all you need to do is manipulate what the majority wants or believes. Something that, with the advent of publicly available internet, is so easily done its not even funny, plus we do that all the time anyway (just with different intent; advertisements anyone)?Id say what were seeing right now - the world over is but the consequences of general na?vet. Chickens coming home to roost. And all that rot. Because at a fundamental level, nobody wants to be told what to think. People dont like feeling manipulated. And in a democracy, they are nominally entitled to do something about that. Its not like theres this inherent feeling of helplessness quite the opposite. Theres not supposed to be one side of the aisle telling people what to do and think while the other side demonizes them for doing exactly that. Because doing so is no different from waging some private war using the common people as pawns. Whether we like it or not, were at a point where we need to rethink democracy too. At least our current understanding of it. Because right now, all democracy actually achieves is make people think they can affect the future. But almost nobody has all the information required to make an informed decision on where they actually do want to go. Or how to get there.

You'd have to change that perception first.I'm not a master of the justice system in the USA. But why can't their be sentencing minimums for specific crimes put into place? Men not having bodily autonomy - circumcision is a religious practice in many cases, and the government is separate (in theory at least) from legislating against religious procedures. Plus there's no guarantee it's going to sway men one way or the other; what about all the Jewish men who have had that done or have fathered children who they have had circumcised?I don't think it should be outright banned, I think it should be limited to a specific age where the child can consent on it.

Contrary to what many incels believe, women aren't just gifted a big community of friends that cares and loves and checks in on them on the basis of them being women.  We have to work for it too - we're just socialized to put in the work and emotionally support our friends more than men are.  If I put as much effort into my social life as the average man does, I'd be a lot lonelier.  The women I know (including myself) do all kinds of things to make and support deep/lasting friendships:  we plan events and dinners, we call and catch up frequently, we give thoughtful gifts or do random kind gestures, we're a shoulder to cry on when something bad happens, etc.  And when we're lonely, we work hard to make new friends - either through mutual friends, hobby groups, strengthening existing connections, etc.  Men, by and large, don't do this - at least not to the same extent.  For example, both myself and my brother just moved to a new city:  I'm sure from his perspective I have an instant community because I'm a woman, but the reality is that I'm putting in a ton of work he isn't doing.  To be fair to him, I also benefit from the work of the women around me, and I understand there are (changing!) social norms underlying this... but women can't change social dynamics of male: male interaction.  That's something they'll have to fix.   The solution is pretty clearly for men to put more effort into their relationships -- if all men did this, the loneliness epidemic would disappear overnight.  Instead though, they dig their heels in and advocate for the government \\"assigning them a woman\\" as the solution, so forgive us for responding with dismissal when they won't even take the first step to fix it themselves.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"but surely if they hadn't done anything they wouldn't have anything to worry about?Trump just got convicted on felony charges with credible evidence and people say it was a political prosecution and he hadn't done anything.
