The point of having US troops there is to keep US force projection in Europe intact.  That sort of thing erodes soft power.But Trump will look at it as \\"billions of dollars wasted on having a military presence where no one is paying us to be there\\".

These people--even though I'm vehemently against what they represent--are saying things people want to hear.  It is a sad state of affairs when the GRIFTERS are doing a better job at actually listening and communicating to a large portion of the voting demographic.You don't take your dogma and demand everybody heel which is precisely what the left has done.  Every issue is intensely moralised so if you disagree with certain components you are a BAD PERSON and squeezed out of conversation and spaces involving the left.  Unless you 'get with the program's you are labeled as ignorant problems.Maybe instead of dismissing people who think Joe Rogan has a point or Donald Trump makes some sense we should be thinking what LEGITIMATE concerns do they have that the left isn't addressing? Everybody here lives in a stupid echo chamber.  At a time when housing costs too much, food costs too much, school costs too much, health care costs too much the Democrats focus on inclusion, tolerance, and identity politics.  Yes, Democrats have plans for the economy but their messaging doesn't hammer this home.  It just doesn't.  Whether it is right or wrong anybody that isn't bleeding blue feels like the following type of words define Democrats: woke, moralising, inclusion, trans rights, dei, critical race theory, etc.That ISNT what embodies notions on the left but that's what people are feeling.  There was not enough strong, unapologetic messaging that focused on economic issues affecting EVERYONE.  The goal for the left for so long has been to build a strong coalition of minorities and special interests.  But the coalition isn't strong.  More and more of these minorities are moving to the right when voting.The Democrats and progressives have some serious work to do when it comes to discourse.  'Defund the police' is a perfect example of totally shit messaging.  Is re-allocating funding from typical policing duties to a broader apparatus that involves social workers and policy makers a great idea?  Yes!  Is this something that could improve communities, diversify the workforce and ease the burden on the state?  Yes!  So WHY was the choice to frame the conversation in the most inflammatory, ignorant way possible so when the average person hears it they think \\"we need the police word these guys are loons\\"?  WHY not frame the conversation in a way that gives space to suggest how this could actually be positive for police forces, small businesses and families?  Because people want to feel morally superior and righteous.","title":"Exist polls show voters think Kamala is too left wing compare to trump."},{"text":"Spoiler: he isnt","title":"Its Not Like There Werent Chances to Do This Differently Dearborn, Michigan, turned against Kamala Harris decisively.

Nor was it people like me that tried to build a militia to fight FEMA. So how is it people like me that caused the problem?This wasnt a scenario in my head. This is what was going on. And the threats that caused the evacuation were made were by a very real, very armed MAGA follower. Americans were still being helped. Just not as many through door to door efforts as some groups were making that dangerous. I had family members here from other parts of the country who are MAGA shortly after the hurricane. After the threats and fema having to suspend work in some areas, they were still believing that FEMA hadnt even been out there yet. Because that is the MAGA echo chamber.

Egan*.  They made it abundantly clear that classification and de-classification authority flows exclusively from POTUS and that any Congressional grant or mandate would be unconstitutional.Any de-classification procedure for POTUS is merely courtesy or theatrics. President Obama did create a Presidental declassification process, but it was by executive order. Its not a law (again, it would be unconstitutional even if it were).Its part of the reason the documents case was never going anywhere even if they somehow managed a conviction. Nevermind the more recent immunity ruling.But Drumpf held the documents as a civilian!all he needs to argue is that he gave himself permission to have those documents. That he de-classified them, whatever. *Egan* established that the President has *unlimited* declassification (and classification) power and that there is no formal de-classification process (for POTUS). Adding-in another layer; Given that classification and de-classification are absolutely within the purview of official acts, one could not charge him for de-classifying documents even if it was specifically for his civilian-self.While Im not privy to the details of his defense, I can guarantee this argument will come-up at least on-appeal.

At the same time the Democratic party gained control of the Senate (picking up three seats) and retained control of the House (with 3% vote margin over the Republicans).In 2024 Trump will probably end up with a bit under 78 million votes, with something like a 2 million vote lead over Kamala Harris (about half the percentage margin of 2020). The Republican Party gained control of the Senate (picking up 4 seats), and just about held onto the House (possibly losing a seat, maybe picking one up).I'm not sure which metric gives Donald Trump more of a mandate than Joe Biden in 2020. An extra seat in the Senate (v fewer seats in the House)? A slightly bigger margin of victory in the Electoral College (86 rather than 74) but with fewer votes, a smaller vote margin, and a smaller percentage lead?The main difference is that in 2020 the Republicans controlled the Supreme Court, and still do.

Your gas will be $1 because no one gives a fuck about gas when you have no job, no house, no retirement and no money after your president destroyed the economy. Your imports will be taxed at 50-200% and everything you buy will have a 50-200% price increase added on. What did you all think was going to happen?

Naive, but who can blame you when the media spent three months discussing how Harris doesnt do enough interviews, instead of telling you how tariffs work.

It needs an outsider to be the messenger, not someone like Pete.Also let's be a little more clear about his primary issues. He got fucked over by the DNC, especially in 2020. Everyone but Warren and Biden dropped out right before Super Tuesday. Pete was outperforming Biden at the time and he dropped (then later gets a cabinet position, seems very legitimate). They knew Bernie could win if they didn't all coalesce around Biden so everyone but Warren - the candidate closest to Bernie - dropped out. It was so obviously manipulated. If you wanna continue to say he had trouble connecting to certain groups of voters, that's totally legitimate. That means someone else could take up his platform, not that his platform doesn't work. People want change and they want progressive policies. In head-to-head polls, he did better than every other candidate against Trump by far. It's because he was also a \\"change\\" candidate but had real material ideas and not just racist demagoguery.You say someone who can be a bit more moderate, like Pete, is what we need. You know what 2016 and 2024 proved, without a shadow of a doubt? Moderate democrats don't win. Biden ran a progressive campaign against Trump and won because Bernie had pushed the whole field to the left.

Then \\"conservative\\" policies like deregulation allows global corporations to buy up all the failed businesses, patents, and lost properties during the crash caused by regulatory policies.So they do this boom/bust cycle over and over again, where they pretty much double their wealth each cycle while halving ours!

Former President Donald Trump is dialing up the retribution rhetoric in the wake of his criminal conviction, remarking for the third time in as many days that he has every right to go after his political opponents.\\n \\n Revenge does take time, I will say that, Trump said during an interview Thursday with Phil McGraw, the TV personality known as Dr. Phil.\\n \\n And sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil. I have to be honest. Sometimes it can.\\n \\n His remarks are just the latest in which Trump suggested that hed seek retribution from his political enemies if elected president in November. And they come as one of his closest allies, former White House chief strategist Steven Bannon, is ordered to report to prison by July 1.  \\n \\n Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 for failing to provide documents related to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He was sentenced to four months in prison.\\n \\n When asked during a Fox News interview on Wednesday if he plans to use the justice system to punish his political opponents, Trump said: \\"When this election is over, based on what they've done, I would have every right to go after them.  \\n \\n It was the most direct statement Trump has made about his plans since he first floated the idea after a jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment central to a catch-and-kill scheme carried out during his 2016 presidential campaign in a bid to influence the election.\\n \\n Trump, who denies any wrongdoing even after being convicted, has made his legal affairs central to his reelection campaign C claiming that they amount to political persecution by President Joe Biden, his Democratic allies and a justice system overrun with corrupt left-wing judges and prosecutors.\\n \\n For months now, Trump has vowed to rebuild the Justice Department top to bottom with a cabal of his allies and has suggested that he would install a special prosecutor to investigate Biden and his family.\\n \\n By weaponizing the DOJ against his Political Opponent, ME, Joe has opened a giant Pandora's Box, Trump said in a social media post in January.\\n \\n The overtures have grown more frequent and specific in the aftermath of his guilty verdict, with the former president now repeatedly referring to himself as a political prisoner.  \\n \\n Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Trump said in an interview with conservative Newsmax that \\"it's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to, and it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\\n \\n Notably, the idea of political retribution sits at the heart of the presidential immunity case before the Supreme Court, which, among other things, wrestles with the idea of whether a president can be prosecuted for actions taken, publicly or privately, while they are command in chief.\\n \\n The case is specifically related to the four-count criminal indictment of Trump, which accuses the presumed Republican presidential nominee of attempting to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss and undermine Americas democracy. The justices are set to decide the case in the coming weeks.","title":"Full List Of All The Times Trump's Cabinet Picks Mocked Him In Public"},{"text":"nothing screams working class more than a businessman who owns his own skyscraper","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

Sexton shows how this connection helped rulers keep people in line, giving them \\"divine\\" reasons for oppression and supporting elites.He argues that this pattern repeats across eras, like during the Industrial Revolution and Cold War, and even now, when we see Christian nationalism popping up in political movements. Sexton basically says, \\"Look, these old power tactics are still around, and they might be steering us toward more crises.\\"Its a bold take on how faith and authority are intertwined, pushing the idea that the mix of religion and power isnt just about beliefits about creating stability for the few at the expense of change and progress.","title":"Trump doubles down on eliminating Education Department, vows to give restitution to victims of DEI | President-elect Donald Trump's plan would have sweeping impacts on students attending HBCUs or facing discrimination in classrooms."},{"text":"Yes prices will rise immediately but I was responding to the layoff item.

First, we should not imagine that litigation will be an effective tool for stopping egregious Trump administration actions. In recent decades, both political parties have cheerfully colluded in the steady expansion of executive power. The Insurrection Act and similar legislation grants the president extraordinary discretionary powers to declare emergencies. These would likely allow Trump to bypass the checks and balances that would normally constrain potentially norm-shattering executive actions, such as the possible deployment of active-duty military forces to the shutting down of protests in U.S. cities. [] Another lesson: In our exercises, large-scale protests on the streets and on college campuses consistently backfired. We live in a world rife with disinformation, and peaceful protests were quickly mischaracterized by Trump players as violent riots, even insurrection attempts. Throw in some agents provocateurs and AI deepfake videos, and peaceful protests led to evidence purporting to show out-of-control threats to public safetywhich alienated the general public, triggered violent action by right-wing extremists, and was used by the Trump administration to justify draconian crackdowns on civil liberties, including mass arrests and the deployment of military personnel to restore order.","title":"I Helped Run War Games on Trumps Plans.

I dont think Trump changing his mind would affect the perception that hes real its not about the policy its about the emotional realness. Its why hes so difficult to go against because no amount of facts will break through that. The media definitely didnt help but I also dont think there was anything they could have done. If they go too hard on him then it looks like theyre rigging it for Kamala which just makes him more popular. If they dont go hard enough on him then democrats complain that theyre helping Trump. Theres also the fact that most voters now are not getting their news from CNN or Fox News or MSNBC but from social media and podcasts. The democrats are still running an election like its 2008 not 2024. You dont need billions of dollars, celebrity endorsements or to knock on everyones door.

First I saw all the things that made him the pundit's dream candidate: the mayor of a Rust Belt town, a millenial, an Afghanistan vet, and a Rhodes Scholar. In fact, he was criticized as a candidate for [not being gay enough](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-queer-opposition-to-pete-buttigieg-explained). On the day of the Iowa Caucus, there was a [viral video](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/iowa-caucusgoer-pulls-buttigieg-vote-after-learning-he-s-gay-n1130696) of a Buttigieg supporter learning that her candidate was married to a man, so it clearly wasn't just me.Later I learned other things about Pete. He's quite possibly better at giving [interviews](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2024-07-29/pete-buttigieg-kamala-harris-fox-news-cnn-real-time-bill-maher) than anyone else in national politics. He's got a weakness in the [black vote](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-really-behind-pete-buttigiegs-lack-of-support-among-black-voters/), and worked for a firm called [McKinsey](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/6/20998972/pete-buttigieg-mckinsey-fundraisers-elizabeth-warren) that progressives don't trust. He took point for the [infrastructure bill](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-buttigieg-60-minutes-2022-03-13/), the most uncontroversial achievement of the Biden administration, and eventually took the [airline companies](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/03/pete-buttigieg-tough-on-airlines-00181436) to task for mass cancellations. Furthermore, I'm not convinced homophobia is as major a problem as you say. Eight years ago, Republican presidential hopefuls said they would [attend a gay wedding](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2016-republicans-attend-gay-wedding/story?id=30653208) if invited by a friend. Donald Trump was not asked, but despite [some posturing](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/09/fact-check-does-donald-trump-support-marriage-equality/), he's mostly ignored the issue. For all the finger-pointing at 'wokeness' for losing the '24 election, there's [reason to believe](https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-does-the-public-move-right-when-policy-moves-left/) voters are just contrary about social policy. Come '28, they even transgender rights could be mainstream.

I feel like this is going to cause a massive shakeup, the democrats will have a lot of infighting, they will regroup, and come back as a much better middle ground option. Thats literally their only hope of winning again. I genuinely believe America is tired of the extreme left nonsense where everyone is a nazi, fascist, or bigot if they disagree with the lunacy.","title":"Redditor wishes that the American birth rate drops off a cliff to own the Rrepublicans"},{"text":"They keep telling themselves they did everything right, so they do it again.","title":"SCOTUS Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor Will Not Resign Before Trump Reenters Office"},{"text":"Securing the border /s","title":"US Special Operations will take out cartels, Trump nominee for border czar promises"},{"text":"Yes, Nicolae Ceau?escu, the communist leader of Romania, was overthrown in 1989. His rule, marked by severe repression, economic hardship, and a cult of personality, had become increasingly unpopular, especially due to the austerity measures he imposed to pay off Romanias foreign debt, which caused widespread poverty and shortages of basic goods.In December 1989, anti-government protests erupted in the city of Timi?oara, quickly spreading to Bucharest and other cities. Ceau?escu attempted to maintain control by ordering a crackdown, but the military eventually sided with the protesters. On December 22, 1989, Ceau?escu and his wife, Elena, fled the capital but were soon captured. They were tried by a hastily convened military tribunal on charges including genocide, damage to the economy, and abuse of power. Both were found guilty and executed by firing squad on December 25, 1989. This event marked the end of his 24-year rule and the fall of communism in Romania, transitioning the country to democracy.","title":"Trump Draft Executive Order Would Create Board to Purge Generals"},{"text":"I felt that Vance interview was more coherent than Trumps.

Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!So, do you think we should adhere to history and tradition and discount that ruling?We *are* adhering to history and tradition. Please cite to a single law from the Antebellum period of American history showing that you couldn't own or carry arms if you weren't in a part of the militia.The Courts opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms, ict of Columbia v. HellerThat's because there are historical traditions of those things. They didn't do a deep dive into history because the question asked if the court was answered and didn't warrant looking further into it.","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":"Im being sarcastic but he won and so thats what the people want.

This can lead to an increase in gun violence. In fact, the reasons for gun violence are multyfold and diverse. To your last point, while I do not agree that gun ownership is critical to the long-standing freedom of the United States; I do believe that gun ownership is a national characteristic of Americans. A distinguishing feature that is part of the national characteristic and for that reason access to guns should be preserved. It is also plainly obvious that there is a gun violence crisis in the United States, and it is exporting it to all of its neighbors. Haiti, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela... the criminals in all of these countries procure their weapons from the USA.

I understand the desire to get back to a point where politics are boring and nothing really happens for people, but the people don't want to return to that. We are in a period of significant desire for change. Harris wasn't that, Biden wasn't that, and Clinton wasn't that. Harris allowed herself to be controlled by the same white bread eating coastal democrats who have been advising presidents for decades. Unfortunately for Harris, those people are so out of touch with reality, they don't know what year it is. New York and California Democrats have completely lost the ability to fight for the future. Newsome sucks, most mayors of San Francisco suck, every NYC mayor sucks, even the governor of New York has consistently sucked. So why do we let these people dictate national politics?

Wisconsin has fought hard to claw back our state one seat at a time. Are we pure blue? No, we are purple states, but that means we actually have to pay attention to people and what they want.

Imagine how hard life must be that they're willing to take their families with only what they can carry in hope that life might be just a little bit better on the other side, and there's not even a guarantee that they'll make it into the country or even survive the journey.There is some really in-depth reporting on how the asylum process is broken and set up to fail. I wish there was a quicker process where they could all get here legally, but if you were in their shoes trying to get your family to a better life, would you blame yourself for trying everything you could? These people aren't living like royalty when they get here. They're living 8 people inside a studio apartment and working 10 hour days at meat processing factories so you can get $5.00 chicken tenders. When I see those \\"caravans\\" on tv, I just think about how lucky I am that I don't need to risk everything to cross a border where the majority of the people on the other side are going to hate and exploit me, and then blame me for everything wrong with their country.If you want to end illegal immigration, make it a federal crime to hire people not authorized to work in the United States and actually enforce it. We all go through endless paperwork when we're hired for any job, but somehow these meat processing facilities and farmhand jobs seem to have pretty lax work requirements. Send a couple middle managers to prison for 5 years and see how many more are willing to look the other way when an employee has no social security number. This would also be a perfect opportunity for republicans to implement that National ID they've been going on about for the past decade. I would be in favor of that.I am in favor of border control and limiting our immigration. We don't have enough resources to take care of our own citizens.

Research. To answer your question again, no. That will literally never happen. If you are here legally then we are more than happy to have you and will treat you like our own. Illegal immigrants shouldnt get the same IF NOT MORE rights than legal immigrants. Its not easy to immigrate here and especially not easy to become a citizen. And yet the liberals were willing to give illegals instant citizenship, insurance, housing, and money just to add votes to swing states. For what? For cheating the system and getting rewarded with a shortcut and more benefits than average Americans. Its Fing disgraceful and undermines the work that immigrants have to go through to become citizens. Legal immigrants and new citizens are just as happy about this deportation.

That was true for Black and Latino voters as well.**About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.**Juan Proa?o, CEO of LULAC, the nations largest and oldest civil rights organization for Latino Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trumps messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos.**I think its important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump, Proa?o said. \\\\[Latino\\\\] men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.**The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trumps hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color.*Black and Latino voters priorities changed from 2020*While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue.**A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as not so good or poor, compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape.**That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress.**This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said.**Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me, Uscanga said. Gas, grocery shopping even as a college student, everything has gone up in price and that is a big concern for me and other issues like immigration.**Having grown up selling tamales and used cars, and washing cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said.**Under the Trump presidency more opportunities were abound, Uscanga said. I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016 but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019, I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying and thats why I started supporting him after that.**Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters.**For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate, Woodbury said.*Desire for strong leadership made Trump more appealing*A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Latino voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Latino men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Latino women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%.**Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader.**David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him.**Im satisfied with the result. I dont feel slighted. I wasnt let down. I wasnt pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position, he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, Id rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.*","title":"Young Black and Latino men say they chose Trump because of the economy and jobs"},{"text":"They were trying to get her to step down so they could put Kamala in.

Buttigieg just has to please the democrats, not everyone else in the primaries. The next election, if it follows the pattern, will be away from the status quo, so whoever the democrats run will have an advantage, the way Harris had a disadvantage. We'll see if a grievance filled felon finds out how to run a government efficiently, or if people might want a little more idealism than his revenge projects.

But it might be that the people who think that way were not going to vote for Buttigieg anyway. The landscape is going to be different in 2028, it's hard to predict who emerges and what the issues seem to be. Buttigieg is a good communicator and has a good resume, and he's a white man, so he's got that going for him. Trump can't run again, so it's probably going to Vance hating cat ladies as his platform, he's got no charisma. If you want a democrat, and you don't want to take too many chances, I hear that, but you know the right wing can find reasons to hate everyone. Newsom is from California.

Never in the history of our nation has the right to own and carry arms been contingent on membership in a militia.We have court cases going all the way back to 1822 with Bliss vs Commonwealth reaffirming our individual right to keep and bear arms.Here's an excerpt from that decision.If, therefore, the act in question imposes any restraint on the right, immaterial what appellation may be given to the act, whether it be an act regulating the manner of bearing arms or any other, the consequence, in reference to the constitution, is precisely the same, and its collision with that instrument equally obvious.And can there be entertained a reasonable doubt but the provisions of the act import a restraint on the right of the citizens to bear arms? The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!","title":"Trump-Appointed Judge Overturns Illinois Assault Weapons Ban"},{"text":"I'm not interested in being nice to assholes.
