In the US, the Greens and Libertarians are basically irrelavant. There is no other major democracy which is as strictly and rigidly two-party, as the US is. Whereas the 3rd and 4th parties even in Australia and the UK still have a significant number of seats. For example, the SNP has a lot of weight because of the number of seats it has, and that further makes it an even more important voice for Scotland in the UK Parliament. Having seats in the UK Parliament gives the SNP much more influence and limelight than it would've ever had if it wasn't part of the UK Parliament. The third parties (and others) can only dream of this in the US. And we're talking about the UK, which is a much more two-party-like compared to the other multi-party systems. The smaller parties in the other truer multi-party systems have exponentially much more power and representation as compared to their equivalents in the UK. The gap is way way more than even that when it comes to their American equivalents instead. For example, look at India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, France, Germany, the Nordic countries, and some other European countries as well.

Certainly a case can be made that *nothing else will be accomplished*, without starting there.This will be exceedingly difficult, because simply getting elected in the first place absolutely requires selling one's soul to *some* devil. Even the very richest of our congresswhores has achieved their seat by spending someone else's money- and the inevitable *quid pro quo* is completely obvious, to even the least sophisticated voter.An immediate recusal of any individual legislator from any and all activities that impact said legislator's \\"sponsors\\" **in any way** would be certainly a good start. However, given the current dialing-for-dollars requirements or both chambers, in order to feed the party machinery behind them, pretty much every legislator has benefitted from pretty much every potentially-sponsoring entity that exists before they are even seated. All of the corporate johns have an ideal buyer's market, at the moment, and the worst of them have plowed money into *everyone's* PACs.Unless and until someone comes up with a good mechanism with which to control, and eventually put an end to, the large-scale grift that is now essentially the only activity conducted in Washington, efforts to accomplish anything else will be nipped in the bud by the minions of whatever industries or interest groups that might be affected.Unless we could identify a suicidal (or term-limited) congresswhore who is willing to name names, number numbers, and generally derail the many gravy trains, I hold out little hope of anything else happening. Money talks far louder than mere good intentions.Somehow breaking the lobbyist-payola cycle might be a start. Lobbyists have clearly been the primary corrupting influence for  over a century, and they are arguably the reason that there are no longer any Mr. Smiths attempting to go to Washington. But I lack both the wisdom and the ideas of how to accomplish that legally.

It's as simple as that, I also feel like this is a (sad) lesson, since it's now been repeated for the 2nd time. That we are very far away from there being a chance for a woman president.\\nExpect the 2028 Democrat candidate to absolutely be White, Male, 50s-60s. ( saying this in a factual statement, not as a, oh it has to happen thing, tho it does to have a chance of winning 2028).\\nAnd the candidate needs to be a Strong leader, Harris wasn't exactly weak, and given more time to be an active candidate, I believe the numbers could have slightly been better in her favor. But it just wasn't in the numbers. We need a Democrat candidate in 2028 that will absolutely let the entirety of the nation know that Maga will be shutdown, and Maga criminals will be punished.\\nUnlike Bush, where Obama was the change Most people wanted. People seriously, (referring to Trump voters) and we saw last night, do not want a change from Trump.\\nMost of the Gop consider him either as the best or 2nd best Republican president post ww2. Tied with Reagan.

The people who benefited from that certainly had their interests improved, even if they didnt actually vote for the specific purpose of harming Jews. The fact that they stood by, indifferent, as their neighbors were kicked to the streets while their own pockets were lined makes them morally abhorrent. They were no less monsters than the brown shirts doing the kicking.Of course people are inclined to put their own interests first. But not all interests are equivalent. My interest in lower grocery prices does not outweigh the interest of some other group to exist. By all means, vote your interests.

The Biden administration dragged its feet, played politics with justice, and got stymied because they started the process too late.It's the same with Ukraine.  The western world decided that rather than directly intervene and crush the Russian invasion, they would provide Ukraine just enough to survive so the fighting would drag on for years.  But now, most of that support will evaporate in a couple months, so Ukraine will likely no longer be able to hold out against the invasion.  When it could have been over by now if America had committed to defending Ukraine fully.Stalling for maximum political effect is how all of this has happened.

I live in an area that has a lot of Mexican-American immigrants; the gym I go to is owned by an immigrant from Mexico and all the members are also Mexican immigrants except for me. (I'm a gringa lol.) They are always inviting me to go to church with them and it's a big Protestant/Evangelical Mega church. They are always sharing sermons by televangelist/gospel prosperity type Mega church pastors, and rejoicing when Daddy Yankee said he quit show biz to dedicate his life to Jesus and will only sing religious songs now or something.I'm originally from a small town in PA but I've lived here over 20 years; I was raised Evangelical Christian out there and left the church but from what I saw there and here, quite a large percentage of Latino/hispanic families are Protestant and Evangelical churches seem to cater to them. When I was growing up it really didn't matter what skin color or race you were if you came to our church and believed or at least pretended to believe in the (IMO ridiculous) religious teachings. Of course, it would matter if you were LGBTQA+ and \\"non-repetent\\" but they seemed to welcome straight Latinos with open arms. We were encouraged to marry early and have big families and the minority members of our youth group, including Latino, Black and even a Native American, seemed to be equal with whites in the \\"courtship\\" pool and there were quite a few interracial marriages. My fellow Evangelical Christian youth who stayed in the religion instead of leaving it didn't seem to care about the race or skin color of their spouse so long as they shared the same religious belief and both wanted to settle down and start raising families young.So I guess I really disagree with you that Latinos can't be in the crowd of white Evangelicals. I'm really not sure about the Catholic part as the Catholic Latinos I know are more of the traditional, older ones with more money and privilege and they do tend to stick to their own Catholic churches and they tend to be liberal at least when it comes to social causes and charities. But the younger (and by younger I even mean 50 and below... I'm 43 and my friends/neighbors here range in age from somewhat older to a lot younger) Latinos I know who are lower or middle class, some kind of struggling financially, are solidly Evangelical Protestants and from what I can tell as an outsider who doesn't really have a stake in things considering I'm not religious and won't be going with them, they seem to feel very happy and welcome in the Mega churches here from what they say. And in my hometown it seemed like that too. I think they are more interested in being religious and perhaps finding some support and community at a church than they are about paying attention to matters of race or skin color.","title":"Young Latino Men Flipped to Trump 54%-44% Over Harris"},{"text":"You're missing the point.

Tax dollars going to a federal school lunch grants? Improving education nationally? Propping healthcare up? A lot of states had an influx of people seeking reproductive healthcare because of the loss of this in their home states, and this has put on a burden on state-level resources, but it's accepted all the same because that's what is the right thing to do. It sucks, it probably shouldn't be done, but turning people away because of their politics and the way they vote is still cruel. It _SUCKS_ that this is the way it is, but it is the way it is.The unfortunate reality is that the electorate, by and large, refuses to vote for anyone that champions for what is the right thing to do. The electorate by and large simply will not do it. GOP-led states draining federal resources are a burden, but cutting them off just to spite the poor, the disenfranchised, and the suffering is simply against the ethos of the Democrats. And because this is the way it is, the Democrats' continue to struggle.The Democrats, in general, need to appeal to everyone fully, a feat that is pragmatically impossible, because the Democrats seek to represent everyone. They will never be able to do so, and shifting their focus away to represent only those who will vote for them will cause them to lose voters too. It's a lose-lose situation.Campaigning on empathy and caring for others does not win elections. Campaigning on memes and baser human instincts like fear and hate of the other does. But I'm unconvinced doing so would bring the Democrats closer to electoral success, because everything the Democrats do to appeal to one portion of the electorate can easily alienate the another.

They want to end war but also support Ukraine. They need to appeal to young progressives and also older moderates, at the same time.

Its more difficult to become an autocrat in a parliamentary system, for instance. But when you have a presidency, or you have a long tradition in your political culture of there being one leader in charge, its easier. And weve seen it happen frequently through the ballot box, through an electoral system, where people select a strongman and cede their power to an individual because they think that that person is going to do something specifically for them or their group.\\n \\n After the election in these situations, there is often a group of people around the leader who are pretty ruthless in chipping away at the checks and balances in the system. And look, we saw that under Trump from 2016 onward. We saw efforts to stack the courts. Weve seen the capture of the Republican Party by what is a pretty revolutionary faction. And now weve got a fusion between Trump and Elon Musk, someone whos pretty revolutionary himself, including in the scale of money that he has at his disposal. Weve got an American system that because of Citizens United  which I think is one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions in our lifetimes  has become a political system thats driven by money.\\n \\n In other words, were witnessing a fusing together of something thats revolutionary in the economic sphere with something thats revolutionary in the political sphere. People need to decide if they want to live in a U.S. version of an oligarchy, whether they want us to go down the same kind of path as Russia. Theyll make that decision at the ballot box.","title":"What happens to Trumps criminal and civil cases now that hes been reelected"},{"text":"That would require an educated public.","title":"DOJ moving to wind down Trump criminal cases before he takes office"},{"text":"Hey man don't direct your anger at me.

Basically according to them:* \\"Trump is a fascist and if you support him you're a literal Nazi who is complicit in genocide\\"\\n* \\"If he gets four more years, say goodbye to all freedoms\\"In reality:* Trump is a me-first, 80+ year old man focused on his legacy who previously enjoyed support from many of the same people who now lambast him in the media (see Oprah, The View, etc.)\\n* Trump already had one term to go full dictator, if he was going to do that. He didn't.\\n* January 6th was a shitshow and an embarrassment, but Trump did not orchestrate it. It was largely a failure of Congress to prepare for and secure it, and Trump did himself no favors by lending vocal support to it before he likely knew the full extent of what it was, which gave the left talking points.\\n* Trump's actual platform is actually pretty popular, even though many Republicans and independents find his style abrasive. To his credit, he's done a better job avoiding some of the childish insults this time on the campaign trail that alienate constituents. I hope he'll continue this the second time around. The real test will be how he handles the media. But - look at what his administration does, not what he says. I was an undecided voter in 2016, and initially dreaded the Trump presidency, but I was willing to give him a shot and look at his policy objectively - which won me over with time.As for your views, I'd be careful about calling yourself \\"Progressive.\\" I know what it means, but to most people it means you support the far-left agenda of groups like the DSA and Working Families Party. You sound like a moderate that understands this country has issues and has not always lived up to its own ideals. These days, that actually makes you a conservative (in the eyes of most leftists) if you actually believe in those ideals.So, the sky is not falling. Some things will likely get better, but a lot of that will depend on how well Congress can get its act together and focus on the key issues that have bipartisan support (tackling inflation, the border, crime, ending global wars, countering China) and avoid focusing on issues that will cost the midterms or the next general (abortion, for one).(1/2) - see reply below for 2/2 which discusses policy.","title":"Lifelong blue voter.

A certain strain of anti-Americanism, and pro-Russian sentiment, also runs through her nationalist movement, as well as others in Europe.In fact, her top lieutenant, Jordan Bardella, signaled Wednesday that the French should see the Trump victory as a national wake-up call for the protection of our interests and our identities.As all the other powers are waging an economic and influence war against Europe, we must now take our destiny into our own hands. Nobody will do it for us, he wrote on X.And a trade war, observers say, could quickly smash any ideological bridge between Trump and the European nationalists heralding his victory now.\\nIts possible, Fieschi said, that Trump may try to curry favor with certain leaders by offering trade exceptions in exchange for loyalty. But it could be a hard sell.Hed have to make someone like Meloni, who is the most powerful right-wing conservative in Europe, a very special deal to convince her its okay to trash her playground, Europe, with tariffs, she said.In Latin America, Trump allies old and new celebrated his win. Argentinas unconventional president, Javier Milei, who may be looking to Trump to smooth his chronically indebted nations relations with the International Monetary Fund, posted an edited photo of the two men embracing before a background of U.S. and Argentine flags.Few were more devoted to Trump on the international stage than former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who lost reelection in 2022. His backers have said a Trump victory could give momentum to Bolsonaros attempt to override a court order that banned him from running in 2026 over his baseless attacks on Brazils electronic voting system.May Trumps victory inspire Brazil to follow the same path. May our compatriots see in this example the inspiration needed to never bow down, to rise with honor, following the footsteps of those who refused to be conquered by adversity, Bolsonaro wrote on X.During Trumps first term in office, he and Turkeys autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, enjoyed a warm relationship that appeared impervious to tensions between their two governments, including over the conflict in Syria, Turkeys purchase of a Russian missile defense system and its imprisonment of U.S. citizen Andrew Brunson, a Christian evangelical preacher who was eventually released.Erdogan has been a vociferous critic of Israels military offensives in Gaza and Lebanon and has voiced continued support for the Palestinian militant group Hamas, presenting a possible obstacle in his relationship with Trump now. Turkey, a NATO member, has also sought a middle path between Russia and Ukraine during their conflict, with Erdogan keeping close ties to Putin even as his government has supported Ukraine, including by supplying Turkish-made drones.On Wednesday, Erdogan congratulated his friend Donald Trump.In this new period, Erdogan wrote, I hope that Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crisis and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.Brady reported from Berlin.

By virtue of geography and its neighbours, the US is very lucky in that its immigrant population has traditionally been extremely active and independent in being a part of the melting pot and contributing to civic nationalism.

ROME  Some heads of state are shuddering at the thought of a new Donald Trump presidency. But at least one segment of the global political class is publicly rejoicing: right-wing populists who are hailing the return of the U.S. leader who could validate and amplify their agendas.In Argentina and Brazil, the Netherlands and Hungary, Germany and Turkey, nationalists showered praise on Trump, congratulating a man they view as a powerful ally in the culture wars, who mirrors their views on illegal immigration, who would push back with them against climate action  and who has proved to be tolerant of democratic backsliding. In time, Trumps policies, particularly his vows to slap steep tariffs on imports, may sting. But for now, they are celebrating.It was not woke Hollywood that decided this election, but the working American people, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, wrote on X.The U.S. vote, she said, was an election against mass migration. It was an election against economic decline, against climate ideology, against gender. Donald Trumphas said, by the way, no men in womens sports and things like that. It was above all an election of young people who finally want to have a perspective again. And it was an election against all this war propaganda.In his first term in office, Trump offered comfort to authoritarians, regularly speaking in admiring terms of Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Koreas Kim Jong Un and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, while downplaying their rights abuses and other efforts to crush dissent. He offered a new way to dismiss accountability by popularizing the term fake news. He endorsed constructing walls to control migration, withdrew from international climate agreements and fueled the war on woke.Observers see his coming term as more of the same, but on steroids, and one that could deliver a fresh jolt of momentum to populists and nationalists abroad.\\nI think that this will embolden them; they will now have a sense that they are in the march of history, said Catherine Fieschi, a political analyst and fellow at the Robert Schuman Center of the European University Institute in Florence and the author of a book on populism.Nationalist politicians in Europe said they see Trump as a partner in their push to end the flow of money to Ukraine and to roll back rules aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions and regulating social media.Donald Trump is now freeing us for the next few years from the Ukraine war, from the Green Deal, from the Digital Services Act, said Maximilian Krah, an AfD politician and member of the European Parliament. And he is giving us political breathing room, because you can see that in the U.S. people are already further along and are voting for Donald Trump.In Italy, the Trump victory was being spun as a win for socially conservative thought.\\nIt represents a severe defeat for the radical agenda on abortion and gender promoted by the Biden presidency and sponsored by VIPs and mainstream media aligned with Kamala Harris in the election campaign, the conservative social values advocacy group ProVita and Famiglia said in a statement.The Biden administration had criticized a new law, backed by the government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, that criminalizes international surrogacy in a move that critics say especially targets same-sex couples seeking to have children.The U.S. was exercising its moral suasion to discourage the embracing of policies that would lead to taking steps back in civil rights, said Gabriele Piazzoni, secretary general of Arcigay, Italys largest gay rights group. Now this bulwark will entirely come undone.In the Netherlands, the party of far-right firebrand Geert Wilders  a brother of Trumps in ideology and hairstyle  is now part of the governing coalition. Celebrating Trumps victory, Wilders declared on X: Patriots are winning elections all over the world. The liberal-leftish woke driven nihilists are full of disbelief and hate and unfit to give the people what they truly want: freedom and their own nation first, their own people first and most of all no more illegal immigration.Analysts say Wilders is likely to leverage Trumps victory while trying to push a new anti-migrant program through the Dutch parliament. The move would tighten rules for family reunifications, shorten the term of temporary visas and designate parts of Syria as safe for the return of rejected asylum seekers.Wilders will use this victory, saying, See, this is a universal trend and you have to deal with migration. It will help him in the national discussion, said Ruud Koole, a Dutch political analyst and former senator.Trumps strongest ally in the region is the illiberal Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, a leader who has co-opted the courts while muzzling the free press, nongovernmental organizations and his political opponents. Under President Joe Biden, Orban came under pressure for eroding the rule of law  a criticism likely to disappear under Trump, who has described the Hungarian as fantastic.Orban welcomed Trumps win as a much needed victory for the World! The Hungarian leader is hosting summits of European leaders this week in Budapest, where he is expected to boast about a resurgent right and leverage his bromance with Trump to elevate his place on the European stage.But relations between nationalist populists can be like porcupines mating  tricky at best.China has used Orban as a back door into Europe, an issue that may drive a wedge between him and Trump, who has promised to take aim at Beijing. And another major European far-right figure, Frances Marine Le Pen, was notably less effusive Wednesday than some of her counterparts.","title":"Right-wing populists cheer the return of Trump, one of their own"},{"text":"Regardless of your position on the issue, at the end of the day these people are living breathing human beings and many of them are law abiding folks just trying to live. The scenario I'm pointing to is that since many of these folks have been away from their country of origin for so long, they probably wouldn't be accepted back into it. In order to deport someone, you have to get the country you are sending them to agree to take them in. So many of these people would have nowhere to go and this will likely create a massive humanitarian crisis for these stateless people.What do you do with these people? Do you put them in camps? Do you let them live their lives but under heavy monitoring by the authorities? Do you dump them off on the other side of the border to fend for themselves? Do you grant them citizenship?I'm all for a strong border security but this is going to be the mess that needs to be addressed from having lax border security and this mess will need to be cleaned up in a relatively humane way.This doesn't even cover the massive economic consequences from deporting a hardworking and cheap labor source.

Being gay isnt just about what sex/genitalia youre attracted to but includes yourself in that context. Being gay is about your attraction to others and how you fit into a relationship with another person. You are part of the equation. A gay man would not be happy being a woman with a man. It is a completely different concept all together. Being trans is about your own concept of self and has nothing to do with sex or attraction to others.As a man, I had no interest in men, nothing about them appealed to me because I was not a gay man. Once I was able to be myself as a woman and find myself again, I questioned my sexuality. Now Im almost exclusively attracted to men.Its already not unusual to question your gender when you question your sexuality. No idea what it being an illness or a mental health issue would have to do with it here but it is not considered either of those things. At least not medically, and hasnt been for decades. The distress it can cause is a mental health issue just like any other stress disorder, but the actual fact of being trans is not. Theres really nothing wrong with anyone, gay or not, being able to freely question their gender. What that entails is different for everyone. Some people just want to dress different or change their hair but theyre mostly ok with their body. Others need more stuff like surgery to affirm their sense of self or be able to properly live their life. Myself for example would likely not be alive today if I wasnt able to get bottom surgery. Not being able to properly be a woman, sexually, with my boyfriend would make it difficult for me while for others theyre fine with it. No one on either side, including myself, supports surgeries for minors without some pretty extreme reasoning and this is already something that is almost categorically not done. However, changing how you present, your name, and pronouns, and people respecting you for it is generally all most trans youth need and very easy for us all to accommodate. Hormone blockers are also safe and fully reversible if confident in your choice and you talk with doctors through this decision. Hormone replacement, while not fully reversible after ~6mo, is still completely safe. For minors this usually requires them to be 16 and have been diagnosed and presenting their preferred gender for at least a year prior to starting. I have no issues with these kinds of safety nets to make sure theres no rash decisions. This has nothing to do with it being considered an illness or not or it having any negative connotation.  There is a lot of research that shows being trans is likely a literal misalignment with your body and brain. If you woke up tomorrow as a different sex, would you just go with it and adapt? No, youd be freaked out. The leading theory on this, and what evidence most supports, is equivalent to what I just said. Everyone has a sense of self, its what makes us people and capable of introspection. Something thats unique to humans. Some peoples sense of self inherently doesnt match the body they were born with. Sex is not the same thing as race and trying to compare the two is completely disingenuous.The only physical difference in your body between men and women is what hormones you produce in the womb. We are all developmentally women until we start producing testosterone to transform our previously undeveloped female organs into male ones. Thats why it takes a while to determine gender of a baby and why its not 100% certain until very far along. Its why we can do so much with just hormones and no surgery, but obviously we cant turn back the clock on things once they change.","title":"Donald Trump and Olympics on collision course over transgender ban vow"},{"text":"There it is.","title":"Trump Is The Machine Now"},{"text":"Uhhhh... operation warp speed occurred under what administration?","title":"People are tired of wokery.

She smiled and laughed a lot during the campaign, she preached progressive orthodoxies, she rallied with Oprah Winfrey, Beyonc and Lady Gaga, as if the showbiz elite could persuade provincial, working-class America to vote for the Democrats. But you could see the panic in her eyes. The truth is she had nothing to say to Americans disillusioned by economic hardship, alarmed by immigration and the porous southern border, and alienated by identity liberalism.In the final days of the campaign, certainly following the publication of a rogue poll in Iowa that predicted a late surge to Harris, Democrats seemed confident that Trump could be beaten. Harris became more strident. She denounced Trump as a fascist and her supporters cheered. The momentum was with her, we were told, although the betting markets to the last remained firmly for Trump. On the morning of 6 November, New York Times commentators were clustering around Harris, increasingly certain that she would be the next president, the first woman to command the White House.This was wishful thinking. In mitigation, as my colleague Megan Gibson wrote in these pages two weeks ago, Harris was destined to lose. Megan argued that shed been given too little time to prepare and make her pitch to the American people: the Democratic establishment was culpable for supporting Joe Biden in his doomed pursuit of a second term even as with each passing week he became more shambling and incoherent. Trumps quip during his debate with Biden in June signed his death warrant: I really dont know what he said at the end of that sentence. I dont think he knows what he said either.But I think Harris, whose campaign out-spent Trumps and raised as much as $1 billion, had more than enough time to reveal her limitations; as vice-president she was the incumbent. She had four years to demonstrate her capabilities but, for much of that time, was largely anonymous: marginalised, forgotten. It was as if Biden regretted choosing her as his VP. During the campaign, apart from the issue of womens reproductive rights, about which she spoke with authority and courage, Harris revealed her drastic limitations as a politician and communicator.  In the late 1970s, a divided Labour Party and much of the British left (apart from Martin Jacques Marxism Today) misunderstood the forces unlocked by the election of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. It was complacently assumed that her victory would be transient, and the consensus politics of the post-war order would be restored in due course. When I saw Thatcherism, the cultural theorist Stuart Hall told the New Statesman in 2012, reflecting on the turbulent politics of the 1980s, I realised that it wasnt just an economic programme, but that it had profound cultural roots. Thatcher and [Enoch] Powell were both what Hegel called historical individuals C their very politics, their contradictions, instance or concretise in one life or career much wider forces that are in play.Something similar could be said of Donald Trump, as I wrote in our Saturday Read newsletter last weekend. When he first ran for the presidency as a Republican he was traduced, ridiculed and written off: part orange-faced game show host, part preposterous Mafia Big Man. The American novelist Philip Roth called him the boastful buffoon. Trump is boastful and he is a buffoon. His long, tedious, erratic victory speech C there was praise for the super genius Elon Musk and a bizarre appearance on stage by the golfer Bryson DeChambeau C was absurd even by the standards of a Trump rally.And yet, for all his repulsive excesses and uncouth behaviour, Trump keeps winning. What does he know? What does he understand about the atavistic impulses and insecurities of the American people? Why has the Republican Party allowed itself to be captured? The Maga movement is not a passing phenomenon: like Thatcherism it has hardened into something permanent. It is a counter-hegemonic project. There is no turning back for the Republicans.Alongside Trump will be vice-president elect JD Vance, a true ideologue, and the intellectual leader of the so-called pro-worker, anti-liberal American New Right. But Vance, once a Never Trumper, embodies the contradictions of the Maga movement, which seeks to encompass both the Silicon Valley libertarianism of Musk and Peter Thiel and the common good conservatism of the academic Patrick Deneen who, in his recent book Regime Change, wrote: The institutionalisation of the libertarian ethos C in both the economic and social domains C has globally ravaged the working classes, leaving them simultaneously in a condition of economic precarity and social disintegration.No one, Philip Roth said shortly before he died, could have imagined that the 21st-century catastrophe to befall the USA would appear not, say, in the terrifying guise of an Orwellian Big Brother but in the ominously ridiculous commedia dellarte figure of the boastful buffoon. But perhaps this outcome could have been imagined. After all, as John Gray has written, the word populism has no clear meaning but is used by liberals to refer to political blowback against the social disruption produced by their own policies. Trumps return is some blowback.","title":"Like Thatcherism, Donald Trump is here to stay"},{"text":"Hes easy to control because hes dumb.

There is literally nothing stopping him from outright ending them on day one and pardoning himself (yes, a president can apparently pardon himself), killing any chance for a future prosecution.He attempted a coup and is going to get away with it with exactly zero consequences. He brought this country to the brink with armed and organized militias storming the capitol building and attempting to send fake electors to change the outcome of an election he lost, and he'll face zero consequences for that. He stole boxes of classified documents, hid them from people who rightfully came looking for them, and stored them in insecure locations (including a disused ballroom... with a photocopy machine right next to the trove of documents). He'll face zero consequences for that.He has already been convicted for covering up his illegal interference in the 2016 election, but not sentenced. That's a state charge, so he can't pardon himself. But they're not going to sentence a sitting president, so that's on the back burner until he's out of office and likely won't include jail time anyway.He's still charged with election interference in Georgia, but they've been doing everything in their power to put the brakes on that since day one. There is zero chance that that prosecution will be put on the back burner for four years and be able to be rebooted once he's out of office. So he'll probably get away with that, too.","title":"Special Counsel Jack Smith taking steps to wind down federal cases against Trump"},{"text":"We already know...","title":"What happens to Trumps criminal and civil cases now that hes been reelected"},{"text":"Speaking of which, when is Trump's sentence hearing??

Actually, based on a current study...\\" he just leans into the microphone and says \\"WRONG\\". And people eat it up, you know? Because that's just where discourse is now.

I mean, imagine someone who goes onstage and calls the ceo of a company a jerkoff for doing layoffs right after massive stock buybacks. And it seems fairly obvious that this person doesn't even have to be a true everyman. Trump lived in NYC in a big gold tower with his name on the top. He is, objectively, the most coastal elite theres ever been. But people relate to him somehow and disregard they stuff they don't like about him, and that's powerful.\\nPeople will say that they don't want to see the dems go low like that, but I just gotta ask: do you ever want to win an election again? The DNC seems to just be waiting for another Obama to fall from the sky. Another super skilled debater who is almost maddeningly cool and confident and is really good at inspiring people. But I just don't think we're gonna get that person if the DNC keeps insisting on putting forth candidates who really seem to lack the fiery conviction and anger that Americans seem to really crave in these modern times.","title":"Be honest, America.

See Article 1 section 8 and the 10th Amendment.). We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives (meaning- it goes back to states where it should always have been).\\"edit- SurpriseZeitgeist- Really?

It's just wishful thinking.Oil companies set the price of gas today on how much they *think* it will cost them to produce gas in the future.We already produce more oil compared to other countries. In the last 3 years we've pumped pretty much the same amount + a bit more than Trump, while other countries stayed fairly stagnant, and gas prices haven't really changed much, except for during covid, but that was a result of supply and demand and gas companies *still* posted record profits while continuing to drill.Companies aren't reassessing gas prices as they fluctuate. If gas is $2.25 today and they charge you $5. Any *decrease* in gas price means more profit for the company, and any increase in price is factored into their next round of price hikes.How it actually works: at it's most basic - Sell a thing for more than it costs you.Everyone down the line (manufacturer, distributor, supplier) wants to make all of their money back, make/buy more inventory, and turn a profit.Lets say a company manufactures a computer chip and it costs them $5 to produce and deliver anywhere in the world. They sell them to an US importer for $15, the importer sells them to retailer for $45, and the retailer sells them to you for $120. You get a product, companies make money, what a world!But lets talk about tariffs; the US government charges and collects 200% to bring these widgets into the US for resale.That means the company is still making them for $5 and selling them allover the world, but the manufacturer doesn't get charged the tax when someone buys them, the importer does.So now the importer is being charged $45 instead of $15, they sell it to the retailer for $135, and the retailer charges you $405, everyone else makes their money back turns a profit, and that 200% tariff on a $5 widget just cost you an extra $270 dollars.\\"But wait, won't that just increase manufacturing in America?\\" Not any time soon. We've been off-loading American manufacturing to other countries for decades and at this point it will take us another few decades to revitalize it **AND** the US company has to be able to make and sell them at equal or less than it costs to buy them from overseas...which is exactly why they outsource manufacturing in the first place.

TRUMP IS YOUR PRESIDENT"},{"text":"(Article)---It turns out its a bad idea to pitch a Democratic campaign to neoconservatives such as Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol. Especially while a seismic realignment has pushed workers away from centre-left parties across much of the developed world. Yet thats just the sort of campaign Kamala Harris ran: one premised on the defend democracy sentiments of affluent suburbanites, instead of the promise of social and economic democracy.The gambit didnt pay off. As I write, Donald Trump appears poised to clinch the popular vote C a first for a Republican presidential nominee since 2004, and the second since 1988 C and to sweep the battleground states. Its safe to say that Trumpism in American politics is an era, in the same way we think of the Reagan era. The long-term trend of US politics, in other words, is right-wing populism; the Joe Biden interlude was just that.Speaking of Bidenism, Harris might have done better had she enthusiastically articulated the populist elements of her bosss vision: the industrial policies, the rural development, the tariffs, the anti-trust crusade. Instead, she touted that her economic platform had won plaudits from Goldman Sachs, that most beloved of institutions, even as she wouldnt commit to retaining Lina Khan, Bidens bold anti-trust czar (whose efforts JD Vance was more apt to praise). Her surrogates bashed tariffs as a tax on consumers, seemingly unaware that Team Biden had retained and expanded Trumps on Chinese goods.History had dealt Harris a lousy hand: a politician who had never won a nationwide primary received her partys nomination after Bidens disastrous debate in June, in which the much diminished president vowed to beat Medicare. Still, it isnt hard to pinpoint a slew of unforced errors on Harriss part.For starters, there was her catastrophic lack of vision. It was hard to discern a story beyond defend democracy and protecting womens right to an abortion. The latter no doubt motivated some women. But given Team Trumps shift away from the anti-abortion cause, it didnt do much. As for democracy, voting for Trump was practising democracy for many millions of Americans. The notion that democracy itself was on the ballot had few buyers outside the editorial boards of the Atlantic and the New York Times.In place of a cohesive narrative, Harris offered a barrage of lame micro-policies: small-business loans, homebuyer grants, handouts to the scammy crypto industry, encouraging black marijuana entrepreneurs, scrapping tax on restaurant tips (a gimmick lifted from Trumps agenda) and so on. What happened to the sorts of things that used to make left parties attractive to ordinary people: Medicare for all? Student- and medical-loan forgiveness? Peace in the Middle East?Speaking of the Middle East, Harris somehow managed to alienate Muslims over Gaza, going so far as to bar a Palestinian speaker from her partys convention, without endearing herself to the pro-Israel community, either. Trump achieved the opposite: he became the toast of the Israeli public while garnering endorsements from a number of imams and Muslim mayors in Michigan, a crucial battleground. Few expect him to restrain the IDF in Gaza, but theres a reassuring sense that, with Trump, what you see is what you get.Then there was illegal immigration C not a mere problem for the Democrats, but a catastrophe. Having dismantled Trumps signature border-control measures, the Biden administration oversaw the arrival of millions of low-wage, unvetted immigrants, including gang members. They fanned out beyond the border states, putting pressure on public services and criminal-justice systems in even tolerant blue states.Footage of low-income Americans, including black and brown people, complaining of schools and childrens recreation centres converted to migrant shelters soon proliferated on social media C but national Democrats paid little heed until it was too late. Harris tried to be hard line on immigration, but her promises were vague, and she couldnt give a reasonable account of why she changed her mind.None of this is to deny the numerous contradictions in Trump, who has been resurrected, like the revenant of Greek myth, to greater power than he possessed before his sojourns through the Hades of defeat and lawfare. But US voters get a binary choice, and a choice they have made. Democrats, too, now face a choice: to finally grant popular rage and work toward bipartisan solutions C or to indulge another four years of fruitless #Resistance.","title":"Why Kamala Harriss gambit failed | For millions of Americans, voting for Trump was democracy in action."},{"text":"They would need to pass a bill and the US government would need to issue mortgages.

The correct question for the kamala team right now should be more along the lines of \\"How could she have better connected with the concerns of trump voters,\\" or \\"What policies are hurting her among the electorate, and how can she adjust/minimize that\\"  It's a time to look in the mirror, not to berate the electorate.

Here are some potential reforms:1. Increase Transparency and Accountability\\t?\\tPublic Financial Disclosures: Require more detailed, accessible financial disclosures on how DNC funds are raised and spent, including campaign contributions and vendor payments.\\n\\t?\\tClearer Decision-Making Processes: Make decision-making processes, such as primary debate rules or candidate support, transparent and subject to clear guidelines that are publicly available.\\n\\t?\\tEnhanced Oversight: Establish an independent ethics and oversight board to investigate conflicts of interest and hold DNC officials accountable.2. Promote Democratic and Inclusive Representation\\t?\\tDecentralize Power: Reduce the power of top leadership to make unilateral decisions. Empower state and local party chapters to have more influence in decision-making, especially in setting primary rules and selecting candidates.\\n\\t?\\tSuperdelegate Reform: Limit or eliminate the role of superdelegates (unpledged delegates) who have disproportionate influence over candidate selection, giving more power to pledged delegates chosen by voters.\\n\\t?\\tDiverse Representation: Ensure that DNC leadership reflects the diversity of the partys base, including more representatives from underrepresented communities and younger voices.3. Modernize Primary and Caucus Systems\\t?\\tStandardize and Simplify Voting Procedures: Standardize the primary and caucus processes across states to reduce voter confusion and streamline the delegate allocation process.\\n\\t?\\tIncreased Accessibility: Encourage vote-by-mail options, early voting, and same-day voter registration to make primaries more accessible to all voters.\\n\\t?\\tReduce Influence of Wealthy Donors: Reduce reliance on high-dollar fundraisers and corporate PAC donations, and prioritize small-dollar fundraising to better reflect the grassroots base of the party.4. Strengthen Grassroots Engagement and Empowerment\\t?\\tInvest in Local Organizing: Dedicate more funding and resources to grassroots organizing at the local and state levels, ensuring that the DNC is consistently engaged with voters outside of election cycles.\\n\\t?\\tCreate Platforms for Policy Input: Develop mechanisms for regular feedback from party members and activists, such as open forums, town halls, and digital platforms where members can submit policy ideas and proposals.\\n\\t?\\tEmpower Volunteers and Small Donors: Recognize and reward the contributions of small-dollar donors and grassroots volunteers, making sure they have a voice and feel included in the decision-making process.5. Foster Internal Democracy and Party Unity\\t?\\tEncourage Internal Debates and Open Forums: Allow more space for debate within the party, avoiding a top-down approach where dissenting voices are discouraged. This can be done through regional meetings, issue-based caucuses, and a stronger national convention.\\n\\t?\\tBuild a Clear, Cohesive Platform: Establish a clear, unified platform that reflects the partys core values and policies, with input from all wings of the party. This can help bridge gaps between moderates and progressives and present a unified message to voters.6. Adopt Modern Campaigning Techniques and Data Practices\\t?\\tEmphasize Data and Technology: Invest in data science, digital engagement, and innovative campaigning techniques, equipping local chapters with tools for voter outreach and engagement.\\n\\t?\\tProtect Digital Privacy and Security: Ensure robust cybersecurity measures to protect voter data and prevent interference in digital campaigning.7. Implement Term Limits and Leadership Rotations\\t?\\tRegular Leadership Changes: Introduce term limits or rotation policies for DNC leadership positions, allowing for fresh perspectives and preventing stagnation in the leadership.\\n\\t?\\tEncourage Young Leadership: Create opportunities for younger leaders and activists to rise through the ranks and contribute new ideas.8. Increase Voter Engagement Through Policy-Driven Initiatives\\t?\\tFocus on Core Policy Issues: Emphasize policy-driven initiatives that directly address the concerns of voters, such as healthcare, climate change, economic equality, and social justice.\\n\\t?\\tDevelop Community Programs: Launch community programs on important issues, allowing voters to see the DNCs commitment to real, impactful change in their daily lives.This kind of reform would be ambitious and complex but could make the DNC more democratic, more effective in addressing the needs of its base, and more capable of inspiring voter enthusiasm.","title":"Donald Trump's Popular Vote Win Is the Sweetest Victory for Him"},{"text":"Trump is the mostly lucky president in history.","title":"DOJ Set to Drop Federal Cases Against Trump Before Inauguration"},{"text":"ok my bad","title":"Donald Trump's Popular Vote Win Is the Sweetest Victory for Him"},{"text":"Give me money.
