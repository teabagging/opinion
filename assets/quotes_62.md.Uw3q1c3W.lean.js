It can all come from one source, but you are capped out at that number. That means that the mayor of Cincinnati and his opponent are allowed to campaign on $311,097.00 each. And that's it. So the Democratic and Republican candidates for President cannot raise or spend more than $334.9 million apiece (or whatever the U.S. population is at the next election.) That's still a lot of money, but it will mean that campaigns will have to make some smarter choices and make more use of television and the internet than their gas-guzzling jets.

Also: ads will be fact-checked, and a clarification disclaimer will be attached to the end of the ad just like we do with ads for heartburn and boner pills. This goes for Super PAC ads, too, and here's another rule for Super PACs: you can campaign for or against any issue you want, but you can't mention, depict, or reference a specific candidate in any way in your campaigning.

I don't care how much is being taken, who is taking it, or who/where it is being sent. The government acquiring money through compulsory taxes regardless of consent from the people or their ability to determine where/what the fruits of their labor are spent on, is theft, in my book.However, seeing as apparently the average citizen is not concerned enough with the concept of being forced to involuntarily donate a portion of their income to a cause they have no say in, to fight it, and taxes are likely going nowhere any time soon, it only seems fair to me that everyone should be robbed, equally. So if the government is stealing 10% of the middle class's income, they should steal 10% of the upper class's income, as well.In my opinion, the beauty of a flat tax is that everyone \\"pays\\" the exact same share of their income, and if it's an equal share then it's a fair share. If Billy makes $100,000/year and is compelled to pay 10% of his income in taxes, the government would take $10,000 from him. Meanwhile, if Susan makes $100,000,000/year and is compelled to pay 10% of her income taxes, the government would take $10,000,000 from her. They both paid out different amount in taxes, however they both retained 90% of their income.Who is going to strive to invent something revolutionary and groundbreaking that will make them so rich that money is coming out of their ears, if they realize that when they finally get there they will have to turn around and pay 40% of it to the government, who did nothing, because they did something that nobody else could do? Nobody.Wealth tax, regardless of how much, disincentives ingenuity and hard work and it would lead to a reduction in overall productivity as the wealthy would take their assets and companies (to include jobs) abroad to a country that has a friendlier position on the rich. We want to keep them, their factories, and their jobs, in our country so our people have jobs and we maintain a cutting edge in productivity and technological advancements.","title":"Wealth tax"},{"text":"All the mods would bawl their eyes out XDDD","title":"??During his visit to Mar-a-lago, Mark Zuckerburg has promised Trump that he will work to ensure his Meta platforms grant their users Freedom of Speech.\\" The way X platform is doing it."},{"text":"All this guys X posts read like a based chad's.","title":"Luigi Mangione &amp; the Biden Administration Connection"},{"text":"Butpeople deciding on their own who lives and dies is a foolproof system?!","title":"CMV: If you believe people deserve to die because of their actions, you are in essence in support of capital punishment"},{"text":"Biden tried to in [August of this year](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dgzn66134o) and [June of 2023](https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/31051/SCOTUS_Blocks_Biden_s_Student_Loan_Debt_Cancellation_Program).

It is rooted in a few ideas. The first is the perversion of tolerance. Instead of live and let live, they believe that a tolerant society must be intolerant of the intolerant. Anyone who they deem to be intolerant of a group must be silenced or eliminated from society. The only way to do this is through government and violating those peoples God-given rights.The second is the perversion of righting past wrongs. Instead of righting past wrongs, such as slavery, by just treating them as people, they demand things such as race reparations. Their ideology is built upon a hierarchy of oppression, where people of certain races and ethnicities are given special treatment because their ancestors were oppressed. The bottom of this totem pole is the straight white male, who in their eyes is the source of oppression. This generates racism towards the groups they deem as oppressors, often lumping in groups who have been historically oppressed because they look white (such as the Irish or Jewish people). These redistributionist race reparations are proto-socialism, but based on a hierarchy of oppression. It violates the fundamental principle that All men are created equal. This snowballs into a perversion of justice where oppressed groups are treated much more favorably compared to those of the oppressor groups. Think how people like Derek Chauvin and Daniel Penny have been treated by the left.The third is a perversion of what rights are. People on the left have expanded their definition of rights to include stuff like healthcare, housing, money, or whatever. This belief is built upon by envy of the successful and greed. That envy and greed continues to spiral out of control in an attempt to take things that others earned for themselves.There is no world in which a liberal left society can exist.

But a lot of people are able to successfully pierce that tribalism. This pre-occupation with tribalism is actually more divisive than actual tribalism in my humble opinion.It's better to focus on ways to pierce that tribalism by identifying WHY people vote for in-groups-what threats do they see in voting for an out-group member than vilifying said people (not all of them) for their occasional tribalism. And reassuring voters that you, even though you don't belong to their in-group, have their back. I mean you could carry on chastising them but that just pushes them away even further. It's a lame strategy if you actually want to win and see a future of peaceful co-existence between races.Meet their bias where it is-instead of trying to change it. So for example, maybe Fresh off the boat immigrants and those of an older demographic and/or apolitical immigrants vote for their own because of default thinking so then focus your outreach on younger, second gen immigrants who are easier to sell a progressive non-tribal ideology to. I grew up in an incredibly progressive family with feminist parents but I have older, distant relatives who are regressive as fuck. I could focus on their essential narrow-mindedness or I could find common ground where I can.Another example: there are some voters who were fed the Great Replacement theory in parts of the country in droves-so they feared that voting for someone like Kamala would mean replacement of them and their race. The pre-occupation with fast changing population demographics painted as an existential threat by the likes of Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson didn't help either. So the solution is meeting that fear head on. Instead of condescending, approach people as essentially scared-and allaying that fear-even if it's a non-sensical/borderline racist fear.Like I hate to say it-but Trump did a good job finding the common denominator between all races of men in America currently-a fear of radical feminism-and used that to increase his vote among minorities along with his assured voting block. Incidentally, Kamala also grew the numbers of white voters-male and female (albeit to a small degree) from Joe Biden by painting herself as a centrist with a diverse family-white, Brown and Black/also Jewish. So clearly, the tribalism can be pierced. But statements like yours-even if not intended to be malicious or whatever-are just unproductive and NOT the way to do it.P.S. Also, \\"the whites couldn't do it\\" is also just a racist statement. Plenty of white people could do it AND did. In fact, Kamala increased the number of white voters (male and female both) from Joe Biden's 2020 record. She actually lost among brown Latino voters in big numbers and a small chunk of Asian and Black voters.","title":"This Vietnamese American Candidate Just Blew Up the Democratic Campaign Playbook"},{"text":"Catechism of the Catholic Church 2267. https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/548/ Consequently, the Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide.","title":"Pope Francis and advocates add to pleas for Biden to clear federal death row"},{"text":"It's a US weapons and jobs program. \\"McConnell said the war has not cost the lives of any US military personnel, and weapons transfers to Ukraine are allowing the United States to modernize its industrial base with cutting-edge technology that will be needed in the rising competition from Russia and China, and it is creating US jobs.\\"","title":"Biden Administration Moves to Forgive $4.7 Billion of Loans to Ukraine"},{"text":"The answer is propaganda.

Right now, the sector that is paying for those market intervention costs is the industrial sector. Any industrial company operating in South Australia now has 30 per cent of their electricity bill apportioned to market intervention costs.\\"\\"When you're a large company, or even a smaller companylet's use the example of the Central Irrigation Trust. Who are they? They're a trust that pumps water to irrigators so that we can have stone fruit and pears and apples in the Riverland. They've got about 14,000 hectares of land with horticultural crops. They've got 12 irrigation districts, and 30 per cent of their bill is market intervention costsnot electricity but market intervention costs. What do they do with that? The trust can't absorb it, so they then push that onto the irrigators. So the irrigators are now getting a charge. And where do the irrigators put it out to? They put it to the wholesalers. And where do the wholesalers put it to? They put it to the community. So is there any wonder that we're paying more for our pears and our stone fruit than in other parts of Australia? Because we've got to absorb this 30 per cent of market intervention costs, and it's just not being talked about.\\"They begged the Inquiry into Nuclear to lift the moratorium in South Australia:\\"if you don't want to do it for the rest of the nation, please untie our hands here in South Australia and give us the opportunity to look at nuclear in South Australia. You can use us as a test case because we've got a very large proportion of our community where there is social acceptance and people do want to have the conversation about nuclear power and where the community are sick and tired of paying very high electricity bills to pursue a number. They just want jobs.\\"Her members are willing to undertake private business cases:\\"If it weren't a prohibited activity, I think we would see my member companies undertaking business cases to determine whether that is an opportunity for them to decarbonise. Whether or not you're a cement-making or an iron-ore-producing facility, you have to get their carbon footprint down. One of the ways to do that would be to develop, to build or to order an SMR.\\"\\"CHAIR:  So you don't think, if we were to get to 82 per cent renewables in the grid, firmed up by storage and hydro and then backed up by gas, that would be an opportunity at all?Ms Knol:  No. We're at 72 per cent and we're breaking manufacturing.

That's literally what plenty of white Americans born and bred do too-vote for someone who looks like them, speaks like them, shares their religion etc. And I'm sorry but there is a distinction between new-to-the-country immigrants who are treated like crap/alienated and therefore feel safer within their groups to immigrants who have been in the country for a long time and therefore feel seen by the country at large.Tribalism is a product of mistreatment or being misunderstood-it makes you retreat to your safe place. People like you who generalize political views of immigrants who do not all even share the same language, country of origin, politics, race or even religion in so many cases make my skin crawl. Instead of actually investigating why they vote the way they do, you resort to simplification based on personal biases about a group you are not a part of yourself.They are NOT a monolith-don't ascribe your own narrow minded-ness unto them. Find a more nuanced way to criticize voters than using an assumption about immigrant voting based on zero real research. If you read the Mother Jones article which interviews actual Asian voters, putting them into a group is what annoys them more than anything-as if they have no identity/qualifications/interests/views outside of their race because having a broad range of views is something only non-immigrants are capable of having. Immigrants on the other hand are apparently sheep-incapable of logical thinking.It's all too common to paint Asians as meek, subservient followers which is what's really disgusting. I'm sure you wouldn't suggest French immigrants or German immigrants only vote for their own. It never ceases to amaze me that all said and done, casual racism is a truly bi-partisan issue. There are Asians-Indians, Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean who are Democrats and then there are Asians who are Republicans and even more who are Independents. For example, there are plenty of Indian Americans who hate Kamala Harris and would never vote for her/didnt vote for her but also many others who did vote for her.Same for literally all other races-white, brown, Black. People vote for the people they see as meeting their specific needs the best-sometimes they make a mistake and choose someone who will not do that. And then they learn. But at the end of the day, it's being able to sell yourself as someone who has your voters back. Period. If you are able to do that by speaking to their identity-then that's one way, if you are able to do that by speaking to their class-that's another.

If I did have trouble finding work, which will almost certainly be true in the NOVA area as so many skilled folks will be looking at the same time, I would just take early retirement and hit up the Social Security and Medicare benefits Ive been paying into for years.  Im pretty sure those benefits are worth more than picking lettuce as a migrant laborer.  People are missing the fact that federal labor is not a major cost.  The government processes money to contractors.  The entire federal workforce accounts for about 5% of the federal budget.  The rest flows out as aid, grants, and contracts for goods (like new roads, bridges, and military aircraft) and services (like air traffic control, law enforcement, and national defense).  If Trump makes cuts to the federal workforce the net effect will be less efficient purchasing of those goods and services.

We refused to help Britain hold on to their colonies. We tried to dissuade France from holding on to theirs. But France was so insecure about their natonal masculinity and embarrassed at their utter and rapid defeat at the hands of Germany  and ashamed of the toadying collusion of the Vichy government that they utterly refused to do so. Algeria and Vietnam, agitating for liberation that had been strongly hinted at by France during the war, became festering sores. When asked by the Vietnamese to support their independence, the American government refused because the French were extremely reluctant members of NATO and the US was very concerned they'd move off-side. Communist Russia and China were proximate dangers worth compromising their liberal principles for, so they thought at the time.","title":"CMV: Democrats will be doomed for a long time unless they become more centrist"},{"text":"Reddit does tend to be American-centric in these subs. ?People are going to be more upset by a genocide that is being funded by their tax dollars.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"David Perdue just left the senate on 1/3And funny enough, the run off was on January 5th, so Perdue wasn't any longer the incumbent senator cause his term expired.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 9, 2024"},{"text":"Hasnt he been always been MAGA?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 9, 2024"},{"text":"Youre a non educated economist","title":"Republicans are feeling great about the economy again.

It's a very weak one and It's been largely debunked. No one forced banks to give loans to people who couldn't qualify for them. No one forced banks to skip the verification process. Neither congress nor the DNC suggested to the securities ratings companies that they should misrepresent the quality of the mortgages that made up the instruments that failed and began the collapse. In fact the banks pay the fees of the companies who vouch for the quality of the instruments those banks packaged up for sale to an unsuspecting public. The incentive to do all that was greed and it was weaponized, in some significant part, by the dismantling of New Deal era banking regulations and oversight. The fetish for deregulation is well understood to be a conservative disease and Neoliberal (read Conservative) Democrats have done very little to curb it. The problem with assuming the 'liberal' policies were all good is that you are using hindsight and survivorship bias. Generally, nobody rememebers the proposals that never were implemented nor do they remember the policies that were tried and failed. It is just looking back at the successes and assuming everything was a success.I never said nor meant to imply that all liberal policies and leadership were \\"all good\\" nor does do I suggest that some of what they didn't accomplish was bad. (If you have a list of these supposed atrocities I'm all ears). I'm pointing to the inarguable fact that they were successful and effective and produced the greatest advancement in prosperity for working class people in history. If you are suggesting that there were hare-brained liberal schemes that were thwarted by conservative opposition in the period, please share some examples. Again, I'm not suggesting that either the liberals of the time or their programs were perfect. But I can still point to the period 1932\\\\~1968 when policy was dominated by liberal leadership and compare it to the period 1968\\\\~2024 when conservatives began steering policy and the largely disastrous change in outcomes from one to the other is unmistakeable. The conclusion one is to draw from this is that we might have done much better if that liberal momentum had suffered from less conservative friction.  What do we find after 50 years of conservative resurgence? Two financial crises exceeded only by the Great Depression, the injurious dissolution of anti-trust regulation, erosion of unions, worker protections, wages, civil rights. Housing and higher education moving ever further out of reach. Qanon idiocy and fear-mongering substituted for serious political discourse, the hollowing out of the middle class so that millionaires can reach into our pockets and become billionaires. A significant percentage of qualified voters are unhappy with a political party that does the bidding of oligarchs, that puts policy up for sale, that fails to advance and protect the interests of average working Americans. Lots of Trump supporters say that's why they voted for him, because they believe (in spite of all the evidence) that he's going to serve working people, lower their taxes, \\"drain the swamp.\\" In fact of the two parties the D's are the ones who fight (weakly) for working people. In fact, while Democrats are right in the swamp with Republicans, they don't wallow in it publicly and there is at least some agitation in the party to change conditions. And between the two, calls for making billionaires pay their share of the cost of civilization only comes from Dems. THAT is the direction the DNC needs to move in. Not performatively, not rhetorically. Fiercely. Moderates (Obama, Biden, Pelosi) don't believe in the New Deal. Centrists, Neoliberals will not save us. This is political opinion, not a fact.It's an opinion borne out by a survey of the performance of the two philosophies for the last century and an appreciation for the routine trajectory of radical right-wing movements across the globe in the same period.

Aside from that, LGBT Palestinians asylum seekers fleeing persecution from their religion are also given refugee rights.And on a side note, it may or may not be relevant, but iirc, a subset of Arabic people in and outside of Israel do not want Israeli citizenship because it's the same as recognizing Israel as a legitimate state.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"Saying wearing a seat belt and comparing that to the equivalent of a death threat is the reason for this conversation","title":"Why does the liberal left not see or care about the loss of individual rights?"},{"text":"I'm always am so interested in Representatives who previously served in the House coming back and how it affects seniority. I just like it because it makes some interesting factoids and with this cycle done we've got 3 Representatives returning to the House.Gil Cisneros in CA-31: Good ole Gil was first elected in 2018 when he defeated Young Kim in CA-39. Which led to one of my favorite moments in the old Blue Midterm 2018 history because before the election was called some weirdo conversative posted a picture of Young Kim on r/ pics calling her the first female Korean representative. The cons in the comments then circlejerked themselves and chided liberals for not talking about it. And then the votes kept coming in and Gil eventually emerged the victor in that race, leading to a response post on rpics by someone  with him. Unfortunately Gil was defeated by Kim in the rematch in 2020, leaving the house in 2021. Though he later joined the Biden Administration as an Under Secretary of Defense. He would leave the Biden Admin in fall of 2023, and announced he was running in the vacant CA-31; a race that he would later win. With one term in the House he'll be given seniority over the 2024 Freshmen but under those who were elected in special elections during the 118th congress.Marlin Stutzman in IN-03: Stutzman's got a rather interesting history of how he got into the house, he ran in the 2010 Republican primary for Senate where he placed second behind Dan Coats. However Stutzman's D.C dreams weren't squandered as the incumbent rep of IN-03 Mark Souder resigned after winning the primary due to an affair with a staffer. Stutzman was chosen to take his place on the ballot winning the simultaneous special/regular elections. He would be elected to two more terms until choosing to retire to run for Senate in 2016; losing to Todd Young and then disappearing from politics until 2023. With his successor running for Senate, Stutzman announced he would be running in the crowded primary for his old seat which he would narrowly win and later win the general election. Due to how seniority is calculated he would be credited with 3 terms if I'm correct (2010 Regular, 2012, 2014) so if I'm understanding the rules correctly I believe he would be given seniority over those elected 2020.Cleo Fields in LA-06: Probably one of the most unique cases of returning to the house that I've seen since I've started following politics. Fields was first elected in 1992 in LA-04 and was subsequently reelected to a second term in 1994. He would then run for governor of Louisiana in 1995 which at least according to his wikipedia page led to a lot of drama between him and future Senator Mary Landrieu, this loss and him being redistricted to LA-05 led to him not seeking a third term in 1996. Fields would return to the Louisiana state senate in 1997, later being revealed to have been caught on tape by the FBI accepting 20,000 dollars in cash from then governor Edwin Edwards though Fields was never indicted on any charges in the case. He'd serve in the State Senate until he was term limited in 2008, though he'd return to the state senate once again in 2020 after his successor was term limited. After LA was forced to make a second VRA compliant district in 2024, Fields jumped into the race on the same day for the new LA-06. Fields would clear 50 percent on election day avoiding a runoff despite the presence of 3 other democratic candidates leading to his return to US House after 27 years. Now I don't know everyone who's ever been elected to the House but I think Fields might hold the record for longest time between terms, the only other case like this I've seen is when Kweisi Mfume was reelected in 2020 after 24 years. But onto seniority Fields will be given credit for one term if I understand how seniority works so I believe he will be given seniority over those who were elected in 2022.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 9, 2024"},{"text":"#Satisfaction with the US healthcare system varies by insurance type78% -- Military/VA  \\n77% -- Medicare  \\n75% -- Medicaid  \\n69% -- Current or former employer  \\n65% -- Plan fully paid for by you or a family memberhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/186527/americans-government-health-plans-satisfied.aspx","title":"Rep.

I'm sure there are probably a handful of narrative styles that would be compelling. With the way I framed that it did come across as though that was the primary point. Really what I was trying to get at was that if a story is compelling, people are going to be more likely to buy into it and repeat it. The DvG argument is more intended as an example of that.I think its probably that Isreal/Palestine is a combination of a lot of key factors, including the David v Goliath aspect:A. The US is closely involved in backing Isreal, equally as much as almost any other country thats been involved in one of these conflicts in semi-recent history.In the comments under this post, the notion that US is funding/providing military backing to Israel has been invoked repeatedly as a driver of Israel's role in public consciousness. Honestly, I'm skeptical. While it is true that the US does that, that argument strikes me more as an artifact of the demonstrations highlighting those specific issues. I'm not sure that's more important than just the fact that Israel is generally perceived to be allied with the US by the general public. I strongly doubt if you asked your average citizen about funding/backing provided to Israel that they could speak to the *extent* of that funding/backing beyond just \\"the US supports them,\\" which is sort of a null statement given that one could say the exact same thing about any US ally.  In the absence of a more robust response than that being more common, I can't attribute changes in public discourse to those details.B. People can draw on themes regarding western colonialism which are very compelling in the zeitgeist. Isreal is, rightly or wrongly, seen as a western state, and to some extent Western colonialism draws more vitriol (understandably to some degree) and focus.Certainly true, and that framing may be a better descriptor of the narrative style that makes the current iteration of the conflict compelling enough to capture attention. I'd point out that even with that framework pitting the big bad colonizer against the victim of oppression is just a stones throw (*ba dum dum tsheee*) from the DvG narrative. C. Theres a lot of history related to this conflict that has been consistently in the news for decades. Its hard to say this is true of many other similar conflicts. Equally, a lot of Arabic states, and Arabic people, have a complicated relationship with Isreal and Jews and an extensive history of conflictAgreed. There is an extensive context to the current conflict. No disputes there.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"Do people actually believe that billionaires dont pay an enormous percentage of the taxes collected by the feds?","title":"The imbeciles are imbeciling so hard right now"},{"text":"I don't buy the reasoning the article gave for his win.

Some of that is plain old racism, some is due to the continuing impacts of colonial exploitation and how difficult most African states have had it with maintaining a well-functioning democracy, and some is probably truly due to a lack of heavily publicized Western interests there.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"A fascinating element of UK politics at the time was the rotten borough, basically areas of minimal or even zero population that for historical quirks got to send a Member to Parliament.It was pretty common at the time for large financial concerns, like the EIC, to just pay a landowner in a rotten borough to lean on the dozen folks there to vote for a specific MP, and then the group basically had a bought man in Parliament.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs","title":"Elon Musks Stunning $250 Million Favor to Trump Should Wake Up Dems"},{"text":"I can't see any problem with that level of concentration, only with how it got that way, and who is in charge of it.

The US really tends to favor late-stage and heavily interventional care, which performed by specialists who are paid an insane amount.  At the same time, groups such as the AMA have done a great job at restricting medical school and residency slots.Insurance restricting care and trying to override doctors looks really bad but the truth is that any sort of rework of the healthcare system, which is long overdue, is going to cause massive changes in how healthcare is administered and that is going to in turn cause massive blowback.  With the massive undersupply of doctors and different expectations of care in the US, change is going to have to be a long-term process, which is exactly what we tried to kick off with the ACA.  Dems have been trying to fundamentally change how the healthcare system works since at the least the 1970s (40s if you count what Truman tried) and it has quite literally blown up in their faces about once a decade, even when the reform passes.Edit: and as if he read my mind, Noah Smiths (whatever you think of him, he is a trained economist) [latest substack](https://substack.com/home/post/p-152827066) basically says the same thing (It's actually quite a good read).

They have a pretty big reach.","title":"Elon Musks Stunning $250 Million Favor to Trump Should Wake Up Dems"},{"text":"Bingo. While journalists keep focusing on the investigation and hunting down this person, lets not forget the real issue - the long list of problems with United Healthcare and also these super big corporations in general:1. UnitedHealthcare has the highest rate of denials of the major US health insurance companies. They literally deny around a third of all claims, at a rate twice as high as the average in the health insurance industry ([source](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/05/data/unitedhealthcare-claim-denial-rates/)).2. Even after this assassination, the CEO of the parent company, UnitedHealth Group - a person named Andrew Witty - defended sticking to a high rate of claim denials in a leaked video ([source](https://fortune.com/2024/12/09/unitedhealth-ceo-andrew-witty-brian-thompson-claims-denials/)).3. UnitedHealth Group is run irresponsibly. Their subsidiary company, Change Healthcare was responsible for a completely avoidable hack where they didnt even use two factor authentication to secure the *medical records* of over 100 million Americans. All of this extremely private and sensitive information was stolen, and all United/Change have done in response is offer credit monitoring to victims of their failure. They refuse to tell affected patients what information of theirs was stolen. No one has been fined or gone to jail for this incredibly damaging breach ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-hacked-millions-health-records-ransomware/)).4. There is a two tier justice system that is upheld by politicians at every level. Think about how many local, state, and federal police officers, detectives, etc have been deployed to investigate this murder. Around half of New York City are unsolved. Why should this person get any more resources in solving their murder compared to everyone else who is a victim? Would most New York City or state residents support spending hard earned taxpayer money on this one murder? Personally I doubt it but despite the way this looks, New York Citys mayor claims that they are not treating this investigation differently from anyone else ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1h9tcnm/eric_adams_we_would_do_it_for_any_new_yorker/)).5. This isnt just about healthcare. Its about large companies that have so much money and power that they are not facing any kind of competition that would pressure them into acting differently. They are too embedded into the system, too rich, too influential, and are part of the donor class. There is no realistic accountability for them. Untied Healthcare is under antitrust investigation, but the current laws for antitrust are so badly written that the government cant easily prove their cases and win in courts. These super big companies can drag these investigations out for years. This CEO that was killed actually committed insider trading and sold $15m of stock before the public and shareholders were informed of the ongoing antitrust investigation ([source](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-insider-trading-lawsuit_n_6751a2abe4b01129dffa8789)). Forget the 1% - or even the top 0.1%. The real wealth and power is by an even smaller group, the 0.01%. They can commit mass murder through unethical business practices or break insider trading laws or violate antitrust and face zero consequences. This has to change.","title":"Ro Khanna: Brian Thompson killing was horrific but people arent getting care they need"},{"text":"Truthfully I dont see any other message to take away from this election.","title":"Elon Musks Stunning $250 Million Favor to Trump Should Wake Up Dems"},{"text":"Well, they didn't want to be communists you see.","title":"Obamacare approval on the rise, new Gallup survey finds"},{"text":"Don't underestimate them.","title":"Elon Musks Stunning $250 Million Favor to Trump Should Wake Up Dems"},{"text":"I agree give those ignorant, uneducated ass wipes what they deserve!","title":"I say to the Democrats \\"do everything you can to make his presidency a failed one and miserable to the American people!\\""},{"text":"The amount of Billionaire $$ thats up for grabs!

Nuclear cost is better suited for public sector while private could do it but gen 3 is still a bit pricy (it can be lowered especially AP1000 while Korean with APR1400 do it better for example). Renewables have a low basic LCOE (so low initial and running cost) but remains high cost when firming and battery included (battery scenario is unrealistic except V2G). Also comparing cost between each isnt that simple, especially because 1GW capacity of wind or solar will never produce as much as nuclear. Guaranteed availability need to be count in, for example, typically, to have 1GW available 90% of the time, nuclear necessitate 1.7GW of capacity while wind would need 18GW of capacity on the grid, to compare initial price, offshore wind park of 1GW cost between 1,5 and 3 billions of euros, in comparison the worst french EPR cost was 19 billion. 18GW of offshore wind would cost 27 billion. another comparison is the price of Barakah plant (4 APR1400) was 22,5 billion of euros","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"I hear what you're saying and not advocating for civil war.

FWIW I think Yemen has actually gotten a good deal of coverage, it's just that there's not a clear 'good guy' from the typical Western Media perspective. At least in the media I consume there was a degree of fanfare when Biden halted arms sales to the Saudis at least partially over their conduct in Yemen, and people report on the humanitarian crisis there every now and then, but the fact that the alternative to the Saudi backed government is the Houthis puts a damper on things to some extent. People also 100% talked and talk quite a lot about Syria and Turkey's involvement, I feel it was one of the more publicized conflicts in recent memory. Regardless, conflicts in the middle east tend to be reduced in media to multiple groups of innately barbarous savages killing each other, it's not as bad as the presentation of Africa but it's not good.Sudan is a genuine blindspot and it's where the racism comes mostly into play; Africa is the Dark Continent where genocide and destructive wars are treated by Western Media as just a fact of life, the people there have no civilization or culture in their eyes, so ultimately what happens to them barely matters at all. It's why the destructive and genocidal war in Tigray was likewise little discussed, they're Africans and they barely count as people, let alone them deserving airtime. It's only if there's little else going on or if a crisis really spills over into an area that some western power has an interest in that there is a chance for some attention. I would also say with respect to the UAE, their involvement in Sudan is almost entirely below-board and attention has been drawn to it (iirc Macklemore pulled out of a concert over it). The UAE has other controversies as well, like over half of their population being slaves, so even if they're unaware of their actions in Sudan it's not like the UAE is not criticized.Is it purely ignorance or is it more sinister antisemitism or something else entirely?Prior to last October, Israel's treatment of Palestinians was a very niche subject in spite of massive escalations of violence in the West Bank by the IDF and Israeli settlers the year-ish prior. Outside of expressly leftist or Middle Eastern outlets it was uncommon to hear of Israeli actions in the West Bank, and you'd never see much at all about Gaza. I think the simplest answer is that Israel is a pet subject for many Americans specifically for a variety of reasons so it gets a lot of coverage. It also helps that the very recent trend in American culture has moved away from the full-throated support for Israel you'd see in prior years, and more towards a contested (though non-partisan, yet) subject; as it is no longer a subject with a neat consensus, you can basically guarantee *some* viewership by reporting on the issue.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"This isn't anything new.

Both of which can be explained without even mentioning the LNP or labour. The liberals supposedly using nuclear as a delay tactic is pure political trash talk. There is nothing to suggest this is the case. Only an accusation that came from the Labour energy minister to influence the debate using pre-conceived notions about the liberal party. I will respond to both points here. Firstly, just because a technology isnt viable for the private sector, does not mean it isnt viable for the consumer. As far as I am aware, there isnt a single privately built and owned nuclear reactor anywhere (I may be wrong and am happy to be corrected). Every single nuclear generation company is partly or wholly government owned. There is good reason for this. The most obvious reason is that nuclear technology is sensitive and needs more government control. Secondly, private companies dont invest in nuclear because the return on investment is poor. Note that this does not mean that consumer power prices will be higher. If the capital cost of something is high, and the retail cost is low, the ROI will be poor and slow, and thats unattractive to investors. This is one of the problems with the Gen Cost report, as it uses essentially an investors mathematical tool (LCOE) to show that renewables are cheaper. Cheaper for the investor? Absolutely. Cheaper for the consumer? Not necessarily. We also know that the reactors are going to be government owned and funded, so the opinion of the private sector is quite irrelevant here. If the reactors are government owned and funded then they dont need to recoup the costs. As for the states Commonwealth law supersedes and state law that is inconsistent with it, and this is a power that is prescribed by the constitution of Australia (sections 109). This is why the commonwealth government can legally plonk down a nuclear waste disposal facility for the AUKUS submarines wherever they want, regardless of if state law bans said facilities or not.When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"Wake up dems.

Similarly with the UAE, efforts have been made to cut support so long as the UAE continues to support the RSF, though Ill note that such support is much less direct than the US support for the Saudis or Israel.

Often times components are made overseas and assembled here which is a pretty flimsy made in America story.Tariffs increase the cost to bring an item into the country. Theoretically this affects every item equally, but in practice things are assessed at different rates or excluded. When the cost to bring something in rises, that expense is passed to the consumer. No company on a capitalist economy is going to voluntarily eat that cost increase as a favor to consumers.The tariff plan has been debunked by many economic scholars who have done some extensive writing about it. One of the underlying problems besides labor laws is that the U.S. simply doesnt have the resources to produce many things. Putting tariffs on goods that we cannot produce ourselves means we are forced to continue importing at a higher price. The general idea is that this will spur companies to bring manufacturing home. The problem is it doesnt work because those companies pass the price increase along, dont change any part of their production, and consumers pay the difference.","title":"Why Bidenomics Was Such a Bust"},{"text":"Can I use images of DJT to sell adult diapers?","title":"Trump uses image of Jill Biden to sell his perfumes and colognes"},{"text":"Ive been asking the same question for years.

I just want to know what the truth is.\\nWe could argue that tariffs will not work and companies will just use them to justify higher prices, but is the basic principal there atleast? If we want domestic manufacturing to return, don't we need to address the slave labor elephant in the room?\\nIf we don't want manufacturing to return, then how is every American expected to make a living?

There's a reason every strip mall in an average city could sell you a pocket sized tao te ching, a prayer flag, and Baoding balls in one transaction. So when China is clamping down on Tibet, their clamping down on something easily accessible and familiar. That's going to elicit an \\"I like this thing, and this thing is under threat\\" reaction. It's certainly a reaction to the level of oppression, but the closeness and familiarity of it is what helps keep that going. With the Palestinian conflict, this has been part of the international conversation for decades. Further Israel self as a Jewish state necessarily invokes things like the way Jews have been treated historically (centuries of antisemitism, holocaust, etc). Both of these narratives area already closely woven into parts of western society, so they're probably more likely to form the zeitgeist than say the issue with the UAE &amp; South Sudan. **Narrative**With both the Tibet issue, and the Palestinian issue You've got a big bad nation state against a non-state little guy. While Tibet is a nation state, the narratives around that were more about the oppression of religious groups rather than really the state as a whole. Probably a bit of an infantilization of Tibet in that case.In any case, David vs goliath narratives are super useful for holding peoples attention. Ukraine is probably a really good example of this. Huge difference in the level of attention there at the beginning  vs now. It starts out as \\"comedian president transforms into rugged hero to protect the nation from big bad Russia\\" to the state of Ukraine against the apparent military equal of Russia. It's just more boring for people, so people are going to be easily distracted/attracted to other more compelling narratives.**Bandwidth argument**Regardless of whether its familiarity or narrative style, people are only going to be able to focus so much at a time. One just can't focus on everything everywhere all at once, so *something* is going to bias them into concentrating on one thing or another. In a world where both familiar and unfamiliar conflicts are occurring simultaneously, its only natural that those that are more familiar are more likely to capture peoples attention.

If there were no Zionists in the U.S., and Israel was just another U.S.-aligned criminal state in the Middle East, it would receive proportional attention, and the conversation could move on to the question of whether the U.S. should be conducting genocide *at all*, rather than whether it should be conducting *this particular* genocide.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"I have been trying to tell the left come to the table and work to help  reality is keep doing what you're doing and it helps us secure elections","title":"Trump Preps Bloodbath on Federal Death Row As Advocates Beg Biden for Mercy"},{"text":"Kyle Rittenhouse killed someone too.","title":"What happens if/when the CEO assassin is caught?"},{"text":"Every US politician and diplomat in the last 50 years would have loved to be the one to create peace in the middle east.

Monolithic treatment of groups leads to such beliefs that nobody dares stand up to, or else they're sexist.I think the core issue, though, is that you're taking their comments too literally. When I read of this conversation, it just seemed like sharing shared experiences and the purpose was venting. The human brain isn't wired for truth, it's wired for self-preservation. One of the most pressing elements of that is belonging to a group. We're very social creatures. Just because people aren't saying \\"well actually\\" or trying to get an objective truthiness doesn't mean they all agree with the LITERAL meaning of the words little alone abstracted out to the logical conclusions. They're not really meaning what the literal words mean. Here: often when I extend sympathy I am treated with disrespect. I wouldn't get it because I don't have periods, because I'm not black, because I'm not a woman, etc.This also seems to be more examples where you're missing the point in conversations. When someone vents, people have two general tacts. One is to say \\"me too\\" and you think you're showing solidarity. But, some people think you're invalidating *the uniqueness of their experience*. In short, they don't want solidarity, they want acceptance. And you're rejecting them. Two, of course, is they want solidarity with you.The difference is context and having some EQ about you.

Russia up and invaded Ukraine and are clearly the aggressor, and that makes it easy to say \\"Russia is the bad guys, so we will root for Ukraine.\\" 4) Ukraine and Russia are relatively modern and \\"civilized\\" (*coughcoughWhitecoughcough*) which means people are more likely to empathize or see it as something that could happen to them. 5) There is a sizeable chunk of religious people who literally think Israel is going to kick off the big smash ending of their holy book, so they watch wars there closely. 6) There is a significant amount of people who see the Israel/Palestine conflict as \\"civilization vs evil Muslim terrorists.\\" There is another significant chunk that see it as \\"evil white colonists vs innocent brown civilian victims.\\" The war applies to both their worldviews, so they are invested. 7) I do personally know lots of people who care about China's treatment of various peoples within and outside their border, but China doesn't give a shit what anyone here thinks.

The idea stems back to a clean/unclean dichotomy. God is holy/clean/good; anything that opposes him is unnatural/unclean/bad. God as the epitome of all good must smite evil or wipe it away. Sinning against God isnt just being naughty to them; it puts that being in direct contradiction to the forces of good: they are now unnatural/unclean/evil until made clean again. The only way to make something clean again is death: blood sacrifice. In the Old Testament, this was animal sacrifices at the temple; in the New Testament this is supposedly superseded by Jesus sacrifice and death. So: boiling that mindset back down to your question. Death Row is killing people whove sinned - in that state they are an unnatural affront to God, pure evil, unclean corruption. Fetuses have had no chance to sin, so they are in a state of purity/good/holiness (like god) and should never be harmed.  Now you might ask If Jesus sacrifice supersedes the need for blood sacrifice and weve all been made clean before god, why does that selectively not seem to apply to Death Row inmates, LGBT folks, mothers out of wedlock, etc?

Here's some example: [https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-south-sudan](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-south-sudan)But if groups like UNMISS aren't enough, and the people who write white papers, or whatever, and you want a US-centric and US-lead campaign, then we should talk about how do awareness campaigns occur and what level is legitimate.For better or worse, people care about things that impact them and the urgency is the directness of the impact. For South Sudan, how many sitting members of Congress have large Sudanese constituents? How many companies in the US have a lot of trade there? How many Sudanese people have moved to the US? All these same questions but for the counter parties to the Sudanese conflict?Then you contrast that to the Palestinian conflict. There's more direct constituents for both Palenstine and for Israel. There's more US strategic work for the region. Many US Presidents staked their legacies on trying to create an accord. Lastly as narratives - Sudan has two warring generals. Africa in general is seen as constant chaos and warfare. Gaza has narrative lenses that you read teh struggle between. Like Hegemon vs. small powers, or anti-semitism; in the US, you have a contingent of religious people that project onto the importance of who controls Jerusalem and the second coming of Christ.

One, UAE is not doing the genocide, they're supporting a government engaged in a war. With Israel its more complicated because the US is giving them weapons which is illegal by US law if Israel is using those weapons to commit war crimes. Supporting a country who's supporting another country who's doing a genocide is definitely not morally great, but diplomatically and legally its not the same thing. For example, the US supports India, India trades with Russia is the US therefore supporting Russia against Ukraine? I've never seen anything on my feed or on any random subreddit about Saudi Arabia's war in YemenI certainly was, and so were many people on the left. Part of the problem was a lot of it happened under obama and liberal democrats tend to be just as cultish in supporting their candidates as maga does. But everyone left of the democrats (who tend to be the same people protesting the Israeli situation) was definitely opposed. The major point here is that this isn't just a conflict, most countries today recognize that greater Israel (Israel proper, Gaza and the westbank) is one apartheid state controlled by Israel, rather than what Israel presents it as, a war between two states. Rightly or wrongly, people tend to view crimes against ones own people (or people under your control such as what Saddam did to the Kurds) than crimes committed between rival states.","title":"CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts."},{"text":"Exactly.

No one has the right to arbitrarily take another's life. However, when an individual deliberately violates this right, such as through murder or other heinous acts, they forfeit their own claim to it. Capital punishment, in such cases, becomes not only acceptable but a moral imperative for justice and deterrence.As a result, no one has the right to take that away. Now, when someone decides they have that right, be it a murderer acting in cold blood, someone who gets heated and draws a knife, a \\"robbery gone wrong\\" (which is an asinine concept to begin with,) or a drunk driver who was far too careless in his actions and takes someone else's rights to life away. They then lose their own right to life. Thus, submitting them to execution is perfectly acceptable and arguably the moral thing to do. (I would personally rather be executed than life for 50-60 years in prison with no chance of leaving.)Execution should be reserved for the gravest offenses, applied with the utmost care to avoid misuse or wrongful conviction. While a justice system must be cautious, the death penalty serves a dual purpose: as a punishment for those who irreparably harm others and as a safeguard against recidivism.In cases of self-defense, where ones right to life is directly threatened by anothers actions, the use of lethal force can be justified. The distinction lies in the immediacy of the threat and the absence of intent to violate another's rights outside self-preservation.By contrast, the innocent, such as unborn infants, have committed no such violations and thus retain their unassailable right to life. Justice requires that punishment aligns with guilt, not with the circumstance of existence. Thus, abortion is murder.","title":"Trump Preps Bloodbath on Federal Death Row As Advocates Beg Biden for Mercy"},{"text":"We give Saudi Arabia roughly $2M in foreign assistance, and it all takes the form of operating expenses for specific programs that we run in the country.

I'm all in favor of it if, and only if, we can be certain of the crimes and the guilt of the accused. There is enormous incompetence and outright abuse of the justice system and under those circumstances judicially sanctioned executions are highly likely to result in the tax-payer funded murder of innocent citizens as well as the escape of the guilty.I believe that there are indeed people who deserve to die and I shed no tears when they do. I believe that our justice system regularly fails in identifying those people and sparing the innocent. Street justice, on the other hand, is famously unjust, notorious for killing innocents and vigilanteism can never be tolerated. But in a nation where the rule of law does not apply to the very, very wealthy, where even their legal, sanctioned businesses openly profit from the pain, suffering and death of others, when those very, very wealthy people are entirely unaccountable to their victims or society at large and the damage they cause isn't even classed as criminal, vigilanteism is inevitable. In a society where the rule of law is applied evenly to everyone vigilanteism is shocking. In the nation we've become vigilanteism should sadly come as no surprise. As a society can we afford to tolerate it? Absolutely not. But we can do without the pearl-clutching. Mark Blyth described democracy as an asset protection plan for the wealthy. This is what happens when the wealthy tear it down.","title":"CMV: If you believe people deserve to die because of their actions, you are in essence in support of capital punishment"},{"text":"Oh, look, a new one.","title":"Biden officials race to help stabilize Syria after regime collapse.

Maybe if she got 30% people would feel better about her basically being appointed, but 3%? It just fed into the whole \\"She's a DEI hire\\" narrative the right was peddling. I can't put my finger on it but there isn't something quite right with herThere were a lot of things not to like about here though. Her interviews sucked for instance. When people started hearing her speak more, the less they liked her. She had a significant lead after her debate with Trump according to polls but around early October when she went on her media blitz, the polls starting dropping her lead. She liked to flipflop on issues and give non-committal answers. The only people who really liked her were already hardcore democrats and, well, obviously black women. She lost ground with basically every other group compared to 2020. Makes sense she wasn't likable though given she only won 3% of her primary vote in 2020. This isn't racism or sexism, this is Kamala just not being a good candidate. In fact, it seems like the only group that liked her was the group that shared her race and sex. That's bias for your own kind if anything. We had so many great politicians to choose from, and we elected the old white man.We had so many great politicians to choose from, why did we run Kamala?The sooner democrats just admit they fucked up with running her, the better.

We could absolutely go back to before that when it was cheap. A populist campaign could easily run on cutting defense spending, literally tens of billions of which just goes into the pockets of private contractors who don't actually sell anything to the military or create anything of value. It's a black hole of money that lots of people would love to see cut, but won't happen because liberals and right-wing populists are too tied to our current economic system and get donations from wealthy Private contractors. Different types of schools are not a solution to the increasing costs of college. They train you for completely different things, and increasing access to college not only leads to a more educated workforce down the line, but a workforce more capable of building personal and generational wealth, and enough people in the workforce to support something like a universal health care system, which is a left-wing populist policy. But if barely anyone can afford to get educated to be a doctor, we won't have enough doctors for that. Obviously just for giving student loans as things are and getting rid of them would make things more expensive for everyone else, but that's just like saying Obamacare is bad because it made insurance premiums rise for everyone with health insurance. You're missing the forest for the trees, the problem with this system isn't the public spending, which is good for everybody, it's the greed of private entities that want to create artificial barriers to entry for poor people. Student loan forgiveness is a step in the right direction to making college cheaper. Any major economic change has a period of tumult where things will probably get more expensive and rougher for people for several years, but sometimes that's necessary in order to make things better after that. I'm in favor of left-wing populism, it seems like the only type of populism you're aware of is the right-wing populism we've seen over the last decade or so. Left-wing populist policies helped to pull the United States out of the greatest economic depression in modern world history. We can absolutely do that again, but it's going to take some serious changes to the way we run our system.","title":"CMV: Jon Stewart will be a Ronald Reagan for the Democrats in 2028."},{"text":"Old school progressives too.","title":"President Biden Should Issue a Blanket Pardon of Undocumented Immigrants: Protecting Trumps enemies from prosecution just reinforces the idea of politics as retribution.

This is a function of human intelligence. It's been a survival technique for as long as we've been alive. In the past, it was things like \\"fruits that look like &lt;x make you sick, so don't eat those\\", and \\"water that isn't clear doesn't taste good and/or will make you sick\\". Do those rules ALWAYS work out? Hell no. But they work better than treating everything as if it was a unique instance with it's own behaviours and rules. Following those generalizations led to improved survival for the rule followers, so that reinforced the ability to generalize.What you are rightfully pointing out is that generalization can be incorrect. And, when applied to human behaviour, frequently IS incorrect. But, it tends to still lead to better survival rates for those that generalize. Looking at your examples, I can generally explain WHY each of those generalizations exist through that lens.* Men are rapists - not all men are rapists, but rapists look like and act like ALL other men, right up until the moment they rape women* Men wouldn't understand women's struggles - not all men fail to understand, but given that men never have to deal with a vast swath of women's day-to-day challenges, issues, health, or social pressures, a lot of men don't understand. And even when they make an attempt to do so, they can't fully understand **because they haven't been socialized as a woman, lived as a woman, and been dismissed offhand because of it**. * Men are privileged - we are (I'm male, and aware that I'm privileged). Men don't have to worry about 90% of what women have to pay attention to **every minute of their lives** - I never worry about the Door Dash guy raping me, or about an Uber driver taking me to a secluded location. I don't have people coming up to me in the coffee shop, while I have my headphones on, to talk to me. I don't have to worry about the government forcing me to grant access to my bodily organs for 9 months at a time, against my will. These are all privileges. My ideas at work are taken seriously, even if they're half formed musings out loud. People move out of my way on the sidewalk, most of the time. And if I get into a verbal altercation with a friend or lover, I don't tend to have to worry about them hauling off and backhanding me. **THESE ARE ONLY SOME OF THE THE PRIVILEGES THAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE PRIVILEGED Women are cheaters - some women ARE cheaters **as are some men**. People can be terrible partners. People cheat for a lot of reasons - boredom, abuse, different levels of commitment, socialization, previous experiences, etc.  Sucks for the non-cheating people they get into relationships with, though. Treating every future partner as a potential cheater IS an attempt at survival though - \\"if you expect the worst, you're never disappointed, just pleasantly surprised. It's a tactic that tends to fail, frequently spectacularly - and damages the loyal partner, and blows up what could be a good relationship. * Women don't block male friends that clearly interested* - This is related to the previous statement re: cheating, and also the response re: men being privileged. What do you think happens when a woman blocks a man that is clearly interested in her? They don't ALL just go away quietly. Some percentage of them will begin to try to reach out via other means, or accuse the woman of leading them on, or attempt to apply social pressures to get them to add them back. Some will confront them in person about being unfairly cut off. Some will act out in more violent or invasive ways - stalking, physical confrontations, and more. **And there is no clear way to identify how a man will react before you cut him off**. The mildest mannered geek could make her life a living hell. Thus, it is a survival tactic to not arbitrarily cut off men. (Admittedly, some people like the ego-boost of having someone indicate - subtly or otherwise - that they are desirable. Men and women both react positively to that stimulus - but if you don't trust your partner to be faithful, why are you with them?)This kind of analysis of generalizations can be useful for many other demographics, as well, although it has to be said that there are also generalizations that are made **in an attempt to either gain or maintain power and power structures**. A number of racist beliefs and statements have nothing to do with survival, and more to do with maintenance of power - which, now that I think of it, can be further analyzed as an attempt to ensure a particular group's survival over that of other groups. Humans are tribal, and want to be part of the tribe that has the power. (Which sucks, but it is what it is...)I get that it can hurt, being part of a demographic group that's being disparaged. If someone is punching down at that group (e.g. CIS White Billionaires making statements about how \\"nobody wants to work any more\\"), then you can take them with a grain of salt. If they are punching up at the group (e.g. women making statements like \\"men are passing legislation that takes away my bodily autonomy\\") , then pay attention to what they're saying - **and don't be like that negative statement**. It's a constant dance of figuring out what does and doesn't apply to you. tl;dr - Human intelligence is built on the most powerful generalization engine in nature, and while it may be painful to be associated with people that are being slagged, it's a normal, and inevitable thing that will happen.","title":"CMV: Society unjustly treats demographics too much like a monolith and leads to negative effects"},{"text":"Seeing them speak together feels comforting in a world that has gone completely batty.","title":"Bernie Sanders &amp; Jon Stewart discuss the urgent need for Medicare to negotiate priced on all prescription drugs!"},{"text":"Why they need it Trump gonna pardon them day one?","title":"Why is the DOJ not releasing how many secret service agents and under cover FBI agents were mixed with the January 6 crowd.

Aside from the presumption of innocence question, the issue of punishment of the guilty is not part of the reasoning.Basically, all of my beliefs around what the government should or should not do with respect to the punishment of criminal offenses rests on two principles:(1) for there to be a civil society, the government must have the power to investigate and punish criminal offenses.(2) for there to be a liberal society (not left-leaning, but rather, the opposite of autocratic), the power of the government must be strictly constrained at every step of the justice department.I do not believe criminal justice should ever be about moral judgements, but about legal ones.It is not inconsistent to believe that someone is morally deserving of a punishment but that the government should be constrained from acting on moral decisions  and/or administering it.","title":"CMV: If you believe people deserve to die because of their actions, you are in essence in support of capital punishment"},{"text":"Will the media blame Biden for not acting now if Trump does follow through on his threats to jail his political enemies?Or will the media accuse Biden of abusing his executive power by preemptively pardoning all of Trumps political enemies?","title":"Biden must act now to block Trumps retribution threats"},{"text":"Not hardly.

Even in the most authoritarian of countries, there is an opposition; there is a human spirit that just cannot be suppressed forever.Republicans are going to over-read their mandate. Say what you will about the federal bureaucracy, but their attempts to strike terror in everyday employees of the civil service are heartless, and reform should not involve dumping tens of thousands of people into unemployment all at once. People don't want deregulation if that means giving even more power to the petty tyrants in their lives: the boss, some distant for-profit-health-insurance bean counter getting between you and your doctor, people colluding to extract more and more rent from working families.After Trump's second term, there may be no return to the *status quo ante*. People aren't going to sign up for civil-service jobs if they know their job will be in jeopardy four years later if another Republican is elected who wants to take a wrecking ball to the federal government again. Institutional knowledge will be dispersed.Democrats have valiantly defended our nation's institutions, imperfect as they may be. They worked hard to empower workers and take on concentrated corporate power. Unfortunately, our very system of checks and balances makes it hard to deliver quick, drastic relief as misery and precarity worked their way up socio-economic strata. But if these norms and institutions have already been torn down, something different would come next.Our society has come out of balance. Ayn Rand offers the rich and powerful seductive conceit: nihilism and mirror Marxism. All of us stand on the shoulders of giants; we all depend on the hard work of those who came before and those around us; none of us emerged, perfect and fully formed, like Athena from Zeus. Ingenuity and hard work should be rewarded, but everyone needs to be able to live with dignity and a basic sense of security in their lives.Look to Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt. They relished the fight, and that's what we're going to need: people who are willing to break through old ideologies and old coalitions to focus on what matters most. And the goal is simple: to eliminate that misery and precarity and to invest in the future. If Democrats want to win again, their decisions should be locked like a compass needle on that, and like FDR before them, they're going to need to be bolder, more creative, and most of all, willing to fight harder (both moneyed interests within their party and without).

Thanks to Anthem, I now know what it's like to survive a murder attempt.And yeah, there were two just...hilarious stalling bits that especially stand out.First time, they denied medical necessity for the surgery. So we had to go to the #1 specialist in the world on the issue (not in network so this was pricy) to get them to argue with the insurance doctor. Insurance doctor had no expertise in this field at all and was still insisting the #1 ranked doc in the world for this field was incorrect this was medically necessary.Second, we were applying for an out-of-network exception because only 5 surgeons in the world performed this exact surgery if you had my husband's specific condition. They're supposed to auto-approve if the nearest in-network is over 100 miles away and our nearest was 500 miles away. Plus my husband's spine was deteriorating fast and he couldn't travel. They approved the out-of-network exception and then changed their mind 48h before the surgery and un-approved. Too late for us to have any chance at an appeal.The reason they declined was they supposedly found other doctors in the area who were in-network who could perform (we knew for a fact there weren't). They were *supposed* to provide us the names of the people they found so we could follow up. No names were provided and it took over a month of continuous phone calls for us to get those names. And then when I followed up by calling those offices, they did not perform the procedures at all. Turns out the insurance *asked about a totally different procedure than the one we were getting*. Still haven't sorted that out after months of phone calls.If you added up all the time people (me, husband, insurance agents, doctor, doctor's office admin staff, etc...) have spent on this stupid bullshit and just paid it to me at my usual hourly rate, that would cover the surgery and we wouldn't even need insurance. Oh and did I mention that you only have 3 months to appeal after getting the surgery? So all the ridiculous time stalling they're doing...","title":"Ro Khanna: Brian Thompson killing was horrific but people arent getting care they need"},{"text":"I, for one, cant wait to see if youre right","title":"Trump uses image of Jill Biden to sell his perfumes and colognes"},{"text":"Its what you voted for","title":"Trump uses image of Jill Biden to sell his perfumes and colognes"},{"text":"Exactly ??","title":"Trump uses image of Jill Biden to sell his perfumes and colognes"},{"text":"DOGE will say that $264k is a waste of government funds while the $10M is totally ok since its a private company.Heck, theyll say let that CEO oversee Medicare for $15M after further corporate tax cuts.","title":"Obamacare approval on the rise, new Gallup survey finds"},{"text":"The last thing I would ever do is use a cologne that smells like a shit stained diaper wearing old man.

They made Trump sound like Hitler 2.0, which he most certainly isnt. Joe Rogan had a big audience, but thats not what shifted the whole country rightwards. Its the messaging, plain and simple. People do not want kids being sterilized by puberty blockers . People dont like seeing 9 year olds performing drag routines. People dont like seeing drag queens at elementary schools. People dont like seeing trumped prosecuted on property law that was twisted in ways never used before. The NY lawsuit was insane, a Business deal that stated explicitly the bank was to do its own due diligence with regards to the value of trumps property, and they did, and they loaned trump money which he then paid back, and all the parties were happy come on. The documents case against him, while Joe Biden was guilty of the same thing, but too senile to stand trial.  Yes I know the minimizers sayoh but trump was way worse because he didnt return them when asked immediately but at the end of the day they both broke the same law. The nonsense about our democracy under attack when democrats are openly screaming about packing the court, and killing the filibuster. January 6th was bad, but no worse than cities burning during BLM. Dont take my word for it look at the polls on the topic. Trump asked Pelosi for national guard troops for January 6th and was denied. \\n \\nThe simple fact that democrats appear to be ok with millions of illegals pouring in, and all of the malfeasance that takes place with it. Rapist and killers roaming our streets, people with no skill and no economic value flooding across to take advantage of our public systems that we already cant pay for. The whole world is sick of mass migration and this is just the beginning of that. The amount of hypocrisy is at an all time high. Bidens son was actually guilty of a crime, and the DOJ tried to cut him a sweetheart deal so outlandish and unprecedented that the judge was like WTF is this and then Biden saying how he respected the law and courts, then dropping a BLANKET Pardon for 10 years. The Steele dossier, that we spent millions of dollars and an impeachment over, that ended up being funded by Hillary Clinton, and was bunk. \\nDemocrats have also become the party of censorship. If you dont strictly adhere to all the ideologies of the woke left then you are cast out. If you say something as simple as boys cant become girls on a democrat ran platform like Bluesky or Facebook or Reddit you will be silenced. If youre a nazi incel , or a marxism supporter I dont care, you should be free to say what you think, and be ridiculed for it. This was greatly amplified by the Covid censorship where true facts was labeled misinformation and banned from the public forum. I consider myself fairly centrist, and Ive seen this coming for a long time. Youre excluding anyone who doesnt agree with EVERYTHING that is leftist, and that bubble will shrink the further left you go. It excluded me years ago, Democrats have been subverted by woke activist and its sad to see.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Pinged EUROPE ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20EUROPE&amp;message=subscribe%20EUROPE) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20EUROPE&amp;message=unsubscribe%20EUROPE) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=EUROPE&amp;count=5))Pinged POLAND ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20POLAND&amp;message=subscribe%20POLAND) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20POLAND&amp;message=unsubscribe%20POLAND) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=POLAND&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Polish, Baltic presidents condemn crackdown on protesters in Georgia"},{"text":"The denial is hilarious.","title":"Joe Rogan: House Report on Covid Pandemic Proves Every Conspiracy Theory Was Correct"},{"text":"Im okay with reporting any vaccine saved lives.

Democrats have policies that sound good, are better than Republicans, and leave a better record to run on. Theres just an execution problem in bringing it all together under charismatic advocates that have a clear vision people can imagine.I dont even think Harris had to shift to the left, I just think the base and independents open to Democrats have a harder time understanding what theyre advocating for. So many start more left when campaigning locally before moving to the center or even the right the longer a national spotlight is on them.Even those policies are still better than Republicans, but it becomes less clear to people what the bigger goal is beyond defeating Republicans. Especially when Republicans will use the earlier positions and the shift to portray Democrats as secretly more extreme than they actually are. Ironically its Republicans who use more less extreme rhetoric to cover more extreme positions while Democrats actually do end up supporting their own moderate compromises.  Find effective ways to get people away from Republicans.I think we solve this problem with the same general approach of becoming clearer, but being more conscious of how our messaging is going to land with different demographics. For example the rights case to men is in openly praising what we call toxic masculinity and claiming its necessary for restoring social order after the last few decades of rapid changes. A lot of boys and young men are brought to the right because they provide a clear way to feeling valuable by reinforcing old gender expectations. For the left to cut into that, they need to figure out how their platform gives young men opportunities to be valued and express masculinity in a healthy way, and then elevate symbols and advocates that reinforce that instead of old gender expectations. If we have a clear core vision, we just need to make sure the messaging and policies are being adapted for different audiences. Addressing everyones concerns individually without a clear central theory of what the problems are and what we want to do about it makes our own job much harder.","title":"Tim Walz surprised that he and Kamala Harris lost election to Donald Trump"},{"text":"If you have nothing to hide, aren't you advocating for a waste of taxpayer money?

Isn't calling her a 'race traitor' exactly a symptom of the issue at hand? I am certain that you have some kind of a point there, I'm just not quite understanding it - maybe it's been a long day on my end.If Post-Structuralists who ascribe to the feminist theory of Intersectionalism genuinely believed in Intersectionalism, the way that they interact with a person like Candace Owens would be markedly different from the way that they interact with Straight White Males that they disagree with like Gaven McInnes. -- For the record I despise both of these people. -- The difference should be to see McInnes as contemptible for reinforcing the patriarchy and to see Candace Owens as a victim of systemic violence and oppression who has chosen a path out of that misery by reinforcing the patriarchy. Therefore, we should see revulsion towards McInnes and pity towards Owens because while we may criticize the choice of an oppressed person, we know that their choice is meaningfully constrained by the oppression surrounding them. But Candace Owens is treated no differently than McInnes, which means that a person who is a \\"race traitor\\" suddenly exists outside of the Intersectional system, as if Owens were a Straight White Male. This calls into question the systemic racism that forms a key part of Intersectional Theory if a person can simply opt out of the oppression.","title":"CMV: Society unjustly treats demographics too much like a monolith and leads to negative effects"},{"text":"The people that Brian Thomson killed with his policies was horrific and people aren't getting the care they paid for.?","title":"Ro Khanna: Brian Thompson killing was horrific but people arent getting care they need"},{"text":"Part 1\\\\ I am not 'radical' enough to believe that nobody can understand one another, I believe that empathy and compassion are still possible - I might not ever **truly, in its entirety** understand one's experience or struggles, due to the limits of subjective experience (enter the mind-body problem),I was making  the extreme case for both philosophies so that they can be analyzed. Most people fit somewhere on the continuum. I lean heavily toward the Enlightenment-Style of thought but even I will admit language is an imperfect instrument to convey experience and people can use the same words to mean vastly different things, making perfect communication impossible. That said, a belief in the sincere possibility of communication being able to overcome divisions in cultural context and personal history is the fundamental distinction between Enlightenment-Style thought and Post-Structuralism.\\\\ but humans have the ability to imagine themselves in someone else's shoes through creativity. The Post-Structuralist would disagree and argue that your imagination is limited by the nature of your experience. For example, the Post-Structuralist would argue as such: The arctic tern (a type of bird) migrates from the arctic to the antarctic and back every year and does this by feeling the magnetic field of the Earth and aligning itself with that magnetic field. I struggle to imagine what the arctic tern feels when sensing the magnetic field of the Earth. As a human who has never felt a magnetic field (and only observed how magnetics affect certain metals), my lack of experience of sensing a magnetic fields necessarily means that I cannot fundamentally understand what the experience of an arctic tern is. Given the subjectivity of human experience, this issue is amplified. How can a person who was never without luxury understand a ravenous hunger so great that a person so possessed of it would kill another person to eat? (for example)I, as someone who generally rejects the premise here, would argue that there is no sensation denied to one person that another has and the power of imagination is sufficient to contort our senses and understandings to situations we have not experienced if the description is sufficiently clear and the interlocutor sufficiently expressive.\\\\ I do not like that because I am certain group, my abilities of empathy must be dismissed because I wouldn't get it.The Post-Structuralist would argue that the experiences of the minority in this instance are like the magnetic field of the arctic tern and cannot be related to by a person who is not subject to the same cultural convulsions. It's not a question of empathy; it's a question of the limitations of language and experience trasmittal. You could be as empathetic as anyone and still not understand what feeling the Earth's magnetic field in your body is like.Of course, real-life Post-Structuralists make numerous false equivalences, like imagining that a Nigerian Yoruba has more connectivity to an African-American from Dallas, TX than a White American from Dallas, TX has to an African-American from Dallas, TX because the Yoruba shares the racial classification, but Post-Structuralists in theory would claim that neither the Nigerian Yoruba or the White American from Dallas, TX has the ability to understand the suffering of the African-American because of the different living contexts.","title":"CMV: Society unjustly treats demographics too much like a monolith and leads to negative effects"},{"text":"If CEOs and the megawealthy are untouchable by consequences, and are sociopathic (as so many are), then of course they will continue to do terrible harms to others as they hoard money and power.

A single election cycle doesnt dictate a partys long-term future.Yes, rural areas are a challenge for Democrats, but rural America isnt growingurban and suburban areas are, and those places lean blue. Younger generations still favor Democrats overall, even if theres been a small swing recently. People change as they age, and issues like climate change, reproductive rights, and economic justice will likely bring many of these voters back. Its also worth noting that Democrats still hold a significant edge with women and people of color, demographics that are growing in influence.Your Senate argument also assumes the current map is set in stone, which isnt true. Georgia flipped recently after decades of being solidly red. Colorado and Virginia were swing states not long ago, and now theyre solid blue.

Like it or not, 2016 and 2020 were even-split elections and Democrats should have put forth the most experienced, knowledgeable, and likable candidate possible in 2024, as well as promoted that candidate early on. Biden ran on a campaign of being a transition president but did not step back until it was too late and the Democrats were seemingly stuck with Harris.I challenge your perspective that Harris should have been a layup and Biden was historically unpopular. I would also challenge your perspective that Trump was historically unpopular. As the last 3 elections have been so close, you could argue that both candidates were equally popular.Harris did not succeed on her own and during Bidens presidency, she showcased her lack of experience at every turn. She struggled to build more than 5% of primary voters and suspended her own campaign early. On 60 Minutes a few months after winning the election and being named the Border Czar, she revealed that she had not done much international travel before, having only been to Mexico. Seemingly (in the court of public opinion) her solution to the border crisis was lambasted as Do not come. Her role in the Biden administration was the same as many traditional VPs: to court a larger voting pool, then sit at the kids table while the adults are talking.Bidens uniqueness over Trump was that he was the most experienced candidate, having spent over 30 years in the Senate and 8 years in the White House. He did not stand in the way of the Federal Reserve, unlike Trump. He did not court controversy, unlike Trump. He projected an image of a wise old man, unlike Trump.In my opinion, the political machinations of the rest of the Democratic Party lost the election for them. Imagine if they simply moved on after Trump, without the highly publicized, controversial cases that kept him in the spotlight. Would the Republicans have rallied behind him if it werent for him appearing to be attacked by the left? Would they have moved on to other candidates in the primaries? The historical precedent is to move on from ex-Presidents and even from popular enemies of the state, which is what Democrats believe Trump to be. Nixon was pardoned without serving time. The entire Confederacy was pardoned after open rebellion. (although Jefferson Davis served 2 years) Why not move on from Trump?As a secondary point, I do feel that Democrats should have been generally supportive of alternative Republican candidates in the primaries rather than attacking them too. I understand that, by default as their competition, they felt obligated to compete, but wouldnt it be better to bring the country together (Bidens ethos) rather than sowing further division?","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Well Im glad Im on the side of unity by success rather than the side that just wants to be right.

To wit: The pre-revolutionary period in Iran saw significant political and social upheaval that culminated in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Under Mohammad Reza Shah, Iran pursued rapid modernization and Westernization, supported by alliances with the U.S. and other Western powers. However, this was accompanied by authoritarianism, corruption, and suppression of dissent, including crackdowns on political parties and civil society. Economic inequality and disconnection from traditional Iranian cultural values alienated large segments of the population. Ultimately, opposition coalesced around Ayatollah Khomeini, leading to a revolutionary overthrow of the Shah's regime and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, which dismantled previous democratic structures in favor of a theocratic governance model rooted in ideological control and suppression of dissenting voices? This trajectory bears certain parallels to contemporary concerns about democratic backsliding in other countries, including the U.S. since 2016. In the U.S., polarization, distrust in institutions, and the use of populist rhetoric by leaders have raised alarms about the erosion of democratic norms. The targeting of media, the judiciary, and political opponents through rhetoric or policy can weaken the guardrails of democracy. Similar to Iran's pre-revolutionary period, the rise of discontent due to perceived corruption, inequality, or identity issues can create fertile ground for radical political shifts. Iran's revolution shows how a democracy can degrade when systemic grievances are exploited without effective checks on power?Note that I am not saying the situations are *exactly* the same, but they are similar enough that one should not be as dismissive as you appear to be. Iran's culture pre-revolution was absolutely *nothing* like the culture of the Arabic nations in the Middle East.Some differences between the U.S. and Iran's historical conditions: The key difference is that the U.S. still has robust institutional structures and a history of resilience against authoritarian trends. However, lessons from Iran underscore the importance of addressing underlying socioeconomic issues and maintaining strong democratic practices to prevent further erosion.Sources:* [The Washington Institute for Near East Policy](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/iran-democratic-evolution-or-revolution)* [Foreign Policy Research Institute](https://www.fpri.org/2015/04/iran-before-and-after-1979-how-did-we-get-here-from-there/)* [Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/irans-revolution-and-the-problem-of-autocratic-allies/)","title":"Biden says U.S. will support Syria and its neighbors after Assad dynasty collapses"},{"text":"I mean, Xenu definitely did have a working deportation plan, if anything.?","title":"Trump uses image of Jill Biden to sell his perfumes and colognes"},{"text":"Have you seen the movie 'Idiocracy'?

There are tens of millions of war weary people that just want a chance of an ordinary life and millions of refugees that want to return home. The United States spent more than a billion dollars since 2011 trying to overthrow Assad, and armed and funded many of the factions that came together under the umbrella of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) - and now their wish has come true. The question now facing the US is will they actually support Al-Jolani and the HTS creating a stable and successful new regime? Or will they conclude that they don't actually want to see a successful Islamist state and will therefore start supporting some of the factions to try and rise up and replace Al-Jolani, which would likely kick off a new phase of the civil war.A key litmus test of US intentions will come on Dec 20, when the Caesar Sanctions on Syria are set to expire. These sanctions were broad and far reaching and sought to cut Syria off from the western finance system. So will the US allow the sanctions to expire and start supporting the new Syrian leadership? That will be the first test, which will be decided by President Biden.A lot of countries in the region, including Turkey, Jordan Saudi Arabia and Lebanon all have a vested interest in seeing Syria stabilize - there are millions of Syrian refugees in all the neighbouring countries. And even Iraq appears to be fully backing the new leadership, stating?\\"Iraq stresses the need to respect the free will of all Syrians, and stresses that Syria's security, territorial integrity, and maintaining its independence are of utmost importance, not only for Iraq, but also for its connection to the security and stability of the region.\\"So what approach will the US and Israel choose for Syria now that Assad is gone? Israel is, as we speak, bombing Damascus, as well as other regions in Syria and has moved in to take over Syrian territory in the south-west, under the guise of \\"securing a buffer zone\\".

And then you have the hospital bullshit to work through. One year, during the pandemic my daughter had been sick and took a sudden turn for the worse, blue lips, said it hurt to breathe. I immediately scooper her up and put her in the car to drive to a pediatric emergency dept. and though the only thing on my mind should have been getting her care ASAP I still made sure of the 2 options near by I chose the one in network but even after doing everything right, I still had insurance deny her 4 day hospital stay on oxygen support because even though the hospital was in network, the on call doctor was not in networkThe hospital says theres a term for this and the insurance is supposed to override that and all I have to do is file a dispute. The hospital tried to file it for me but insurance says they dont approve of disputes on behalf by third party and I will have to file myself. I do. Denied again.Even when my daughter was deathly ill, and all i should be worried about is her care, i still tried to play by the rules and i still get screwed over by the system by things outside my control. This system is evil. Capitalism / for profit is antithetical and incompatible with health care. The conflict of interest of your duty to shareholders incentivizes you to put profit above human life.

Even more, they are told to do it and exactly how to do it.\\nAside from it surely being traumatizing to kill people for a living, it has even more drawbacks. For one, there is a social stigma. There is a reason why executioner was considered a dishonorable profession in Europe. There is a very interesting diary of an executioner of Nrnberg, named Franz Schmidt, that lays out his struggle with this life.\\nThis is different from police or soldiers, that are basically only allowed to kill people when directly threatened. Nobody is directly threatened by a prisoner on death row.\\nNow, you can try to distance the executioner from the deed, but ultimately, there always has to be a last human that does something that ultimately and surely kills another. You can argue that you can employ people that will not get traumatized and will not mind the stigma. But do we want to give psychopaths the right to kill people we deem deserve to die? This sounds not good either.\\nSo, I could think some people deserve to die, but I could also think that nobody deserves to be an executioner neither in the sense that they deserve to suffer from it, nor that they deserve to have the legal right to kill a person that I deem deserves to die.

There's also the fact that the state already has the prisoner captured, and is specifically choosing the path of punishment over all other avenues.\\nLet's compare this with the assassination of the CEO. \\nThe man was shot on grounds of his greedy business tactics that led to thousands of people dying or deteriorating in health. His continued existence as a legally operating businessman would lead to the unimpeded murder of many more people. The very nature of his business targets poor people (directly) and ethnic minorities (indirectly). There was little to no alternative recourse that would likely work, other than his murder. His killing was essentially pre-emptive self defense for all of the people his company would deny healthcare and kill in the future.\\nWhen you compare the two situations, it's easy to see how different they are. Even if you remove the specific realities of the US justice system, the state still has much more discretion in how to deal with a criminal than anyone did against this CEO. \\nI think these are somewhat similar ideas but ultimately completely distinct in their contemporary and inherent implications and reasoning, and your comparison of these ideas as being the same \\"in essence\\" is flawed.","title":"CMV: If you believe people deserve to die because of their actions, you are in essence in support of capital punishment"},{"text":"Its up to the lower courts to decide, not the incoming administration.

How many people really didn't care beyond their talking points? Not enough. The issue isn't the Democrats. America is voting for the government this country deserves-Period. You can't ask a party to do real work and be a clown show at the same time-Another history lesson ignored. It is time to put this one the voters and esp the non-voters. 22% of people made Trump the President-elect and 13% decided the Senate. A democracy is only good while the citizens take the wheel. But the beauty of Democracy is that consequences are real. And living in a Kleptocracy is the hellish alternative chosen. Our kids will pay for it.

There is never a single incident that galvanizes them into a revolt, just a steady stream of ad hoc situations that degrade democracy until it is gone. If you look at the literature surrounding totalitarian regimes in the last century you'll find the same process happening every single time. This degradation of democratic norms in the USA has been going on for decades (at least since Nixon), but it's one of those \\"slowly then suddenly\\" situations that has now accelerated into openly oligarchic rule. The press kept normalizing this because that's what many people want: they want to believe this is normal, that their support for or tolerance of this is normal, so they can keep living normal lives and not look at the bad things that happen to other people. That, in fact, anything bad that happens to them is caused by those other people rather than by the fat cats at the top eating all the cake.The only way to avoid this is to have strong political or labour movements that act as a focal point for resistance, but the USA has neither of these. The Democratic party is effectively the only viable democratic party in the two party system and they're not prepared to either do what is necessary, nor to stand aside for a more militant successor or competitor. Unions have been weakened by decades of hostile governments and are in no position to act effectively. This becomes even more problematic if you look at the USA's electoral system. The Republican party doesn't even need to cheat all that much, or in many places, to ensure there will be no more competitive elections.Unless they are really stupid or somehow unwilling to actually do this, the USA is in this mess for the long haul, probably until they do something so heinous or irresponsible that the usual distractions cease to work and their own supporters turn on them. Since those supporters are authoritarian and reactionary, the natural basis for dictatorships around the globe, that might take a while. It might also make matters even worse.","title":"Biden must act now to block Trumps retribution threats"},{"text":"Trump hasn't even signed all the transition papers, and he is getting away with it.

They pay income taxes because they have a wage income. These people have SOME resources and are somewhat comfortable, but they aren't what you'd call wealthy. They know it's their income that is on the table here. If tax increases happen, these are the people hit.The wealthy, on the other hand, are all in favor of redistribution of wealth because they know they write the rules and their wealth will not be redistributed. These people do NOT have a wage income, they make money from appreciation of assets and from the economic output of what they own (dividends). They can afford the lawyers and accountants that will make coming after them very expensive for Washington, and they know the people in Washington who make the decisions about who gets gone after.I am entirely in favor of any income tax reductions that we want to put in place, simply because those taxes do not target the wealthy. Taxes that ACTUALLY target the truly wealthy would be welcome with me, but those are going to be harder to put in place.The good news is that if taxes exclusively hit corporations worth $1B or more, well, there are only about 6500 of those. Even if that number is wrong (I suspect it is, I don't trust the source I saw) there are far fewer than there are actual people in the country. They could be taxed instead of people.

There's no short-term wins to be had in Syria, whatever happens there has to be a long-term strategy requiring years of work.

My entire thing is that would a federal universal health care system be ideal? Absolutely, but we need to recognize that as long as Republicans have a default advantage in the Senate and the Electoral College, it ain't getting done because that's not what they want. That means that we need to figure out alternative solutions, with my core ideal being we need to bring government down to the lowest level possible. The states need to nationalize their railways to allow for better passenger rail service, counties should offer universal health care to their residents, cities need to build social housing, and schools should be offering universal pre-K- because if we bring these government services closer to where people live and where they can have a say as to how and what they do. If that means Arkansas doesn't get universal health care, so what? That's not my problem and they don't care enough to make it theirs.As for wealthy individuals leaving the state, two points: 1) they would do it regardless on if it's a federal or state program because \\"reee taxes\\" and 2) the only meaningful thing that the wealthy bring could be local investment, but most of their investments aren't at the state level, but in the national stock market. They weren't going to meaningfully contribute to the state one way or another- just like they aren't now.Right now Blue states aren't meaningfully doing much in the way of being competitive with Red states in terms of \\"livability\\" due to high taxes and dense urban environments being undesirable. Many Blue states are already offering a lot of these services already, it's just a matter of expanding the programs to utilize the economies of scale. Cook county, where I live, just so happens to already RUN HOSPITALS, so why can't we have them be open to all residents free of charge? It would bring people to the area, attract investors because of the increased population, and generate taxes. If we can figure out how to deflate the property market so it doesn't require a small fortune to start a business that is brick and mortar (-cough- r/georgism \\\\-cough-) then you're on the road to building a vibrant local economy with robust social services.States need to stop acting like we can't compete with one another and start offering meaningful differences in the lived experience between one another.

They estimate less than 1/3rd the lifespan for nuclear plants (something like 5 to 10 years less than the standard western licensing period; bizarre) and increase lifespan for renewables by \\\\~25% (and don't model in the known capacity factor reduction for PV). Both are almost entirely capital cost technologies (IE less than 10% fuel and/or running cost) so this has huge effects on costing. Additionally they chose the highest possible cost assumptions for FOAK rather than observing other countries first forays into nuclear (South Korea constructing in the middle east or Canada's work with India) for nuclear and included no disposal or recycling costs for renewables which are included for nuclear...it's almost as if key Australian Political donors/special interest groups like mining companies make incredibly larger amounts off the incredibly larger amount of materials required for renewables; or they just don't want to lose the green votes.Moving on from this, the CSIRO also used inflated capacity factors for renewables including engineering somehow overcoming a limitation of physics (the SQ Limit).In short, had I handed in either of the CSIRO's papers for my financial analysis bachelors at university I'd have expected to fail based on using unrealistic and poorly researched assumptions; the CSIRO however I'm sure knew exactly what they were doing.On an annual average kwh per year of construction basis (so an actual electrical output/consumption unit per year of construction) the average nuclear plant is faster to roll out than a solar and wind strategy.Batteries are the biggest hurdle for solar and wind as we're literally running out of materials to produce current technologies; we need something like Ambri to really break through. Additionally the assumptions thrown about (and used by the CSIRO) for solar and wind to \\"keep getting cheaper\\" are optimistic; regardless however, they still don't make those technologies cheaper than nuclear.  \\n  \\nRE ramping up and down/peaking; it's a common misconception that reactors can't adjust output quickly. France is a good case study for you, but a reactor can run at 50% and move output up or down at 3-5% per minute; that's 2200MW online within 17 minutes at a single plant. If you're not using power you can also pump hydro, charge batteries, head sodium/salt as a thermal battery, desal water and fill dams (all like you would with renewables), or just bypass the turbine.I think the most important thing to point out for most pundits that most don't know or think about is that anti-nuclear propaganda and misinformation is a product of big oil. In the mid 20th century nuclear was an incredible threat to energy hegemony so oil companies seed funded groups like \\"friends of the earth\\" and created tonnes of propaganda. Today, mining companies that provide lithium, cement, iron ore, copper, aluminium etc and gas extraction companies (none of those are big in Australia ??) stand to profit ridiculous amounts from the renewables narrative.","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"Why is he talking about Medicare for All NOW when trump just got elected??

Is Bashar sending troops to kill our children in our streets?*\\" asked Marine Le Pen in 2017, without mentioning the Syrian dictator's responsibility in the birth of the Islamic State. A binary position that has multiple times led the figures of Le Pen's party to deny the atrocities carried out by the regime. After (yet another) chemical attack launched by the Syrian Army in Khan Sheikhun in April 2017, Marine Le Pen was offended by Donald Trump's reaction, who ordered reprisal bombings in Syria. Indeed, in 2019, the National Rally MEP Virginie Joron explained after a trip to Syria that the streets of Paris were more dangerous than the streets of Damascus. During the same trip, her colleague Thierry Mariani cheered after finding in a Saydnaya restaurant a bottle of C?tes-du-Rh?ne, despite the sanctions and embargo against Damascus: \\"*Congratulations to our winemakers who managed to distribute their wine so far!*\\", he posted, dining at a terrace in city where the regime had built its most dreadful prison, called \\"the Human Slaughterhouse\\". More recently, in 2022, Marine Le Pen called for a restoration of the diplomatic ties with the Syrian dictator. \\"*The breaking of diplomatic relations with Syria has blinded us, notably in the domain of the fight against Islamist terrorism, maybe at the most dangerous time for the country*\\", she said during the presidential campaign. Perhaps enough to explain the embarassment of Le Pen, whose old friend Frdric Chatillon participated in the parade of far-right figures to support Bashar Al-Assad.It's always useful to emphasize that Marine Le Pen, who recently took a very firm stand for the security of Israel against its geopolitical enemies, maintains close ties to her very old friend Frdric Chatillon, a neo-Nazi who is a longstanding ally of the Assad regime and Hezbollah since the 1990s, and spearheaded the pro-Assad propaganda efforts in France to paint the opposition as the second coming of the Taliban and deny the rapes, tortures, massacres and chemical attacks carried out by the regime against its population.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"of course, this isn't an absolute rule about human thought, but rather an adaptive tendency which can be hijacked, manipulated, and magnified. It's possible to practice compassion and empathy with all kinds of people, and to know that just because things are correlated, one does not necessitate the other. But it also wouldn't make sense to willfully ignore your experience of probabilities to deduce things. The mechanism I'm describing has a much simpler example that demonstrates this:You have two opaque containers full of balls, with different proportions of red and yellow balls inside of them (but you don't know what those proportions are). You take 100 balls out of each of the containers. From container A, you have taken out 95 red balls and 5 yellow ones. From container B, you have taken out 95 yellow balls and 5 red ones. If you wanted a red ball from your next draw, which container would you choose?Obviously you wouldn't say \\"well it doesn't matter at all, because you don't know what the next ball will be\\". Sure, there's no certainty of an outcome from either container, but you have a decent idea of the likelihood of a given outcome, based on your experience. This kind of reasoning is absolutely essential to human thought.People learn from their experiences and update their beliefs and expectations based on them. In your example, it would be logical to think that the likelihood of that individual being homosexual is higher than that of a different individual displaying no such characteristics. That doesn't mean you would know without them telling you, and it's important to remember in the cases of individuals that these are probabilities rather than certainties.There's another argument about people intentionally signifying their group identity with certain behaviors/mannerisms/clothing choices/etc. While it's obviously not good to think with absolute certainty that someone belongs to a group because they display traits common to that group, it's also a bit obtuse to ignore them completely. It's important, rather, to identify your own thoughts and potential prejudices about that group, where they stem from, and why they may be problematic.The thing is, working against this typically requires at least some level of privilege, and it's important to recognize that not everyone thinks that way (and to also have empathy with those people and understand why they might think in other ways). Either you have the privilege of your upbringing teaching you this, going through some kind of education, and/or having the leisure time to think about these things. That's why I mentioned stress/overload as a key player here. Lots of people are too stressed and overloaded in their daily lives without these considerations, and asking them to expend more mental effort and overcome their longstanding thinking patterns is unrealistic without also providing them with the time and resources to do so. In times of stress, brains revert more to simplified thinking than when a person is relaxed and well, and even the most compassionate person could do this if they were under enough duress.","title":"CMV: Society unjustly treats demographics too much like a monolith and leads to negative effects"},{"text":"That's irrelevant to the metric I was responding to however.

It's possible to practice compassion and empathy with all kinds of people, and to know that just because things are correlated, one does not necessitate the other. But it also wouldn't make sense to willfully ignore your experience of probabilities to deduce things. The mechanism I'm describing has a much simpler example that demonstrates this:You have two opaque containers full of balls, with different proportions of red and yellow balls inside of them (but you don't know what those proportions are). You take 100 balls out of each of the containers. From container A, you have taken out 95 red balls and 5 yellow ones. From container B, you have taken out 95 yellow balls and 5 red ones. If you wanted a red ball from your next draw, which container would you choose?Obviously you wouldn't say \\"well it doesn't matter at all, because you don't know what the next ball will be\\". Sure, there's no certainty of an outcome from either container, but you have a decent idea of the likelihood of a given outcome, based on your experience. This kind of reasoning is absolutely essential to human thought.People learn from their experiences and update their beliefs and expectations based on them. In your example, it would be logical to think that the likelihood of that individual being homosexual is higher than that of a different individual displaying no such characteristics. That doesn't mean you would know without them telling you, and it's important to remember in the cases of individuals that these are probabilities rather than certainties.There's another argument about people intentionally signifying their group identity with certain behaviors/mannerisms/clothing choices/etc. While it's obviously not good to think with absolute certainty that someone belongs to a group because they display traits common to that group, it's also a bit obtuse to ignore them completely.
