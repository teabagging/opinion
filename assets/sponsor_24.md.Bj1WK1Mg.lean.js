But since you only asked for a reason besides na?vet or narcissism for calling for allyship, let me try and push you in the other direction, to taking a dimmer view of it.Ally is basically a military term. People who just support you generally arent allies, but friends. Allies are what you make when you are looking for people to support you in a struggle against an enemy. Thus, the call for allyship is neither a result of a naive belief that everyone can be helped nor by a personal narcissistic belief that the person making the call is uniquely worthy of help. Rather, it is an insidious tool of political propaganda and indoctrination. It is asking you to view differing values and preferences not as personal matters to be dealt with in private, but rather to conceptualize them as part of a highly toxic black and white us versus them political conflict. And this goes beyond the particular issue they want you to be an ally on. The entire social justice movement is predicated on seeing the world as a childish good vs evil fantasy, from the very term social justice (implying anyone not onboard is supporting injustice) to the idea of calling people out (as if they were white-hatted sheriffs in a B western), to the idea of micro aggressions (often implying aggressive intent to actions where they know damn well none exists).","title":"CMV: Anyone who demands allyship from others is incredibly naive or a  narcissist."},{"text":"Anything I disagree with must be fake","title":"Jennifer Aniston says she voted for Kamala Harris in Instagram post"},{"text":"Good thing the baby wasn't dressed?as ice cream, or Biden would've started licking him. ??","title":"And we're garbage?

Kant says it is never permissible to lie (although it is to dodge the question), but that both completely ignores outcomes of dodging the question (because Kant doesn't care about outcomes in morality), and seems to dance around the point. Saying \\"No, sorry, I'm not hiding any escaped slaves in my attic\\" to slave-catchers is obviously the morally correct thing even if it is a lie, while other ethical systems generally offer more better ways out. In general Kantianism runs into this type of problem a lot.\\n* Weird definition of moral worth - Kant says moral worth is a product of a rational guided will, which seems sketchy. Defining sentience/capacity to suffer as what bestows moral worth seems intuitively more obvious and means you don't have to construct frameworks of obligations when you can just say that causing pain for no reason is inherently wrong.\\n* Metaphysically suspect - It presumes free will exists, which seems debatable, but even given that, are the decisions that the will has the chance to make not subject to the whims of the external world around us? Wont ones involuntary experiences impact what one's will inherently is like? There don't seem to be any moral circumstances in which you have full autonomous control. Sure, I believe in liberalism, but how do I know that's not a product of me being brought up in the US in the 21st century, and an identical version of me 200 years later wouldn't be a communist or something?

Making us think the earth is round makes us believe that if you go north, South, East, or west you will end up at the same location.  Every part of the area is known and wraps back onto itselfHowever, if there are really lands beyond antartica (like admiral byird reported) then we wouldn't even think to look for them because they would be outside the realm of what is possible in our mindAllegedly there are vast areas of advanced technology.  But we are kept ignorant to this so we can produce excesses from our society.Directly after World War 2 there was \\"operation high jump\\" where all of the worlds great military generals went right to antartica with huge arsenals and troops as if still at war.   After this time it was agreed people can no longer travel to antartica without permission. There's a no fly zone you can't fly over it and you can't boat over to it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_HighjumpSo you're not allowed to travel to antartica without all kinds of special permissions.  You can't just go there and people who have strayed too close are intercepted by large military vessels. Link added of boat traveling south of Australia towards antartica intercepted by military https://youtu.be/6MLeWoHzZnY?si=YrcQzwh2b_sjUY7Zif you look at the UN flag which is a map for example, it's centered over the north pole and antartica raps around the entire outer circumference of the circle.  (Sometimes referred to a pilots map bc flights are straight lines on these maps, while curved parabla on a globe)  people argue that antartitica is actually a wall that surrounds the earth,  as we know it, and we aren't allowed to go beyondSome people will also say captain cook who was tasked with mapping antartica, which took him 3 years (same as Magellan to navigate the globe with far worse technology many decades before ) shows that he actually navigated the circleAlso there is no single photo of earth from space.  All photos are actually composite photos comprised of hundreds of photos \\"digitaly\\" photoshopped together into a master photoFor those wondering, I don't actually believe this, nor do I disbelieve.  I find it interesting but it would be almost impossible for me individually to prove it being a globe, flat, or anything inbetween.There are other arguments to be made and the list is endless reallyRockets appearing to curve back down towards earth (which is said to be caused from the earth spinning away) but some argue the rockets are just for show and all fake. Elon musk even going as far to say \\"you know its real because it looks so fake\\"  when he launched the tesla car into orbit around marsThere's NASA footage from I belive the 1960s of astronauts doing a space walk and the earth rotating below them, however the earth below looks so pitifully fake it might as well be cardboardThere's tons of anomalies of astronauts dropping items and even appearing to be suspended when they're supposed to be in zero gravityAlso it's possible to induce actual zero gravity by being in a plane very high up and suddenly the plane plunges down for thousands of feet and everyone inside will be in a state of zero G free fall.  So some NASA footage is in this stateThere's also a couple studies done shinning light on extremely large frozen lakes.  If the earth was curved then the light would be below the horizon over very far distances, but this is not the case when studied by individuals they are able to see 3 different lights at 3 different extremely far distances on a frozen lakeMany globe believers will use the ancient well shadow experiment between 2 different cities at the same time of day.  They can use the angle difference the light casts between the 2 wells to extrapolate the circumference of the earth.  However, the assumption in these experiments is that all of the light hitting both wells is parallel (ie) the sun is extremely far away and the light rays are parallel to each other when hitting the wells.  However, if the sun was more local (ie closer) for example, the rays would not be parallel and the whole well experiment wouldn't hold trueWarner von Braun, the nazi head of NASA, has on his tomb stone a Bible Psalms verse.  If you go to the verse he references it talks about the firmament https://images.app.goo.gl/QCQ4GGbCTLn2cmvGASome people think there is a firmament made of water as told in the Bible. Separate the waters above from the waters below.  And they will use this argument to explain why when you zoom in on a planet, star, moon, anything in the sky you will see ripples on it as if it's in water.  You'll notice it with your phone zooming in and also with telescopes.  People will argue this is the firmament They will also argue that's why rockets appear to go back down because they don't want to hit the firmamment.  Also there will occasionally be crazy looking rocket separation in the sky (many people mistake for UFOs)  it's hard to explain but I'm sure most have seen it, like a swirl of light rippling when rocket stages seperate. Some people say that's actually a rocket crashing onto the firmament and causing waves to ripple on the firmament","title":"Flat earth is a real conspiracy"},{"text":"belong to","title":"CMV: Anyone who demands allyship from others is incredibly naive or a  narcissist."},{"text":"Because they are literally the evil empire of baseball.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 30, 2024 - 6 days until election day!"},{"text":"More just one person (Jackie Kennedy) but yes.","title":"Biden will attend US presidential inauguration regardless of winner, White House says"},{"text":"How is deontology completely wrong?","title":"Do Republicans comprehend the Categorical Imperative?"},{"text":"But she doesnt support Israels war.

Get friends and family to vote. https://app.vantagedatahouse.com/analysis/TheBlowoutNoOneSeesComing-1Read through this to see why the polls flooding the zone and making it into the media, RCP/538 are bullshit. https://virtualtout.com/news-log/2024-10-20/Some background on the VirtualTout: its a model devised by Thomas Miller that combines historical election data with PredictIt data to predict the winner of the election. Harris had a strong EC lead through out much of the race until recently when PredictIt (and Polymarket) completely flipped for Trump. There is nothing in the news that would explain this (like a major campaign misstep for Harris). Thomas Miller knows the prediction markets had a Republican bias in 2020 and he corrected for that, but he doesnt know to what extent that bias is now (honestly I suspect its much higher now that his model made the news a few times this year). Point is hes got the fundamental (numbers) analysis which says a Trump win; he looks to history to LBJ vs Goldwater and he says Harris will win. Lets look at some facts:* Harriss campaign is inspiring; Trumps is doom and gloom. \\n* Harris is getting 2x+ the crowds Trump is getting to his rallies and her speech at the Ellipse blew his MSG rally out of the water (max cap of MSG is 19,500). \\n* Harris raised $1 billion in short order. \\n* Democrats over performed in 2022 and every special election since. In closing, do not feel scared. The reich wing is working overtime and pulling every lever imaginable to make this seem close. Its not close. If you havent voted already, make a plan and vote.

What do all my fellow democrats think ?! Lets get this !!!"},{"text":"Here's my answer.These \\"protest votes\\" against Harris are a tad unnerving considering the alternative.In regards to the conflict in Israel, Harris has been vocal about a cease fire, she's openly expressed sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza, she even refused to show up for Netanyahu's performance in Congress recently, performance being the key word there.Donald Trump however, has an entirely different record as president, one that we can point to, and one that illustrates his own self-serving agenda and hardline stance on the war in Gaza. Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with several contentious world leaders, Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as \\"Zionism out of despair\\" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been unrelenting and undeniably share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict. A stalemate that has cost countless lives.That being said, Trump's record indicates that not only is he willing to take an indiscriminate stance on this war that he likely knows next to nothing about, but he's willing to do it merely because he thinks its what's best for him politically.Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved. When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his advisors, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.What's more, Trump's \\"Middle East peace plan\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. In fact, as foreign policy goes, it was more political theater than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This plan in particular also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.It's also important to note, that Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is \\"what's best for me?\\"So his rhetoric can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. It should also be noted, that his rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges and his vindictive nature can also sometimes alter his public mood or his rhetoric. He's like a child really.But that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as \\"radicals.\\"Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said, Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,Trump may have offhandedly criticized Israel once or twice during this conflict, but he's quickly backpedaled with statements like, they \\"have to have a victory.\\"Because Trump also sees everything through a ratings lens, he's tastelessly claimed that Israel is \\"absolutely losing the PR war.\\"Trump hasn't laid out a plan for addressing the war in Israel if he wins a second term. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gazas current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy. Gazas waterfront property could be very valuable, Kushner saidIt's likely that Trump's advisors have cautioned him against speaking out about the war, but that hasn't kept him from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.Also keep in mind Trump's history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a \\"Muslim problem.\\" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.In 2015, he said he will \\"look at\\" closing mosques.He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.Trump once said he would certainly implement a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registryHe called for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\\"He's called Muslims \\"sick people.\\"Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that the Judeo-Christian west is engaged in a global war against jihadist Islamic fascism.Then there's Trump's first \\"Muslim ban\\", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of \\"radical islamic terror.\\"While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.And to add to this, let's not forget the recent \\"rally\\" in MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric.All that being said, what I'm getting at here is, based on both of their records, who do you think is more likely to provide Palestinians with a greater measure of support and acknowledgement as president?","title":"How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she supports Israels war?

Do you really not know this?? Before 2014, health insurers in the individual market (ie, coverage that people buy themselves, as opposed to obtaining from an employer) used medical underwriting in nearly every state. That meant they could reject applications altogether, charge higher rates, or apply a waiting period if an applicant had a pre-existing condition. Today, that practice is no longer allowed in the individual major medical market, but some types of health coverage still use medical underwriting. A pre-existing condition is a health issue that required diagnosis or treatment prior to an applicants enrollment in a health plan. Prior to 2014, individual market insurers would set their own rules, but would generally have look-back periods of one to ten years, checking an applicants applicable medical records to see if any health conditions had been diagnosed or treated during the window used by that insurer. https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/pre-existing-condition/","title":"Helping Kamala Harris, Mike Johnson Vows to Kill Obamacare"},{"text":"It has nothing to do with my level of optimism or lack thereof, but I feel physically nauseous when I think of Tuesday.

That, I think, is the distinction you are missing. Might always makes things the way they are in every state, but that doesnt make things right. If the four people in the above example rose up and collectively overpowered him, their new, freer, healthier social dynamic would of course have only be made possible by their combined might, but it would not be their might that made it right in any meaningful sense.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"I'm probably gonna watch some porn too, just in case p2025 makes it in, cause it's bye-bye then(god i hope everyone takes this with a few yuks like i mean it :-)but I am definitely at least a bit dead serious though :'-(","title":"Todays polls look more promising for Harris !!

Part A absolutely covers Home Care and Hospice (source: I bill Medicare for those services specifically for a living).

The non-medical services mentioned are usually covered if ADL support is needed and they qualify for home care (ie, meet definition of homebound). You can't currently just get aide services if there's no skilled need, but the examples given in the article talk about alzheimers patients, who would likely be covered under a skilled need.Editing to add: I'm a fan of her proposal, I just keep hearing people say Medicare doesn't cover this and have no idea where that sentiment comes from.

From what I'm looking at, the main border control policy trump implemented was title 42 which Biden kept active for years.

Biden just called trump supporters garbage,1. Biden isn't Kamala2. This was in direct response to calling Puerto Rico a garbage island. Appropriate to say? Probably not. Defendable? Arguably yes. \\nthe dems made all sorts of false claims about Russian interference which went absolutely nowhere.There was an investigation, In case you didn't hear, trump was found to have colluded with Russia and interfered with the 2016 election. It was a whole [report](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/) even. Kamala criticized all of trumps policies and is now copying them, border wall, tax cut on tips, fracking and many other things.As mentioned in my prior comment, I actually agree.

Making us think the earth is round makes us believe that if you go north, South, East, or west you will end up at the same location.  Every part of the area is known and wraps back onto itselfHowever, if there are really lands beyond antartica (like admiral byird reported) then we wouldn't even think to look for them because they would be outside the realm of what is possible in our mindAllegedly there are vast areas of advanced technology.  But we are kept ignorant to this so we can produce excesses from our society.Directly after World War 2 there was \\"operation high jump\\" where all of the worlds great military generals went right to antartica with huge arsenals and troops as if still at war.   After this time it was agreed people can no longer travel to antartica without permission. There's a no fly zone you can't fly over it and you can't boat over to it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_HighjumpSo you're not allowed to travel to antartica without all kinds of special permissions.  You can't just go there and people who have strayed too close are intercepted by large military vessels. Link added of boat traveling south of Australia towards antartica intercepted by military https://youtu.be/6MLeWoHzZnY?si=YrcQzwh2b_sjUY7Zif you look at the UN flag which is a map for example, it's centered over the north pole and antartica raps around the entire outer circumference of the circle.  (Sometimes referred to a pilots map bc flights are straight lines on these maps, while curved parabla on a globe)  people argue that antartitica is actually a wall that surrounds the earth,  as we know it, and we aren't allowed to go beyondSome people will also say captain cook who was tasked with mapping antartica, which took him 3 years (same as Magellan to navigate the globe with far worse technology many decades before ) shows that he actually navigated the circleAlso there is no single photo of earth from space.  All photos are actually composite photos comprised of hundreds of photos \\"digitaly\\" photoshopped together into a master photoFor those wondering, I don't actually believe this, nor do I disbelieve.  I find it interesting but it would be almost impossible for me individually to prove it being a globe, flat, or anything inbetween.There are other arguments to be made and the list is endless reallyRockets appearing to curve back down towards earth (which is said to be caused from the earth spinning away) but some argue the rockets are just for show and all fake. Elon musk even going as far to say \\"you know its real because it looks so fake\\"  when he launched the tesla car into orbit around marsThere's NASA footage from I belive the 1960s of astronauts doing a space walk and the earth rotating below them, however the earth below looks so pitifully fake it might as well be cardboardThere's tons of anomalies of astronauts dropping items and even appearing to be suspended when they're supposed to be in zero gravityAlso it's possible to induce actual zero gravity by being in a plane very high up and suddenly the plane plunges down for thousands of feet and everyone inside will be in a state of zero G free fall.  So some NASA footage is in this stateThere's also a couple studies done shinning light on extremely large frozen lakes.  If the earth was curved then the light would be below the horizon over very far distances, but this is not the case when studied by individuals they are able to see 3 different lights at 3 different extremely far distances on a frozen lakeMany globe believers will use the ancient well shadow experiment between 2 different cities at the same time of day.  They can use the angle difference the light casts between the 2 wells to extrapolate the circumference of the earth.  However, the assumption in these experiments is that all of the light hitting both wells is parallel (ie) the sun is extremely far away and the light rays are parallel to each other when hitting the wells.  However, if the sun was more local (ie closer) for example, the rays would not be parallel and the whole well experiment wouldn't hold trueWarner von Braun, the nazi head of NASA, has on his tomb stone a Bible Psalms verse.  If you go to the verse he references it talks about the firmament https://images.app.goo.gl/QCQ4GGbCTLn2cmvGASome people think there is a firmament made of water as told in the Bible. Separate the waters above from the waters below.  And they will use this argument to explain why when you zoom in on a planet, star, moon, anything in the sky you will see ripples on it as if it's in water.  You'll notice it with your phone zooming in and also with telescopes.  People will argue this is the firmament They will also argue that's why rockets appear to go back down because they don't want to hit the firmamment.  Also there will occasionally be crazy looking rocket separation in the sky (many people mistake for UFOs)  it's hard to explain but I'm sure most have seen it, like a swirl of light rippling when rocket stages seperate. Some people say that's actually a rocket crashing onto the firmament and causing waves to ripple on the firmament","title":"Flat earth is a real conspiracy"},{"text":"Ah yes Tom Hanks any day now","title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsing Kamala Harris out of his own free will.

If were going to talk about division, lets look at the actions, not just rhetoric. Trump has openly mocked disabled people, encouraged chants against his political opponents, spread harmful lies about election integrity, downplayed a pandemic that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, and refused a peaceful transfer of power. All this went well beyond typical political division, it encouraged hostility, fear, and emboldened groups with deeply divisive and hateful agendas.  There is no comparison between these actions and the general opposition from Democrats. The lefts criticisms are in response to Trumps behavior, which actively undermines democratic norms and civility. Yes, Democrats have strongly opposed him, but I'd argue they haven't taken it far enough.

You would have to start on the state and local level. You could theoretically get enough states to change their constitutions (through referendums) to allow ranked choice/proportional voting systems for their house members and senators. Then those third party house members and senators can propose a national constitutional amendment to change the way we elect the president to allow for third parties to be viable (Probably something like the two round French system unless you just want to stop having an imperial presidency).\\nEither way it is a very tall order and an arduous journey to break the two party system. It is baked into the constitution. The only times it has briefly been broken (1850s when the Whigs died; 1912 with the three way race) it just reforms itself quickly with the third parties (Northern Dems and Republicans in 1860) coalescing back into a new two party system.\\nIn first past the post nations without a presidential system (i.e. the \\"British\\" system found in Canada and the UK) you can have some local areas where different parties are viable, but it still usually favors a two party system and third parties often act to siphon votes away. In the recent election Labour won a \\"landslide majority \\" of seats because the conservative vote was split between the Tories and Reform UK. While I personally liked the outcome, it shows that voting third party is often against the interest of individual voters and leads to a less ideal outcome than if citizens vote for the most viable party that best matches their beliefs (and ascribe to \\"negative partisanship \\").\\nTL;DR even if there is a \\"shift towards third parties\\" like there has been in the UK, unless the system changes to accommodate third parties, they will just be spoilers that siphon off votes, guaranteeing that an opposition party with only a plurality of support wins every time.","title":"CMV: The alienation of politics from the minds of regular people moves democratic countries closer to autocratic rule."},{"text":"And the one before that.","title":"Kamala is going to win"},{"text":"Love the smell of desperation in the morning","title":"Moron MAGA are pulling another stunt to own the libs Big Orange and Vivik Ramaswamy are doing trash truck ride alongs to show that they are not garbage after Biden called them that?

Firstly, the vast majority of people trust government departments, for example if you witnessed a fatal car crash, the first thing the vast majority of people would do is call 000 (Australian version of 911 for the Americans here). You would do this because you trust that the government emergency services will respond to the accident and treat any casualties. But I get you are probably referring to government legislators, not departments. But even then, we as a population often elect governments on their promises, and therefore we are trusting them. On another point, the American 2nd amendment was designed with a lack of trust in government in mind. Im going to assume that you as an Australian  dont believe the proliferation of semiautomatic and concealable firearms would be particularly good for Australian society, (although I could be wrong). I think its fairly obvious that the general level of violence would rapidly increase if we adopted a similar policy here, and that would be a negative development in Australian society, simply due to a lack of trust in government and our Westminster democratic system.","title":"CMV: trust in government is an unhelpful and ideologically compromised metric"},{"text":"What a fucking child first McDonalds and now Garbage Man cosplay?

In a video, the president referred to Sunday&amp;#039;s rhetoric as &amp;quot;Garbage,&amp;quot; and the GOP and its flying monkeys insisted that the president had referred to the former president*&amp;#039;s supporters as &amp;quot;Garbage.&amp;quot; Oooh!

They could end up learning a thing or two other than making some educated guesses.Of course, these metrics are very dependent on the trust of the organizations producing these trust figures so we can end up in a chain of trust conundrum, but that's not within the purview of my answer.

Passed by the same congress that passed by the 2nd amendment, and who were opposed to the idea of a standing army.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_the_United_StatesThe idea of using a militia for defense lasted less than a year. It was never intended to defend against a tyrannical federal government. That's revisionist history, mostly because that same congress engaged in the most followed tradition in politics. They said \\"we'll deal with the problem later\\" and kicked the can of reverting the 2nd amendment (which lost it's core purpose with the establishment of a permanent Standing Army) down the road to deal with later (and they never dealt with it).It would be embarrassing to revert one of your big amendments you passed less than a year before. So they didn't.It was only through a very \\"Originalist\\" viewing of history, and you stop reading the second the amendment was passed, that you get a heavily armed militia was what was intended.Interestingly, for that Originalist logic to hold true, you also need to effectively disband the entire US Military (at least the enlisted personnel side of things).

But that would be a dumb way to look at it because the value of the parking enforcement officer isn't just the $150 they generate in tickets per day, it's that their presence is what makes the other 95 cars a day bother to pay their $20 a day. If the enforcement officer wasn't there they'd just ignore the $20 a day for parking sign and park without paying.

Trump sued PA today, right? Well, PA is listed at \\"Even\\". Their internal polls likely indicate it is very much so not \\"even\\".Vote, keep it going, blue all down ticket, Harris/Walz. Bring it home guys, it's just a few days away and if we can really do this, can you imagine the implosion that will inevitably happen with the Republican party after yet another Presidential loss? (and maybe even more stinging losses in House/Senate).If we win the Presidential this year, it will then make it so the only Presidential term they had was with Trump for a mere 4 years which will then be forever sandwiched in between *8 years* of Democrats **before** Trump and another **8 years** of Democrats *after*.Do you think the Republican party is seriously just going to go \\"back to business\\"? Trump's crimes and his cases that he's only been able to stall, will finally come to fruition and he'll have nowhere else to go. **Because of this** he is guaranteed to state (publicly and privately and through official paperwork) as soon as humanly possible that he will actually be running for President in 2028. It's the only \\"feasible\\" move he can do to try and stall shit in court moreso. I mean it likely won't work, he exhausted most of it out, but never stopped the actual charges or the cases in the first place.He's going to need all that free \\"ad/mind space\\" in front of as many eyes as possible and he's not going to want any other Republican coming along, winning and then showing the world how much easier it was for **that** Republican to win than him. **Republicans are legit stuck with him**.If we win this time, he's literally going to be a permanent problem for them and a fading problem for everyone else. This is why Graham said Trump would destroy the GOP. It's because he knew 100% that the party would....simply just let it happen. He didn't think Trump was some brilliant demolitions expert, he *knew* that the entire Republican party (including himself) would simply jump at the chance to suck down Trump's gravy.Graham was actually being honest about *himself*, not about Trump (in that famous Tweet). Let's crush this one and send these dipshits packing. His (obvious, even at the time) projection came through in where he directed his blame: \\"HE will destroy the GOP\\". He actually **meant** \\"we're going to let him\\". Another Trump loss is **guaranteed to further prove what Graham said and will do so FAR faster than anything else.** This seriously is the Republican end-game, isn't it?

Most of the folks who say this are complaining that they report too often on a certain subject, not enough on another, or their editorial takes are not what they want.

And that's the thing: the more civilized the society is, the more it relies on carefully maintained belief equilibria instead of regular demonstrative exercise of violence.   \\n  \\nIt is called common knowledge in game theory: everyone believes, that everyone else believes, that... etc. When this equilibrium is stable enough, you don't even need a big army to enforce it. But crucially, when *it's lacking*, a big army is useless.   \\n  \\nConsider some major historical transitions of power or failed attempts at those. The Soviet Union dissolved despite its troops stationed everywhere and security services monitoring every move of every important actor. The march on Rome was branded as a triumphant show of force and resolve, but it was arranged on top of the change of power, already negotiated in the background. Kapp putsch in the early years of Weimar Republic failed because of unprecedented general strike by the opposing workers and the absent support from the army -- the old equilibrium proved too robust to subvert: contrast this with the general lethargy, mixed with wishful prospects of Nazis just withering away from political scene in 1932, displayed both by communists and conservative elites -- they relied on the balance of expectations, which got dangerously out of sync with reality.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Biden used is, singular, and not are, plural.

I believe Ken McDonald said that's hardly enough time to make a serious decision on their demands.And let's look at the bigger picture here. These MP's don't have the means to remove Trudeau forcefully. The LPC didn't adopt the reform act, the LPC doesn't have a mechanism for leadership review and they can't hold a secret vote against a sitting PM as prescribed in their party constitution. The only mechanism left for these MP's is voting non-confidence with the CPC and Bloc, but as their aim is to save the LPC from disaster I don't think triggering an election now is congenial with that goal.It seems the only way to get rid of this SOB is through, as Lori Turnbull calls it, the Blaine Higgs method and that is to suffer a massive electoral defeat.Edit: Spelling.","title":"Liberals look to move past leadership drama with eye on next campaign"},{"text":"Tough guy going after the elderly.","title":"Teenage Trump supporter threatened elderly Democrat with machete"},{"text":"What is a \\"small donor?\\"  Up to the donation maximum of like... $2700 or whatever it is now?

Our leaders should start being more honest about that truth, instead of going out of their way to be politically correct as to not hurt the feelings of a group of people who are perfectly fine with a president who says hateful, racist, extremely disrespectful shit about  other Americans.","title":"Trump rides in garbage truck in effort to seize on Biden comment"},{"text":"Thats exactly the reaction Im seeing.

So, it cannot be known with certainty what Biden intended in the moment that those words escaped his lips. The surrounding context, however, undercuts the GOPs interpretation. Immediately after uttering his controversial statement, the president said the following:*\\"Now, Trump has di tried to divide the country based on race, ethnicity, anything that does harm, to take their eye off the ball about what the terrible things hes done and will do. But Kamala Harris has fought for all Americans and will be a president for all of America.\\"*It is possible that Biden intended to 1) deride all Trump supporters as garbage, and then 2) immediately tout Harriss commitment to fighting for human trash. But that strikes me as unlikely, particularly since the president has never said anything like that before during his half-century in public life.Whatever Biden intended though, it is indisputable that his very next sentences disavowed the idea that Republican voters are garbage whose interests should be ignored.Now how about we focus on the guy who likes to echo Hitler in his speeches and calls his political enemies \\"human scum\\", \\"rrded\\", \\"vermin\\", \\"animals\\", \\"not human\\" and worse?","title":"The big lie behind Bidens garbage gaffe scandal"},{"text":"Simply love seeing him in a garbage truck, but he's mistakenly climbed into the wrong end...","title":"Moron MAGA are pulling another stunt to own the libs Big Orange and Vivik Ramaswamy are doing trash truck ride alongs to show that they are not garbage after Biden called them that?

The Conservatives and Bloc Qubcois have pledged to try to bring down the minority government this fall.\\\\[...\\\\]Toronto-area MP Nate Erskine-Smith said the party's leadership was not the focus of caucus this week, and the priority was hearing from Bevan.\\"It was very much focused on: these are the next steps from a party perspective, and people were able to weigh in with their own feedback as far as it goes,\\" Erskine-Smith said following the meeting.\\"That question from last week to what's the finality, that wasn't part of it.\\"\\\\[...\\\\]At last week's meeting, a group of around two dozen MPs presented a letter to Trudeau calling on him to step aside. The dissenters gave him until Monday to make a decision  but he made it clear he plans to lead the party in the next election.Several MPs have since said they want to hold a secret ballot vote to decide on whether Trudeau should stay on as leader. However, the Liberal party chose after the last election not to use Reform Act rules that would have allowed a caucus to hold secret vote to oust the leader.\\\\[...\\\\]Erskine-Smith said the \\"overwhelming focus\\" for now is on what comes next, but he could see leadership troubles come up again depending on the results of two upcoming votes.Byelections are pending in former Liberal ridings on both coasts: a vote must happen in CloverdaleLangley City by Jan. 13 and in Halifax by April 14.Further readings:[Liberal Party preparing to launch ad campaign to take on high-flying Poilievre | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-party-ad-campaign-1.7368291)[Two more Liberal MPs call for secret ballot on Trudeau's leadership | CBC.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/9.6550960)[Attempts to put Trudeau leadership question to rest only making caucus tensions worse, MP says | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mp-tensions-liberal-caucus-1.7368594)[NDP says they won't help Tories, Bloc topple the Liberals | CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/not-going-to-play-their-games-singh-won-t-help-tories-bloc-topple-the-liberals-1.7092626)[Justin Trudeaus allies dismiss leadership challenge - Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/justin-trudeaus-allies-dismiss-leadership-challenge-as-utter-silliness-despite-grumbling-in-liberal-caucus/article_0a81d8fe-96e2-11ef-bb51-a792436b6dbb.html)[Apocalyptic or appealing?
