That would be like someone who suffered attempted murder concluding that everyone in the world is a murderer. Your feelings are hurt, that is all.I don't think this analogy holds up. OP isn't saying that everyone will break your trust. He is saying everyone has potential to break your trust:?I don't think there's a single person you can reveal something to that won't **potentially** use it against youEvery time you trust someone with something you are always placing yourself at **risk**Trust involves a leap of faith, or else it isn't trust. In other words, there is the possibility that trust is broken or else it isn't trust. For example, I'm not trusting you to not use a key to enter my house *because I haven't given you the key to my house*. There is no possibility that you use the key, so there is no trust. If you meet someone that you **fully** trust, you have taken a leap of faith because there is no way you can prove that the person is **fully** trustworthy.My disagreement with OP is that I don't think you can truly trust yourself either. Everyone has experienced the following: you tell yourself you're going to do something, and then you don't end up doing it. That's breaking trust in one's self.Is it *healthy* to choose people in life to fully trust? I think so.

However, Id argue that while trusting others carries risk, trusting only yourself can also lead to isolation, missed opportunities for connection, and can make life harder in the long run.First, think about how often we rely on trust in daily lifewhether its doctors, friends, coworkers, or even strangers. If trust werent possible, society as a whole would struggle to function. While its true that some people may betray your trust, that doesnt mean all people will. Trust is a calculated risk, and while some people fail, many others prove reliable.Additionally, trusting only yourself can limit your ability to experience deep relationships. Yes, trusting someone means being vulnerable, but it also creates the potential for real connection and mutual support, which can enrich your life in ways that self-reliance alone cant.The key isnt about trusting everyone blindly, but about being discerning. If you write off trust entirely, you might miss out on people who are genuinely there for you.What if the real issue is not that people, in general, are untrustworthy, but that certain individuals have shown themselves to be?

And you call that a defensive war.Was Israel attacked? Yes. Thats a defensive war. You know that Jordan and Egypt forcibly ejected Jews from the West Bank and Gaza after 48 right? And the entire Middle East ejected 900,000 Jews after 48. Jews who had nothing to do with the war. No one argues for their right of return or the return of the assets stolen from them. Suppose Russia captured the whole of the Western US, and then said they would give Michigan back as long as the US agreed that everything else they took was Russias forever now, and that the people there would never get their homes back. Do you think the US would be unreasonable to turn down that deal?This is not even remotely close to the scenario in Israel, so its a ridiculous argument. In any ethnic conflict, granting freedom to the other ethnic group will come with increased danger- more freedom always entails more freedom to do harm. But for the conflict to ever end, that has to be accepted. So your solution here is for Israel to accept the deaths of potentially thousands of its citizens so Palestinians can use the West Bank and Gaza to launch terror attacks? We saw what Hamas was able to do *with* the restrictions. What do you truly expect would happen without them? Magical peace?And again, you are framing this as an ethnic conflict as if there arent 2 million Arabs with full Israeli citizenship. How many Jews would get the right of return to their homes in the West Bank should it become a Palestinian state? (Abbas has already the answer is zero). You cant arrest, brutalise and restrict people into not hating you, so anyone with this as a plan is planning for the war to go on forever.And you cant mass murder people at random for over 100 years and expect them to give you full access to kill more of them.

Every time you trust someone with something you are always placing yourself at risk regardless of who it is and how close they are to you. Let me offer you a somewhat grim alternative perspective: You can't even trust yourself. Often we are our own worst enemies, generating addictions, poor behaviors, and distorted views of the world that are against our best interests (hint). Nobody is perfect, not even you, and expecting *anyone* or *anything* to always do the right thing is folly.You want to complain because your trust was betrayed and you were burned this one time.

Also, wildly inaccurate claim to make in the second half there. If Israel doesnt want the charge of being an occupying force that is the right of Palestinians to resist, they need to not be enacting the aspects of an occupation.Right of resistance does not equal a right to kill civilians. There was a largely peaceful protest about a decade ago where Palestinians demonstrated before the border fence in Gaza. The IDF responded by maiming thousands and killing hundreds. For approaching a fence.Thats aclaim. The blockade is and has extended beyond military goods for a long time. What is considered a dual purpose good has included such things like fishing equipment and chickens.Certainly there are more items considered dual use than is strictly necessary. But considered water pipes have been used to built rocket launchers, its hard to say whats truly dual use. Fishing equipment and chickens dont seem to rise to the level of dual use. Still, the blockade is mostly aimed at preventing smuggled weapons. Its a matter of material. Hamas can smuggle small arms because those are small, hence the name. It smuggled in a lot more than small arms. The goods to build an economy are usually quite bulky. Machines, construction equipment, tractors, concrete. These are all banned for legal import and are not exactly feasible to smuggle through a tunnel.They had all of that equipment for legitimate purposes and used them on 10/7 to conduct their attack. How do you suppose Gaza had luxury car dealerships? Then theres the matter of exports. Also impossible through the blockade.Stop being a terror regime and economic wonders can happen. The blockade was initially put in place before Hamas even took power.No it wasnt, nothing like a blockade in place once Hamas took power.

Plenty of states do not open any early ballots until election day, so states with laws banning counting them if the person has died before election day can pull those ballots. Ten statesArkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Virginiahave statutes that explicitly permit counting absentee ballots cast by voters who die before Election Day; one state-Connecticut-only counts these ballots if the deceased voter is a member of the armed services.Nine statesDelaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsinhave statutes that explicitly prohibit counting absentee ballots cast by voters who die before Election Day. Missouri states that such ballots be rejected only if sufficient evidence is shown to an election authority that the voter has died before the opening of the polls on Election Day, and the deceased voter's ballot is still sealed in the ballot envelope.In Colorado, Kansas and New York, absentee ballots can be challenged on the grounds that a voter died before the day of the election. After investigation, if evidence shows that the voter has died, the challenge is sustained and the ballot will be rejected.At least two statesKentucky and Mississippialso prohibit counting deceased voters' ballots, but through attorneys general opinions, rather than statute.In the remaining 26 states, NCSL has not found citations indicating whether absentee/mail ballots from voters who die before Election Day are to be counted.The roughly half of states that don't have explicit laws on the books one way or the other would likely end up being at the discretion of the Secretary of State.

Are you ignoring segregation?Both instituted by Democrats once they regained power after Reconstruction ended in 1874, to as closely recreate slavery as possible without *actually* owning people.They were the reason the 14th, 15th, and 24th Amendments (all opposed by Democrats) were necessary....but Jim Crow and Segregation were ended by Republicans (sometimes necessitating the use of Federal troops against recalcitrant Democrat governors), probably before you were born. Are you ignoring that it wasn't until 1967 that black men could marry white women?...in the remaining 16 states, almost all of which were in the Democratic south.  It was never illegal in 20 states.  The laws in the other 14 states that had banned it were overturned starting in 1948 when (then Republican-majority) California did so. It is black and brown people that have been subjugated for far to long.Again, by who?  The Confederacy, which seceded from the United States to preserve slavery after the first Republican President was elected because the Republican Party was formed as an anti-slavery party, has been gone for 159 years.  You said for the last 50 years.  Jim Crow and segregation were forcibly ended by Republicans around the same time as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed 60 years ago (despite a dozen Democrats filibustering it for 2 months).

What is considered a dual purpose good has included such things like fishing equipment and chickens.It's a matter of material. Hamas can smuggle small arms because those are small, hence the name. The goods to build an economy are usually quite bulky. Machines, construction equipment, tractors, concrete. These are all banned for legal import and are not exactly feasible to smuggle through a tunnel.Then there's the matter of exports. Also impossible through the blockade.The blockade was initially put in place before Hamas even took power.Oh, have any comments on the illegal settlements in the West Bank and their continual expansion?

The US doesnt have the right to charge Canadian citizens with a crime committed on Canadian soil. The courts youre referring to do not have jurisdiction on Israeli soil. If an American commits a crime on Israeli soil, then yes they would go through Israeli courts just like if a Canadian committed a crime on American soil.   In Israel, there is a separate tier of justice towards Palestinians than there is Israelis.No, there isnt. Youre talking about areas outside of Israel.  In every non-apartheid country in the world, no road is reserved only for the domestic population - nor do any individual risk military trial or execution over using any road. Ever.And there are no Israeli roads that are reserved for only the domestic population. Im not Israeli and I can use all the roads in Israel that an Israeli could. Again, youre talking about roads outside of Israel.  Like your basic law already describes: the right to self-determination is unique to the Jewish people. Not the Israeli people.Thats not what it said. Go up and read your own quote. But even if it was - is this your only example? If all Israeli citizens have full equal legal rights and your only issue is some vague mention of Jewish self determination in one document and you cant point to any actual laws where people have different rights - then I think youre creating a problem where there isnt one.  And it does not enshrine neither universal human rights nor equality in its constitution. It does.  If that were a core value, the systematic crimes against humanity and dignity against Palestinians and Arabs would not occur.Youll have to prove systemic crimes against humanity within Israel if this is really your argument. Thats a big claim. As for dignity of Arab Israelis - I do think there needs to be more work done wrt social racism within Israel, just like more work needs to be done with that in my own country. The existence of racism does not mean people dont all have the same legal rights.  Youre welcome to provide sources that universal human rights apply to all individuals in Israel, regardless of nationality, identity, religion, sex, ethnicity and background.Sure, I will find some on my lunch break and get back to you.  Promoting settlement of land that does not belong to Israel is settler colonialism. Settler colonialism doesnt happen without settler colonialist violence like we see in the West Bank. Settler colonialist violence are terroristic and political in nature.I am against the settlements in the WB, but that still isnt settler colonialism since Jews are indigenous to the area. But regardless - Im against the settlements. The existence of those settlements (which for a third time - I am against) does not demonstrate that Arab Israelis have different rights than Jewish Israelis.  Finally, Israelis are not indigenous to Palestine. Never have been, never will. What in the world? Where do you think all the Hebrew writing found at archeology cites comes from?  Israel is nothing more than a Zionist project - not a Jewish project, Id argue its both but I have no problem calling it a Zionist project. I love complimenting Israel!  and its antisemitic to claim that it is. Never really made the claim its a Jewish project until just now. Who are you arguing with here?  The Israeli Jews who moved to Palestinian territory moved from Europe, Some of them did. Others moved from the Middle East, Africa, the Americas and Asia.  where they and their ancestors have been living for two millennia - suffering European violence and European pogroms generation after generation.Do you think indigeneity gets erased if youve been exiled for a long time? Whats the cutoff there? If Jews had only been exiled for 80 years, would we then be indigenous to Israel? Whats the cut off? Somewhere in the middle? 500 years? Why would an ethnic group lose to indigeneity based on how long they were forcibly exiled?","title":"CMV: If you oppose Israel's right to exist, you are indirectly supporting the Axis of Iran-Russia-China-North Korea"},{"text":"Money, please!~~Mona Lisa Saperstein~~.

Palestinians are not Israeli citizens and do not want to be Israeli citizens. The governing body of Palestinians, the PA, refuses to hold elections. This is, according to numerous observers, at least in part to avoid Hamas winning more control. In Gaza specifically, Hamas does not hold elections. Thus, Palestinians are denied their voting rights by Palestinian governing bodies, not Israel.Secondly, you mentioned the Knessets *attempts* to control the judiciary. Attempt is an operative word here. The judiciary remains independent.Israel has not clamped down on the press, with the exception of Al Jazeera, which is a state run propaganda arm of Qatarhome of exiled Hamas leaders. Al Jazeeras Arabic reporting is borderline incitement to violence and goes well beyond simple bias.Putting on a press vest doesnt make someone a journalist. Videos have come out of Gaza of two men in press vests operating a rocket launcher. A journalist held a hostage in his home.

In principle I still hold that position but there is a relevant distinction that must be drawn between colonial nationstates, typical nationstates, and nationstates which emerge out of an anti-colonial historical context, Iran being the second type. This distinction is important both to this specific question and the question of what is to be done with regards to colonialism. Mostly because those two questions are one and the same. Israel is a colonial nation by any definition accepted among scholars of anti-colonialism. Iran is not. I oppose all nationstates in principle due to my values as a staunch internationalist, the nationstate itself is a construct of 17th European history (largely attributed to the Treaty of Westphalia) later reified by the Napoleonic wars and the nationalist movements of the 19th century of which Zionism was a product. But colonialism isn't just a typical nationalist movement, in the Israeli context it has sought not just to establish a \\"Jewish state\\" but to replace the Palestinian people with the Jewish people and more specifically the newly constructed Israeli people (created out of a process of colonial ethnogenesis similiar to the creation of the American people or Canadian people). This is why it is innately genocidal. Colonial projects shouldn't be opposed merely on the basis that they are nation-states and therefore opposed to my values as an internationalist, they should be opposed because they *require* the subjugation and elimination of the indigenous people (and no, indigenous does not mean \\"has ties to the area\\" Indigenous as defined by anti-colonial scholars means the people who are subjugated by a colonial state).","title":"CMV: If you oppose Israel's right to exist, you are indirectly supporting the Axis of Iran-Russia-China-North Korea"},{"text":"The one that Iran blew up?","title":"Peace impossible in the Middle East?

Ever. Like your basic law already describes: the right to self-determination is unique to the Jewish people. Not the Israeli people. And it does not enshrine neither universal human rights nor equality in its constitution. If that were a core value, the systematic crimes against humanity and dignity against Palestinians and Arabs would not occur. Youre welcome to provide sources that universal human rights apply to all individuals in Israel, regardless of nationality, identity, religion, sex, ethnicity and background.Promoting settlement of land that does not belong to Israel is settler colonialism. Settler colonialism doesnt happen without settler colonialist violence like we see in the West Bank. Settler colonialist violence are terroristic and political in nature. Finally, Israelis are not indigenous to Palestine. Never have been, never will be. Israel is nothing more than a Zionist project - not a Jewish project, and its antisemitic to claim that it is. The Israeli Jews who moved to Palestinian territory moved from Europe, where they and their ancestors have been living for two millennia - suffering European violence and European pogroms generation after generation.","title":"CMV: If you oppose Israel's right to exist, you are indirectly supporting the Axis of Iran-Russia-China-North Korea"},{"text":"Hi Canadian here, centre left leaning as per political stance but curious about your take on Trumps rhetoric about jailing politicians and party members that dont agree with his policies?

Non-Jewish citizens of Israel do not have full legal rights. For starters, Israelis are processed in military courts and Palestinians through military courts.Incorrect, all Israeli citizens are subject to Israeli civil courts. Sounds like youre talking about people who arent Israeli citizens and Israelis who live outside of Israeli.  Car roads in Israel, reserved only for Israelis with Israeli license plates. Palestinians are given separate plates, and risk execution by driving on these Israeli-only roads.Also incorrect. All Israelis are issued the same plates regardless of their religion or ethnicity. Palestine - since it is not Israel - issues different plates. Just like Germany issues different plates then Poland. All Israeli roads are open to all Israeli citizens, regardless of religion or ethnicity.  The right to return is reserved only for Jews.Correct.

The question still remains of how Israeli citizens are treated differently under Israeli law based on their religion or ethnicity. So far youve demonstrated no differences in the way Israelis are treated under the law.  France, like many other countries, enshrine the principle of equality and universal human rights for all its citizens, regardless of ethnicity, religion, background, sex. Israel has done this as well.  Israel is an undemocratic, apartheid state. It also categorizes itself as a terrorist state.This is a claim. Where is the argument to back it up? The state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value, and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.Having a national value does not an apartheid make. Show me laws where non-Jewish Israelis have different rights than Jewish Israelis.  The state encourages settler colonialism by whatever means it deems necessary, as a national value - in its constitution.It is impossible to colonize a land you are indigenous to.

We can even show examples of their own political allies doing the same thing (but in a way that actually violates the law and did cause real harm) yet they don't care. It is plainly obvious they don't care about the principles of law or any factual matter of guilt or innocence in these cases, rather they are just excuses to hold witch trials and perform a modern day lynching. This isn't just on reddit this is the actual mainstream sentiment of most democrats. You can read the judges opinions and listen to them on video - their speech is filled with hate and vitriol for us because of who we are not because of any particular thing that we did.This is behavior that demonstrates a level of conditioning among the population that is very much in line with what we saw in the lead up to nazi germany, the cultural revolution in China, and many other such events throughout history.

When you talk about Israels right to exist we are talking about the middle east arab countries that have denied Israels existence since their conception. Israels conception came as a WAR against them (at this point it was only jews take that as you will) from Palestinian military groups and at least 5 other arab nations. The narrative is (on the pro Palestinian side) that Israel deserved to be shunned and shouldnt be recognized after their war crimes of attacking civilians and uprooting about 700 000 Palestinians from their own during the 1948 war. Now i wanna stress this again THE JEWS WAS ATTACKED in 48 and repelled militias from their Palestinian neighbors, and its recorded by Israeli historians that about 60 000 Palestinians was forced out by the different military groups in Israel but most fled for the safety of not being in the middle of a battle. So now if we accept this understood and studied history (the Qatari propaganda is that this is Israeli historians so they are lying BUT Israel is the only country involved that is a democracy that has actually unsealed its war aims during the conflict from documents recorded by the government at the time) we can see that the largest contributor to the fleeing of civilians was the aggressors from the Arab side. There is so much more to go into here but ill leave it at this.2. If the conversation around Israel is as hostile and negative as today it does reek of antisemitism, not that people actually feel the hate for jews when they report or share their opinion but their arguments are fundamentally bought in to some Qatari propaganda line of logic that you need to believe if you use some criticism of Israel3. Arguing for any democratic country to be dissolved should be heavily criticized and ridiculed. The world is a dynamic place if we dont uphold democratic values they will disappear and tyranny will once more dominate the planet. 4. Israel is a democracy not a perfect one but they have solid democratic institutions with a population being very pro democracy. Since 1967 Israel have occupied to some extent Gaza and the west-bank (also Golan heights but it is very different) but the narratives have been very misleading to say the least. Gaza was under the rule of Egypt for 19 years and Westbank was under the rule of Jordan, after both countries aggressed Israel with military actions and very strong rhetoric about destroying the Jewish state they found themselves occupying Gaza, Sinai and the Westbank. There are certain geopolitical reasonings they had to continue to occupy these regions mostly to put their civilians outside of artillery range for strategic purposes. And since the population in Gaza and Westbank wanted to fight the Israelis for what happened in 48 they had a dilemma at their hands for the security of their population. Now i can write all dat about what happened but i think you understand my point. 5. The world is not mostly democratic or share western values and Im gonna be bold here and say we have the BEST values for human happiness and freedom then any other value system in any other part of the world, its not perfect but its so much better then anything else. Are you against the America driven world order? Im gonna tell you a reality about our world, if you dont do something someone else will and i promise you America is the best leader the world could have and it is not even close.","title":"CMV: If you oppose Israel's right to exist, you are indirectly supporting the Axis of Iran-Russia-China-North Korea"},{"text":"[Jill Stein Instagram Account caught liking comments telling supporters to vote Trump if not her](https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/s/26k5dyaKGY)\\nIts actually shameful what these spoilers have become.

Obama is one of the partys best-known figures and gave a speech boosting Harris candidacy at the national convention in August.It is unclear which celebrities will attend the rally but organizers noted that the groups co-chairs include professional basketball players Stephen Curry and Chris Paul; musical artists Becky G, H.E.R., Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez and Janelle Mone; beauty influencer Bretman Rock; and actors Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kerry Washington.The group has hosted more than 500 Party at the Polls events across the country focused on increasing voter registration and turnout. The events have ranged from pop-up block parties in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Philadelphia to voter registration partnerships with professional sports leagues and music festivals over the past year.The goal is to take the energy and momentum at the rally to the ballot box, said Beth Lynk, executive director of When We All Vote. We want to bring the culture, the energy and the momentum together in one big space.Lynk said the group chose Atlanta because of the states diversity and the impact that only a handful of voters can make in Georgia. About one-third of Georgias electorate is Black alongside rapidly growing Asian American and Latino communities. When We All Vote is focused on engaging college students on campuses in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Lynk said.Something that we have been hearing from young voters is that a lot of people dont believe that their votes have power. But they do, plain and simple, Lynk said. We know that democracy has to work for all of us and thats what we will be stressing at this rally.The rally will take place just before early voting ends in Georgia on Nov. 1, less than a week before Election Day.","title":"Michelle Obama will headline an Atlanta rally aimed at boosting voter turnout"},{"text":"They are all rubber stamping the threats, so yeah if they support this guy they are threatening me, too.

However, I have some concerns with the way this CMV is presented.1. [Do nations have the \\"right to exist?\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_exist#:~:text=The%20right%20to%20exist%20is,for%20the%20community%20it%20represents) What I mean by this is that is your position that no matter what a nation-state does, it will always have the right to exist? Is there no threshold that can be crossed where the global consensus comes to the conclusion that that nation should cease to exist?\\n2. Can we agree that \\"Israel\\" and \\"Jews\\" are not monolithic? That there are Jewish people who do not support Israel's actions and that there are Israeli citizens who are also critical of Israel? And that to say that Jews and Israel are the same is light anti-Semitism?\\n3. Can we also agree that if you make a morally \\"correct\\" decision, you are not also responsible for the admittedly tenuous consequences you've outlined in your post? I'm not going so far as to suggest that I fully understand the indirect consequences of arguing for the dissolution of the Israeli state, but to suggest that by arguing for that I am also arguing for the aims of other oppressive regimes is soft argument at best. If I were to argue against the existence of Israel, I can also decry other regimes.\\n4. [Israel is not a democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/israel-hasnt-been-a-democracy-for-a-long-time-now-israelis-need-to-face-this-fact), at least not in the way that you have framed it. Israel is an apartheid state. This is just a fact. You cannot have a true democracy when you have rules and laws subjugating an entire ethnic group. In the same way that the United States was an apartheid regime (and continues to this day to exhibit characteristics of an apartheid regime) pre-Civil Rights, Israel has engaged in some of that same behavior.\\n5. Global authoritarianism is what, exactly? Are you suggesting that this \\"Axis of Upheaval\\" is a global elite, swaying the opinion of anyone who matters? The world generally agrees that NK is a global pariah state. Russia, also, is generally perceived by the world at large to be a dictatorial oppressive regime. What world are we living in that suggests that they are on the precipice of a new world order? Even China, arguably the strongest of the nations you've identified, [has its own problems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/16/china-deflation-consumption-economy/). Not to mention that the history of the phrase \\"[Axis of Upheaval](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine?check_logged_in=1&amp;utm_medium=promo_email&amp;utm_source=lo_flows&amp;utm_campaign=article_link&amp;utm_term=article_email&amp;utm_content=20240729)\\" comes from a [Western-centric think tank](https://www.cnas.org/) dedicated to maintaining US hegemonic status on the world stage.I hope that this post can perhaps nudge you into reconsidering your framing of your argument.

These regimes are not just territorial aggressors; they systematically violate human rights and oppress their populations. Their shared goal includes destabilizing the global order by undermining democracies like Israel. When you oppose Israel, you're playing right into their hands.The argument seems to be that I have one shared goal with Iran, then i support them.But like... China wanted to beat Covid, and i wanted to beat covid.  Does that mean i am playing right into China's hand?  I suppose yes, but only in regards to developing covid treatments.I don't want Islam or China's brand of communism to spread around the world.  But I do want Chinese citizens to become richer and have better lives.  Its not uncommon to have shared goals with an enemy or rival.

Meaning that there is no overarching government body giving and overseeing these rights. What is now Israel was handed to them, they took it. Now it exists. They aren't subordinate to those who handed them the land.  It's right to exist is based entirely in its own ability to defend this existence, and the geopolitical circumstances of attacking that existing. e.g. Ukraine would have no right to exist if the west wasn't arming them. Russia would take that away. Now they still do. Iran and proxies cannot beat Israel's friends if they could even beat Israel itself. So they do exist.

And after Donald Trumps manic week, featuring a dance session and repeated public tangents, she had a curt reply to her critics: youre welcome.The moment encapsulated what many Democrats see as an acute challenge for Harris, one thats reminiscent in some ways of the partys 2016 loss to Trump. They see her fighting a losing battle for public attention against an opponent whose often inflammatory rhetoric cuts through the news cycle more easily than her messaging.Interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists about Harris campaign revealed some worries, as well as plenty of encouragement for the nominee to stray from her so-far careful approach. Harris has let Trump be himself, even as he captures more headlines than her, and sought to make the election a referendum on him  even though hes been out of power.The more people see Trump, the more they hate him, Democratic strategist Caitlin Legacki told Semafor. So letting him decompensate on national TV while she goes and makes a positive case for herself to persuadable voters is a great strategy.Other Democrats are less convinced that Harris lower-key mentality will break through with undecided voters, particularly those to whom shes still introducing herself after her late entry into the race.[Read the full story here](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/16/2024/dems-nudge-kamala-harris-to-do-more-than-let-trump-be-trump?utm_campaign=semaforreddit).","title":"Democrats nudge Kamala Harris to do more than let Trump be Trump"},{"text":"Project 2025, removing BAH by itself should be reason enough to note vote for Trump (talking purely about this specific item, not the 1000s of other reasons) let alone all the other problems with everything else they proposed","title":"House Dems and GOP are waging a bitter fight over military voting"},{"text":"What if the Democrat party knows how bad she is?

Let me explain how populism works in practice.When populism manifests, it almost always drags social issues into the fray because that's how capital co-opts a movement that might become ostensibly anti-capitalist. The new media elite on the rightthe \\"populists\\" like Tucker Carlson and Jordan Peterson and even Joe Roganfocus first and foremost on an \\"anti-woke\\" agenda. They don't go after the people who are paying their bills, just as legacy media doesn't go after the people who are paying their bills. Not saying it's all the same people paying those bills, mind you, but it is people from the same owner class. It's the reason the Democratic Party itself seems so mired in wishy-washy centrism. The donor class has its fangs in many places.When I single out right-wing \\"populist\\" workers for criticism, I'm not criticizing the working class. I'm a blue collar worker in a trade. I'm not stoking division; I'm criticizing the division. I'm insulting the divisive ideas that these folks willingly consume every day so that they can get a brief dopamine hit of anger that's directed at the wrong target. They can drop the bigotry and wise up any time they want and join me in reality. Until that happens, though, it's a waste of time and energy to try to reason them out of positions that they didn't reason themselves into, especially since they represent a minority of the working class in this country.I'm a Democrat in name only. I vote for the party simply because I have no real alternative within our voting system. I'm much further left than the average Democrat. I admit that quite openly. There are millions of disaffected working class people just like me who don't vote, who sit on the sidelines and who would love universal healthcare, affordable education and childcare, etc. Do right-wing working class \\"populists\\" want those things? Absolutely not, because it's deemed socialism or communism or fascism or woke. They are suffering from what looks to be a terminal case of brain rot. Time is a limited resource, and it makes little sense to squander it on them.","title":"Brain flaws: Understanding MAGA as an epidemic disease"},{"text":"Hes actually worse for the Nazis too, since most of them are poor Americans who would benefit from Harris policies, but theyre happy to suffer as long as the Others are suffering more.","title":"Kamala Harris Is the Better Candidate for Small Business | Opinion"},{"text":"Pinged SHITPOSTERS ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20SHITPOSTERS&amp;message=subscribe%20SHITPOSTERS) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20SHITPOSTERS&amp;message=unsubscribe%20SHITPOSTERS) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=SHITPOSTERS&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Los Angeles New Liberals Candidate Guide - November 2024"},{"text":" Do these guys just forget what they learn about economics in college, or are the colleges just not teaching real economics?I'll bet it's far cheaper to buy an Economist than it is to buy a Politician.","title":"HEAD IN SAND: Paul Krugman Claims Bidenomics Has Been Vindicated"},{"text":"Oct 2016: polls had Clinton +9.4, lostOct 2020: polls had Biden +7.1, won by 1.2There was never a narrative that Biden was the underdog.","title":"Pennsylvania Dems Allege Harris Is Screwing Up Her Campaign in Their State: Report"},{"text":"I've been confronted by the reality that many people close to me are trumpers in spite of my active curation.

If it's under 600, she's cooked (just based on Fetterman's number (411k) extrapolated for a presidential turnout).Biden got 603k, she's got to improve that number, or keep it the same, and improve the numbers in Bucks and Montgomery, and somehow keep the margins tamped down in Pennsyltucky.Some of this is the usual 'democratic operative' pants-wetting to Politico that happens every cycle, so bear that in mind as well, either for legitimate reasons, or in an attempt to drive up turnout even more for the 12 people that read Politico still.It's been proven over time, telling Democrats they're behind and having them doomscrolling is a better motivator than anything else, unfortunately.But yeah, we'll know 'expected vote' in Philadelphia County when the polls close.

Emphasized extreme nationalism, advocating for the racial superiority of the \\"Aryan race\\" and the need to reclaim Germany's lost glory post-WWI (\\"Lebensraum\\").\\n- **MAGA**: Focuses on \\"America First,\\" with calls to prioritize American interests, jobs, and identity over global cooperation and foreign influence. **Populism and Anti-Elitism**\\n- **Nazis**: Gained support by attacking the Weimar government, intellectual elites, and cosmopolitan cities, blaming them for economic hardship and cultural decay.\\n- **MAGA**: Rallies against the so-called \\"deep state,\\" liberal elites, intellectuals, and media, blaming them for economic inequality, cultural decline, and loss of American values. **Scapegoating and Xenophobia**\\n- **Nazis**: Blamed Jews, communists, and minorities (e.g., Roma, disabled people) for Germanys economic woes and social instability.\\n- **MAGA**: Targets immigrants (particularly from Latin America and Muslim-majority countries), Black Lives Matter activists, and other non-white groups, claiming they undermine American society. **Authoritarianism and Democratic Undermining**\\n- **Nazis**: After gaining power, the Nazis quickly dismantled the democratic Weimar Republic, centralized authority under Hitler, and suppressed political opposition.\\n- **MAGA**: Trump and MAGA figures have challenged democratic institutions (e.g., attacking the legitimacy of elections, pressuring judiciary and Congress, undermining checks and balances) to consolidate power. **Militarism and Law-and-Order Rhetoric**\\n- **Nazis**: Glorified the military and paramilitary groups like the SA and SS, using them to enforce political conformity and suppress dissent.\\n- **MAGA**: Strong \\"law and order\\" rhetoric, glorification of military and police forces, support for armed militia groups (e.g., Proud Boys, Oath Keepers), and encouraging violence against protestors or political opponents. **Cult of Personality**\\n- **Nazis**: Adolf Hitler was portrayed as a messianic leader, the singular savior of the German people.\\n- **MAGA**: Donald Trump is central to the movement, seen as a strong, unassailable leader who \\"tells it like it is\\" and can \\"drain the swamp.\\" **Rhetoric of National Decline and Crisis**\\n- **Nazis**: Promoted the idea that Germany had been humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles and undermined by internal enemies, requiring radical change to recover its past strength.\\n- **MAGA**: Argues that America has lost its greatness due to globalism, immigration, and liberal policies, emphasizing a return to an idealized past (\\"Make America Great Again\\"). **Anti-Immigrant and Nativist Policies**\\n- **Nazis**: Passed laws to exclude and marginalize Jews and non-Germans, culminating in the Nuremberg Laws and eventually the Holocaust.\\n- **MAGA**: Advocates for strict immigration policies, such as building a border wall, travel bans targeting Muslim-majority countries, and mass deportations. **Conspiracy Theories and Disinformation**\\n- **Nazis**: Spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, such as the idea that Jews were responsible for Germanys defeat in WWI and global financial crises (\\"stab-in-the-back myth\\").\\n- **MAGA**: Conspiracies like QAnon, claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, and the \\"deep state\\" narrative that unseen forces are undermining Trump and American patriots. **Use of Violence and Intimidation**\\n- **Nazis**: Employed paramilitary forces like the SA (Brownshirts) to intimidate opponents, disrupt opposition rallies, and enforce Nazi ideology.\\n- **MAGA**: Encouragement of violence against political opponents, as seen in events like the January 6th Capitol insurrection, armed protests, and clashes with counter-protestors. **Media Control and Propaganda**\\n- **Nazis**: Controlled the press, using propaganda through Joseph Goebbels to spread Nazi ideology and silence dissenting voices.\\n- **MAGA**: Regular attacks on the mainstream media (\\"fake news\\"), promotion of alternative right-wing media (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart, OANN), and use of social media to spread disinformation and create an alternative reality. **Economic Grievances**\\n- **Nazis**: Capitalized on Germany's hyperinflation, unemployment, and economic collapse in the 1920s and 1930s, blaming Jews, communists, and the Treaty of Versailles.\\n- **MAGA**: Focused on the perceived economic decline of working-class white Americans, blaming globalization, outsourcing, and immigration for job loss, and vowing to bring back manufacturing jobs. **Anti-Globalism**\\n- **Nazis**: Opposed international cooperation, arguing that Germany needed to be self-sufficient and dominate its neighbors for resources and security.\\n- **MAGA**: Similarly anti-globalist, opposing trade deals (e.g., NAFTA), international agreements (e.g., the Paris Climate Accord), and multilateral organizations like the UN, promoting isolationist policies instead. **Religious Rhetoric**\\n- **Nazis**: While officially secular, the Nazis exploited Christian sentiments to gain support, portraying Hitler as a figure sent to save Germany, and aligning with conservative Christians to fight \\"godless\\" communism.\\n- **MAGA**: Strong ties with Christian nationalism, portraying Trump as a defender of Christian values and Western civilization against secularism, immigration, and multiculturalism. **Gender Roles and Family Values**\\n- **Nazis**: Emphasized traditional gender roles, promoting women as mothers and homemakers to increase the \\"Aryan\\" birthrate and strengthen the German nation.\\n- **MAGA**: Echoes traditionalist views on gender, emphasizing the preservation of traditional family structures and opposing LGBTQ+ rights and progressive gender policies. **Patriotism vs. Cosmopolitanism**\\n- **Nazis**: Demonized cosmopolitanism and urban centers as decadent, Jewish-controlled spaces that eroded national values.\\n- **MAGA**: Targets urban elites, liberal cities, and coastal regions, portraying them as disconnected from \\"real\\" America, which is identified with rural, white, conservative areas.","title":"Kamala Harris agrees that Donald Trump is a fascist: Yes, we can say that"},{"text":"His team is basically the supporting cast of a real life version of \\"The Emperor

The MAGA movement is a dangerous and lethal syndrome of what I describe as Authoritarian Violence Disorder. Donald Trump is a massive superspreader. The contagion and the moral disengagement it causes provokes cruelty and obedience. This is accelerated by the effects of constant-lies. Streams of lies are not just lies to be fact-checked, but an accelerant that impacts peoples brains, causing moral disengagement, allowing people to abandon their own decision-making and obey.Maybe I don't appreciate modern journalism, but I found it annoying they buried this quote 60% of the way through the article.

You have your own self-interests, needs, desires, etc. Other people have their own self-interests, needs, and desires. You probably wouldn't want people to be mean to you or abuse you or hurt you. So it makes logical sense that they wouldn't want you to be mean to them, abuse them, or hurt them. If you are doing something you know hurts someone else, you should stop because you would want them to stop doing something harmful to you. Like, I don't have your mental disorder so I can't fully understand what your life experience is like. But I can relate it to things I do know like the concept of fairness. I can understand why it doesn't seem fair to be criticized for something that isn't my fault. Likewise, it's not fair to other people to get hurt by you for something you have no control over...they shouldn't be expected to associate with you if it causes them to get hurt, just like you don't want to be friends with someone that doesn't give you what you want. From a \\"transactional relationship\\" standpoint, your lack of compassion and care is a bad deal.

Their steel mills, their manufacturing plants, their factories continually cut jobs until they completely closed due to the development of better facilities elsewhere or the lower wages countries could offer.But the rich leveraged this as an opportunity to call for lower taxes, claiming that if they were taxed less, their companies would remain competitive despite the fact that we passed that inflection point long ago. But trickle down economics was championed and these people bought into it.Now the politicians are in a bind, because the tax cuts aren't going to solve the problem, so people will still be unhappy. So how do they avoid having to admit their policies failed to boost the economy like they promised? They start throwing out scapegoats. If it weren't for these various drains on our tax dollars, we could cut taxes more, and then we'd be effective! We're less than 20 years from the Civil Rights era at this point, so African Americans are the easiest scapegoat since they still haven't really been established in our society and there's a lot of racism still prevalent. So the minorities in the city are blamed.And once those excuses run out, on to the next group. Now we're to the point where it's all the illegal immigrants' fault! And all along, nobody's stopped to say \\"hey, we were wrong about that.\\" So for these people, year after year it's another group added to the list to blame for their economic struggles. It's never the fault of anyone in their community, it's always the people outside of it. Urban minorities, New York elite, illegal immigrants crossing the border. And they just continue to buy into it because it's just an extension of the narrative they've been believing for the last 40+ years.That's how you get so much hate. Because they have to blame everything they're unhappy about their current situation on someone else. And these people are mighty unhappy now that Walmart is the only employer in the area.","title":"Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump among every generation: Poll"},{"text":"Damn you Kamala.

You cant, Allred said as the candidates stared one another down.Cruzs response was to laugh, a reaction that prompted Allred to snap that his remarks were not funny.Youre a threat to democracy, the Democrat added, leaving the senator staring at the floor.Allred spoke of the moment that he was in the joint session of Congress for the certification of the 2020 election results when the Capitol was stormed by pro-Trump rioters trying to overturn the former presidents defeat to President Joe Biden.I was on the House floor when we went through the votes. I remember when you objected to the results in Arizona, Allred recalled.That day, Cruz shared his objections to the election results in Arizona. His actions led to calls for him to resign ahead of the 2024 GOP presidential primaries in January.Continuing his blistering critique, Allred added: On January 6, when a mob was storming the Capitol, he was hiding a supply closet, an incident which Cruz himself wrote about in his 2022 book, Justice Corrupted.Allred also addressed Cruzs controversial trip to Cancun, where the senator abandoned his state in the middle of a winter storm that killed 246 Texans and left millions without power and running water in February 2021. The scandal, which left the senator with the nickname Cancn Cruz, was exacerbated when Cruz attempted to justify his actions by claiming he was just trying to be a good dad to his daughters.When the lights went out in the energy capital of the world, he went to Cancn, Allred added.The debate comes as Allred appears to be hot on Cruzs heels with the gap between the candidates for the seat in the traditionally red stronghold continues to narrow.Cruz, who is looking to retain his seat for a third consecutive term, is still tipped to be narrowly ahead in the race, despite Allred closing the gap to just 2.8 percent, according to The Hills polling.If he wins, Allred, a former NFL linebacker, will become the first Democrat elected to statewide office in Texas since 1994.The race could be critical to determining which party controls the upper chamber.Democrats currently have a two seat advantage over Republicans in the Senate C 51 to 49 C thanks to four independents who caucus with them.But pollsters have warned that a few crucial races could flip the Senate majority into the GOPs hands. Jon Testers Democratic Senate seat in Montana appears to be slipping away, while GOP Senator Rick Scott has garnered a large lead over his Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.","title":"Ted Cruz scolded by Democratic Senate challenger for laughing at Jan 6 comment during heated debate"},{"text":"Hillsdale offers some really good online classes.

Gave me chills and the bravery alone should earn your vote. Cruz is such a slimy weasel and Im tired of him disgracing our great state.

The biggest liability at the moment was the media, who were always going to be holding Harris to a higher standard than Trump. Trump can rant about illegal transgender immigrants eating people's cats and dogs but somehow the issue is that Harris, \\"can't elaborate where she'll be different from Biden\\"? Trump never won on policy, stop pretending he ever was anything but a belligerent moron with vibes that appealed to WWC yokels. Trying to fight him on policy was never a winning battle. Fighting the NYT or CNN media battle was never going to do anything but generate soundbites for Trump and conservatives to butcher and repost to Facebook. Those networks were never anything but liabilities after they drove Biden out of the race for being old. Even as they defend Trump as he goes through a stroke mid townhall. Instead she's been bypassing them via online circuits and letting the conversation happen around her instead of letting it be about her.Let's also be clear: The Republicans are one of the big deciding factors for this election. Trump has never generated support. Even after he got shot at, the man could not break over 47% of the electorate. If he loses any points he's fucked.

I was watching the Casey/Calley Means talk on Tucker. I have seen things about Obamacare that have raised my suspicions about Dems fiercely wanting it. It really wrecked healthcare for anyone making money over the threshold. They said how Obamacare's metric for doctors is to keep the patients on medication. While this may not seem like a voting related or economy related thing, it is. I saw examples where some people are intentionally trying to make less money so they can qualify for Obamacare due to the medications they have been put on, which would be unaffordable through regular insurance (which went through through the roof for everyone once Obamacare entered the healthcare system). How is one supposed to get out of this trap Dems made that ties your healthcare and how much you earn and wants to force you to be impoverished and ill at the same time.

There are 'mainstream' candidates where the media does everything they can to move them forward where the only criticism is about minor parts of their lives or viewpoints and their major scandals are ignored completely. Then, there are other candidates (normal people) who seem to be allowed some success but either get ignored completely by media or get torn down by a relentless media looking into every aspect of their lives trying to generate scandal.In 2004, when Obama beat Alan Keyes in Illinois, I remember Fox News decided to cover this particular race like it was the most important Senate race in America. There were a lot of Senate races - but this one got all the coverage.. on Fox News.. They portrayed it how 'traditional' America was out of touch and a new kind of progressive America was going to be dominant in politics. Out of nowhere, Sean Hannity starts talking about how Barack Obama 'looks so Presidential' and saying stuff like, \\"I wouldn't be surprised if he's running for President soon.\\" It just seemed so odd to me that Fox News, which generally seemed to be 'against Democrats', seemed so giddy as a network that Obama just beat Keyes, the Republican, and went on to bring up Obama over and over for weeks. It seemed like the network was grooming Republicans to get used to Obama and know who he is.Meanwhile.. candidates like Ron Paul.. Fox News went out of its way to minimize any mention of him. Any time they did mention him, they would say things like, \\"Kooky candidate Ron Paul\\" and do nothing but associate Ron Paul with negativity.The mess we're in is clearly that people are waking up to the idea that we have had no real choice for a long time and the bureaucrat part of the US government in coordination with the media has taken over and has provided us with 'choices' that do not matter.

The government ended its 2020 fiscal year with the portion of the national debt owed to investors, the metric favored by the CBO, at around 100% of GDP. The CBO had predicted less than a year earlier that it would take until 2030 to reach that approximate level of debt.

And by \\"actually far-right\\" I mean people who are voting strictly on their \\"feelings\\" on \\"social issues\\", aka the ones voting deliberately to hurt minorities and women.

I'd say seven is pleanty. But just for future reference how many is it for you? 10+, 20+, 50+, 100+?

You can 100% say the commands in charge that day fucked up or those who fed them the information fucked up. What else could you say? No mistakes were made? It was all good? Hamas has been caught using ambulances to transport fighters, is it?*that*?unbelievable they could also use aid transports? Weapons have been found smuggled in with aid shipments as well.Sure they could, and every civillian could be Hamas incognito. Better shoot them and ask questions after.  This line of argument means that you either tacitly accept the incompetence of Israeli intelligence or accept they're targeting civilian aid workers on the off chance they may be Hamas. The incident youre pointing to does not satisfy the intent required by Article II. Again, it could be part of the acts that can constitute genocide but absent that intent it is not genocide by the definition used in Article II.I'd say it does.

This involves a couple of ancient mammals and some fossilized jawbones. The research revolves around two fossils belonging to mammal-precursor species, Brasilodon quadrangularis and Riograndia guaibensis.  These fossils have turned out to be goldmines of insight C revealing the developmental journey of the mammalian jaw and middle ear. The surprises come in the form of evolutionary experiments that occurred much earlier than previously realized. **Mammals and their unique jaws** As we know, mammals have a distinct jaw structure and house three middle ear bones. This unique configuration separates them from earlier vertebrates, which had a single middle ear bone.  These mammal ancestors, referred to as cynodonts, have been the subject of fascination due to this transition. The recent study embarks on uncovering how these cynodonts evolved these distinctive features over a striking period. **Technology to the rescue** The power of technology is responsible for this thrilling turn in mammal evolution. By wielding CT scanning, researchers could digitally reconstruct the jaw joint of these cynodonts.  Interestingly, this species existed a whopping 17 million years before the oldest known specimen showcasing this structure. Yet in Brasilodon quadrangularis, a species closer to our modern mammals, this feature was missing.  **Jaw contact in mammal evolution** Now, heres where the plot thickens: these findings imply that our mammalian ancestors were more adventurous than we gave them credit for.  They dabbled in different jaw functions, leading to the independent evolution of mammalian traits across diverse lineages. The early evolution of mammals was, in fact, a rather complex and varied affair. Leading the research was James Rawson, holding the helm at Bristols School of Earth Sciences.  The acquisition of the mammalian jaw contact was a key moment in mammal evolution. What these new Brazilian fossils have shown is that different cynodont groups were experimenting with various jaw joint types, and that some features once considered uniquely mammalian evolved numerous times in other lineages as well, Rawson stated. **Implications of the discovery** This isnt just an intriguing tale for the history books. The history of jaws holds extensive implications for our understanding of the early stages of mammal evolution.  Over the last years, these tiny fossil species from Brazil have brought marvelous information that enrich our knowledge about the origin and evolution of mammalian features. We are just at the beginning, and our multinational collaborations will bring more news soon, adds Dr. Agustn Martinelli from the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Natural of Buenos Aires. **Jaw fossils in understanding mammal evolution** Fossils, often termed as natures historical archives, play a pivotal role in piecing together the evolutionary puzzle of life on Earth. They provide crucial evidence that allows scientists to trace morphological changes over millennia and understand the adaptations that occurred in response to environmental shifts. In the context of mammalian evolution, fossils like those of Brasilodon quadrangularis and Riograndia guaibensis have unveiled transformative stages in the development of features such as the jaw and middle ear. These findings highlight not only the structural adaptations over time but also the experimental paths taken by diverse lineages. By continuing to study such fossils, we enrich our comprehension of the intricate tapestry of evolutionary history and the way ancient species shaped the biological characteristics of contemporary mammals. **Future research directions** The revelations brought forth by the study of ancient fossils invite a plethora of questions and opportunities for further investigation. As scientists aim to delve deeper into the evolutionary lineage of mammals, emphasis will likely be placed on exploring additional fossil sites that might harbor remnants of similar significance. Advances in technology, such as more sophisticated imaging techniques and computational models, will undoubtedly enhance our ability to reconstruct extinct species and simulate evolutionary pathways. Collaboration between paleontologists, biologists, and technologists is essential to paint a more detailed picture of how features once perceived as uniquely mammalian arose through various evolutionary motifs. The field stands on the brink of exciting discoveries, with each new finding having the potential to reshape our understanding of mammalian ancestry and its complex narrative. **Hope for more discoveries** Our story doesnt end here. The research team is raring to dive deeper into the South American fossil record, which has proved to be a veritable treasure trove of information on mammalian evolution.  Nowhere else in the world has such a diverse array of cynodont forms, closely related to the earliest mammals, noted Professor Marina Soares of the Museu Nacional, Brazil. By melding these new findings with prior data, scientists hope to enhance their comprehension of how the early jaw joints functioned and contributed to the development of the mammals. Fossils and the secrets they harbor continue to lend fascinating insights into our own narrative.  The study opens new doors for paleontological research, as these fossils provide invaluable evidence of the complex and varied evolutionary experiments that ultimately gave rise to modern mammals, Rawson aptly said. Heres to embracing the unknown, and the promise of many more intriguing tales from the depths of the Earths chronicles. The study is published in the journal Nature.!ping BIOLOGY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"That's the thing. Illegal votes do happen, voter fraud does happen.

Yes, youll trot out Ben Gvir and his ilk, but he is no more representative of the entire state of Israel than Haniyeh was representative of every Gaza civilian. You can claim that the conditions on the ground constitute one of the acts listed in Article II, and you can point to radicals in the Israeli government to claim intent is there. But thats doing the same thing as saying every Palestinian is Hamas. It is not showing Israels intent is to kill Palestinians as a people by engaging in warfare on the terms that Hamas has chosen: within civilian areas and with civilian casualties.While Israels intent with respect to Palestinians is not (as yet) provable, Hamas with respect to civilians is. They have openly stated that civilians are Israels responsibility, not theirs. There are also documents indicating civilian casualties are a deliberate part of the Hamas strategy because Israel can be blamed for them. Not to mention Hamas stealing aid, preventing civilians from leaving combat zones, storing weapons and military equipment in schools, hospitals, etc.I would say you could believably argue that Israel is being indifferent to civilian casualties and civilian suffering at this point, but to go beyond that and insist on genocide is a much higher bar. To try and apply it as broadly as you are is essentially saying all war is genocide. Thats not stating *approval* for whats going on mind you.

It also misunderstands the Gaza health ministry numbers, which don't claim to represent the total dead - only those directly confirmed dead (there isn't the opportunity to count all the bodies in a war zone where many buildings are reduced to ruins) and a direct consequence of combat (Not including those dying of disease due to the impact of starvation from Israel's blockade).

You state: .....genocide, as defined as the eradication of a particular demographic group....That's purposefully vague and inaccurate. Eradication is only one form of genocide. By your definition, there was no genocide in WW2. Article 2 of the Genocide Convention defines genocide as:... any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such:(a) Killing members of the group;(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.With some debate for (e), every other characteristic for a genocide is met, and exceeded by, as you classified, an apartheid state. While I certainly believe that Israel is in effect an apartheid state (I would define this as government-enforced separation between two racial groups at the behest of one), with the practical reality being that they are a government for and by Jewish Israelites.....An apartheid, genocidal state.","title":"CMV: Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza."},{"text":"International law does not exist.

The fact that Israel hasnt killed everyone in Palestine is only because they know that even they cant get away with that. They certainly have the means and the desire to do so, as espoused by literally all the government ministers. Most Israelis support the ethnic cleansing, as evidenced by the votes for extreme right wing ministers into government for the last however many years its been since Israel was violently birthed. So ministers are just doing what they are voted in to do. Youre quoting numbers from Israel who routinely clain not a single civilian has been killed. Many NGOs report that the number of civilians killed reported by hamas is a conservative figure as thousands remain buried. Has only reports on bodies that have been identified. Systematically starving people to death on its may not amount to genocide, but look at the overall picture. Its everything that Israel is doing that amounts to genocide. Killing huge amounts of civilians, many children and women, who cannot then go on to procreate, immediately stopping the line of population growth. Starvation of the remaining civilians leading to disease and famine, and death. Maiming huge amounts of the population. Destroying schools and universities so the remaining civilians cannot be educated or learn about their own cultures Destroying hospitals so people have to leave for treatment Not allowing people to return to their homesThe policy of illegal settlements These things are just the tip of the iceberg, all designed to force Palestinians out, destroy their culture, instill fear, and ultimately cleanse the whole of gaza and the west bank. Genocide is not just killing everyone of a particular ethnicity/culture. Its the attempt to do so via various means, ie destroying culture, people, the a ability to learn etc. The nazis tried with the jews, they didnt kill every jew, but certainly attempted it. And we still say the nazis were committing genocide. On that view, the Israelis, and i include Israeli civilian population in this, are trying to commit genocide.","title":"CMV: Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza."},{"text":"Totally alpha'd Cruz &amp; his beta-aura, same as Trump did, except with intelligence.","title":"Colin Allred came out swinging in Tuesday night's debate against Ted Cruz"},{"text":"Headlines should simply indicate content.

Which makes it clear that Israel *can* conduct very targeted and discriminate attacks against their enemies, they just elect not to when it comes to their attacks on Palestinians. Instead, extremely high yield explosives are dropped on a dense civilian center because of typically unsubstantiated claims that some member of Hamas was there.Additionally, it would be nonsensical for a genocidal state to periodically allow aid to reach the people they allegedly aim to exterminate.This is the just \\"it can't be genocide because Israel would have killed them all on public TV by now\\" argument. It seems like it'd pair well with the \\"they dropped a smaller bomb first as a warning so anyone killed by the bigger bomb deserved it\\" talking point people like to bring up. All of which, ultimately, is just marketing. Because Israel is self-aware enough that it knows it can't literally announce a genocide and kill millions of people while maintaining the support it desperately relies on. So they make token gestures that allow them to continue their actions without criticism because they let in an aid truck that they bombed the next day or whatever.And lastly, the suffering of the Palestinians is no greater than any other urban population amidst urban conflict independent of claims of genocide, thus it seems as though the emotive rhetorical claim of 'genocide in Gaza' is not empirical.The thing is that this isn't just random urban conflict. Gazans literally cannot leave, their infrastructure and homes are completely gone, and they lacked for adequate food and water even before the bombs and invasion. Had Israel made an effort to actually establish a safe place for them to go, instead of routinely bombing everywhere they designated as safe to perpetually force march the entire population, maybe things would be different. Where every \\"war is hell so everything is justified!\\" talking point fails the second you bring up the West Bank, where the government has armed extremists with and has ordered its soldiers to aid them in violently expelling Palestinians from their homes, as well as simply killed many of them.What we're left with is a state whose leader invokes genocidal rhetoric, echoed (in song) by his soldiers and added upon by his ministers. The repeated desire they have for all Palestinians to be forced out and scattered throughout the world so it can properly be settled by deserving Israelis gives them as much cover from the accusations as the people who proposed the Madagascar Plan as an early \\"solution\\". But we're all expected to wait a few decades until some Israeli rediscovers their soul and shares evidence of Netanyahu going \\"do a genocide\\" so people can stop pretending","title":"CMV: Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza."},{"text":"Don't forget gaslight!","title":"Actual post by Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Crosstab fuckery","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 15, 2024 - 21 days until election day!"},{"text":"So what exactly is preventing Israel to let at least the women and children leave Gaza and let them shelter on the Israeli side of the border, and give them food, shelter and medical aid?","title":"CMV: Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/8whcgqy473vd1.jpeg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739ac52049ad96b5fc0d3a2eb6aa144f00caf3b4","title":"Yes, I Will Legalize Recreational Cannabis at the Federal Level - VP Kamala Harris Goes All in on Weed!"},{"text":"Hilarious","title":"Discussion Thread: 2024 Debate for Texas' US Senate Seat Between Rep.

Texas has been gradually shifting purple since the 2000s, and many people despise Cruz.Lets not forget that Cruz hasnt faced reelection since 2018, and this is only his second term in Congress. Even after Betos taking your guns controversy, in a gun-loving state like Texas, Cruz only managed to win 50.9% of the vote.Allred, though not a senator, has won multiple congressional races. In 2018 (against an incumbent Republican) and 2020, he secured 56% of the vote in his district. By 2022, his margin was even larger, netting 65%. Hes a native Texan, played NCAA football for a Texas universitywhich could sway voters hereand he has consistently maintained his popularity.All of this is happening while Texas remains heavily gerrymandered. I understand that the 32nd district is predominantly made up of people of color, who tend to vote more blue historically, but the political landscape has shifted dramatically. Sure, there will be some racist voters who would choose a white mans corpse over a person of color, but Allred is only down by 1 point in the polls, so maybe we can pull it off.We might not be able to rid ourselves of Cruz, but having a Democrat from Texas in the Senate would be huge. Plus, the GOP is being forced to spend a ton of money campaigning here, and their messaging is weak. Ultimately, this means they cant use that money in other battleground states.

TL;DR: Colin Allred stood his ground while Ted Cruz hid in a closet.YouTube - [Congressman Colin Allred live at the Texas Democratic Convention](https://www.youtube.com/live/BTictCqGPTc) (15:50)[Rep. Lizzy Fletcher] Colin and I were both in the Capital on January 6th. I was up in the House gallery, Colin was down on the House floor.And as the warnings came in that a mob was inside the Capital, as we heard beating on the doors and breaking glass, I watched as Colin took off his suit jacket, ready to fight anyone who came through that door.We saw that day, and in the days since, the very real threats to our democracy that I know are on the minds of everyone here. And I am here to tell you that there is no one, no one, more committed to protecting our democracy, our freedoms, our rights, our progress, and our country than Colin Allred.The Warning with Steve Schmidt - [Ted Cruz hid in the closet during January 6th riots](https://youtube.com/shorts/x-XszoQLOCY)[Rep Colin Allred] I just want to talk about January 6th because I was there and I was about 50 feet away from Senator Cruz when he objected. At some point the representative from Sergeant at Arms gets on the microphone and tells us that the Capital has been breached, tear gas has been deployed in the Rotunda. You know, being the only former NFL linebacker on the floor, I take off my suit coat and Im literally preparing to have to defend. And some of my colleagues joined me and took off their suit jackets. Particularly the younger men.While that was happening, Ted Cruz, who had whipped up that mob. And who had gone around the country talking about how this was a steal. And who was, as we learned later, part of the legal backing for trying to challenge this. And who was implementing the legal strategy, which was to try and delay, delay, delay. He was hiding in the supply closet.And I think it does say something about who he is, and I dont think it matches who we are as Texans.Baptist News Global - [Politics, faith and mission: A conversation with Colin Allred](https://baptistnews.com/article/politics-faith-and-mission-a-conversation-with-colin-allred/)Greg Garrett:  Rep. Allred, you have spoken about being in the Capitol on January 6, about texting your wife a possible goodbye, about preparing to defend yourself and your congressional colleagues from the insurrectionists. As you think about the events of January 6 now, what are the things that stand out for you? What would you want Americans to understand about that day and its aftermath?Colin Allred: I remember sending that text to my wife, a text I never thought Id have to send in this job. I wrote, Whatever happens, I love you. She was at home with our son, who was not yet 2, and she was seven months pregnant with our second son. I wasnt sure if I was going to make it out. I learned later that Vice President Pences security detail were sending the same text to their loved ones.When youre a former professional football player in a situation like that, people will unsurprisingly look to you for protection. So I took my suit jacket off and got ready to take on whatever came through that door.That day, we came closer to losing our democracy than a lot of people realize, and Ted Cruz is responsible for that. He spread the lie that the election was stolen and was the senator who objected to the certification of the results in an attempt to overturn the will of the American people. But when the mob stormed the Capitol, he hid in a supply closet.As a former voting rights attorney, protecting our free and fair elections and our democracy is extremely important to me.","title":"Ted Cruz, Colin Allred come out swinging over abortion, immigration in Texas debate"},{"text":"Looking like it has been hit by a nuclear bomb is indicative of it being an urban-warfare epicentre.
