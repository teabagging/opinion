The heavily redacted report details a boozy night at a hotel in California, a poolside argument and two conflicting versions of what ultimately took place inside Hegseths hotel room.This is another instance of people being blindsided, so I think theres rising frustration there, said a person familiar with the transition. While the president-elect is still behind Hegseth for now, if this continues to be a drumbeat and the press coverage continues to be bad, particularly on TV, then I think there is a real chance that he loses Trumps confidence.The Monterey police said a redacted version of the report had been released to Hegseth on March 30, 2021. The transition team wasnt told that a copy of the police report had been released to Hegseth previously, the people familiar with the discussions said.Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.), who will become the No. 2 Senate Republican in January, called Hegseth a strong nominee after their morning meeting. Pete pledged that the Pentagon will focus on strength and hard powernot the current administrations woke political agenda.I think he can explain a lot of the situations.

Most of it has nothing to do with \\"control\\": they fund research into education (e.g., their \\"What Works\\" clearinghouse); they provide rather specialized grants to places, for example to train teachers in particular fields or regions; and rather down the list, they have a couple of offices that are responsible for monitoring/handling certain things the GOP currently hate - civil rights laws related to education (e.g., Title IX).And (IMHO) that is the reason they hate ED, because in their mind, the civil rights stuff is all they think they do. Which I think is silly, because most of that stuff are statutes that Congress controls, and regulations shaped by decades of courts cases.

But Netanyahu kept escalating. Trump is FAR FAR FAR worse. Is it bad she didn't say anything on Gaza, only she would be samey as Biden? Yes, bad. Is this Neoliberalism? No not Neoliberalism.Neoliberalism is Generally understood as reforms and laws to give more free hand to big corporation, less power to the state. Together with tax cuts for them. A lot of Raeganomics which just doesnt work. And also deregulation, privatization of everything. A lot of supply side economica while ignoring the consumer. Certainly NOT giving workers anything lol. She and Biden tried to build more jobs, wanted to regulate private sector MORE and tax corporations and stock traders, which also heavily goes against Neoliberalism. Biden WAS the anti Neoliberalism guy. Funnily enough. He Was the guy FOR consumers and normal people than the LAST 50 YEARS of presidents. He was THE ONLY PRESIDENT to join autoworker strike. THE ONLY. Hr criticized price gouging and wanted to limit it openly. He was more pro working class than Obama and Clinton. Here from wiki:\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeoliberalismNeoliberalism is often associated with a set of economic liberalization policies, including privatization, deregulation, consumer choice, globalization, free trade, monetarism, austerity, and reductions in government spending. These policies are designed to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society.This is the opposite of Neoliberalism, still capitalism but the Government is far more active. Regulating and also helping DEMAND. not Just supply side economics all the way and privatization and monopolies to the max as we have it now.

I believe it is one of the few jobs of the US Government.

I manufacture it here, hire US workers and pay local, state and federal taxes on what I generate.   I put out the product, which has a quick uptake in sales and is a new hit in the market.  3 months later, multiple products with the same design specifications hits the market and undercuts my sales even though I have sole ownership of the mechanism's design and how it is implemented in the product.What recourse do I have against foreign pop-up manufacturers who make a run with a brand name that was randomly generated set of consonants and vowels, sell until the product is done and close up shop to avoid any legal ramifications?  I'm not a fan of Government intervention but regulating commerce is Section 8 clause 3 in the constitution.  Based on this, my opinion is that one of the many compoinding reasons we have very little manufacturing here in the USA is due to this IP theft from other nations who do not enforce it with companies operating in their countries.

I know a lot of schools don't bus within a certain radius and not all provide support for gifted and/or special needs kids, but a lot still do and all that shit's gonna be a lot harder to come by in a privatized school system.I've only got one kid and it looks like they're pretty much on the gifted track for their school, so I doubt it'll be a huge issue for us, but folks with larger families and varying needs across all their kids are gonna have a hell of a time with all this.

I also say Jack Smith's cases having to be ended are 100% on Merrick Garland. Garland was scared of appearing to act in a partisan way by investigating trump for any of the crimes he committed on his way out of office, and as a result, Smith didn't have enough time to get the cases heard before the election.

Were a border, the 54-year-old said, nodding towards Mexico less than a mile from the grocery store in Rio Grande City, a working-class town named after the nearby river.And youve got so many people coming across, youve got criminals, youve got terrorists and theyre just letting them through. Plus, inflation.Yet another case of feelings over facts.Fact: Undocumented immigrants are far less likely to commit crimes than US citizens.Fact: Not one single terrorist attack has been carried out in this country by someone coming through the southern border illegally.Fact: The steady supply of cheap labor is one of the reasons inflation isnt a lot worse than it currently is. Deporting farm workers will, in fact, make eggs more expensive. Along with every other domestically produced food. Trumps tariffs will handle the rest. For real, if he enacts even half of what he wants, things are going to get expensive, FAST. That is if we can even *get* them. Were likely to see food rotting in fields for a season or two while farmers figure out how to harvest the things that have already been planted. Then the real pain hits when theres nobody to plant the next crop.Fact: The only reason were just letting them through is because our immigration system is severely underfunded and cant process people quickly enough, so we give them a court date and hope they show up, which most of them do..Fact: Many undocumented immigrants arent coming across the border in the dead of night. A large percentage are visa overstays who were allowed in as visitors and just never left.I grew up not too far from Rio Grande City. I live in another part of the country still pretty close to the border. There isnt a massive wave of crime being committed by undocumented immigrants. There arent roving gangs of Venezuelans taking over parts of the city. All of these things are false narratives that Fox News and newsmax have repeated ad nauseum to get MAGA supporters to *feel* like theyre being attacked.The REAL source of violence from Mexico is due to the cartels, which are supplying the drugs (and humans) that Americans demand. Maybe if we came up with a sensible drug and immigration policy, we could actually hit the cartels where it would hurt them, which is the insane profits from trafficking.","title":"The Texan farmland where Trump plans to build deportation centre"},{"text":"This is what will literally cause blood in the streets.

Until such time, welfare reform should encourage partnerships with (without providing any taxpayer funding to) faith-based institutions, community, and business organizations to temporarily assist individuals in need.  \\n   \\n  195.

The oligarchs broke the state in Russia, they set themselves up stuck that they could no longer be touched, and then there is nothing to do but defer to them or rebel.Musks proposal to cut government jobs will not save much money, but saving money isn't the purpose.

Whether or not it actually saves money is orthogonal to the point. Saving the state money a distraction. He's already basically broken the SEC, they can't even get him to appear before then, he just ignores them and they're realizing they can't touch him because his legal resources are too deep.People miss things like this by looking at things from the perspective of a middle income worker, rather than someone who runs multiple large and powerful institutions.

Yes, they plan on cutting lots of people, but the E stands for efficiency.  They could find two agencies doing the same thing, with 1000 workers each doing that job. If they decide it's a critical government function, but only needs 1500 workers, it could be more efficient to fire the 1000 positions of one agency, then hire 500 in the other agency.  Another example could be something where expertise has shifted.  Suppose an agency has 100 lawyers whose jobs it is to interpret the laws passed by Congress into regulations that industry can understand. This happens all the time... Congress passes a law with the word \\"reasonable\\" in it, then industry asks wtf is and isn't reasonable? We want exact regs!  So Musk pauses Diablo 4 and decides 100 lawyers are no longer needed. 50 lawyers using LLMs is enough if we replace the other 50 with paralegals.  You know, because Musk is a super genius and can totally understand things like regulatory development in fields he's unfamiliar with.    Anyway, if 50 lawyers and 50 paralegals can do the same work with today's technology that 100 lawyers could do in the past, isn't it more efficient, at least in spending terms, to fire 50 lawyers then hire 50 paralegals?  I'm not saying they **will** take this approach. Musk and Ramaswamy love headlines, though, and talking about cutting entire agencies makes headlines. But there are ways to become more efficient that do involve hiring people to replace fired ones.","title":"DOGE and Project 2025"},{"text":"Exactly. What's going to happen if he won't sign.

It's even worse when you break it down by year. Since 08 when Obama beat out Hilary. The DNC establishment has had a thimb on the scale of their primaries. In 12, it was Obama's re-election. Ok, i get this popular president running for re-elect. Still think there should have been a primary so that Obama could have practiced campaigning before getting creamed by Romney, but at least this is forgivable. In 16, Hilary was essentially coorinated. In 20 yes Biden won, but with a huge caveot. He had the entire moderate wing collapse behind him after losing the first three states. In fact, both Bernie and waren were ahead of him. It has been widely reported that the collapse was planned because the DNC establishment feared Bernie. In 24, Kamala was immediately endorsed by Bidin (reportedly as an FU to Pelosie and Obama). Crowding out any hope for a real challenge. Whilr I think Kamala would have won a primary, she still needed it as both a way to re-introduce herself and message the test. Instead, she had to build the proverbial campaign plane in the air while flying it. 28 needs, and I mean, needs to be a completely open primary. No endorcements, no meddling from party elites.Also, for the record, I'm not even saying hey, Bernie needs to win. I think that an economic populist message that focuses on community building and not identity is a winning message, but that's just me.

Environmental Collapse:** Agencies like the EPA will be gutted, which means more polluted waterways, toxic air, and unchecked industrial waste. Think Flints water crisis but on a national scale. Corporations will cut corners, and youll pay the pricethrough health bills, unlivable communities, and disasters like floods and fires made worse by climate inaction.\\n**2. Worker Exploitation:** Say goodbye to labor protections. Project 2025 will make it even easier for corporations to exploit workerslonger hours, unsafe conditions, and stagnant wages will become the norm. And if you try to fight back?

Millions could lose access to basic healthcare and food assistance. For the Greedlords, this isnt a bugits a feature. A desperate, struggling workforce is easier to control.\\n**4. Weaponizing Agencies:** Instead of serving the public, federal agencies will become tools for political vengeance and corporate greed. Expect whistleblowers and dissenters to be silenced while watchdogs that keep the powerful in check are dismantled.\\n**5. Communities Left Behind:** Rural America, already struggling, will get hit the hardest. Cuts to infrastructure, public services, and disaster response will make these areas even more vulnerable. The billionaires will build higher walls around their mansions while the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves.Project 2025 is the Greedlords endgame: destroy the safeguards that keep them in check, and leave the rest of us to deal with the fallout. Theyll sell it as reform, but the reality is this: theyre breaking the system so they can break us. Its time to fight back before its too late.","title":"Trump's transition team turns to Project 2025 after disavowing it during the campaign"},{"text":"Spot on. There's a famous quote of Isaac Asimov that fits perfectly what you said : \\"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.

Apparently they consider it a sign of weakness! You can clearly see that trump having problem reading and needs to squint a lot which he has embraced as a sign of power in his photos! The other night, Elon was making fun of Cuban by putting on glasses!Here are some interesting facts about tanning based on Perplexity:Tanning has indeed been a symbol of power and status throughout history, with its meaning shifting over time based on societal and economic factors.\\\\ Historical PerspectivesAncient TimesIn ancient cultures, fair skin was often associated with nobility and high status\\\\[1\\\\]. For instance:\\\\- In Ancient Egypt, women with fair skin were considered of higher status\\\\[2\\\\].\\\\- Ancient Greeks and Romans viewed pale skin as a sign of refinement and sophistication\\\\[2\\\\].Industrial RevolutionThe perception of tanned skin began to change during the Industrial Revolution:\\\\- As factory workers moved indoors, the upper classes became associated with outdoor leisure activities\\\\[3\\\\].\\\\- Tanned skin started to symbolize the ability to enjoy the outdoors and sunlight, a luxury not afforded to the working class\\\\[3\\\\].\\\\ Modern Tanning as a Status SymbolThe Coco Chanel EffectA significant shift occurred in the 1920s when fashion icon Coco Chanel accidentally got sunburned on a yacht:\\\\- Her tanned appearance was celebrated by the media, sparking a new trend\\\\[1\\\\]\\\\[3\\\\].\\\\- Tanning quickly became associated with wealth, adventure, and sophistication\\\\[2\\\\].Leisure and LuxuryIn the 20th century, a tan became a clear indicator of social status:\\\\- It symbolized the ability to take vacations and engage in leisure activities\\\\[4\\\\].\\\\- Tanned skin suggested one had the freedom to play tennis or go to the beach, activities associated with the wealthy\\\\[4\\\\].Business and SuccessBy the 1980s, tanning had become so ingrained as a status symbol that:\\\\- It was believed that one couldn't succeed in business with pale skin\\\\[3\\\\].\\\\- Tanned skin was seen as aspirational, indicating success and a luxurious lifestyle\\\\[3\\\\].\\\\ Cultural VariationsIt's important to note that the perception of tanned skin as a symbol of power is not universal:\\\\- In many Asian countries, fair skin is still highly valued and associated with beauty and social status\\\\[2\\\\].\\\\- The meaning of tanned skin can vary significantly across different cultures and time periods\\\\[5\\\\].In conclusion, while tanning has indeed been a symbol of power and status in Western societies for much of the 20th and early 21st centuries, its significance has evolved over time and differs across cultures. The association of tanned skin with leisure, wealth, and success has made it a potent symbol of social and economic power in many contexts.Edit: Reddit, for some reason, didn't allow me to post the references, so needed to remove them.","title":"Why Is Everyone In Trump World So Absurdly Tan?

This is not a thing, and if it's a thing at all, it certainly hasn't become more of a thing since trans people have been permitted inside female bathrooms.  If anything, since conservatives seem to think trans women are as strong as a WWE wrestlers, they should be happy to have them there to defend against actual bad actors. Where do you come down on gun control laws? They used to work.  It used to be very hard for people to purchase illegal weapons.  Now due to the proliferation of firearms the percent of crimes committed with stolen ones has gone up by multiples.  Additionally, given that thousands of people die every year from gun violence and over a hundred thousand are injured, often in life altering ways, and given there has been no wave of SAs committed by \\"men in dresses\\", interest in gun control laws is a lot easier to rationalize by people who don't live in a fantasy reality where everyone is a threat.Furthermore, the entire purpose of laws is to provide a punishment framework, not to prevent crime.  Any crime a \\"man in a dress\\" might commit is already punishable under the law.  Numerous harmful acts committed by people with firearms get brushed under the rug due to relaxation of laws, like the 9 year old who was murdered by a legal gun owner in Houston when he fired into her family's truck thinking they were baddies.  It took over a year for him to be indicted, and it was only because the family wouldn't give up.  Incidents of frivolous brandishing have increased dramatically because requirements to understand the law via training have been swept by the wayside, in favor of \\"constitutional carry\\".This always gets framed as an \\"anti-trans\\" issue.

The United States ALSO employs slave labor across our economy, just like China. You might want to re-read the 13th amendment to the Constitution, as it contains a rather LARGE exemption in it, for prison labor, and we use a LOT of prison labor (especially in Alabama, for some reason) which certainly meets the legal definition of slave labor, since they are paid little or nothing, AND they are coerced into doing it, through violence or abusive prison rules. One could argue that (some of) their slaves are political prisoners, while ours were all Hard Core criminals, that Deserve to be stamping them license plates, but the US holds many tax protestors in prison, without actual due process, and also we DID recently convict a man of 34 felonies for not filing the TPS political paperwork for his mistress, which has never happened before in the history of the republic. (all campaign finance had previously been civil matters, with fines only) So I would argue we also have political prisoners, even if they are proportionally far less than China.That being said, our median wage (for our non-slaves) is WAY higher than a lot of East Asian countries, so there is a very good reason to trade with them, one that tariffs will likely not change, since all the plants and equipment to make things like computer monitors are there, and no one will invest in bringing that stuff here, which would be a hella-expensive move, to the land of high taxes, costs, and environmental BS, because its entirely possible that tariffs will come and go as a policy, making long term production hard to plan, kind of like how the Keystone pipeline gets canceled and un-canceled every 4 years, and after a few yo-yo's they just said, F-it, and stopped hemorrhaging money waiting for eco permits, which are HIGHLY politicized in our country, and have little to do with any actual environmental improvements that matter.","title":"Opinions on Trumps Tariffs on China?"},{"text":"Who?

I'm not sure there's a perfect parallel with a governmental system where you have a single person (Musk) who would be in charge of a government program to identify how to route the capital from public taxation to privatize portions of the government and also at the same time be a CEO providing the services to pick up the privatized version of the formerly public asset. It's like some form of capitalism-cancer.\\\\]","title":"Dont let Trump and Musk gut NASA"},{"text":"Youre giving CEOs too much credit. Ive worked with CEOs.

Trump understands that being tan is a sign of leisure, most working people aren't able to lay on a beach all day to get a tan, they're in offices doing work. This is a flipped script where back in the day field hands toiled outside while being indoors was the leisure activity of the wealthy, times change.At some level, Trump simply knows that being tan, is a sign of wealth. The thing is, what separates a good looking natural tan, from the fake and bake spray on over bronzed? That developed taste of aesthetic is something only someone critical of art can possess. Someone who can pause and know when to stop because otherwise you're overworking the piece.  \\nTrump lacks that skill, a lot of people do, especially once they start getting in to body modifications, and it's pervasive in the GOP especially, but anyone who's constantly going under the knife for plastic surgery can be subject to it. Simply put, they're never going to be satisfied, ever.This brings us back to Trump, and his eternal quest to appear more tan, more bronzed, because in his mind he only understands the link between being wealthy means you're tan, and his ego insists that he appears the most wealthy, the most tan.There's more to it, he also acts like a toddler, ever put makeup on a child? I have. They don't want it on their ears or around their eyes. He's also a TV personality, and makeup down the neck gets on his shirts and leaves marks on the collars. End result, you end up with this over bronzed pancake face appearance with the hollowed out eyes.","title":"Why Is Everyone In Trump World So Absurdly Tan?

Say good-bye to Pell Grants and federally backed student loans. Do people understand that low income schools and special education programs are going to be most impacted by this due to a large amount of funding coming from the federal government? One of the main purposes of this department is to ensure equal access to education for all Americans. Can this be achieved at the state level? One could argue that this department has failed at delivering on it's goals because the push to privatize education has been continually gaining traction. The voters in my state just shot down a proposal to provide vouchers to students so they can migrate to a private/religious school. It seems that there is no interest in protecting access, only funneling students away.   \\nPerhaps I am oversimplifying, but the message I get from this is that they do not care if Americans are \\"prepared for global competitiveness\\" as they set out to do when forming in 1979. In fact, an uneducated population is more apt to accept propaganda, be baffled by conflicting sources of misinformation, and therefore less likely to speak out against the government. We no longer feel that educating citizens on civics, the arts, or physical education is important. This is troubling, especially when the incoming President has no issue with lying to the public and appealing only to emotions and negating rational, educated discourse. I mean, of course Trump thinks the DoE is worthless. His kids all went to private schools. Why can't yours? How much does a banana cost these days? $6.2 million?  \\nThe argument about states rights and pushing this to the local level is a valid one to consider, but one need only look at abortion to see the unintended consequences of leaving states to their own devices on key issues that should have some form of federal protection and guidance. Again, the people who will be victim to this will be lower income folks who are already stuck in a cycle of poverty and lack access to quality education. Maybe the states are prepared for this and have a solution, but I have not seen a national conversation take place on the impacts and contingencies.   \\nI am, overall, a proponent of a smaller federal government, as long as said government is laser focused on ensuring the rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and not laser focused on buying lasers to bolster the bloated military industrial complex. The biggest problem is that this is ONE thing that is a complex issue requiring debate and collective compromise.

Would it have been better if Biden had stuck to the one term and we had been through a primary? Yes. But that wasn't enough... Young people - Gaza - they didn't vote because they wanted to teach Democrats a lesson - and they took away any hope for those poor people, but they got to wag their finger at Democrats. They also believe both parties are the same. I've personally seen change - look at my list in the other comment. But younger people haven't.What they and others don't grasp is you need a REAL MAJORITY to get things done, especially  because of the way the filibuster is used. People should get what they vote for, so Democrats tried to kill the filibuster, but they had only a slim majority, and they were blocked by Manchin and Sinema.  Fix Climate change, fix gun control, fix manufacturing, fix prices, legalize abortion - people complain that it never gets done. Nothing is happening!   Hey,  to get things to happen,  they need to VOTE in greater numbers. Biden managed to pass the chips act- but people won't see that right away. He did a lot for the future of manufacturing, He was going after monopolies, but again, that doesn't happen tomorrow. He tried to use laws to protect abortion, so far the supreme court is blocking him.Jon Stewart did a great monologue on how Republicans just do shit, throw spaghetti  at the walls, no care for  norms, they   find loopholes,  they get a thing done. And he was berating Democrats for constantly following the norms, working on bipartisan proposals. Plodding along following the process. I get that they prefer to do things in a way there's less chance of another president coming in and undoing, but they wouldn't have to worry about that if they win the election by getting things done. Just skirt the law and get stuff done. Find the loopholes. That's probably why people didn't turn out. They think It doesn't make a difference. I believe soon enough, they'll find out it does, but that's what they think. Now - Why they voted for trump- It takes too long to explain economics. What Biden did was amazing considering the fight against Republicans and a right wing supreme court that blocked him at every turn. \\nHe brought back a new New Deal with long term investments and, if trump doesn't kill them, will show up in a few years. Even right wing WSJ and other finance news outlets praised the work he did with chip manufacturing.  And he was the first president in decades that finally used existing law to go after monopolies that are raising prices - not just to end consumers, but to small businesses. They are also strangling young entrepreneurs. I'm sure trump will kill that. Many of his bills went to states with stipulations that they fix processes that are slowing down permits for housing and businesses.  My own Republican senator regularly boasted about the money and jobs that were coming in - he didn't mention his party fought it tooth and nail. But, that's TOO MANY WORDS. Immigration - the problem is amnesty. For decades Cubans jumped off a boat on to a Florida beach and claimed amnesty! I mean they were here for a better life and $$$, but ok. They have to have a hearing. Same is happening on the southern border. Biden tried to fix that with a bipartisan law that would limit amnesty until the backlogs were caught up. It also gave money to hire more  border security and judges. Guess what -  Trump went berserk because he didn't want the border fixed - he needed the border to be broken to win! He was pissed. So this deal Republicans put together , they suddenly had to come up with bullshit reasons to kill it. It was ridiculous listening to them- , ummm, ummm - it still lets too many in. But wait, Trump said these were rapists and criminals - you are going to walk away from STOPPING  most of them from coming in ??!TOO MANY WORDS.Prices were going down. Not fast enough. COVID had been a bottleneck and there were studies people were starting to see them go down locally, but assumed they were high everywhere else. Using anti trust laws will do something about price fixing...So that's a LOT of words. Too many words. \\nDemocrats suck at messaging. Trump - I will fix high prices.  The immigrants are raping you and taking away your homes and boys are going to school and coming back as girls. I  will fix everything! Instantly!The people - we feel heard!Experts - tariffs are going to raise prices.

This is a 100% increase from the number of preborn children they killed in 2000. What this amounts to is 1,076 preborn children killed every day, nearly 45 every hour, and one every 80 seconds in 2022-23  by Planned Parenthood alone.","title":"Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy signal move to defund Planned Parenthood under Trump"},{"text":"Meanwhile, shes buddies with two of the most infamous sex predators in the country: Trump n Gaetz.

Its the least we can do to protect girls and women in an America that is less safe for them today than it was yesterday. Those of you who voted for Trump had a hand in making it less safe, for my daughter and for millions of others in this country. If you think otherwise, you are lying to yourself.*Reasonable people can disagree about economic policy. Or immigration. Or the level of U.S. involvement in Ukraine and Gaza. But if Donald Trump swayed you on any of these issues, you still had to cross some major red lines to vote for him. One red line was ignoring Trumps refusal to accord basic respect and dignity to women as equal human beings.The evidence is irrefutable and so voluminous its hard to know where to start. We can start with his rival, Kamala Harris. He said world leaders would treat Harris like a play toy. He reposted a claim that Harris owed her success to giving sexual favors. He seemed surprised Harris could be competent, exclaiming that she somehow  a woman  somehow shes doing better than Biden. He then said, were not going to have a socialist president, especially any female.These statements are tame compared to his greatest hits. He advised in an interview that with women: you have to treat em like sCt. He told The Celebrity Apprentice contestant Brande Roderick that it must be a pretty picture. You dropping to your knees. He told a lawyer who took a deposition break to pump breast milk, youre disgusting. He said his daughter has a very nice figure and that if Ivanka werent my daughter, perhaps Id be dating her. Of presidential primary opponent Carly Fiorina, he said Look at that face. Would anybody vote for that? When debate moderator Megyn Kelly challenged him about these statements, he claimed Kelly had blood coming from her eyes. Blood coming from her  wherever.His words express utter contempt for women as anything but physical objects. His actions confirm that belief. A jury found that Trump sexually assaulted a woman in a department store dressing room. Twenty-six other women have come forward recounting similar behavior, including Trump walking into dressing rooms unannounced and Trump forcibly kissing and groping women without consent. He ordered pageant contestants to line up in bikinis so he could divide the room between girls he personally found attractive and those he did not. He held a press conference solely to criticize Miss Universe Alicia Machado for supposedly gaining too much weight.?*But Trumps real danger extends beyond his abominable behavior. Its in the stamp of approval Americans gave to someone who clearly disrespects and abuses women. Giving an open misogynist and predator that much power signals unmistakably to millions of men and boys that women and girls are inferior, that they need not be taken seriously, and that harassment, abuse, and assault is no big deal. And his advice to those who follow his lead? Youve got to deny, deny, deny, and push back on these women. If you admit to anything and any culpability, then youre dead. Deny everything.*?*The power of the presidency lies as much in what that leader communicates about us as any bill signed into law. What this leader communicates about us is dark, sinister and violently sexist.*?*When Trump was elected in 2016, just weeks after a tape leaked where he openly bragged about grabbing \\\\[women\\\\] by the p-, my daughter was 4 years old. I worried about her future but knew we had time to right the ship. Now she is almost a teenager, and her first reaction to his election was one of disbelief: Is he really going to be president until Im 17? Unfortunately, yes.**I feel grateful to live in a state that protects womens reproductive rights. Its the least we can do to protect girls and women in an America that is less safe for them today than it was yesterday. Those of you who voted for Trump had a hand in making it less safe, for my daughter and for millions of others in this country.

In Medicaids current financing framework, the volume C rather than value C of care patients receive drives spending. We applaud Governor Lee in his historic efforts to strengthen and sustain the Medicaid program, CMS Administrator Verma noted.* \\"This is not a traditional block grant proposal; but rather, it takes many of the advantages associated with traditional proposals and leverages value based care concepts while placing appropriate guardrails to ensure protection for beneficiaries. It also requires rigorous federal oversight and state accountability, while providing new flexibilities to ensure these demonstrations remain attractive to states.\\"With an unprecedented opportunity and incentive to share in federal savings, Tennessee will be able to earn the opportunity to reinvest those savings in programs that strengthen Medicaid and improve the health of all of their residents.\\nCMS is approving this demonstration for a period of 10 years to reduce administrative burden and allow the state sufficient time to evaluate its innovative approach. This approval, which includes robust monitoring and evaluation, empowers the state to better manage costs and target resources when delivering high-quality patient care for more than 1.4 million Tennesseans, many of whom continue to reel from the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Two and a half years after the considerable fanfare, the Trump administration CMS announced the approval of a Medicaid aggregate cap waiver for Tennessee with The Governor was more forthcoming, trumpeting the states receipt of a block grant waiver.

Under Wilson there were isolationism, until the Zimmerman telegram blew it up. WWII the US wanted to sit it out until Pearl Harbor. It also comes off as American exceptionalism, American centric and a bit Eurocentric that I'm having a hard time taking your points seriously. Ex.A general perception that the rest of the world benefitted from this system yet simultaneously held anti-American sentiment. True, the US could be an arrogant bully on occasion, but the American people began to ask: if this system is so good...why aren't other countries doing more to maintain it themselves?This is a mixed and complicated topic. The Bretton Wood system largely benefitted the US primarily, and then what we would now call the Western bloc. The end of the Cold War solidified those gains more than anything. You're largely ignoring how a lot of these institutions do not benefit the Global South as a whole - that's why the Chinese are able to put in a wedge as a counter offer. Your analysis is also very hollow (I couldn't think of another word and I don't mean this as a pejorative) in the sense that you seem to look at the problem on a surface level. Your average American did not become stupid over night. There's been a gradual decline in cognition mostly (personal take) due to social media removing any safeguards. The people back then are the same people as today, but they're not getting the same quality information to make informed decisions. And this one is a bit of a nitpick but the analysis on ME oil is off - the US doesn't need Saudi oil as much as to stabilize the global oil prices or else we might have something like the 1970s recession. Personally, I don't believe he's convincing people against what you call the American identity and Grand Strategy (this isn't a game, no nations have a grand strategy hahaha) but he is channeling anger against the status quo. The US has a lot of problems but no one wants to have an honest and open conversation - things like over militarization (Prussia was not a country with an army but an army with a country), lack of funding for public education (which will stifle innovation and economic development that this will trigger a negative cycle per Ray Dalio), extreme income inequality, etc. Also, to solidify, those issues are core beliefs for some of the American constituents, it's not a Trump thing. I hate the man too, but blame does fall to the Republicans and the extreme far right.I don't know why but I feel you're on the right track and your hearts in the right place but this seems very flimsy overall","title":"Why Donald Trump's Victory is Bad for the US and the World"},{"text":"I've met the same response when trying to be civil.

Here I was taking you seriously.Buddy this is just literally true. Its unlikely they get that 1 vote majority for such an act, but theres nothing stopping them if they do. Theres no formal constitution. Even if there was, theres no judicial review because of legislative supremacy, so its irrelevant. The Lords can delay the legislation, yes, but have no power to stop it. No more local governments have sovereignty outside of that extended to it by parliament, so they could not resist a 1 vote majority.The Monarch has no authority left outside of that allowed by parliament. He could not stop it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_dictatorship In the United Kingdom, ultimate legislative sovereignty resides in Parliament (Parliamentary sovereignty). Parliament may pass any legislation on any subject it wishes. **Parliament operates without restraints such as, for instance, an obligation to legislate in accordance with fundamental constitutional rights.**... **The party which commands a majority in the House of Commons forms the government. The governing party should consequently be able to pass any bill they wish through the Commons, provided that voting discipline is enforced amongst their Members of Parliament (MPs).**You think I'm unserious because this sounds unbelievably absurd. I'm not - the system is just... actually that extreme (I don't actually think it's *wrong*. But it *is* extreme in the level of power it grants the legislative branch)--- Heaven forbid the government be allowed to govern. Come to Queensland Australia where we have a Unicameral Parliament. We pass laws without a Senate!\\n The Democrats couldn't pass shit even with a supermajority. Remember 2009? House majority and 60 Senate seats and fuck all agenda progressing.And as a consequence, the U.S. has only been the most prosperous nation on the face of Earth for our entire existence. (I have a cite for this, but on my phone, so Ill find it later if you really want to contest it.) (Ah, found it: https://www.nber.org/papers/w18396)Also, like, Dems *did* pass shit. They just weren't able to radically remake the entire country because they won one election.

De-standardised vote counts prevent rigging? Long-winded under-provisioned months-long counting systems are for \\"thoroughness\\"?under provisioned, no. But half of the delay comes from localities which choose to accept mail-in ballots *postmarked* by Election Day (AKA arriving after) and also hand-counting ballots (which increases security).  Paper ballots, party scrutineers, independent electoral commissions to process results, standardised processes, those would increase security.Those increase security all the way up until a nefarious actor takes control of that independent national commission and standardized process. Then the election is fully corrupted. In the U.S., it would arguably be easier to corrupt any single district's counting, but it would be near impossible to corrupt enough to influence any election that was even a few percentage points in one side's favor.  Really awful take. Like, clown-makeup level terrible.

Collecting data on Americas schools and disseminating research (most states dont have this capability and the DoE performs this and provided the data and info to states)3. Focusing national attention on key educational issues.4. Prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal access to education (and providing assistance to schools to have and maintain programs such as special education classes).5. Provide resources and funding above and beyond to schools and states for additional programs where state resources are limited. As for lock out red state students, this could be a possibility as the DoE provides student loans.

Of the 4, Harris and Newsom fared better than Biden but still under 270, but Whitmer and Buttigieg performed best, both getting over 270 and Buttigieg specifically getting over 300.The ability to speak to middle states directly is going to matter as much as some forceful economic populism is. A proper primary matters, and the global landscape of a year of global \\"incumbency disadvantage\\"s due to inflation is important to keep an eye on. I think you're underestimating both Buttigieg and the ability of the nation to vote for a woman.But also, you say many wished Walz was top of the ticket. There was a reason for that - he hasn't gone back and forth on policy as much and has delivered progressive success in his state, and once was elected to a swing district. That all matters. And his ability to get the \\"weird\\" wave going mattered. I don't think most candidates could've won - this was just a trash year to run as an incumbent. Harris was to stop the bleeding - and still came close in a number of swing states, in spite of what research says may be a 1-3% disadvantage for women candidates.Let the party go in the direction it wants to go. Any leader - whoever that leader is - just needs to know how to reach people where they are. And they're going to come out with an instant advantage by default after what Trump does to the economy in the next 4 years - assuming we get fair elections.

There are no limits under current law on how many embryos can be created in an IVF cycle, Rosendale and Brecheen said.This is because every single person responds to treatment differently. I had 40 follicles, 26 of which contained mature eggs. The average number of eggs retrieved is 8 to 14. From those 26 eggs, I ended up with 4 viable embryos. My one embryo transfer, so far, was not successful.You cannot limit how many embryos can be created because you don't know how effectively someone will respond to medication or what the attrition rate will be for the embryos you're trying to create. The doctor could decide to not retrieve all the matured eggs, but the quality isn't known until they're fertilized and attempt to make it to blastocysts. So putting a limit on how many embryos can be created per IVF cycle will make more attempts at IVF, which is more hormones in your body for a longer period of time (and is prohibitively expensive).There is a 5 day process for developing the embryos and a lot of them do not develop completely. So what is the party of pro-life's advice here? \\"Don't you dare try to fertilize all 26 of your eggs in the hopes that even one will lead to a baby. You're capped at X eggs being fertilized.\\" And then I could have ended up with 0 embryos depending on which eggs were chosen to retrieve?? Only for the other mature eggs in my body to not be retrieved and die with no chance at life.So can we stop pretending like they have any idea about the realities of IVF? And that this is about protecting the sanctity of life?","title":"2 House Republicans seek to stop IVF expansion in defense bill"},{"text":"You are incredibly wrong. See Argentina.

They are often presented as a tool to protect domestic industries or to right perceived injustices in international trade, yet their actual effects frequently diverge from their stated aims. A tariff is, at its core, a taxa burden not on foreign producers but on **domestic consumers.** \\nBy raising the price of imported goods, tariffs distort markets, forcing resources into less efficient uses and imposing hidden costs on society. Its a form of the government picking winnersand they tend to pick winners significantly less effectively than free enterprise does. While they may create the appearance of protecting jobs, they do so at the expense of higher prices, reduced choice, and diminished economic vitality. A few jobs will be visibly saved and far more jobs will be invisibly lost, and every Americans will become invisibly poorer. And when the inevitable retributive tariffs are created on the other side, American exporting becomes weaker.Worse, they invite retaliation, setting off a cascade of inefficiencies that harm the very people they purport to help.The case of Stanley Black &amp; Decker shows the misconceptions surrounding tariffs and global trade. You decry the companys reliance on overseas manufacturing, accusing it of forsaking its American roots for the sake of profit. Yet this criticism ignores the fundamental economic principle of comparative advantage. Producing goods in lower-cost regions allows companies to allocate resources more efficiently, benefiting consumers with lower prices and freeing American workers to focus on more productive pursuits. Forcing companies to reshore manufacturing through tariffs is not a solution but a misstepone that hurts more American consumers and workers than it saves, and jeopardizes the competitiveness of American businesses.","title":"U.S. companies are stocking up to cushion incoming Trump tariffs"},{"text":"Well, snakes dont really have parts, but if I had to pick one, Id say that is a knee.","title":"On Team Trump, Tommy Tuberville isnt Coach.

Which could mean a few things: states could decide to raise property taxes to make up the difference.\\n Or they could institute a new tax for schools.\\nWhat happens if the amount per taxpayer from federal taxes that used to go to schools isn't reduced  on the tax payer side?Some states receive more in federal tax dollars than they ever pay out. For example, California has the highest gpd in usa. And Vermont has the lowest. \\nCalifornia taxes help fund schools in Vermont.Federal dollars make up a significant portion of more than a few states' overall budgets for everything.  Like Montana's overall state budget is reliant on to the tune of 31.8% or 6.3 billion dollars of its overall budget from federal dollars. \\nSo it is more nuanced than federal bad, states good. The least reliant on federal funding to pay for stuff in their states are California, South Dakota,  Minnesota, Iowa and Vermont.  The most dependent are Michigan, New Mexico, Alaska, Louisiana, and Kentucky. Over 30% of their budgets for everything come from federal funding.\\nYou get rid of federal to state welfare/funding and many state budgets collaspe. \\nCalifornia Texas,  New York, and Florida have the highest GDP.  California's GDP is twice the amount of the next closest ones. California support checks fund a lot of stuff in other states.  Seriously, thank you, Californians.

There are a bunch of other issues that can be helped by this including immigration and reduced emissions, lower demand on oil which should lower prices. All of these issues can help the American consumer. It will take time to build the infrastructure and for the cost savings to eventually impact the market.

In raw numbers, Locked Out estimates that 399,684 adult Tennesseans cannot vote because of a felony conviction.In Florida, convicted felons earned back the right to vote through a ballot measure.

Ultimately, most funding for schools is from states (how this works varies a lot depending on the state). In addition, states currently have a lot of control over their own curriculum and generally have a ton of autonomy in how they run things.The impact of dismantling the federal DoE would likely result in a shifting of current DoE resources to other federal departments. A lot of federal funds are used for SPED, and for those states that don't have the funds to support it, these programs will be in jeopardy. It's really hard to tell how this will all shake out, but like most things in government, it'll be a slow process if they really intend to dismantle the federal DoE. Some people will lost their jobs in DC, for sure. But I don't see major damage rippling down to state DoEs for now. The federal DoE is a funding source primarily.My take is that red states in particular will suffer the biggest brunt of this dismantling, if it occurs, since they often don't fund education at levels that blue states do. But this is not really anything new. Red states have traditionally lagged behind blue states in almost every measure, including educational outcomes. I expect that gap to widen as red states continue to dismantle their education systems.","title":"South Dakota Republican introduces bill to eliminate Department of Education"},{"text":"people have been watching for years as states REPEATEDLY go against the constitutional separation of church and state within the school system. it's not overnight, it's been planned for years","title":"South Dakota Republican introduces bill to eliminate Department of Education"},{"text":"Newscum should be in prison for what he's done to that state.

Trump rejoiced in the moment. America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, he boasted. In the two weeks since, his campaign has repeatedly heralded his landslide, even to market Trump merchandise like the Official Trump Victory Glass.\\n \\n But by traditional numeric measures, Mr. Trumps victory was neither unprecedented nor a landslide. In fact, he prevailed with one of the smallest margins of victory in the popular vote since the 19th century and generated little of the coattails of a true landslide.\\n \\n The disconnect goes beyond predictable Trumpian braggadocio. The incoming president and his team are trying to cement the impression of a resounding margin, as one aide called it, to make Mr. Trump seem more popular than he is and strengthen his hand in forcing through his agenda in the months to come.\\n \\n . . .\\n \\n With some votes still being counted, the tally used by The New York Times showed Mr. Trump winning the popular vote with 49.997 percent as of Thursday night, and he appears likely to fall below that once the final results are in, meaning he would not capture a majority. Another count used by CNN and other outlets shows him winning 49.9 percent. By either reckoning, his margin over Vice President Kamala Harris was about 1.6 percentage points, the third smallest since 1888, and could ultimately end up around 1.5 points.\\n \\n If the definition of landslide is you win both the popular vote and Electoral College vote, thats a new definition, said Lynn Vavreck, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of Identity Crisis about Mr. Trumps first election, in 2016.

At the time of the WMD thing, I was a low-mid level analyst, just sort of getting into managing other analysts but still doing analysis myself.  From my vantage point at the time, there was a LOT of evidence.  But there was just one problem, which didn't become apparent until later on (to me, at least): Circular reporting.  This is when a single source, or maybe a couple of sources, get picked up and reported on by multiple agencies or analysts; since plagiarism is a bad thing in the field, at at the time academic citations weren't as widespread, it ends up looking like there are multiple sources confirming a thing.  So to a lot of people, it seemed like there was a robust WMD program in Iraq.  This is not a defense of the intel community, merely a description of what often happened with somewhat sensationalist issues.  And also, I was not privy to the machinations of those at the top of the food chain, and there's a lot of very complex, controversial things happening that are beyond the scope of a Reddit post.  Suffice it to say, that it was a very bad outcome, and my field was bent to the whims of people with an agenda.
