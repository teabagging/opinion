Most economists seem to agree that the Great Recession lasted longer than it needed to due to policy decisions and a more conservative approach to spending. They decided to do more stimulus this time rather than risk a long and drawn out recession. And by all metrics they were wildly successful in doing so. Virtually every major economics forecaster was predicting a recession at some point in the past 3 years or that we would have need large scale unemployment to get inflation under control. Biden and the Fed were successful at preventing the recession and getting inflation under control extremely rapidly. I find the inflation that we got to be far preferable to a drawn out recession or economic stagnation that we are seeing in many other countries. Now the political reality is that this election showed people **really** don't like inflation because it feels bad to them even if the economy is far preferable to one in an recession. So I am guessing in the future politicians will choose to go to 8-10% unemployment rather than 5-6%+ inflation.","title":"How Democrats Blew it On Inflation"},{"text":"Gunther is a well-known Russian backed account.

PIAAC has level-based definitions of *functional* literacy; the 21% stat appears to refer to people who can still read paragraphs of text, locate information from relatively short texts, recognise basic vocabulary, determine the meaning of sentences etc. They aren't \\"completely illiterate\\" by the definition that most people would understand (i.e. incapable of reading). PIAAC also assessed people in English, which for some respondents was their second language. In terms of those with the absolute lowest level, the rate is closer to 4% if you exclude those who had a language barrier or disability that left them unable to respond to the test. In terms of comparing the illiteracy rate to 1960: according to the US Census Bureau, approximately 32 states had illiteracy rates below the national average of 2.4%. The lowest was Iowa at 0.7% and the highest Louisiana at 6.3%. Similar to today, there is a lot of variation on a state basis. However, I'm not sure how to compare the 1960 statistic with the modern day because the definition of illiteracy wouldn't be the same.","title":"Opinion: Donald Trump's 2024 election the death knell for experiment.

But that tide had turned long ago.Now the Russian Black Sea fleet is waiting for an opportunity to ensnare them. The thin supply lines trickling out from Constantinople were no longer safe. The fall of the Dardanelles meant only one thing for the German-Ottoman fleet: isolation.Most of their supply harbors on the northern Turkish coast had been shattered by Russian bombardment or were now occupied. They couldnt sail souththe Entente fleets would soon be in full possession of the Sea of Marmara. Heading east? Russian coastal batteries.Fuel, ammunition, food, moraleall were running low.Admiral Wilhelm Souchon runs over the calculations again and again.The Goeben, the Breslau are now cornered.If the Entente pressed forward, Constantinople would fall in a matter of days, and the Bosporus would choke with British and French vessels before anyone in the Ottoman court could beg for assistance.Surrender? Scuttle? But Souchon has Prussian resolve.One last blaze, one final sortie out into the glory of combat.The Midilli, fresh off intermittent battles with Russian patrol boats, had sustained damage to its forward guns. The crew was exhausted, and despite their courage, they knew they were facing execution rather than a fight.The decision had to be made before the situation grew direbefore morale collapsed completely and sailors began abandoning the ships outright. Some had already murmured about seizing transports and crossing into Romania, should such an act buy them a few more days of wretched survival.But there would be no room for cowards or mutineers. They could die with honor or not at all. The Midilli might fall to British fire off Prinkipo, or perhaps during a headlong flight into the British flotilla, but by God, she would die floating.Orders passed down through the ranks. The crew of Goeben and Midilli made their final preparations. The plan was simple: run straight into the teeth of the British navy, draw whatever ships they could into battle. Whether it ends in a glorious reckoning or in the fires of their own making, the German-Ottoman fleet would go out on their terms.20 March 1915 - The Goeben and Midilli steams out of their Black Sea refuge before dawn broke, towards the Marmara, where the Entente battle group awaited.As many of Istanbuls ruling elite fled the city, knowing the Allied fleet would arrive within a day, the Goeben met the advancing French and British fleets somewhere near Prince's Islands, guns roaring as shells spat like thunder against the red noon sky. She was already blistered and battle-scarred from Russian engagements weeks prior, but now, unburdened by hesitation, she gave everything.For seven hours the Goeben fought, her guns outsized and outmatched, keeping the Midilli close as both ships tried to tempt the enemy fleet into point-blank range. British battleshipsled by HMS Queen Elizabeth and Agamemnon unloaded their 15-inch guns crippling the Goebens superstructure by the evening. French destroyers, looping in devastating arcs, sent the Midilli reeling with piercing volleys.A final explosion, and the once-feared Goeben disappears beneath the  the Sea of Marmara. The Midilli followed within an hour. By the morning of 21 March 1915, the wrecks of Goeben and Midilli lay at the bottom of the Marmara Sea.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Trumpist cult?

Yeah, if Trump ran in the 90s or even 2000s, his scandals are front page news that sit on store shelves for weeks. They are the point of discussion for an extended period of time. Now it basically gets the 15 min of fame treatment before it's blasted through all the algorithms and dumped for the next hot content to catch your attention. Nothing has any staying power anymore. Trump also just plays to this very well. He keeps the cycle moving by making the next crass statement, making some controversial endorsement, or whatever else. I don't know if it's really intentional or just how he is, but it works. Meanwhile Dems generally will go into damage control mode, addressing whatever, and letting the focus stay there for a while. Obviously the latter is the responsible thing to do that we should want in a world leader, but people like Trump know that at the base of it elections and campaigning are basically a game and at the end it just matters who had the most points. The Dems need to find a good balance between the \\"responsible, mature party\\" and learning to play to some degree on the same level as their opponent.People are jumping all over the news media, and yeah, they suck and have for a long time, and are largely responsible for him gaining momentum in 2016, but that was 8 years ago and there's been a massive shift in how people get their news. They will get some amount of a bump from his chaotic administration and all that but they are also likely in for a rude awakening that it's not just Biden being boring that lost them ratings and those ratings aren't coming back. \\nAlso, this is a lesser impact, but the internet has also just jaded people to some level.

The development, spanning 94,000 sq ft, will bring 50 high-skilled jobs to the area, strengthening the UKs homegrown artillery capabilities. The Sheffield site will specialise in the production of the M777 lightweight towed howitzer. This move aligns with the UK governments ambition to boost and maintain essential defence capabilities within the country. John Borton, Managing Director of BAE Systems Weapons Systems UK division, emphasised the significance of the investment: Our aim is to deliver long-term artillery capabilities for the UK, which will safeguard, sustain, and grow a critical, specialised British industrial capability as well as provide important opportunities for exports. Borton added that the investment would help build a highly-skilled and flexible workforce, supporting the UKs defence infrastructure. Preparations for the site are underway, with plans to be fully operational by 2025. Local MP Clive Betts welcomed the project, highlighting Sheffields engineering heritage: Sheffield is well known for its strong history of world-class engineering and advanced manufacturing, and BAE Systems investment in a new artillery facility and highly skilled jobs will ensure the city continues to play a key role in delivering both economic prosperity and national security. The Sheffield site marks BAE Systems latest commitment to expanding its UK operations, say the company. This comes alongside a 300 million investment in shipbuilding facilities in Glasgow, over 200 million to upgrade the UK munitions business, and a 220 million project for a new factory in Rochester, Kent.[Home Sea Now seven Royal Navy frigates being built in Scotland](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/now-seven-royal-navy-frigates-being-built-in-scotland/) The recent steel-cutting ceremony for HMS Formidable, the third Type 31 frigate, is especially significant as the programme to build 13 frigates on Scotland is now over halfway. With this latest development, there are currently seven Royal Navy ships under construction in Scotland. This includes three Type 31 frigates: HMS Venturer, HMS Active, and HMS Formidable, as well as four Type 26 frigates: HMS Glasgow, HMS Cardiff, HMS Belfast, and HMS Birmingham. The Type 31 frigate, also known as the Inspiration-class, is a class of general-purpose warships being built for the Royal Navy. Developed under the Royal Navys National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Type 31 aims to provide a versatile and cost-effective platform, complementing the more advanced Type 26 frigates. Each vessel in the class is designed to displace around 5,700 tonnes, with a length of approximately 138 metres. The design focuses on modularity, allowing for adaptability in various roles, including maritime security, disaster relief, and low-intensity operations, alongside its core warfighting capabilities. With a focus on export potential, the Type 31 is intended to be an attractive option for allied navies seeking a capable yet affordable frigate. In terms of capabilities, the Type 31 frigate is equipped with a range of sensors and weapon systems suitable for multi-role operations. It features a 57 mm Mk 110 naval gun as its primary armament, complemented by 40 mm cannons for close-range defence. The frigate is also fitted with the Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missile system, providing area defence against airborne threats. Additionally, it is capable of deploying a range of smaller boats and unmanned vehicles from a spacious mission bay, enabling flexibility in tasks like boarding operations or mine countermeasures. The Type 31s flight deck can accommodate a medium-sized helicopter, such as the Wildcat or Merlin, further enhancing its reach and capabilities for anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and reconnaissance missions. The Type 26 frigate, also known as the City-class, is a class of advanced anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessels being built for the Royal Navy. Designed as part of the Royal Navys modernisation efforts, the Type 26 is intended to replace the ageing Type 23 frigates, particularly in the ASW role. Each ship in this class has a displacement of around 8,000 tonnes and measures approximately 149.9 metres in length. The Type 26 is characterised by its focus on stealth, featuring a hull design and noise-dampening measures to minimise acoustic signatures, making it highly effective in detecting and countering submarines. The first four vessels, HMS Glasgow, HMS Cardiff, HMS Belfast, and HMS Birmingham, are currently under construction, with with the work on the rest of the order at various stages of procurement. In terms of capabilities, the Type 26 frigate is equipped with an array of advanced sensors and weapons. It is armed with a 5-inch Mk 45 naval gun, providing long-range fire support, and is equipped with the Sea Ceptor missile system for area air defence. For ASW, the frigate carries powerful sonar systems, including a towed array, and can deploy anti-submarine torpedoes. The Type 26s mission bay is designed to support a range of operations, from humanitarian aid to counter-piracy, allowing for the deployment of unmanned systems and small boats. Additionally, the flight deck is capable of supporting a range of helicopters, including the Merlin, which enhances its ASW and reconnaissance capabilities. With its combination of advanced systems and modular design, the Type 26 is intended to be a versatile platform that can adapt to a variety of operational demands.!ping UK&amp;MATERIEL","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Not for long.

The forts had fallen. The minesthe one thing thought to balance the offensive power of the Allied navieshad never even been laid.Colonel Liman von Sanders of German High Command is aware that the Goeben and Midilli, were still trapped in the Black Sea, impotent while the Russian fleet blockaded Constantinoples eastern flank. And now?The Empire was about to lose Constantinople.Enver Pasha paces feverishly. We must move the government, Enver Pasha declares, almost breathless, his eyes wild, darting towards Sultan Mehmed V and the senior ministers. We?cannot allow the Sultans capture. The administration must cross the?Bosporus to Anatolia, before the Allied fleets land troops at the docks or worse, set fire to?Galata?and?Kadikoy?from the sea!To evacuate Constantinople? To abandon the very heart of the Caliphate? It was tantamount to accepting the death of the Empire.Constantinople is as much a throne room as it is a people. How can I move my people my Sultanate?My dear Sultan, von Sanders finally says, his voice shaking with a grim resolve, Evacuating to Anatolia means we live to fight another day. But staying here? If the British land troops and their damned forces breach the city, well be too late to stop the collapse of the European side entirely. Your army will be cut off from the Eastcut off from reinforcements, from suppliesEnver Pasha snaps around, his eyes blazing, What will the Germans do for us? Will they reinforce us? Will you send the Goeben?Von Sanders shakes his head. The Goeben will not escape the Black Sea. Neither will the Midilli Russia has seen to that.Bulgaria, Greece, they do not yet move, but the possibility that they will take a pound of flesh once Constantinople falls is an ever-present fear. If the Allied fleets break through, the Bosphorus Straits become open waters; the Greeks may swoop in from their positions across the region, and from Thrace, the Bulgarians could seize their long-coveted territories back to exact revenge for decades of loss.18 March 1915 - Throughout Gallipoli and the European sector of the Dardanelles, Turkish soldiers sit bewildered. Those garrisoned in the ruined forts at Rumeli Hisari and Kilid Bahr, still smoldering, look out blankly toward what ought to have been the fortified bulwark of the Empire. Instead, the focused naval bombardment has laid much of it to waste.Mustafa Kemal, a newly-promoted lieutenant colonel and commander of a division already stationed near Gallipoli, watches, not with detached awe but with the resignation of a soldier who understands how battles play out. The Allied flotilla is now pushing further north toward Constantinople.To many under his command, the naval approach represents the inevitable collapse of their position. Reports have streamed in from harried officers that Greek and Bulgarian movements along the western borders seem to be preparing for opportunism. If the Allies take Constantinople, nothing stands between the Ottoman European forces and the Balkan wolves. The European territories are as good as lost. But thats not news to Kemal. What is at stake now is far more dangerousthey cannot stay and fight in these forts.To stand here, on this side, waiting for the British to close around us from the sea, is madness, Kemal growls.He gestures to the waters beyond.If we dont fall back across to Anatolia, there is nothing left for us. We stay in Europe, and the Balkans will swallow us whole. Look beyond: the Greeks and Bulgarians will not miss their chance to strike us at our weakest. Hopeful allies, they call themselves but would you see them rip apart our wounded backs like jackals?One older commander scowls beneath his mustache. What do we fall back to, Mustafa?! His voice cracks. The city is gone. And once the city falls, Anatolia will fall too! Let us at least die facing the enemy!Kemal stares him down. Youll die for nothing. Youll die in the shadow of empty forts. When the enemy crosses into Anatolia, we must have something left to fight with.Orders finally spread across Gallipoli, ?anakkale, and the Bosphorus: Retreat to Anatolia under the cover of night. The armys priority now rests on consolidating what they have in Anatolia, avoiding being cutoff, and regrouping for an inevitable defense from eastern approaches toward Bursa, leaving Istanbul and ?anakkale to their fate.From Constantinople, the Ottoman Court reluctantly prepares for evacuation.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Oh, hold on.

I never said they did. Likud doesnt want peace. But OP also says that the Israeli leftists who do want to negotiate with Palestinians but dont want to 100% accept their demands support Netanyahus war crimes.Yet despite even the hardline Palestinians agreeing, this is not enoughThat is my point. These hardliners dont agree. Saying you want something doesnt mean youre honest. Read what I said. Arafat literally said he wanted to use the 2SS as a base to conquer the rest of Palestine. But because his official stance was 2SS I am supposed to believe him 100%??Do you really believe Hamas wants a tolerant 2SS? Keep in mind that there need to be provisions for religious sites. Hamas cannot keep to only their borders, discriminate against Jews in the borders but keep peace with the state of Israel. Jews will need to be tolerated in the Palestinian state too.That doesnt mean you can occupy them foreverI never said so. I am pro demolishing of settlements and pro negotiation.2. You get the timeline wrong. Gaza was blockaded after Hamas won elections.?3. It is not about forcing. The UN org for non-pali refugees explicitly says they work towards integration of refugees. Not forcing. Working toward. The UN org for pali refugees explicitly doesnt want them to integrate.Secondly, its not only about fully integrating. Look up the discrimination policies.

Hezbollah can spend billions to launch rockets against Israel out of solidarity with Palestine but they cant afford to integrate actual Palestinians? Fuck off.

What if the ANZAC forces and the Dardanelles, didn't take Gallipoli... but landed on Constantinople itself?The Death of a Sick Man, the glory of the Antipodes**August 1914 -** The German warships SMS Goeben and Breslau slip through the Dardanelles, signaling the strengthening of German influence in Ottoman military affairs. Alongside German strategic advisors and officers arriving in Constantinople, Turkey gears up for mobilization, increasingly aligning itself with Germany. Vice Consul Charles Palmer, stationed in the Dardanelles, continues to track enemy movements while attending to his diplomatic duties. Palmer notes the arrival of crucial German personnel, heavy artillery, and logistical support pouring into the region. Among those entries is the Nusret, an Ottoman minelayer recently constructed in Germany that has been sent to fortify the maritime defenses of the Dardanelles Straits.**28 October 1914** \\\\- the Goeben (now renamed Yavuz Sultan Selim) and Breslau (renamed Midilli), accompanied by Turkish warships, launch a surprise raid against Russian naval positions in the Black Sea, formally signaling the Ottoman Empires entry into the war. The Dardanelles becomes a vital priority for the Ottomans and their German allies. Ottoman defenses are ramped up hurriedly, reenforcing artillery batteries, fortifications, and minelaying along the straits to stave off any potential Anglo-Franco incursions from the Mediterranean. Charles Palmer charts each fort and noting fortifications.However, during this hectic period of militarization, the Nusret minelayer encounters serious mechanical troubles. A crucial part for its enginea German-made pistonis damaged due to overuse during preliminary exercises. The necessary valve replacement requires shipping from the Ruhrgebiet, further delayed by wartime logistics with several countries in-between.Thus, the Nusret remains laid up in port at ?anakkale, awaiting parts from Germany. This blow to Ottoman defensive infrastructure is softened by assurances from the German High Command that the fleet can hold its own with artillery alone.**November - December 1914** \\\\- As warships gather in the Mediterranean, Charles Palmers reports continue to provide invaluable information regarding Ottoman-German military activity in the Dardanelles region, particularly coastal guns. Without the ability to deploy the Nusret, the Turkish naval defense efforts depend solely on shore-based batteries and patrolling vessels.**January 1915 -** The Anglo-French fleets are formally being equipped for their campaign against the Dardanelles. Rear-Admiral Guepratte of the French fleet and Vice-Admiral Carden oversees the British Eastern Mediterranean Squadron.**February 1915** \\\\- The Ottoman defenses within the straits remain focused on their shore artillery networks and trench construction. The Nusret is still in dock undergoing repairs and replacements. The?indicators of Turkish unreadiness?lead to?probing attacks?by the British Royal Navy.?On 19 February, 1915,?British ships shell the outer forts of the Dardanelles. The bombardment successfully reduces several stone fortresses. Without the?hidden lines of mines, the naval commanders, emboldened by this success, plan to intensify their assaults as preparations for a full-scale push near completion.Still, these attacks fail to disable more inland or well-protected positions, particularly the towering escarpments that house Krupp cannons, which remain elusive targets for British and French warships operating at range.**March 1915** \\\\- Ottoman defensive preparations have come under scrutiny from German advisors, who note the desperate need for the Nusret to deploy her mines before the Dardanelles become the focal point of a major Allied offensive. Engine parts for the Nusret finally arrive two months late, but there is insufficient time to take the vessel out for necessary test runs before the Franco-British fleets increase their attacks.The repaired Nusret rejoins the Dardanelles defenses, but it is essentially too late to lay minefields.**12 March, 1915** \\\\- Battleships of the British fleet penetrates the Dardanelles to test the strait's inner layer defence. *HMS Ark Royals* seaplanes, working in tandem with *Indomitable* and *Inflexible*, scout the waters, and direct naval gunners to suppress Turkish artillery.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Well they've been fishing for Twitter 'gotchas' and clout and look where that got them","title":"Psaki: Democrats are learning the wrong message on Trans Youth"},{"text":"seriouslyI've spent years asking people (fanboys and haters) to just stfu about him, and now it's like, well, I guess we actually *should* care about himbarf","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"1. People have a nice life, so they better pay for it by doing some slave labor. I see you aren't big on the whole freedom thing.2. That's why I said 'want and are able to.' The difference is that there's one government with the privilege to use violence, and there are millions of companies/employers without that privilege. An employer can't force you to do anything, and you can always go to another one. A government doesn't have that problem, so if you allow it to force you to work,  and it can abuse you in any way it please. 'Oh, you don't want to work 12 hours a day, six days a week, for 1$ per hour. Don't worry, we will just put you in jail and force you to work for nothing instead.' - there's a very good reason why forced labor is banned in the constitution.3. Not really, most companies just seek to make a bit of a profit and to sustain themselves. You are looking at top 0.01 % and imagining the the remaining 99.9% is the same, but it isn't at all. If you take away the profit motive, there's no reason to do it, there's no growth (including wage growth), there's no reason to pursue productivity, and nothing gets done. Economies of scale work the other way around at resource-intensive acitivities, because you can't scale resource gathering as there's a limited amount, so the larger the scale of labor, the more expensive the materials. Same for land.4. That doesn't need slave labor, it's just all about money - there's absolutely nothing stopping the government from taking 0.3 % of its budget, putting into government funded housing, and building houses at scale.

Or that the reason police are more often in black communities, or are maybe more on edge in black communities is that there are higher rates of crime in Black communities. I think that implies that there is some level of duty on black people in general, or black men in particular to behave better if they want to deal with police, or police violence less. Essentially, If you want less of a police presence in your communities, you should sell drugs less, get into fights, less, stop robbing each other, etc.More on point though, I think much of the same group that would say \\"stop locker room talk\\", also tell women to support women. Basically, Instead of bickering and tearing down other women, women should treat each other with respect and dignity. Essentially, If they expect to get ahead in life they can't just expect men to treat them. With respect, if they can't treat each other with respect. So I do think much of the same group is putting some of the burden on women as well.","title":"CMV: When Progressives or Feminists implore men to stop \\"locker room talk.\\" They are utilizing the patriarchy through the inherent threat of violence men have among each other during a confrontation."},{"text":"Trump is a Russian asset.

It very much depends on who would that be, which party he would be from, etc. It's also important to recognize that there is a big difference between people wanting peace and people wanting peace that agnowledge the other side. Plenty of Israelis would prioritize the return of the hostagesthey're protesting in the streets over that right now. This, for example, has nothing to do with how war is conducted in relation to Palestinians. The hostages first camp is divided between \\"get hostages through negotiations\\" and \\"get hostages through military pressure\\", and neither side really cares about how the war is perceived or whether there are crimes, they just want their people back. Plenty of Israelis have friends in Gaza, and though they may want to see Hamas defeated, they don't want to see their friends hurt.This \\"plenty\\" is very exaggerated, there are barely any. Gaza was not an easy place to visit before Oct 7th, and there weren't many reasons to do so. Some Arab Israelis may have family or friends in Gaza, but their sentiment is generally anti-war and pro-Palestinian anyway. Plenty of Israelis are uncomfortable with war crimes, or at least uncomfortable with the international community condemning them for war crimes.That much is true, but the number of Israelis who believe their country commits war crimes is miniscule. No nation is a monolith, and while there are plenty of Israelis who want blood, there are also plenty who want peace.Circling back to what I said at the start, those two positions are not necessarily contradictory. A nation can be tired of war for many reasons, and most often they want it to end \\"as fast as possible\\" not \\"the best way possible\\". A good example is Russia/Ukraine. It's no secret that Russian population has seen a growth in desire for peace. But this isn't the \\"we should just leave and let Ukraine alone\\" kind of peace. It's the \\"we should negotiate for peace and force Ukraine to abandon what we have taken\\" kind of peace. Similarly, Israelis don't want the \\"two state solution\\" peace. Most want to never think of or be threatened by Palestinians ever again, whatever form that takes.","title":"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the \\"wrong reasons\\", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge"},{"text":"I think the thing we under appreciated is that NATO was/is important, even if there were McDonalds in Moscow.

Dont act as if you know what I will say when I havent said it.I am not saying the Palestinians cant be trusted because they accepted the 2SS. The acceptance is besides the point.\\nI am saying Hamas cant be trusted. Do you honestly believe Hamas actually wants a peaceful coexistence? The president of the PLO said that Hitler wasnt an antisemite and Jews were partially responsible for the Holocaust. Arafat said once that a 2SS is a temporary solution from which to later go on and get the rest of Palestine back.But I am an asshole because I dont trust them, solely because they pay lip service to a 2SS, which costs them absolutely nothing?I am not saying Israel is the vulnerable one. I am saying that if Israel accepts a 2SS, it will make itself vulnerable.?You are essentially telling the Palestinians, no matter what you do, you lose.I am not. I want to negotiate with the Palestinians, demolish settlements etc. I want to work towards peace. What I am against is acting as if Israel can just have peace if they want to by snapping their fingers and giving Palestine what it wants, and that the idea that Israeli waryness means they all only want ethnic cleansing. (Dont get me wrong many Israelis do want to kick out all Palestinians I hate them)There are good reasons to be wary of just going with the proposed 2SS with no caveats whatsoever, that are not I love Netanyahu and his war crimes.2. I refer back to Arafat and Abbas. But: in the past much more israelis were willing to accept the international version of 2SS. This move towards non-acceptance has been going on for a while. One major event was that Hamas won elections after Israel gave Gaza to Palestine, which showed that giving land would not mean that only the peaceful Palestinians would rule it.3. No, have I said that? What is the point there? It is terrible that they are refugees, I feel for them. But one of the reasons why many are still stateless is because host states and the UN have only been focusing on right of return, instead of integrating them and giving them rights in the country where they fled.?\\nI agree that I want these refugees to be able to return to their homes inside Israel. But I also want German heimatsvertriebenen to return to their homes, and I want the Greek and Turkish refugees to return to their homes. But those things are all impossible in practice. Hinging peace on this issue is not realistic. Accepting a huge hostile population will 100% lead to instability.4. I should have worded it better.

It has more resolutions against it than every other place combined.\\nYou think that if we add all the crimes of all people in the world, Israel is responsible for 2/3 of all human rights violations?","title":"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the \\"wrong reasons\\", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge"},{"text":"TBH, he stayed in the rainforest for just one day.

Russia's economy is still functioning because they had lots of funds stored away before the war, but its been slowly going down.

While this is happening, internal pressure will keep mounting, and the Russian people will start asking themselves if it's really worth it what Putin is putting the country through for what? A bit of Ukraine? Meanwhile, the biggest reason for starting the war: to stop NATOs expansion eastwards has backfired as Finland has since joined NATO and has a larger border with Russia than Ukraine. All NATO countries have upped their defense spending too.Maybe he can keep going forever, idk, but I think even the Russian people have their limits eventually. And even if you want to create a peace deal, you have to make Ukraines negotiating position as strong as possible, not weaker. A Ukraine win doesn't mean total Russian defeat, I don't think. That won't happen. Or getting back every km2 lost. I think it means showing Russia (and the world) this isn't worth it anymore, not now not in the future. For Ukr to join EU/NATO potentially.

Even Hamas accepts this 2SS, even though it is clear they will never be peaceful or tolerant.\\nFor Israel, they are the party who have to make themselves vulnerable.

In the entire history of the UN human rights council, 2/3 of its resolutions have been about condemning Israel. Of course, Isra?l deserves to be condemned for human rights violations.

The 2SS has been a joke for over two decades now due to lack of engagement and willingness from Israel. Public opinion is not set in stone but has been lowering over time because of this. Criticising Netanyahu for this is valid.3) While you start off by talking about view of Americans and People in the West, you then part way through switch to talking about those in the Global ceasefire now camp who wish to push that ceasefire into an overall peace. I think that this represents a minority of Americans, with many Americans giving Netanyahu their support and others being perfectly happy for Israel to carry on its occupation as long as it isn't being so blatantly war criminal about it.I'd also say that obviously everything you say is a vast generalisation and there are peace movements in Israel and that the \\"wrong reasons\\" aren't wrong, just different from the reasons of people critical of Netanyahu within Israel, but I'm assuming that's understood as part of the premise.","title":"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the \\"wrong reasons\\", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge"},{"text":"!delta A fair legal point, and I can't find a way to change this without legalizing slavery for some portion of the population, or allowing politicians to rampantly abuse the system.","title":"CMV: A National Service Draft is one of the best solutions to social inequity and poverty in the United States."},{"text":"Which Palestinian position are you talking about??

Because if they wanted to fix the infrastructure, easily at that - there are plenty of companies working in the field, and would be happy to do these projects for the appropriate price. But the cities, counties, and states do not want to put money into it, because they don't think it's all that bad that it would need money to be spent on it.

It's not that there aren't enough companies/people to build houses, there are, it's just that the rest of the stuff is expensive as hell.Are the farms not getitng harvested now?

A nuclear arsenal has to be fully replaced every 30 years and is incredibly expensive.Its an expense Israel can easily afford. Not making a deal basically means youre continuously gambling with your long term future.  Yes maybe its worked out for the last 80 years, but if you do this strategy long enough, there will come a day when your enemies finally got their armies inline while you are in disarray.You could say that about any conflict or nation.

And take actions that Israel traditionally wouldn't do because they'd be seen as provocative (Abraham Accords, talk of annexation, etc).  And even let funding flow to Hamas while undercutting the PA.  Thus all the talk of \\"managing\\" the conflict, \\"mowing the grass\\", etc, that he said before Oct 7th.

But whether it's a result of MBS(not a fan, he's a murderous bastard) just wanting to liberalise, or societal pressure from being a close US ally, Saudi in the last 10 years HAS seen an overall societal liberalisation, that anyone would agree has been supported by the government. Progress in other countries has never been this rapid even when there are strong supporters in leadership(India, for example, has had no fault divorce since 1955 and remains one of the country with the least divorce rates, and no, most Indian marriages are not happy ones) and in some cases where external forces have been involved in attempting, it's been reversed by reactionaries(Iran). I don't think this has much to do with Saudi specifically- they lucked with a leader who's open to it at the right time.

The point isn't to suddenly make someone with a 6th-grade reading level an articulate debater, but instead to give them the experience and path towards gainful employment. At the end of high school, there is little to no guidance on how to get a job or where so people end up at the lowest common denominator of jobs: retail. As for the drug argument, studies have shown that many of those who use drugs do so because they lack the social support necessary to self-regulate without them. In a sense, they are self-medicating.

Nearly the entirety of the Torah is the return of Jews to Israel.Zionism is literally encouraged and seen as a good deed in the Torah and in most of Jewish scripture.Slightly over half of all Jews around the world live in Israel.I'm not sure how to describe the relationship, but removing Judaism from Zionism requires advanced knowledge of both Judaism and Zionism as a whole. It would be like saying Mecca has no value to Islam. Now that leaves the question: what arguments do they end up making?The arguments I widely see that are pushed along with \\"not all jews are zionists!\\" are so nonsensical it's unbelievable from a Jewish standpoint. \\"Jews should return to Europe\\", \\"In Europe Jews were anti-zionist and didn't speak hebrew\\" and the classic, \\"there are literally thousands of anti-zionist jews out there!\\" end up falling completely flat in Jewish ears largely because they're not even historically or religiously accurate. Same with the argument that Jews and Muslims lived in peace in Israel only shows how flawed their perception of Jews is; I'm not American, so I'm sorry if this example is oddly seen, it's just my experience, but I could compare it to racists in the south glorifying slavery, or saying slavery was good for black people, or token black people in inherently racist organizations.

I would argue that women are second class citizens in the West too. In the West, women are sexualized severely and sexual harassment, abuse, assault, and rape are severely common in our society. Not just hypothetical street rapists, but rape as a tool of systemic oppression from men to women. We are not the golden standard of treating women well. In a sociological sense, our view of gender progression is Western in the first place. Is the over-sexualization of women \\"freedom\\"? What events led up to Saudi Arabia's oppression of women in this manner, and what led to ours? Based on our lived experience, over-sexualization is normalized, and thus we deem such a consequence of \\"agency\\" instead of a tool of oppression. Often our own morality is subjective to our lived experiences. You don't understand Saudi Arabia because it isn't your culture. Yes, they suck to women. Yet women are \\"\\"\\"happy\\"\\"\\" not because they aren't oppressed, but because their lived experiences are powerfully personal. They do not exist outside of their lived experience, as you do not. It is easy to point and say \\"look how bad they treat women!\\" but it is important to look at such sociologically in our examinations, and understand that it isn't as simple as just raiding their societies and forcing them to \\"free\\" women.

Most global conflicts are unpopular in the US today and are largely driven by economic or geopolitical interests (Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam), so you're essentially signing up poor folks of color to die to serve billionaire interests abroad. With attacks on education, healthcare, benefits, and worker's rights almost certainly coming down the pipe in 2025, your proposition is that it would be better for poor minorities to die in service of their country (read: billionaires) than to die overworked in capitalist factories at home. I don't necessarily think that's a good proposition. Furthermore if you listen to Elon's statements on \\"government efficiencies\\", he says he can slash the government budget by $2 trillion.

The difference in votes between the winner and runner-up as a percentage of the total electorate has only been greater than 5% on five occasions going back to 1960.What I am saying is a wide swath of the population is leaning more and more towards authoritarianism because of propaganda and a total breakdown of media and journalistic standards in the US. If that problem was fixed elections would still be close but fights would be between more reasonable candidates. Sensationalism, propaganda, and misinformation is taking attention away from real complex issues and radicalizing people such that they are become comfortable justifying ever more extreme candidates.It just so happens that people who are more susceptible to misinformation also tend to lean conservative so we see one side pushing further out than the other and eventually it can no longer be balanced.Trump won it by a small margin because of big donors and influencers like Musk feeding the beastThat's not a Musk problem that's a Citizens United problem.

Israelis hate Netanyahu because he is a corrupted megalomaniac with a god complex, not because of war crimes or because of his tough stances on Palestinians. Youre right. But I hate him for both reasons. And I know many American and Israeli Jews that hate him for one reason that are a feathers push away to hating him for both reasons.  In fact most Israelis dislike the Palestinians (especially after Oct7) and share the tough stances on them. Yeah, but Hamas did kill over a thousand civilians out of the blue. I supported Israels response for several months until it became clear they were using it as an excuse for the worst genocide of our lifetimes. Even when Netanyahu goes, Israelis still wont support a 2SS (Most of the opposition opposes it), I believe in a one state solution where Israelis, Palestinians, and anyone else who wants to move there lives in peace. Thats what Herzl wrote about. Its the basis of liberalism. Its what every human deserves. Monarchism, Colonialism, Imperialism, Fascism, Communism, etc. are dead. Liberalism won. We need to stop fighting yesterdays wars.  the War will continue and in fact, all of the criticism about Netanyahu for his management of the War and the genocide remarks would have been the same even if Lapid or Yair Golan were in charge, because when it comes to the War and Oct7, most of Israelis are pretty united.) I constantly talk up Lapid, and I constantly attack Netanyahu. Merkel was awesome. Hitler sucked. (To be clear to any admins who want to ban me, Netanyahu is the modern day Hitler.)\\n While they are divided when it comes to the Hostage deal, the global Ceasefire now crowd is using the hostages to push a prominent ceasefire that will keep Hamas in power and end the War, while Israelis who want the hostage deal still want Hamas destroyed and to continue the war after the deal)Nah, I think everyone wants no more Hamas, no more Zionists, and no more war. Im honestly willing to bet that Israelis and Palestinians will be united in a century. Same with India and Pakistan, and the rest of the post-colonial ex-slave countries. But no one is going to set down their gun when theres still a chance theyll get shot in the face.  The Western left who considers themselves as Pro-Israel and anti-bibi, wants Netanyahu gone because they see him as an obstacle to the 2 State solution (That nowadays no Israeli and no Palestinian support). Lol Biden and Harris are in this camp and they just suffered a humiliating loss *exclusively because of this.* Americans are famously dumb, but some of us are slightly less dumb. (Not me, Im the dumbest.) They dont really care about his domestic corruption and attempts to become a de-facto dictator. I care. I read once in a while. This genocide U.S. Netanyahus last ditch attempt to avoid prison or worse.  At the same time, if you would say to the Israeli public (including the secular centrists who voted for people like Lapid, Gantz and Lieberman) that the world views Bibi as an obstacle to the 2SS, it would make them appreciate Netanyahu for standing up to the world and deflecting pressures. Nah, I think Israelis know Netanyahu is committing genocide to save himself. Many love it and dont care because they wanted genocide, ethnic cleansing, and annexations all along. But most realize how badly they screwed up by supporting him and are slowly backing away. Lol as an American, I remember when famously hated election stealer Bush Jr. had a 90%+ approval rating after 9/11. Its called the rally around the flag effect. He famously has the highest and lowest approval rating in history. God damn, the Afghanistan and Iraq wars were huge mistakes.Anyways, Netanyahu is no joke. Hes part of history, just like Trump. But I honestly think weve hit a turning point in world history. If the U.S. bombed the crap out of Israel in a few decades, Id be sad about the violence, but Id get it. Young Americans (both progressive and conservative alike) truly think Zionist Israel is the modern day Nazi Germany. And we love punching Nazis. Unfortunately, the onus is now on Jews to say they dont support Zionism today, just like it was on Muslims 20 years ago to say they arent going to Jihad their way into suicide bombing a school. Bigotry is timeless. It sucks, and I really hope we solve this quickly. But its a very dangerous time for the Middle East and things are likely to shake out in surprising ways. Im worried more than Ive been worried in my entire life. It honestly might end up being WWIII and the American Civil War II. There not might not be an Israel *or* Palestine in 20 years. Both countries would end up as a Jeopardy question in a few centuries and nothing more.","title":"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the \\"wrong reasons\\", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge"},{"text":"Who said that ?","title":"Go look at what they did to Trumps Wikipedia page and the Wikipedia page about this election"},{"text":"Everybody who was paying attention remembers the chaos and instability of Trump before.?

On December 17, 1944, a group of American prisoners of war (POWs) was executed by soldiers of the 1st SS Panzer Division, part of Kampfgruppe Peiper, led by SS Standartenfhrer Joachim Peiper. The massacre occurred near the town of Malmedy in Belgium.Events of the Massacre:\\t1.\\tCapture of American Troops:\\n\\t?\\tGerman forces surrounded and captured a column of about 120 American soldiers from Battery B of the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion near the Belgian village of Baugnez, south of Malmedy.\\n\\t?\\tThe American POWs were disarmed and assembled in an open field near a crossroads.\\n\\t2.\\tExecution:\\n\\t?\\tThe Germans, under unclear circumstances, opened fire on the unarmed prisoners. Some soldiers were killed instantly, while others were gunned down as they tried to flee.\\n\\t?\\tApproximately 84 American soldiers were murdered. Survivors of the massacre later testified to hearing the wounded being shot at close range.\\n\\t3.\\tSurvivors:\\n\\t?\\tA few Americans managed to escape by pretending to be dead or fleeing into nearby woods.

Female genital mutilation has a lot of terrible outcomes.From the WHO , the forms it takes are horrificType 1:?*This is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans).*Type 2:?*This is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).*Type 3:?*Also known as?infibulation, this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans.*Type 4:?*This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g., pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.*The negative long term outcomes are significant and numerous, again from the WHO*FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and it interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies. Although all forms of FGM are associated with increased risk of health?complications, the risk is greater with more severe forms of FGM.**Immediate complications of FGM can include:** *severe pain*\\n* *excessive bleeding (haemorrhage)*\\n* *genital tissue swelling*\\n* *fever*\\n* *infections e.g., tetanus*\\n* *urinary problems*\\n* *wound healing problems*\\n* *injury to surrounding genital tissue*\\n* *shock*\\n* *death.**Long-term complications can include:** *urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);*\\n* *vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);*\\n* *menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.);*\\n* *scar tissue and keloid;*\\n* *sexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);*\\n* *increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths;*\\n* *need for later surgeries: for example, the sealing or narrowing of the vaginal opening (type 3) may lead to the practice of cutting open the sealed vagina later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation). Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks; and*\\n* *psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.).*","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"He's not doing well.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"God help us.

I didn't do shit to anyone of color and no one of color did anything to me. We weren't even alive then. I grew up in the deep South and was absolutely the minority in my community and school.

It's so disrespectful and, frankly a form of mental abuse. The instant someone tells you you should feel bad about something that happened in the past simply because of your skin color, is the moment you should realize it is not history, rather it is part of an indoctrination of making you ashamed of who you were born as. That's horrible. Don't spread misinformation; civil war history, slavery, civil rights, WW-I, II, etc. will still be taught.  Facts cannot be changed or manipulated as history stands on its own.

Actually came to the realization a few years ago that it would probably be better for everyone if Trump got reelected and this had a lot to do with what was going on within my own leftist communities with people basically cannibalizing each other. It was really all of this disgusting mainstream media lies and propaganda that pushed me into doing more research. I started researching I realized that so much of what they said about Trump was straight up lies or just completely twisted and taken out of context. I have never really believed in politics or the media I've never trusted them but I do think that Trump is different. I've never seen this kind of reaction from the media or from people on the left or from people in general over any other person. It's obvious to me that Trump is a threat to the established order and that the people who are controlling the information or the majority of the information are terrified of Trump being in power.

The issue is that the majority of voting Americans chose to vote in someone who has made *explicitly clear* that they plan to run the government as an autocrat. Case in point: all these insane cabinet picks won't have to go through the confirmation process, because Trump has already said he's going to unilaterally appoint them with or without house and Senate support. Which yes, can technically be done under the laws of this country, but isn't a democratic action. Another example is the supreme court. Now, I may not be as bothered  by who sits on it when they rule in ways that protect my human rights, but the appointment of lifelong judges who get to make national policy decisions is inherently autocratic. So, as we saw under Trump, he will absolutely appoint the most extreme conservatives possible. Gay marriage? See ya. Mass deportations? They will happen. How quickly people forget that we had internment camps in this country. There are many people still alive who were children in those camps. That was an autocratic action by a democratic president and absolutely can and likely will happen again.

Right-wing groups in the US have been eroding the media landscape since forever.Partisan press in the 18th century, the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, the rise of right-wing talk radio, the entire modern marketing industry, targeted disinformation on Facebook, and now AI driven sham videos on TikTok.Musk's takeover of Twitter in late 2022 (a media platform which was rife with misinformation long before that switchover) had next to nothing to do with 72 million people voting for an avowed fascist, or for 90 million people deciding that democracy isn't worth defending.The problem is a broad cultural issue in the US where lies and propaganda is not just entirely legal but is also highly profitable. And apart from a short stint between WW2 and the 1980s - where people realized that might not be a good way to run a society because look what happened to Germany - it's always been this way.Add in record income inequality doggedly perused by GOP policies for decades, and people are not just open to misinformation but crave it like plants crave Brawndo.To say \\"oh it's because of Elon Musk\\" is dangerous because it ignores the major underlying structural issues which are the primary drivers, but it also erroneously suggests that the problem would be solved by attacking or removing Musk. That's wrong in the same way that thinking defeating Trump would also defeat the rise of fascism in the US.

The farm would go out of business and they'd have to eat their own crops to survive while being massively in debt and going bankrupt cause they didn't sell anything and couldn't cover their costs.  Cities have massive economic output and often access to ports.  They could just buy food from Canada or Mexico.  It would increase costs, but they'd survive.  It seems like the anti-city conservatives just think a bit too much of themselves and whether people can live without them.","title":"The Rural Areas Pushing for Divorce From Democratic Cities"},{"text":"I mean, he's right.The left has delved very deeply into identity politics, and that has played a large part in dividing the country.  There's been a large movement by the left to include identity-based issues in political and non-political aspects of life.  Anyone who doesn't fully agree with the movement is often also stigmatized and condemned, especially on social media.  It pushes away the moderates and independents because they, like the majority of America (as proven by the election), do not agree with many of the ideals related to recent LGBTQ initiatives and are villainized because of it. As such, the left was willingly abandoning a large proportion of its voting base to give special treatments for a minority.  It's really no surprise the democrats faced an overwhelming defeat.The evidence for my claims are abundant too.1. There was a tidal wave of pronoun inclusion on social media profiles.  \\n2. Arguments about trans athletes like Lia Thomas and Anne Andres.\\n3. Arguments around transgender surgeries and hormones for kids\\n4. Arguments to exclude parents from being involved in children's identities in schools\\n5. Hate trains against moderates on identity issues like J.K. RowlingNotice I say \\"arguments\\" instead of \\"discussions\\" for the above points.  That's because anyone who has an opinion that flies short of giving the minority 100% of what they want are immediately discredited and harassed.  Evidence of that, by the way, can be seen just with Seth Moulton's opinion on trans athletes in girls sports.  His main point was that he can't voice concerns like that without being fearful of being harassed, and that's exactly what happened to him - his own PR manager quit over it.The left has been forcing a spotlight on such niche identity politics, with unrealistic demands regarding them, and demonizing anyone who dares disagree to the point they are literally afraid to exercise the free speech the country claims to grant them.  It is not surprising to me then that the majority of people are distancing themselves from the party, and people like Bill Maher can't help but point out why.It is hard to justify staying with a party that makes you feel like your mind, your thought process, and your own person will be attacked just for existing in a different manner than others around you expect.  Fortunately, moderates and independents don't need to stay in that environment - they just need to migrate to the right where they're accepted.The truly ironic part is that those feelings of exclusion towards the wider audience are the exact feelings the left is fighting against for trans people.  But they've just gone so far into inclusion for that minority party that they mistreat and abandon their majority in the same way.  It's both sad, funny, and proof of how broken the democrats have become over the years.","title":"Bill Maher: Privileged and Stupid Democrats Need to Stop Digging Hole Over Identity Politics"},{"text":"The Republican party is an organized crime ring that occasionally dabbles in politics","title":"Fox News host confronts Mike Johnson with GOP demand for Matt Gaetz report"},{"text":"I guess if you absorb a critical amount of Fox News, and Joe Rogan, your critical thinking dribbles out your ears.","title":"Opinion: Donald Trump's 2024 election the death knell for experiment.

Predictably, the results have been a lot of dead Ukranians; Ukraine is turning into a dysfunctional rump state; and there is no way this ends with Ukraine being part of NATO anyway. Bad situation all around.To be clear, the Russian invasion wasn't right or legal ... but it was entirely predictable and avoidable.

Newspapers all over the country should have had **RAPE** as their headline next to a picture of Trump.  That didn't happen.In 2023, Trump was judged for harassing E.

[Oh it sounds like she was *very much* of her time.](https://blogs.loc.gov/manuscripts/2023/08/temperance-and-suffrage-movement-collections-connections/)As we celebrate Womens Equality Day on August 26, its important to keep in mind that the womens suffrage campaign wasnt the only reform movement that women used to advocate for change in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Temperance, although often overlooked today, was an enormously popular and influential reform movement during this time. Connections between women organizing for temperance and for suffrage can be found throughout various Manuscript Division collections.Temperance followers advocated abstinence from alcohol, but also learned much about organizing for a cause through their advocacy efforts. For example, women gained important experience in public speaking, including future suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony, who gave her first public speech at a Daughters of Temperance meeting in 1849. Moral suasion was the main tactic used during the antebellum years as temperance organizers attempted to persuade potential adherents to abstain from alcohol based on individual virtue and self-discipline, including by signing temperance pledges. By the 1850s temperance became more of a political issue as the movement turned toward legislative measures, much like the womens rights and womens suffrage movements. But in the case of temperance, legislation focused on combatting the sale and distribution of alcohol.","title":"Fox News host confronts Mike Johnson with GOP demand for Matt Gaetz report"},{"text":" Pretty sure the only tenet of the modern conservatives is \\"own the libs\\".

There's a reason the US spends so much money on the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet (by a huge margin) -- being able to project power and protect trade routes. Believe it or not, despite trump's pseudo-populism/nationalism, the US relies heavily on the rest of the world.Also, Ukraine non-intervention sets a dangerous precedent for Taiwan, which is vital to computer chips manufacturing (TSMC). A China-controlled TSMC could mean greater scarcity for the US, higher prices, and possible hardware backdoors in our computing devices.I should also point out that there's a strong correlation between drug usage and a country's economic condition, so... better hope trump actually does well for the average working class, or else we'll see more of that fentanyl abuse.* there are some of us who find it a good thing to honor our commitments to our allies, even if we have our own troubles* Biden did plenty of shit for the US; just do a web search. Granted, maybe he did things that the average person didn't value, and I won't say everything he did was great, both of which are arguably failings of the Democratic party. Also, fentanyl doesn't have anything to do with Ukraine; there's no reason we can't do both.*to go off of point 1 again: a lot of short-sighted \\"fixes\\" often cause problems in the long run. Let's say we block off our southern border. Where do those millions of refugees go? They stay in Mexico, probably, potentially causing destabilization across the border, which then eventually explodes into us -- it becomes our problem eventually if we don't fix the root problem, which is what Biden/Harris tried to investigate and solve. cue fox news \\"border czar\\" rhetoricsame thing with fentanyl -- what's the easy fix? Increased police authority sounds like something trump would do, which sets dangerous precedents for giving more authority and power to government -- a minor safety fix for an overall loss in freedom.something I think people don't seem to realize with voting trump is that once you give someone power, they rarely give it back. I understand people feel disempowered with our modern government, but giving what little we have to trump means we lose any power we had at all. If you read trump's biography, he says he doesn't like losing, EVER. It's why he's so petty and childish about not being wrong about anything at all.while the missiles don't seem like a great idea on the surface, put in the context of russia unjustly invading another country, maybe we should be asking why it wasn't allowed earlier.And more specifically, Biden isn't actually ordering a strike on russians, although fox news will probably frame it that way -- he's \\"allowing\\" it. It's about projecting more power, not completely unlike russia stockpiling 5 million north korean artillery shells, and even thousands of NK troops in Ukraine.what a petty fucking war, all because putin was scared of NATO.

Democrats are too nice, too unwilling to stand up as a force in the government and tell the anti democracy GOP to kiss their asses.  Democrats are so nice its starting to look like complicity. Looking at you Merrick Garland, who had the opportunity to lay down the law on Trump and his cronies and didnt do it, dragging the DOJs feet not prosecuting anyone.  If this democracy falls, I lay responsibility partially squarely at the feet of Merrick Garland. The other half of the responsibility Ill lay at the feed of the Democratic party itself. Democrats are weak, spineless, and go high when they should be punching these fascist traitors squirrel in the stomach. Im very disillusioned with the Democrats and theyre lucky they are the only choice because if we had ANY other pro democracy party that had any chance of winning an election I would start voting for their candidates.   I worked my ass off FOR MONTHS knocking doors, making calls, and I spent more time at the local county Democratic office, than I did at my own house and when Trump supporters started, destroying all of our campaign signs that we paid good money for, the state party wouldnt put it on the news because they claimed that putting it on the media would only encourage copycats.  Ignore the problem and it will go away.   Right?   This party better start waking up and getting a whole lot scrappier or we are going to wake up and find ourselves in the history books as having been a weak party just like the social Democrats in Germany were weak and failed to stop Hitler.  ??

This indicates that while the daily launch rate typically hovered around the mid-20s, there were numerous days with significantly higher activity. Notably, there were 17 days during the study period when missile launches exceeded 82 missiles in a single day.

Any county currently defined as part of a larger MSA by the Census bureau or with X population (let's say 100k) would qualify for membership in urban America, which would be decided by referendum. The overarching \\"super-federal\\" body governing the \\"Two Americas\\" would be responsible for defense/foreign relations, the common currency/interstate exchange, and possibly some other oversight/social programs (FDA? EPA? VA? Etc.).

I think this approval will make it so Russia walks away with half or even just part of their goals.Depending on how many long-range missiles Ukraine has, they could deliver so harsh strategic blows to Russia. Simultaneously, they could use this to regain territory. Putin will be focused on trying to control his government, strategize, and more.As for Russia's response, Putin might clap back, but I believe by the time Trump is sworn in, we'll see the tone change.Trump likes Putin, and Putin likes Trump. They have a connection. Whatever that connection is, nobody knows. Though it is clear as day, Putin plays favorites with US politicians; Trump specifically.So, Trump is sworn in, Trump will negotiate a deal, likely with a lot of back channel diplomacy. He might tell Ukraine if they don't take it, they'll lose support. In turn, Trump could offer Russia an alternative to keeping ALL the land they annexed; offering to lift sanctions and buy Russia oil. This would help lower gas prices in the US, the economy might see a temporary boost and allow the US to focus on its increase in oil production, Russia's economy can begin to recover from the financial blow this war has wrought on them while declaring \\"victory\\" since they annexed some land, Kim can tell his people that North Korea's military power gave Russia the push to victory, Ukraine can rebuild and enjoy an era of peace - even if temporary.It's not the best off ramp, but it's an off ramp that doesn't involve a third World War.","title":"Biden approves Ukraines use of long-range missiles inside Russia for first time"},{"text":"Nashville too!","title":"The Rural Areas Pushing for Divorce From Democratic Cities"},{"text":"Im grateful to have freedoms and rights very recent generations of women did not.

Two, it is very likely this will help Ukraine capture or hold additional Russian territory, which Putin really does not want.

If Ukraine does not control any Russian territory, then Russia gets tens of thousands of square miles of Ukrainian territory and loses nothing, so it's easy to call it a win. However, if Ukraine controls Russian territory, suddenly it looks a lot stupider and more like Putin kind of fucked up in a half-assed effort to conquer a nearby country and then lost some of his own country in the process.Additionally, there is not a ton of support for this war in Russia. If Russian citizens are perfectly safe, then it is a lot easier for them to at least kind to go along with it, but if they fear counterattack by Ukrainians trying to defend their country, the political cost of the war inside Russia is a lot higher with a lot less public support.","title":"In a first, Biden allows Ukraine to strike Russia with U.S. long-range weapons"},{"text":"I dont even like Trump lmao","title":"Election denialism emerges on the left after Trumps win - Conspiracy theories that the election was miscounted, hacked and stolen have spread in some left-leaning online communities."},{"text":"Uhh..

[...] The urban-rural divide is a longtime fissure in American life, one that President-elect Donald Trump played up on the campaign trail as he railed against large Democratic-run metropoliseswhile also making electoral gains in many cities. Now, emboldened separatist groups see the incoming administration as uniquely friendly to red, less populous areas that feel steamrolled by left-leaning urban power centers. [...] As for the wannabe breakaway counties, a divorce could get messy. Becoming new states would require consent of the existing legislaturesextremely unlikely in most blue statesas well as Congress, according to Article IV, section III of the U.S. Constitution. That has only happened a handful of times, including the formation of Kentucky with the consent of Virginia and the founding of Maine, which was once part of Massachusetts.

The main benefit is travelling that 186 miles really fast and being difficult to intercept.It can't quite reach Moscow from the Ukrainian border but it can attack targets behind the russian front line whilst the launcher stays far enough back from the front line to be relatively safe (at least as safe as you can be as a prime target in a warzone).It means you can sit 50 miles from the russian front line, attack supply convoys and rail infrastructure 100 miles behind the Russian line, then gtfo before Russia launches a counter missile strike on you. Because you're 50 miles from the border those counter missiles take longer to get to you than if you were nearer the front.It's not some magic new tech, it's been around since the 80s, but Ukraine being able to use it against Russian supply lines within Russia (like how Russia has been attacking Ukrainian supply lines from day 1) will give them a badly needed edge.Ukraine already had the capability to strike within Russia, but this allows them to expand that capability with donated US missiles.","title":"Biden allows Ukraine to strike inside Russia with missiles"},{"text":"You seem to think that the presidents actions, illegal and immoral, have no effect on the behavior of the public.

People are reactionary, and if the nation is a mess in 2028, we'll see Democrats voted in. In fact, I think that's actually pretty likely: Many of the actions that people voted for--tariffs, removing immigrants en masse, getting rid of entire agencies, reworking social security--will be incredibly unpopular, and will very likely cause a dramatic increase in inflation. Should inflation occur, or SS be affected, or people lose family and friends to draconian immigration efforts, many of the Trump faithful will blame it on Biden, but many will see Trump in office and blame him. Trump has an impenetrable knot of supporters, but the GOP does not. From that point of view, and Democratic president in 2028 might even seem likely. Plus--we don't really know how much of the the GOP's success lately is due to people loving their policies vs. people loving Trump. He is--and I say this as someone who deeply loathes him--a once-a-generation talent. What Obama was in 2008, Trump has been since 2016. He has kept the GOP alive and broadened it--but it may be wishful thinking to assume the GOP will retain its popularity after he's gone, because there just isn't anyone that generates the same excitement among conservatives. They like DeSantis, but he's a wet blanket; Vivek is Indian and while that may not matter to majority of conservatives, there are plenty who would care about that, and care about it a lot; Vance is not a terrible politician, but has been \\"meh-ing upward\\" at a faster rate than any other candidate I've ever seen; Trump's sons are wackjobs and don't have his \\"charm.\\" Think of all the Republicans on the scene now, and ask yourself if you can see pickup trucks flying that person's flag--for me, it's hard to imagine a parade with \\"VIVEK\\" or \\"RON\\" flags blowing in the breeze. I think the Democrats have TREMENDOUS challenges ahead them, with their media problem being the biggest. The legacy media is weaker than it's been in a century, and they can't control the narrative in the new media landscape, or counter the misinformation that the GOP can spew at unbelievable rates. But to say that all this means the GOP will be power for the next three presidential cycles--I have a pretty bleak outlook on the future, and even I don't see it that way. Pre-edit, where I'll disagree with myself slightly: if the GOP uses the next four and figures out a way to demolish the vote and run an election that is \\"free and fair\\" in name only--and I absolutely wouldn't put it past them, seeing as they had a practice round in 2020--then yeah, maybe, I can absolutely see that playing out, where we get more Republicans elected.","title":"CMV: Republicans will continue to win both the Presidency and Senate continually till 2036."},{"text":"I feel awful for Joe.
