This would not be a problem for most elections, as the younger demographic of straight white men still leaned liberal, but recently, hate specifically against this group has become wide spread on social media. And where liberals failed to tap into this demographic, republicans did.  Democrats were sure that Gen Z would vote left, as in the previous election, and polls were largely innacurateAfter the election it became clear what a shift trump had made with these groups, his appearance on JRE garnered 52 Million views, JD Vance interview on JRE had 13M views, and on Lez Fridman, 7.8 Million views, each one lasting around 4 Hours and not requiring any monetary incentive.Kamala Harris had one interview on 60 Seconds and  one interview on the call me daddy podcast, the latter costing her 6 figures and lasting 7 minutes, in which she criticizes trump for his misogynistic comments. This interview has 100K views on youtube and 3 dislikes for every like. JRE was a center-left podcast, and  Rogan has endorsed Bernie Sanders for the presidency in the past. But one day before the election, he endorsed Donald Trump. This means that Trump tapped into around 52M young gen z center/center-left men, and talked to them for 3 hours straight, before having someone they look up to endorse him for presidentsDemocrats were always a party of morals, and conservatives, a party with more focus on the economy. But now that Democrats have neglected this male demographic, the Republican party steps in and paints itself as not only helpful for the economy, but offering comfort where these young men and women were struggling to find jobs.Gen Z is being referred to as the toolbelt generation, as many of them have stepped away from college in favor of a skilled trade after seeing how college debt has effected millennials. Trades have, for a long time, been occupied by men around the age of 40. Men around the age of 40? That sounds like generation X. Young Gen Z men, who were parented by Gen X, are taking trade jobs over college, like Gen X, trade jobs that have for a long time been neglected by liberals in favor of college educated millennials. Gen X also leans conservative, due to being a smaller generation of people, they were not capitalized on by liberals- Gen Z men are being led into trade jobs by their fathers, their fathers being conservative, and trade jobs being largely neglected by democrats, skewing the Gen Z demographic further into conservative arms.The Democratic Party must learn how to appeal towards Young Gen Z Men if they wish to fight against this red wave. You did not offer a view, you offered a statement, a statement that has piles of evidence in support of it.NBC projection for Gen Z voters Before and After the Election[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-half-gen-z-voters-support-kamala-harris-one-third-back-donald-tru-rcna169025](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-half-gen-z-voters-support-kamala-harris-one-third-back-donald-tru-rcna169025)[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/yes-trump-improved-young-men-drew-young-women-rcna179019](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/yes-trump-improved-young-men-drew-young-women-rcna179019)","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"That's what the ZOG elites accuse him of.","title":"Here is a thought, could the LA fires be done on purpose by the rich elite?"},{"text":"Decadence.

Galbraith explains it:-If you go back to the period before the introduction of the sanctions [...] the Russian economy was very heavily colonized by Western firms. That was true in automobiles, it was true in aircrafts, it was true in everything from fast food restaurants to big box stores. Western firms were present all throughout the Russian economy. -A great many of them [...] either chose to exit Russia or were pressured to exit Russia after early 2022. So on what terms did they leave? Well, they were required, if they were leaving permanently, to sell their capital equipment, their factories and so forth, to let's say a Russian business which would get a loan from Russian banks or maybe have other sources of financing, at a very favorable price for the Russians. -So effectively a lot of capital wealth, which was partly owned by the West, has been transferred to Russian ownership. And you now have an economy which is moving forward and has the advantage compared to Europe of relatively low resource costs because Russia is a great producer of resources, oil and gas and fertilizer and food stuff and so forth. -And so while the Europeans are paying maybe twice in Germany what they were paying for energy, the Russians are not, they're paying perhaps less than they were paying before the war. So again I characterize the effect of the sanctions, in fact as being in certain respects a gift to the Russian economy. And this is, I think, quite different from what the authors of the sanctions expected. [...] -And the essence of the situation is this would not have happened without the sanctions. You could have had the war, and it would have gone pretty much as it has gone. But the Russian government in 2022 was in no position to force the exit of Western firms. It didn't want to, wouldn't have done that. It was in no position to force its oligarchs to choose between Russia and the West. It didn't wish to do that. These choices were imposed by the West, and the results were actually, in many respects, favorable to the long-term independent development of the Russian Federation's economy.","title":"Question about tariff war with Canada and Mexico"},{"text":"Yup!

You could say there are vast parallels to the current day obviously, corruption, oligarchic tendencies, income disparity, but Im not sure I think that modern Americans at least overwhelmingly dont believe in the system. I think that a loud minority has taken power through the electoral system, an equally loud minority is angry due to an electoral loss, and the rest are either oblivious to the situation or frankly just dont care. I can see an argument of the lack of political engagement being an argument for a segment of the population being disenchanted with the system, but not a terribly strong argument. At least in the US the voting population has always been rather small in comparison to the rest of the world. Side note, if its about the underlying system, what particularly do you think the population is against? The US Congress has had a net negative approval rating since at least 1976, with the exception of late 2001-early 2002, same as the vast majority of presidents in the 20th and 21st century.

Tho when I say anti-system I mean it in a way that hasn't happened in the US since at least 1900. I don't mean being against the current politics but being against the underlying institutions. And I think that's a crucial difference.Quoting myself in a response to another redditor which I think might be useful to illustrate what I mean here:What you describe as sine waves is mostly what I describe as regime changes in the post. My point is that I think this time its much much stronger. In 1933, 1971, 1980... the regime changes were drastic and the crisis' big but they were never about the underlying system. They were rather about the direction we should take within the current system.FDR and Reagan, while strongly against the state of affairs of their time, never ran against the underlying systems, they never ran like outsiders, they never criticized the old institutions, like the old media, in the way the new \\"anti-system\\" candidates do. Trump was very surprising because of this. When he first appeared he was very much an \\"outsider\\" very much \\"against the system\\". FDR, Reagan and Biden would all be at home running for president in each other's times. Trump would be an outsider in any of those times for the same reasons -- the others weren't about changing the system -- Trump is.I of course believe this reflects sentiments of a large portion of the population who also doesn't believe in the system.

Though Im no fan of Trump, Poilievre, Badenoch, or pretty much anyone right of centre, just because the world is swinging in the direction of the right or left doesnt mean that democracy is over. All that means is that some political ideology has been convinced voters that theyre better off voting right than left in the current day and age. Politics in democracies seem to sine wave a lot. From 1933-1953 the USA was led by FDR and Truman. The New Deal was seen by the left as the way forward out of the depression, and it was seen by the right as socialism and anti American. 1981-1993 the USA was led by Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush implementing conservative fiscal policies that still gave ramifications today. The USA tends to swap parties every 8-12 years for the executive branch, and 4-6 years for the legislative branch. Weve seen tests to democracy since the end of the age of absolute monarchies. Sure some nations here and then fall out of favour with the democratic process, but it seems to be rather temporary. I figure, and of course this is my opinion alone, that in the current climate once democracy is introduced it will continue. You may have hiccups like Germany 1933-1945,l and South Korea 1948-1960 1961-1963 1972-1981. What you have to remember though is though you may think that democracy is a tried and tested form of government, in the history of government democracy is still relatively new in its current form. For thousands of years weve had monarchies, empires, feudalism, and dictatorships. Only really from the 1700-1800s has democracy started to spread. Growing pains in the end. The only way old forms of government are truly snubbed out is when a brand new form of government is invented and begins to supersede it.

A few highlights: https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Judge-rips-Harris-office-for-hiding-problems-3263797.php - the local drug testing lab used by the San Francisco Police Department went crazy and started falsifying results.

But they do not want to confront it.  Democrat politicians actually love republicans.  They try to act like them as much as they can, but they do not want to piss off their constituency, so they have adjust their behavior.  Don't believe me?  Check out John Fetterman.  How about In the 90's the Democrats had the house, the senate and the presidency.  All of a sudden conservative democrats started talking about Republican rights.  And voting with them on a ton of measures, which enriched the rich.  We democrats did not vote them into power to protect piece of shit republicans.  And yet they did (Nancy Pelosi among them).  Democrats lost the next election, because after they fucked their constituents over, the constituency became independent voters and stopped voting for them.  That independent number has grown and the Democrats cannot win without them.  So why did Harris lose?  Maybe because she kept saying that she wants republicans to be part of her administration.  That is a signal saying she is just more of the same and the Independent crowd decided not to vote for her.  But they will push \\"oh she was a woman\\".  You know what they don't hear is why Hilary / Harris actually lost.  Independent voters are older and they remember the democrats betraying us.  We could have had an awesome health plan for America, but Hilary dropped the ball.  Then coincidentally a few months later Big Pharma started giving her a massive amount of cash.  She fucked Al Gore's presidency, which gave us cocaine addict GWB jr and she had been working for the republicans for years.  We had so much hope for this country, but then we had the Dem conservatives acting in the place of republicans. Every study shows that in order for the Dems to win, they need to be more progressive.  And yet they go the other way.  Clinton after her defeat of Sanders was expected to go progressive to round up the rest of the democrats.  What did she do under Robbie Mook?  She went and tried to get the right to vote for her.  I know you guys are saying \\"what?

By then it was too late, as Democrat Independents are scientifically proven to be amongst the smartest voters, and they could see through their bullshit.  I think they don't vote in the hopes that democrat politicians would pick up on this and make changes in their organization.  Yet, that never happens.  It all comes down to this - Democratic Politicians get richer under republican rule.  We need to take dark money out of politics, only then we will see change.

A blanket pardon for the proud boys should be vigorously protested.  Clashes between antifa and far right militias shouldn't be judged and punished according to the political beliefs of those involved.  -Ensure people in leadership of non government organizations, like political parties or churches, are willing to continue their activities despite pressure.  Local government should also be supported in continuing to follow the constitution, and adhere to principles like Federalism and the rule of law.  -Sending people to political camps and prisons should not become normalized.  This includes politically based training and observation for civil service professions like teachers.  Fascism thrives on isolating people and turning families against each other.  -Propaganda offering simple solutions to complex problems through an authoritarian government should be resisted.  Fascists will historically cloak their intentions in both right wing and left wing rhetoric, so viewing government policies through a purely partisan lens isn't always the best way to resist authoritarianism.  Ideally, Fascism will only require a Stonewall to resist, rather than a Warsaw uprising or a Civil War.

I'm a Democrat.\\"Democrats have a lot of diversity, all of them with their own aims and goals. It is constantly fragmented to some degree or other, and always will be. Liberals and leftists are all over the place, and personally ,I think that's a good thing.The party itself has to refocus on how to address their problems with getting their message out. The biggest thing \\"conservatives\\" have are billion-dollar, oligarch-fueled message machines pumping out incredibly questionable garbage 24/7, and these are not even directly related to the Republican party, they are entities all unto themselves, with huge staffs designing methods of infiltration and disruption. As we saw with the first Trump presidency, Fox network called the shots more often and Trump just followed them. Now there are Xitter, Fox, Sinclair, numerous YouTube and other media, and numerous \\"conventions\\" all paid and directed by the oligarchs. If the Republicans relied on themselves to do promotion they would do a terrible job. They have in the past and they suck at it.Democrats somehow need to find a way to do the same. The older members, like Nancy Pelosi, need to step aside and let younger, more tech-intelligent people take the helm. There needs to be way more grassroots infrastructure, high-profile figures, and media outlets to combat the onslaught of propaganda. They have to go on the offensive, and not just constantly be parrying attacks from the right. They also need way better insider intelligence. Someone somewhere knew about this \\"Greenland, Panama, Canada takeover\\" idiocy, and liberals need to be ready to spring forward with a full force of derision and mocking when it came out. Ask \\"How does this lower grocery prices?\\" Hammer, hammer, hammer on the expense Americans will suffer from tariffs.Democrats need to figure out how to defuse and minimize the stupidity of \\"space lasers\\" and other nonsense, and not let the media get diverted by these idiots, but keep laser focused on the important subjects. People cruelly criticizing  the LA fire disaster should be roundly mocked, and their own failures thrown in their face. Make truth-bombs actually something that makes a big explosion, figuratively speaking.Democrats need to completely stop relying on traditional medias, which are dying out, anyway. I've watched the Washington Post sink slowly into the swamp, being subsumed by the liars and rich (well, newspapers always were, except for a few bright moments, but that's another story. Hearst comes to mind). During Trump's first reign,I saw over and over again the Post desperately trying to give cause to Trump's inanity. This time around, they not only continually derided Biden for things Trump was equally suffering from, but ignored the actual achievements Biden made. Meanwhile, Trump was essentially speaking in tongues at his rallies, and the Post sane-washed everything, pretty much putting words in his mouth and making it sound like he was \\"reasonable.\\"I was incredibly disappointed when Biden decided he was going to run again. I knew early on that was a fatal mistake as I did not see him being able to maintain his level of activity. Democrats should have started the process of presenting other candidates for president the second year Biden was in, and had a primary in the normal way. Hopefully this will be a lesson remembered.Because Biden dropped out so late, and because the right-wing media machine is so hot these days, Harris didn't have enough time to get out there, get her message out, get the information out. Plus there were too many \\"old school\\" Democratic leaders trying to direct how Harris and Walz got there message out. I heard that Walz was told to \\"tone down\\" his statements. They were the best thing going on! Plus, the whole Israel/Palestine situation, and people resenting they \\"didn't get a primary.\\" I get that, but it's no reason to not vote for her to prevent whatever disaster we are about to go through.TLDR: Democrats need to weed out the old, cautious politicians, get younger tech-savvy people in, go on the offensive, be smarter than the right wing, and build up a huge media presence.

With Belgium making the best gear.  Iran uses German (Siemens) gear.  An EU nuclear force now isn't unquestionable, given the rapid degradation of the comments from Trump/Musk.  South Korea and Japan probably won't be far behind.

As leftists tell it, climate change is a serious, world-altering crisis, which requires us to either restrict economic activity or overthrow capitalism itself. The leftists are right about the first point: climate change is a huge problem. But what if they're wrong about the second point? I do think the leftists are wrong, by the way. We're beginning to glimpse a future where solar energy is so cheap and abundant that it can replace other energy sources in almost every industrial process. A future where capturing carbon from the air and storing it isn't energy-prohibitive.It's not even obvious to me that we would use less petroleum. Sure, we'll burn less, but petroleum is also processed into other useful products such as plastics. What if the energy needed to rearrange those hydrocarbon molecules into something useful becomes cheaper by an order of magnitude? Conservatives never even consider this possibility. They resolve their cognitive dissonance between \\"climate change is real\\", \\"capitalism is good\\", and \\"solving climate change requires us to overthrow capitalism by discarding the first proposition rather than the third. They accept the leftist account of economic reality and reject the science, rather than accept the science and reject the leftist description of the economy.","title":"Conservatives are still denying climate change."},{"text":"Some more context:https://www.propublica.org/article/north-carolina-supreme-court-election-certification-blockedIt looks like she is the incumbent and is remaining on the bench while they fight it.","title":"In North Carolina, judge Allison Riggs won our votes, but the NC gop won't certify her win"},{"text":"The article doesnt state anything other, than they were offered dinner at an expensive resterurant.

Why would they put forth all of this resistance and ammunition towards Trump, if he was one of them?All Trump has done is expose the existence of the Deep State, how they operate, how the media is controlled, etc. If Trump was one of them, why would he expose all of that? Why would he expose Epstein island? Why would he expose the humanitarian crisis at the border? Why would he expose the swamp?Same goes for Elon. If Elon was one of them, he wouldnt have exposed how the Deep State were using widespread censorship, and he wouldnt have stolen one of their most valuable brainwashing/narrative management assets, Twitter.Same goes for RFK Jr. If he was one of them, he wouldnt have exposed how the Deep State profit off of our illness and are poisoning our food supply. He wouldnt have exposed all that CIA/USAID nefarious activity.If we were all already asleep, why would they go through this big power struggle, and wake up hundreds of millions of normies, and expose themselves in the process?

I dont think Denmark allows that though, because Denmark is a liberal environmentalist country.What does Denmark actually get out of owning a big chunk of ice they arent even exploiting the resources of, thats just a big money pit for them? Good question. As far as I can tell, Denmark just wants the island for sentimental reasons, because some Viking king was amazed by it a millennium ago.Once Greenland becomes independent, the only way they will be able to sustain themselves without subsidies will be to start mining and drilling, and that requires huge outside investment.

She was a horrible choice. Since Biden waited until after he humiliated himself in a debate with Trump, there wasn't really an alternative here, so see bullet point 1\\n* Maybe Harris's campaign should not have decided to hitch their wagon to the fucking Cheneys, of all people\\n* Harris lost more minority support than any democratic candidate in my lifetime. Why? Because Democrats have steadfastly refused to actually do anything to help these marginalized groups, instead taking their votes for granted, and they finally started getting fed up. Is that all on Harris? Nope, not at all, not even mostly, but the question is what Democrats could have done differently, not just Harris\\n* Democrats could have done the things they promised, like codifying a woman's reproductive rights into law before the supreme court had a chance to take those rights away, actually protecting voting rights for everyone at the federal level instead of letting republican controlled states disenfranchise tens of thousands of people, change voting laws to make them more restrictive, etc. but democrats have long held the belief that the key to presidential victory isn't actually helping people through legislation but claiming their victory was required to ensure a supreme court that wouldn't do everything Trump's hand-picked courts have now done\\n* Biden's DOJ could have moved faster to investigate and prosecute Trump for his treason on January 6th, instead of waiting until mere months before the election to even try to go to trial. This is an especially fucking hare-brained move because there's a long-standing precedent of courts refusing to involve themselves in politically linked cases close to an election. Trump should have been in jail by 2022, not getting his supreme court buddies to claim he has unlimited immunity for vaguely-defined \\"official acts\\" in 2024.\\n* Having even a remotely acceptable proposed solution to the genocide in Palestine might have helped since, you know, not a lot of people are super comfortable supporting a regime that is directly helping an apartheid state slaughter an entire civilization, and people throughout the nation put Biden (and then Harris) on notice very early into this election cycle that their approach to Palestine was not acceptable.Those are just a few things they could have done differently. Instead, their entire message was \\"Trump bad! Look at all these cool celebrities who like us! Also here's a really fucking stupid proposal for economic prosperity!\\", after which they blamed voters for being too stupid to vote for them, which is exactly what Hillary did when they lost in 2016I hate the Republican party. They are a cancer. But I'm genuinely sick and fucking tired of the only alternative, Democrats, basically relying on \\"republicans are worse\\" as their primary campaign strategy. Yes, republicans are worse, but your job as a political party is to convince people to vote *for you*, and you only get so far by pointing out that the other side is full of bad guys, especially when so many democrats are, themselves, corrupt, feckless, and subservient to corporate interests. Republicans are worse, but not by a whole lot.I voted for Harris, because I felt compelled to as a civic duty, but you know what? Fuck democrats. They're not entitled to my vote just because. Not anymore. If they start doing the things they claim they can and want to do, I'll vote for them again. Until that day, when it comes to the choice between two evils, I will pick neither.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"And water is wet lol","title":"The Federal Reserve Thinks Trump is Going to Make Inflation Much Worse"},{"text":"What usually happens is enemies like Russia, China, Iran etc spread lies on social media.The MAGA dipshits are stupid enough to believe them.The elected Republicans HAVE to repeat the propaganda of our enemies or their voters will be mad at them.","title":"Falsehoods around the L.A. fires are proliferating on the right"},{"text":"Loss of abortion rights keeps people from being free.

Traditional media outlets around the world will never sufficiently address this because they make more money and hold more influence by slinging propaganda.Social Media has the same censorship problem, and is being actively poisoned by troll farms and AI.The news moves at lightning speed so we don't have time to build up momentum speaking out against any one event.The politicians we elect in the U.S. campaign on helping the average voter, but in many cases, they actively work against us once in office. The only people who get real representation in our country are the ultra-wealthy who, ironically don't pay any taxes.Again, many of these billionaires aren't even U.S. citizens.When these outrages incite more extremists like Luigi to take action, there won't be any self-awareness from the top of the hill. Us peasants will get the blame, and then we'll get the boot.","title":"Trump Escaped Consequences. Now Hes Running From the Truth"},{"text":"When it's his fault then - \\"it's not my responsibility.

I don't think civilization ending, but at the very least halting forward progress for a long while.Perhaps if the pain gets bad enough, extreme measures taken such as expensive de-carbonification through open-air nuclear reactors (and other similar geo-engineering plans) and acts larger in scope as the clean water/air acts will finally be viable.

Connor being deviant doesn't correlate with him being humanized.  Dogs can be humanized, Tamagotchi's can be humanized.  Being deviant has nothing to do with it.  It is a question of whether people would humanize Connor and there even within the game there is zero doubt that they would.  Once something is able to pass the Turing test humans are going to have a difficult time distinguishing it from being human.  Now give it a face and clothing and make it socialize like a human and it is going to get humanized regardless as to whether it is deviant or just a machine.  One of the parts of DBH I like most is you as the player are tested to see whether you humanize the androids in this game at least three different times.1. When you get to decide to shoot Chloe or not2. When you find out Alice is an android and need to decide whether this changes how you feel about her.3. The main menu Chloe asks for you to allow her to leave.None of these force you to say how you personally feel as you might just play as the characters of the game and just react in how they feel, but at least for me when I played I found that I had to pause the and think during each of these moments and that is because I really felt conflicted.  Here is at least how I responded to each scenario.1. I didn't want to shoot Chloe even though I knew she wasn't real.  If Kamski had asked me to shoot a toaster, I'd have done it in a second.  Why is that?  Chloe wasn't deviant.  You could see in her responses and how she acted that she was just a machine, yet I didn't want to pull the trigger.2. Finding out Alice was an android hit me like a ton of bricks.  When Crossroads started, I was ready for Connor to kill Markus at any cost, but when Alice and Kara walked into Jericho, I actually had to step away and collect my thoughts.  I decided that if Connor killing Markus put Alice and Kara in any danger, I'd abandon it.  I'd let the world burn before I'd let them die.  Then I found out Alice was an android and had to once again stop and rethink whether this changed things.  This was probably the biggest test in the game since a character goes from being human in the player's mind to being an android.  Alice isn't even a deviant as far as we know so she is just a robot child.  I ultimately did decide this changed things, but it wasn't super obvious to me as it would be if it turned out Alice was a toaster.3. When Chloe asks to leave at the end of the game, that was a really hard decision.  Again bringing back the toaster, if a toaster somehow asked to leave the answer would have been, \\"Did you just talk?\\" followed by \\"No\\".  Chloe is a freaking background animation yet I had to spend several minutes contemplating what it would be like to let her go or forcing her to stay.Maybe you didn't have these sorts of reactions to these events in this game or maybe you did.  At least for me, it just goes to show how easily I personally humanized the androids whether they were deviant or not.  Now translate this into a real world event like if there is a very serious disaster happening and you see an android like Connor rush towards the disaster and end it saving hundreds if not thousands of lives.  There is no world where that android isn't treated like a hero.  I don't even know where we'd draw the line between how we'd treat Connor's act of heroism compared to how we'd treat an actual human who did the same thing.  There probably would be some gap, but again let's bring back your toaster which fell off a ledge and killed the bad guy.  That toaster would be almost instantly lost to history in comparison to the android who would never be forgotten.lol, again, I could ramble on and on about this, but I feel like it is pretty self-evident on its own that people will humanize a machine as long as it displays some human traits and Connor displays many human traits in how he looks, talks, and acts.  Connor would easily be humanized even in his machine version.  Heck, CyberLife went all out to ensure all of their androids would be humanized as much as possible so it's no surprise Connor would get this sort of treatment.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"Because he doesn't actually care about helping anyone but himself.","title":"Trump Cares More About Starting Fights Than Fire Victims"},{"text":" actual evidence from meteorologists You mean the evidence that they have been screaming at you for decades?","title":"Conservatives are still denying climate change."},{"text":"Going to make a torrent server that pirates Windows and reuploads it 24/7 just to spite them","title":"Microsoft contributes $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund"},{"text":"Mainly venting here, but it seems if there were ever an opportunity to find common ground with Repubs, it would be on joining forces to try to prevent billionaires from buying elections.

You are separating \\"how group A would win\\" from \\"what group B is doing\\".But those things can't actually be separated. Even in the general case - if two sides are opposing each other, whether it's in sport, games, war, business, or politics, it's almost never possible to separate those things. In particular, politics - despite the common language used around it - is *not* like a race. A race is the kind of competition that's closest to being separable; you can just focus on running fast.Politics is (in sports terms) like boxing, football, etc. There are active opponents, and just being good at things isn't enough; your opponents are actively interfering with your plans and enacting their own.That said, it's even worse for politics. In sports, at least the \\"framework\\" itself is not part of the competition. In politics, it is. In football an opposing quarterback can't change the rules of the game mid-play, or swap out referees. In politics, that can and does actually happen. Take, as a concrete example, the idea of a likeable candidate. There is no such thing as *objectively likeable*. Which candidate is actually widely liked is not a function of some inherent traits of the candidate; it's a function of media influence (both \\"traditional\\" and \\"social\\"), of political influence, of the culture and subculture of the people perceiving the candidate, etc. And all of those things are themselves influenced (but not completely controlled) by the candidates, their supporters, etc.It's impossible to simply choose a likeable candidate - every possible candidate is going to be *presented* as unlikeable by the opposition. Rather, the important part is to *make people like your candidate*.Certainly there are still successes and failures there. Trump's backers made a lot of people like him. This wasn't due to Trump being inherently likeable, it was due to a well-executed media campaign. Democrats have not been executing their media campaigns nearly as well. In particular, Republicans have a much stronger media *foundation* (that they have built over 40+ years), which acts as a force multiplier to any individual campaign.So, yes, it's necessary to understand why Democrats lost before their chances of victory can be meaningfully increased; but no, the things you identified are not the main reasons why Democrats lost.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"They are showing off their power.

Ask the Iowa Soybean farmers how the last round went for them.  EVERYTHING will get more expensive...down to sub-components/ingredients for everything else we build.  The bill of materials for those high dollar US electronics are about to explode in cost.  Unless Apple, Samsung, and others eat that cost and kill their margins by keeping prices the same, all of it will go up in price significantly. 2) Mass deportations will cause massive labor shortages in farming, construction and food processing.  American's rarely take jobs picking crops or cleaning those meat processing plants...those are almost exclusively immigrants...legal and illegal.  When was the last time you saw a bunch of White American folks chilling outside home depot looking for day laborer work on a construction site?  Good luck getting your home improvements/renovations done.  Time to roll those sleeves up and DIY that shit.3) Imperialist bullshit that Trump has been spouting...he's doing it intentionally to destabilize NATO.  Pissing off Europe and then trying to push Tariffs and landgrabs against our allies will have long term effects.  Canada is one of our biggest trading partners for providing food, oil and other products...as is Europe. All that shit about Greenland and threatening Denmark?  They are a huge exporter of drugs to the US...this includes those extremely popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.  That will get much more expensive.4) Off of the imperialist bullshit... If he pushes hard enough we'll lose a lot of free/easy travel protections.  Visas will start being required and Customs processing will get much more difficult.  Good luck trying to ship things globally..,and good luck trying to get cheap airfare...taxes and fees will start being tacked on en masse.  Proof?  When the UK left the EU, massive amounts of taxes and fees were added to airfare.  A trip from NY to Manchester nearly doubled in price on the 'cheap' fares.5) Environmental protection policies that mitigate disasters are functionally ignored by Trump.  Disasters won't necessarily get worse in severity but the follow up response will become transactional and significantly worse for large sections of the country.  These add a lot of overhead to statee and local budgets while also impacting federal relief funds (driving costs up).  Coupled with likely tax cuts, this will place further pressure on the national debt which leads to further inflation.6) Tax Cuts...Trump can easily get the political capital to cut taxes...the Republicans will practically prostrate themselves to get those done.  Trump doesn't have the political capital to make any cuts to fund those tax cuts.  The things he's suggested cutting are wildly unpopular and will cause huge uproars if he tries. Social Security and Medicare will get some adjustments, but if he tries to cut them in any meaningful way...then it'll be a bloodbath during mid-terms and 2028.  This will lead to larger deficits as Trump and most recent Republican presidents have driven the deficit up at record levels during their terms.So yea...buckle up.  Biden and his economics policy may not have been sexy, but they some how miraculously stuck the 'soft landing' only to get hit by the Trump 2024 Semi-Truck as it drives the economy into an overheated recessionary mess.","title":"The Federal Reserve Thinks Trump is Going to Make Inflation Much Worse"},{"text":"We can just start putting things in the shiploads of empty containers we send back.","title":"Beijing says its willing to deepen economic ties with Canada as Trump brings trade chaos"},{"text":"Are people's pattern of consumption (and therefore pollution) going to be significantly different under Trump versus Biden?

But not because I think you are stupid. In fact, you seem pretty smart. The numbers for who is actually being denied at soccer games or attacked in bathrooms is not the way I think you think it is....The thing is, you don't actually get to decide what other people are concerned about. I agree with you, these books were in libraries, not being taught (in most cases, with some isolated incidents where they were being taught but that is just edge cases). But should they even be in junior high school libraries ? NO. Not appropriate. And it's not unreasonable for parents to be upset about that. If I can't tell people what to be concerned about, you don't get to tell me what *not* to be concerned about. And, actually, we as a society *do* tell people what to be concerned about all the time. We tell people not to worry about vehicle collision deaths, gun violence (mass or self-), and on. Thousands of people are killed by guns and cars every year and we just kinda shrug it off, but a dozen highschool students claim the wrong gender and we stop the presses. Additionally... uh. Yeah. It is completely appropriate for middle school-aged children to know what penetrative sex is. Basically every major education association in this country recommends that children by the 8th grade should be able to define different forms of sexual intercourse (those being vaginal, anal, oral) as well as sexual physical wellness, healthy relationships and consent, and gender and sexual identity. I'll take a step back here and ask; Now do you see how getting caught stressing about trans people has impacted general sexual education?

Why? Why did that happen. What makes me more angry is after this fire goes out, the rebuilding process will begin. The government of California will approve the construction permits. They will concede on updates to building codes in order to prioritize getting their economy back on track.

Yeah, sure, the working class has a problem with the Democrats right now.  The reason is not difficult to figure out.  Besides the normal reasons of failure to follow through on promises, and Democrats are far better than the Republicans on siding with working Americans.  The real reason lies in threads like this one, and any time that you hear Democrats and left-hearted persons (and I count myself a Socialist) discuss people that vote Republican.  The underlying assumptions that come pouring out about the working class and the poor, the prejudice and malice, are just appalling.  Pure contempt.  We spend every election season pissed about how stupid and evil the poor and conservative are to fall for conservative politics.  How racist, how backwoods religious, every epithet in the book.  Instead of spending our time and energy trying to woo people and convince them of the rightness of our cause, we blame the people we are trying to convert for being too stupid to listen to us.  In public.  Repeatedly.  Often on T-Shirts.  Many times gleefully on YouTube videos highlighting how stupid they are.  We advertise how much we hate them.  Take a look at so many of the comments on this very thread.  Here on the official Democrats subreddit.  What are the working class supposed to think?And what is our excuse?  Well, we tried, but they didn't listen?  So, what then, let the bullying begin.  Let the contempt fly.  They didn't listen because they know that we think they are hillbillies.  They didn't listen because they have known for decades that we have no respect for flyover country.  They don't listen because we haven't supported or respected people with grease under their fingernails for ages.  Until we change that in ourselves, until we conduct the necessary consciousness-raising in the rank and file that prevents every single discussion of the \\"working class\\" from being filled with contempt for the very people we are trying to win over, we will never be successful in winning them back, or in creating the programs and laws to create effective solutions to change this country for the better.  We don't understand how to make it better, because we don't understand the issues.","title":"The only message Democrats need to win is that we represent the working people of America, whereas Republicans represent the interests of the wealthy."},{"text":"Couldn't agree more","title":"CMV: If Trump attacked Greenland and Denmark tried to defend it, his government wouldn't survive it"},{"text":"This is great, this feels like a classic r/conspiracy post","title":"The REAL Reason Trump Wants Greenland"},{"text":"Fucking hell that was only a couple months ago and I forgot about because of how utterly stupid the idea was.

Also, doesn't apply to people who own a home but are still likely struggling.A very very very small percentage of the population even wants to consider owning a small business, yet alone actually go apply for the loan. Most people just want their job to pay more or things to get cheaper first.She was saying everyone wants to be a home owning small business owner and while I don't have a great idea on the number of those in the country,  i doubt those would apply to more than 10% of the country. People that like their jobs don't care about the small business part, and people that are struggling to put food in front of them don't care about applying for a mortgage.Meanwhile trump said basically \\"I'm going to deport the illegals and then the economy will be fixed, and you'll get money back in your pockets\\"A nonsense point, but one that most people can identify with.

Trump succeeds because of isolation, because he channels people's feelings that the world is leaving them, hates them, etc. that they have to win back their place or something. And so many people voted for him because of fear, because they have real economic, financial concerns, however misguided or untruthful it is to think trump will solve them, the concerns are real, and dems don't feel like they are listening, or worse, feel like they are shaming them for having those needs and burying them under other social issues, hence the reaction against LGBT.There are probably a lot of people in the Trump camp that I really don't think compassion may work, they need to actually be brought to a reflective place first, humbled, Trump himself included and many of the most hardline, absolute, racist full believer MAGA people - but that is not everyone.Dr. King told us to love our enemies, and practically, it's simply because it lets you turn many, maybe not all, but many into potential allies - and that if your enemy is the tyrant, the hateful, the ones that survive off of lies and division, this is the only true antidote to defeat them. Anything else just makes them stronger. It's good to think Trump supporters don't have it right, to criticize, you should - but yeah, letting that slip into pure condemnation, hatred, moral highgrounding and dehumanization, that only plays into Trump's hands. The only way hate and its power dies is if you build an environment in which it cannot thrive and that cannot be done through more hate.It sounds like naive moralizing, but in reality it's very practical, a proven strategy and honestly yeah I think what the US needs probably.","title":"Canadians Prepared to Go to War Against America to Defend Independence from Trump: 'Just Say When'"},{"text":"I guess we better get used to that again :(","title":"California is burning.

It should be the very real likelihood that Trump will once again withhold FEMA response from citizens he imagines are his enemies once he enters office. FEMA provides billions of dollars in aid for emergencies and natural disasters disasters which have become more frequent and more severe. States do not have the same pot of resources for disaster response, and I dont know what states would do if they suddenly did not receive FEMA grants because the president thinks this is just a game and not actual human lives.  In my state, FEMA funds 75% of the costs for response and recovery of presidentially declared disasters. For COVID response, the federal share is 100%. FEMA funding begins to flow as soon as a national disaster is declared by the president, and a declaration is usually immediate given that response work is urgent, and work groups submit for grant funding immediately upon getting the green light from FEMA. Disasters happen two-three times a year and vary in severity. Under Trump, COVID funding for blue states was 80% while red states received 100% funding. COVID disaster response in my state was in the ballpark of $4 billion dollars, so thats approximately $800 million dollars that Trump withheld from us, the taxpayers who pay for FEMA, simply because he doesnt like us.Trump also refused to respond to our states requests for emergency declaration status during at least two natural disasters. Delays in declaration cause delays in emergency response because responding groups do not know if they can submit for FEMA grants. Peoples homes were literally burning to the ground, disaster response in a quagmire, all because Trump couldnt be bothered.This is one of the things that legitimately terrifies me as a blue wall state.

As long as Trump says it has something to do with al-Qaeda, probably if he just says that whatever hes doing is under the AUMF, then thats it. Weve already been down the road of using the AUMF for a purpose that was explicitly not authorized - going after ISIS, which had absolutely no connection to 9/11, none to Al-Qaeda, and was in fact actively hostile to them. Nobody complained back then because we had to deal with those guys, but Obama should have sought a new authorization. He took the easy road and in the process proved that the president has absolutely unlimited power to go to war at any time, for any reason. The army could just say nah, were not doing that, it isnt covered, but that would be extra-legal since they have no say under the law. Congress could revoke the AUMF, but the republicans probably wont. Its highly likely that it wont come to that with Denmark, but the problem isnt that he can attack this specific country, its that hes allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and was legally enabled to do so.

Things such as her saying she was \\"open to the idea of reparations\\" at a town hall in October did not help at all. Neither did the taxpayer funded sex-changes for the incarcerated stance. They solidified her loss. This election could and should have went to the Democrats by a healthy margin. The election was not lost to people who bought into Trump's lies, but by the shortcomings and respective radicalism of the Democrats.

Interests who are also dumb and foolish to believe that they can control the outcome in a predictable way.\\nNeed to start with the US, then branch out a little primarily because US politics are just a little different with a firmly entrenched two party system.\\nIn the US, for the sake of simplicity, we have two large, roughly equal groups of people.? One of them will always vote for the Democrat, the other will always vote for the Republican.? They're probably among the smarter voters that we have, or at least you can say that they actually have an ideology and can articulate an opinion and policy.? Whether or not you agree with it.\\nAnd that leaves the dummies.? And there are a lot of them, and they aren't just in the US.\\nThe entire world just experienced, for a variety of complicated economic reasons which are not entirely clear or completely understood yet and which probably never will be, a bout of significant inflation which has made life for everyone, all over the world, more difficult despite, at least in the US, healthy macroeconomic numbers.??\\nAs it turns out most people are simple and dumb.? They approach elections like a tribe carrying out a sacrifice for rain and a good harvest; when they're unhappy they vote the current party out and they vote the other one in.\\nAnd over the past year or so that's exactly what they've done all over the world.? And are still doing now.? Regardless of the political orientation of the party in charge; they're getting switched over by an unsatisfied public.\\nSo my assertion is that the Democrats could have done a number of things to run a better candidate.? Biden could have stepped down earlier, we could have had a primary.? The Republicans could have done different things too, they could have ran just about anyone.??\\nBut none of it would have mattered because the outcome was not about politics, it was just ritual sacrifice, and altering that context wouldn't have changed the outcome.? Maybe an electoral vote here or there, but not the ultimate outcome.??\\nAnd that's the thing that actually tickles me about the thing.? There are a lot of Democrats making bold assertions about why Democrats \\"failed\\", and Republicans moving forward under the assumption that they have some sort of unassailable mandate to rule, but neither is true.??\\nThey're all working really hard to control a thing they can't control, and tricking themselves into believing that they can, that they've done things \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" when the only answer is that masses of stupid people are a force of nature that you can't control.\\nIf I have any more objective statement about who should do what in the wake of the election it's actually for the Republicans.? Their strategy of making an enemy of the Democrats, making villains of them and obstructing only works when you're a sizeable minority.? You can fail to deliver over and over again when you're an \\"oppressed minority\\" when it comes to political power.? But now you've got a trifecta, now you're out of excuses.? You'd better deliver, and you'd better be careful to deliver in a way that actually improves the lives of the people that voted for you.? Just \\"owning the Dems\\" isn't going to cut it anymore, you just delivered that one.?

The amount of polarized responses you're facing perfectly illustrates how effective the dual-party system and media propaganda are at keeping people stuck in tribalistic thinking. It's frustrating to see genuine attempts at discourse met with accusations and labels instead of thoughtful engagement.Youre absolutely right that the \\"Blue Team\\" (Democrats) need to do some serious introspection if they want to figure out why they couldnt beat someone like Trump without relying solely on fear or outrage. While there are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Trump and his supporters, focusing entirely on them as \\"the problem\\" ignores the deeper issues within the Democratic Party itself.One major issue with the Blue Team is their tendency to shame people who dont fully align with their values. This if youre not with us, youre against us mentality doesnt foster understandingit alienates people who might otherwise agree on many issues but feel silenced or disrespected. That shame often drives voters away, and more often than not, they end up with the \\"Red Team\\" simply because it feels like a rejection of the Blue Teams judgmental approach. Its not about agreeing with the Red Teams policiesits about rejecting being dismissed or insulted.The difficulty in speaking outside these narratives is another valid point. Both parties rely on media and propaganda to maintain control, framing the debate as a zero-sum game where one side is inherently good and the other evil. This leaves no room for nuance or criticism within the partycalling out Democrats for their own elitism or failures, for example, often leads to immediate backlash, as youve experienced here.One glaring issue with the Blue Team is their pretense of being \\"for the people\\" while maintaining the status quo in favor of elites. While they may criticize the Red Team for favoring the wealthy, they often do the same but with better PR. Consider the lack of meaningful progress on healthcare reform, their hesitance to challenge corporate influence (e.g., big tech, Wall Street), or their failure to enact policies like student loan forgiveness in ways that benefit average Americans. The Democrats resistance to Bernie Sanders populist policies, despite his clear resonance with many voters, highlights how they often prioritize their establishment over grassroots support.Its worth noting that while the Red Team leans on deregulation and corporate tax cuts, the Blue Team often focuses on symbolic gestures that avoid challenging systemic inequality. Both parties ultimately serve elites, and the tribalistic framing keeps voters distracted from that reality. For example, the Democrats had ample opportunity to address corporate power or campaign finance reform but chose incrementalism or performative gestures instead of bold action.The real challenge is breaking through this polarization to focus on whats best for the country as a whole, rather than what benefits one party. Until more people are willing to have nuanced conversations like thisacknowledging faults within their own \\"team\\"the cycle will continue, and meaningful progress will remain out of reach.

The pandemic started in early 2020, Trump was out at the end of the year. But the beginning of a pandemic is crucial, and Trump did everything wrong. He's extremely stupid, he has no interest in or understanding of public health issues, so he missed the critical window when preventative measures could have been taken and the public could have been prepared for what was to come. Trump simply did nothing until people started talking about it on TV, and even then he still didn't understand the gravity of the situation. Tucker Carlson had to go and warn Trump about the pandemic in person in an attempt to get him to treat it with the gravity it deserved. And even once it was too serious and in his face to ignore, Trump continued to do everything wrong. He kept all the attention on himself, he spread extremely wrong and dangerous misinformation to the public, he even admitted that he publicly tried to downplay the threat of the virus despite knowing how dangerous it was.That's not to even get into the fact that early in the pandemic Trump wrote it off because he's a fucking moron who somehow thought that it would stay contained to blue states, and he could use the death and destruction in those areas to his political advantage in the upcoming election. Trump put Jared Kushner and other morons in charge of distributing supplies, and even personally intervened to send critical testing supplies directly to Putin.Sure, you can say the pandemic would have been bad regardless of who was in charge, that's probably true. But there's no defense for Trump's actions. It was the greatest governmental failure in any of our lifetimes, over a million Americans died, and Trump is directly to blame for almost all of it.

But should they even be in junior high school libraries ?  NO.  Not appropriate.  And it's not unreasonable for parents to be upset about that.  Forget that it is gay in nature, ... nobody wants books in a junior high school teaching kids how to have straight sex either.

There have been countless arguments made by parents across the country at actual school board meetings, not about the concept in general, but about ACTUAL books in their school's ACTUAL libraries.

In 2015 she was questioned by LGBT proponents why she had blocked gender affirming care for prison inmates. She was running on being an ally because she was one of the first democrats running for office to support marriage equality. So by 2019 she said she actually DID support gender affirming care and that the previous positions her office took blocking gender affirming care was done without her consultation. Harris has faced harsh criticism because she fought to block gender-affirming medical care for a trans woman in prison in 2015. In 2019, she told the Washington Blade that legal briefs in her office were often written without her consultation and that as attorney general, she was obligated to defend the state.But the bottom line is the buck stops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did, Harris said.Harris has taken full responsibility for this failing, and reiterated that transitioning inmates are entitled to receive the medical attention they require, need and deserve, a Human Rights Campaign spokesperson said in a statement to The 19th.Thats where this all started. Trump then used her 2019 comments to share that she did indeed she wanted to use federal funds to support transitions for prisoners (which btw, Im 100% ok with. The money were talking about is a drop in the bucket). Since she was running on being an ally she had to be pro-trans. Since trans people are disproportionally represented in sex work, she announced her support for decriminalizing sex work (btw, again something wise I fully support). The problem is all these things were fodder for republicans who used this as ammo to tell everyone else she was fighting for you. She was fighting for them. All of this was done prior to this last election. And she didnt make any real attempt from making her look lime this was her top priority and it snowballed from there.

She tried to thread the needle between not pissing off the wealthy too much because she needs that fat campaign contributions or she's toast and trying to appeal to the average voter without whom, she's also toast. Turns out, she was toast.That's the entire problem with the Democratic Party right now. They've bought into neoliberalist approaches and, well, they work wonderfully! But only if you focus on the overall economy and if you're, you know, rich as fuck. They work for shit for the average voter. Trump at least had the consciousness to flat out lie and say, \\"I know the problem. I know how to fix it. And I will fix it.\\" all the while knowing he's going to cut taxes and not much else because he's lying out his ass. Faced with the choice between more or less the same thing tweaked and an illusion, turns out, voters pick the illusion. THAT should tell you all you need to know about neoliberalism for a democratic country. It works for the wealthy. It doesn't work for the voters. You get the campaign contributions and you don't get the votes (unless you're in a relatively captured district, which is a whole 'nother problem entirely). Democrats need to get back to basics. Dust of FDR and do whatever he did, in spirit at least. Democrats are the working person's party first and foremost. Everything else is secondary. Convince everyone with less than a $20m portfolio they're a working person. Use that as the base and build like a motherfucker off that. The party has basically taken what's supposed to be its base for granted and that was its HUGE mistake.

The Democrats are...quite correctly...viewed as plutocratic neoliberals coasting on decades of status quo that has slowly throttled the life out of the \\"middle class\\" and created a massive and unprecedented wealth/power schism in society. It's not really hard to understand why that's unpopular.The current state of the GOP post ideological capture by its far right flank is essentially nativism/proto-fascism, and we have history to show us why that's popular and what groups it appeals to. It doesn't necessarily need to be a case of \\"the Democrats failed to be appealing enough\\", either, because for a portion of the population fascism will always be incredibly appealing all on its own. Show an average MAGA member the underlying ideological tenets of fascism without calling it \\"fascism\\" and they'd say \\"That sounds pretty fucking good to me\\". I'm not sure a \\"solution\\" to that is to have the Democrats also become fascistic in order to steal that vote share.You could hope they would also become demagogues (to whatever degree they aren't already), or populists in the vein of Bernie Sanders, but \\"left wing\\" populism is a kite that cannot fly in the United States, the nation has been poisoned against it by a century of relentless anti-union, pro-capital propaganda. And even if you're a fan of neoliberalism and market capitalism, you're left with the reality that when given a choice between the populist left and the populist right, capital will always take the populist right. Fascism is very pro-business, and capital will always seek to protect its own interests first.TLDR - Bernie isn't a viable candidate in the US, politics is beholden to entrenched capital interests and the capital will not support even an anodyne social democrat like Bernie or AOC, they will be branded as \\"radical leftists\\". Fascism and Nativism is deeply appealing to the prejudices of the electorate during times of economic upheaval and unrest. People, by and large, prefer simple narratives and folk devils to complex problems with sometimes unpalatable solutions.

What happens if you're wrong? While there are millions of voters out there that are not voting, I am yet to see that they would in fact show up for such a candidate. In a fair election system, the median voter should decide the outcome. Any voter who thinks \\"one party does nothing for me, the other party is going to hurt me\\" and concludes \\"I better not vote, no one represents me\\", is removing themselves from that set of voters and moves the median voter further to the party that wants to hurt them.In the same model, a loosing party has two traditional options: moving their positions towards the other party to appeal to the median voter, or trying to convince the median voter of their positions even if they didn't before. What you're asking for is the third: moving away from the median voter. This can only work if you doing so extends the voting population so dramatically that the formerly median voter is no longer even close to the median voter in this new voting population.These extensions to the voting population have happened before. Most recently (for democrats) on the cultural progressive side after LBJ. Arguably for Trump in 2016. But they are the exception, not the norm.And while I would love to see policies (culturally and socioeconomically) to the left of the current Democratic party, if these voters don't exist in large enough numbers, we are throwing real humans under the bus by not competing for the median voter if your thesis about who we could get to vote for \\"real progress\\" is wrong. It is much easier to argue (and to effect) that Democrats should move to the left, away from Republicans, if they win (and keep winning) than if they lose.
