When you see such an effort, people have something to hide (because he would know) or he is outside the circle of control (that they've controlled for who knows how long). This is why I disagree with the idea that he is in on it too intuitively: I feel like this movement is really about exposing this same BS system that has only gotten exposed more so in the last decade or so.

The last centennial conclave in 1925 set the globalist agenda for the next 100 years and designated it the Stage of the Forerunner. The Stage of the Forerunner is a preparatory period to prepare the way for [the Coming One.](http://thecomingone.org) Their [2025 Initiative](https://youtube.com/@2025initiativepreparingtheway?si=ip7kY38-vADR1LAY) comes to an end Easter time 2025.

Around Easter time 2025, at the time of the next centennial conclave, this is said to set the stage of the externalization of the Spiritual Hierarchy(the Great White Brotherhood). The GWB(which includes Jesus, Mother Mary, Confucius, Buddha, Hilarion, Enoch, Paul the Venetian, Kwan Yin, Saint Germain, and Kuthumi) begins to reveal themselves to the world and evangelize the Coming One.

We are *Lucifer.*There is only one sin: the sin of separativeness. Alternatively, the sin against Oneness. Oneness is associated with goodness, love, and light. Separativeness is associated with evil, hate, and darkness. The Plan: One global communist government. One global religion that grants authority to the global government in the minds of humanity. One global Soul. One God: We, Lucifer. The abolition of private property as we are One.

A big reason is a return to antitrust policy driven by economic competition rather than weird social activism.This will be received like cancer but that's fine. markets are one quadrillion times smarter than r/politics as a general rule. Polymarket was right and r/politics was humiliated last night. Luckily I only cared what the former thought. No jumping up and down like a chimpanzee over Ann selzer's moronic \\"poll\\" with completely nonsensical crosstabs for me.

We find suggestive evidence that European immigrants were perceived to have posed threats to the political order. Our results suggest that, in the American Midwest, despite nativist othering, **European immigrants were fully on the white side of the color line, and were protected from collective violence by their white status**.","title":"My attempt at explaining the huge shift towards the right in the Mexican-American border communities as a guy from El Paso"},{"text":"No self respecting cat would allow itself to be touched by that filthy dog.","title":"Jeff Bezos Congratulates Trump on Victory"},{"text":"And then they dont fix it.","title":"Is it time to imitate the Republicans during the Obama years?"},{"text":"Trump has immunity - not his underlings.

Because this makes me speculate that the reason our turnout cratered this year but was really high in 2020, matching GOP turnout, might be because Dems only turn out when Trump *is* in power. Meanwhile he's not as scary this cycle because he's not constantly in the news for every harmful thing he does.Taking this theory to 2028, that would mean Dem turnout will be really high while GOP turnout will crater. That is, unless they're able to capture the Trump appeal in a new candidate. I think it's very unlikely such a person makes it through the GOP primary at that point, because there would be no system or swamp to decry but Trump's own.Anyways I know this is massive copium, but if an election really does come down to something as simple as \\"Trump being on the ballot,\\" then I don't think it's hard to imagine such an optimistic scenario in 2028.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 6, 2024"},{"text":"The damage the SCOTUS did alone is staggering.Not imagine Presidency and Senate.Yes ideally they don't get the House as well, but lets be real - they are going to work overtime to tear down America and do Putin's bidding.","title":"Should it really be this hard to beat Donald Trump?"},{"text":"Or you can leave toowe dont mind.","title":"STATES WHERE DONALD J.

The reverse of that, is that marijuana is legal on a federal level, but states have the right to decide if it's legal or not there. If the US gov't decides that it will no longer classify marijuana as a controlled substance, should it then make it illegal for states to make it illegal? Marijuana isn't a constitutional right, but this analogy implies that we need the federal government to give us the right to smoke marijuana.If states have the power to decide of marijuana should be illegal, because lets say like, Alabama hates pot and the majority of Alabama citizens get together and vote to outlaw it because they're angry, they hate the smell of pot and they hate stoners. Should the federal government then make it illegal for states to make it illegal? Or should all the marijuana users just fight back for their rights to puff it in Alabama?And also if we have a first amendment right, why doesn't the government take action on social media platforms that have selectively silenced any who oppose the current political agenda? Do we beg government do it, or do we just move on and go to a new platform that will give us more freedoms?Honestly, I really don't know the best answer to the abortion subject but I think legalizing it on a local level is the best effort we have to making it eventually fully legal and accepted by more people as time goes on in the same way that marijuana has become legal, because at that point you won't even need federal government involvement in it.","title":"It was nice to see my vote count."},{"text":"It's a good thing you're around to tell other people what they're going to do.

As for abortion, Trump literally took it completely out of the partys platform. He officially has no stance on it and hast stated that hed veto a nationwide abortion ban on the federal level. It is up to each state to decide what they will do. Look at Missouri as an example. Missouri went for Trump, and the same voters approved a measure legalizing abortion up to I think the end of the first trimester.

Instead they get the 35 hour work week, paid parental leave, free education, health care, cheap prescriptions, the works. As an American Im annoyed that they get all these social welfare benefits and I get aircraft carriers and stealth bombers. I wish Europeans would step up their defense spending significantly and field their own massive military industrial complex and let the U.S. scale back in favor of massive cuts in defense spending. As a history buff I wince at the thought of the Germans or the French or an Austro-Hungarian alliance have their own fleet of cutting edge bombers and warships. European powers have been second rate states for 79 years and cooperative with each other under an umbrella of NATO and the EU.

Harris trying to court moderate Republicans has become the narrative later in the day today, but I don't see how you can possibly come to the conclusion she actually did.

Some of the social spending will because everybody likes free stuff, but Much like how you don't get to just declare presidency, you don't just get to declare that you courted moderate Republicans and they didn't vote. You have to actually court moderate Republicans.If that's too unpalpable you don't have to, but we just saw the results of responding to right populism with going further left (Harris was arguably the most left senator, and Biden benefited pretty massively from the false branding of a moderate). It doesn't work at all, and we should have known it doesn't work at all because the UK did it too and it went similarly poorly. The current D strategy is untenable, and sucking up the voters that the Rs just disenfranchised is a pretty obvious starting point.

Here are some potential reforms:1. Increase Transparency and Accountability\\t?\\tPublic Financial Disclosures: Require more detailed, accessible financial disclosures on how DNC funds are raised and spent, including campaign contributions and vendor payments.\\n\\t?\\tClearer Decision-Making Processes: Make decision-making processes, such as primary debate rules or candidate support, transparent and subject to clear guidelines that are publicly available.\\n\\t?\\tEnhanced Oversight: Establish an independent ethics and oversight board to investigate conflicts of interest and hold DNC officials accountable.2. Promote Democratic and Inclusive Representation\\t?\\tDecentralize Power: Reduce the power of top leadership to make unilateral decisions. Empower state and local party chapters to have more influence in decision-making, especially in setting primary rules and selecting candidates.\\n\\t?\\tSuperdelegate Reform: Limit or eliminate the role of superdelegates (unpledged delegates) who have disproportionate influence over candidate selection, giving more power to pledged delegates chosen by voters.\\n\\t?\\tDiverse Representation: Ensure that DNC leadership reflects the diversity of the partys base, including more representatives from underrepresented communities and younger voices.3. Modernize Primary and Caucus Systems\\t?\\tStandardize and Simplify Voting Procedures: Standardize the primary and caucus processes across states to reduce voter confusion and streamline the delegate allocation process.\\n\\t?\\tIncreased Accessibility: Encourage vote-by-mail options, early voting, and same-day voter registration to make primaries more accessible to all voters.\\n\\t?\\tReduce Influence of Wealthy Donors: Reduce reliance on high-dollar fundraisers and corporate PAC donations, and prioritize small-dollar fundraising to better reflect the grassroots base of the party.4. Strengthen Grassroots Engagement and Empowerment\\t?\\tInvest in Local Organizing: Dedicate more funding and resources to grassroots organizing at the local and state levels, ensuring that the DNC is consistently engaged with voters outside of election cycles.\\n\\t?\\tCreate Platforms for Policy Input: Develop mechanisms for regular feedback from party members and activists, such as open forums, town halls, and digital platforms where members can submit policy ideas and proposals.\\n\\t?\\tEmpower Volunteers and Small Donors: Recognize and reward the contributions of small-dollar donors and grassroots volunteers, making sure they have a voice and feel included in the decision-making process.5. Foster Internal Democracy and Party Unity\\t?\\tEncourage Internal Debates and Open Forums: Allow more space for debate within the party, avoiding a top-down approach where dissenting voices are discouraged. This can be done through regional meetings, issue-based caucuses, and a stronger national convention.\\n\\t?\\tBuild a Clear, Cohesive Platform: Establish a clear, unified platform that reflects the partys core values and policies, with input from all wings of the party. This can help bridge gaps between moderates and progressives and present a unified message to voters.6. Adopt Modern Campaigning Techniques and Data Practices\\t?\\tEmphasize Data and Technology: Invest in data science, digital engagement, and innovative campaigning techniques, equipping local chapters with tools for voter outreach and engagement.\\n\\t?\\tProtect Digital Privacy and Security: Ensure robust cybersecurity measures to protect voter data and prevent interference in digital campaigning.7. Implement Term Limits and Leadership Rotations\\t?\\tRegular Leadership Changes: Introduce term limits or rotation policies for DNC leadership positions, allowing for fresh perspectives and preventing stagnation in the leadership.\\n\\t?\\tEncourage Young Leadership: Create opportunities for younger leaders and activists to rise through the ranks and contribute new ideas.8. Increase Voter Engagement Through Policy-Driven Initiatives\\t?\\tFocus on Core Policy Issues: Emphasize policy-driven initiatives that directly address the concerns of voters, such as healthcare, climate change, economic equality, and social justice.\\n\\t?\\tDevelop Community Programs: Launch community programs on important issues, allowing voters to see the DNCs commitment to real, impactful change in their daily lives.This kind of reform would be ambitious and complex but could make the DNC more democratic, more effective in addressing the needs of its base, and more capable of inspiring voter enthusiasm.","title":"Sanders Slams 'Big Money Interests' and Consultants That Control Democratic Party After Loss to Trump | Common Dreams"},{"text":"I dont think Trump considered a pardon.

Elissa Slotkin defeats ex-Rep. Mike Rogers in Michigan Senate race"},{"text":"I keep saying this, Blue states will be fine, it's the Red States that will have the issues. But no one is listening!I just want to point out something to a lot of people that might not understand this. While this is the beginning of the next presidency, it is also the end of this storyline. The Republican Party is at a crossroads with itself and it splintering down the middle. One side you have moderate Republican who wants to move the country in a direction of conversation with Democrats and the other side you have the radical Republicans. The party is going to cannibalize itself.As for the people that voted for the Republican Nominee, I want to point out a little thing that you might not have thought about. While you are all for deporting migrants, we need to remember that the economy will not stay afloat without those individuals. 1) Migrants make up only 18.6% of the labor jobs in this country. That is not a number that is hurting our workforce. 2) Migrant jobs include working on farms and construction sites as well as mines, factories, food preparation, cleaning, and child care. Here is where Republicans made their mistake.If the deportation of migrants happens, the farms, construction sites, factories, mines, food preparation companies, etc. will have few things that will occur:1. **Getting rid the migrant workers will eventually cause these companies to close.**?Why? These companies will be getting rid of their work force that is paid off the books. These companies have bult in paying migrants off the books that they would not be able to handle paying the same amount of people on the books. Result: Companies crash, farms in the Red States no longer function, prices of goods produced by the company skyrocket, people can't/won't buy their goods because they are too expensive, local economies crash, the Red States cannot function.\\n2. **The companies keep the workers but have to provide them with Green Card Status.**?Why? They do not want to get rid of their labor but now they have to pay them a livable wage. Result: Green Card Status increases, the migrants become citizens, which means they vote, Red States will see shifts to Blue.So what does that mean? Well, Republicans who felt that voting for the Republican Nominee would lower grocery costs, it won't. It will cause them to increase. Coupled with tariffs, getting rid of the CHIPS and Science Act, you're looking at being a lot worse off than you were the last four years.So where does this go? The next four years will be an embarrassment, but Republicans will not be voted in as President for a long time after this. No one will be able to inherit the Republican Nominees cult because they have not been able to yet. The Red States population will decline because they will be moving to Blue States to feel protected. This is the end of the Republican Party.The important thing to remember is that there are still circuit judges that in place that are Republican that have no problem standing up to the Republican Nominee. Democrats will take the White House back in 2028 and all three branches. In 2026 we will take back the house and senate.","title":"Trump Voters Got What They Wanted  Those who expect that Donald Trump will hurt others, and not them, are likely to be unpleasantly surprised."},{"text":"I dont know man, no one has that authority until they take it.

I am reading all the rhetoric about how bad Harris was, how her campaign sucked, and how nobody liked her, but that outlook really only holds true in the US. That said, she was well liked enough to pack large enthusiastic crowds and many people did like her, despite claims that the Dems hated her too. Maybe some did, but many did not. By and large, the Democratic party did accept her, but the party itself is so fragmented.   \\n  \\nI have been living in the EU for a decade now, and everyone around me, without exception is saying how awful Trump is and how likeable, relatable, and capable Harris is and that they cannot understand how this could have happened. Outsiders looking in who have not grown up in the US have an entirely different perspective, and find it unfathomable that Trump won. Not only because they think he is absolutely foul-tempered and uncouth, but because they genuinely do like Harris. These are educated, hardworking and worldly people, well-traveled and not politically extreme in either direction, (but politically astute) and they have no real dog in this fight as they do not have to live in the U.S., or be governed by US politics. They are largely impartial observers. Their opinions are pretty objective and not fueled so much by emotion or personal investment.   \\n  \\nWhen you step outside the U.S. and away from how absolutely insane and polarized the politics are there, you realize how much being inside the fish bowl makes us see things through a very skewed lens. People in the US did not vote for Trump despite his controversial behaviors, but *because* of them.

Yes, social media and traditional media being controlled by special interests plays a huge part, but it's not the entire story.

At the convention they did everything to stymie Bernie - speaking times at unfavourable times etc. of course she got to run but it wa obvious to everyone but her and her husband that she was not the best candidate but Hillary was chosen any way.

If you're old enough to remember Occupy Wall Street in 2011, I'd think you're old enough to remember the last months of the W. Bush presidency of 2008 and just how unpopular it was.You're in for a few unpleasant surprises if you're optimistic about a presidency, Congress, and Supreme Court that are under the control of Republicans. They're guaranteed to get fully righteous with their entitlement to power and empire, skyrocketing the national debt while waging world wars.I know it's become a thing to claim Trump didn't start any new wars, but he brags about assassinating Iran's top General, Suleimani. The whole point of something like that is to start a war. We can all see now that the Iranians have been very patient with the Israelis, putting up with quite a lot while avoiding war. I've found that this is because Iran's economy is growing and its technological capabilities are increasing and improving whereas Israel's professionals are steadily leaving Israel, and the U.S. military capabilities in the Middle East are decreasing due to age and wear. Israel's Iron Dome isn't working as advertised, as Hezbhollah has been steadily wearing it down, using drones and rockets against radar and whatever other sensors and detectors it has in the north, and one day Hezbollah flew a drone over a major Israeli port and uploaded it for the public to view.The U.S. needs to get a war going against Iran ASAP because the longer this is put off, the more advantageous it is to Iran. J.D. Vance likes to talk tough about how much he'll bomb Iran if ever given the chance. Trump says similar.Trump's is best buddies with Mike Pompeo, one of America's most notorious deep state intelligence operatives and a neocon. Trump's putting him in as top advisor, which indicates a Bush-like, neocon foreign policy. This means a major war in the middle east, and we know Iran is a main target.Trump already bragged in his previous administration that he ordered U.S. soldiers to remain in Syria \\"to protect the oil fields\\". Trump was in a low-intensity war with Russia over Syria, as was Obama, as Russia saved the Syrian government from annihilation by the ISIS/Al-Qaida alliance that the U.S. was backing. We still back these right wingers of the Middle East, and still plan on using them some more. Though thanks to Iran's General Suleimani, those right wing Sunni's were mostly wiped out, which is why Trump had him assassinated.Trump and Vance are going to have to defend the southeast Syran oil fields from the Syrian/Russian militaries which are going to try to get them back at some point. I'm guessing over the next 4 years, but who knows when. If the U.S. goes to war with Iran, this means ending the war in Ukraine first to focus on the Middle East. And this is what Trump and Vance are claiming to prioritize. They'll start out their administration with euphoric, utopian talk of \\"peace in Eastern Europe\\", and our media will celebrate this, and all the Trump supporters will use this as proof of what peacemakers Trump and Vance are. But it won't be long before they then start bombarding the media with reasons to be afraid of Iranians, who are trying to be \\"The Next Hitler\\" by trying to conquer the whole Middle East and that America needs to wage a major war there to protect humanity from The Iranian Hitler. Trump and Vance are eager to show how tough they are on foreign policy, and all the Trump fans will be managed by the usual Ivy League mind managers who are really good at being \\"authentic\\", and this means really \\"relatable memes\\" about how tough our 2 executive branch leaders are against The Iranian Hitler.Of course, Trump and Vance are going to have to skyrocket the national debt to fund the whole thing. They also want to go to war with China over Taiwan. The Chinese have already said they're certain they're going to war with the U.S. over Taiwan, and have been working the past year or more, re-configuring their whole society for a war with the United States. That's what all the talk in the economic news is about China having economic problems. It's not really suffering due to communism like they say, but re-configuring for domestic production instead of exports to the United States, as they knew the U.S. would eventually block trade with China in anticipation of the war over Taiwan.With these wars that the Trump admin is required to wage, this means massive control over the media and social media. Trump in his first administration already told us about \\"Chinagate\\" and how the Chinese are manipulating our public discourse, spreading fake news, and that Trump's fans need to be policing the Interent to crush any dissenting views regarding his wars, on Reddit, X, and everywhere else.Plus Trump and Vance inform us that Iran is also meddling in our Internet discourse, so you all need to be ganging up on and pummel out of existence anyone who seems to talk like Americans on the Internet but is too critical of Trump's war politices.Sorry to burst your bubble, but this next Trump admin is just more of the same, but worse because the U.S. capitalist establishment always prefers Republicans, and now it has everything it wants, which means the capitalists are going onto the offensive BIG TIME!This is what's coming. I know it. It's going to start out about a happy peace with Ukraine and Russia, then descend into right wing capitalist madness, as always.

Before today and before looking into readily available public data, I didn't have any idea the extent to which these communities have faced continued and increasing suffering. They're totally left out of the national discussion or written off as idiots. There needs to be an agricultural revolution and a change in how we, as a society, look at rural living as a whole. Food, its supply and distribution, will become ever more important as viable farm land erodes or is contaminated and multi-generational trades dry up.I do not feel like Trump will give them the win they're hoping for, as giant corporations unleashed will stamp out the competition in their extended communties while left unchecked.

These acts are insurrection against the Constitution according to a plain reading of both Amendment XIV of the Constitution and of the words of the people who **wrote** the damn thing, and they are also insurrection and sedition according to the United States Code paragraphs 2383 and 2384.  No presidential candidate has committed actions even remotely resembling this since a very similar set of events took place in the 1860 presidential election.Yet, given all that, Trump was not disqualified from holding office as Amendment XIV requires.So, no, the Constitution does not protect us because our legal and political systems betrayed their responsibilities to the highest law of this nation and to us, the citizens.Your exhortation to stop \\"misusing words\\" is going to fall on deaf ears when you can't cope and contend with basic reality as I laid out above.EDIT: fixed wording","title":"Obamas congratulate Trump, urge good faith and grace"},{"text":"It wasnt the party, it was the voters.","title":"If you didn't vote, or voted 3rd party, in protest - IT DIDN'T WORK.

If your extended family is from a ranch or a small town in Mexico, the above from OP is all true. If you're from a big city, it's not like that in my view. We're from Leon, my parents were hardcore PAN people for economic opportunity but turned very liberal once they immigrated to the US. We were actively pushed to pursue an education, further ourselves ahead and actively pushed out of the house to experience the world because that's what they were told to do in order to survive and experienceda life themselves.My dad was youngest of 13 and my mom was 2nd oldest of 12. They abhorred the traditional \\"family values\\" they were told they had to conform to so they just came here in their 20s. We laugh because my dad is probably the biggest feminist we know and my mom is the biggest misogynist we know. My dad says everybody is equal in our household so we all learned to do everything (including cooking) and my mom says women are useless and to not take care of one so we shouldn't have to rely on one to survive (her brothers are useless because she was their caretaker growing up) so she taught us how to cook and clean. I fight a lot with my wife's family because they're from a small inbred ranch (literally) that even in 2024 doesn't have paved roads or central plumbing. My wife and her sister are the first women in their entire city to work. And my mother in law still thinks my wife shouldn't be working (despite my wife easily making $80-100/hr) because \\"it's not right.\\" I grew up watching all the women around me working and holding down a household (with my dad's help) so it's what I expected out of my partner too. Like to me, taking care of someone who isn't a kid is a non starter, just never an option because that's not how I was raised. So even from my experience, a lot of conversations I have with people my age (30s) in our surroundings, it's fucking wild that people still want that \\"traditional lifestyle\\" and yearn for it in a word with so much freedom to do stuff. But then I talk to people and their parents are either from places like Monterey, DF, Guadalajara, Leon, Juarez, Tijuas instead of out in the boonies of rural ranch areas in northern or southern Mexico.","title":"Mexican-American on the Latino Shift"},{"text":" invited him to chat at the WhitehouseBiden has the chance to do the funniest thing ever.","title":"Special Counsel Jack Smith taking steps to wind down federal cases against Trump"},{"text":"Is it not possible that there are more leftists that use Reddit?","title":"Reddit is now proven to be a propaganda machine."},{"text":"Why does Trump get a pass on Big Money Interests?He's backed by Musk, Thiel, Koch, Murdoch &amp; Fox, et al, and did nothing in his first term that didn't advance their interests.","title":"Sanders Slams 'Big Money Interests' and Consultants That Control Democratic Party After Loss to Trump | Common Dreams"},{"text":"No kidding.

In my googling comparison of UK and US law, there does appear to be a court mechanism by which a person can disestablish parental responsibility. Or the child can be formally adopted and that would also end the parent child relationship.But regardless, the guiding principle for the court and for the state is what's in the best interest of the child. That's why gender equality by both parents is important because each person's ultimate amount of personal liberty is going to be impaired by the rights of the child AND the rights of the state as well. It's because life is also pragmatic - there's no \\"solution\\" that would make a decent society that you could propose. What? Have tons of abandoned children that the state has to provide for? Or allow a man/the state to force an abortion? I think the lines drawn by both the UK and the US are where they need to be.

Two of those states also voted to elect the Republican nominee. He led in two others  Arizona and Nevada  as of Wednesday afternoon.Democrats leaned heavily on abortion rights in hopes the issue would drum up enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris, especially in key battleground states like Arizona. The vote tally and Trumps ultimate victory indicates that efforts to pin the fall of Roe v.

He tried to open a new major American base in Poland, as well as moving up America's anti-ballistic missile systems into Poland (which I remember the media freaking out over and saying he was sabre rattling and threatening to start a nuclear war by doing). He berated the Europeans for being hypocrites by getting oil and gas from Russia even though they were treating them as enemies, and the Euros responded by laughing in his face. He pursued the same \\"Peace Through Strength\\" policies that Reagan had against our enemies then, keeping wars quick and contained (see: Panama and Grenada for Reagan, the war against ISIS for Trump). And around the world, he brought about peace accords and gained new American allies, especially in Asia.He opened up American arms manufacturing to allow the world to arm and defend themselves while making a profit on it.Jen Stoltenberg (the now outgoing NATO chief) has defended Trump and said he doesnt think Trump is anti-NATO.While some of the Western Europeans may posture about how they dont trust Trump, when they actually have to put up they show that they still expect America to uphold its security agreements.

In Europe, most countries practice salt or milk fluoridation, which is just as effective at preventing cavities (40-60%). In other European countries they use topical applications like fluoride gel and fluoride varnishes, in addition to having free and regular dental care in schools. Poor countries on the other hand tend to make due with poor dental health. Fluoridated toothpaste does mitigate cavities to some degree, but is not as effective as fluoridated water, milk or salt (at 25%). And its use is heavily dependent on individual and family behaviors. It also works best if you don't rinse your teeth for at least 30 minutes after brushing. Fluoridation of water isn't actually that expensive. It costs about $1.32 per person per year (CDC \\"Recommendations for using fluoride...\\" 2007). It's actually a very cost-effective solution for improving dental health. Frankly, removing fluoride from our water doesn't make sense. You have to get the fluoride some way, either from water, salt, milk, gels or toothpaste... putting it in the water just makes it easier and more affordable.

When the future of her political career was put into the hands of the American people, however, we saw there was only so far up she could go. Kamala Harris has had quite an accomplished career in law. I won't denigrate that at all. If I had that kind of career, I would be very proud of it. When it comes to her political career, however, she hasn't done well as a candidate.Democrats should have been honest with themselves and with the American people about Joe Biden's inability to run for and complete a second term as president. They should have held primaries and selected a competitive presidential nominee. If they had, they very well might've won this election. For whatever reason, they didn't.
