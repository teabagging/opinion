America First. That tight little patriotic sounding populist slogan was both a dont get involved in the war rallying cry and a good profile boosting vehicle for members of Congress who for whatever reason were opposed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was just an electoral juggernaut at the time.The Justice Department had failed to convict the members of the Christian Front who tried to overthrow the government. They had failed to act on advance warning of explosions at American munitions plants, planned as sabotage. Private activist groups operating outside law enforcement were tracing stolen U.S. military weapons and complex, violent plots involving homegrown violent fascists with help and financing from Berlin. Amateurs were turning this stuff up, not the authorities.William Maloney was an experienced federal prosecutor. Hed spent years at the U.S. Attorneys office in the Southern District of New York handling high-profile federal cases of fraud and corruption. William Maloney had managed to run up an eye-popping, 400-to-nothing record as a prosecutor there. Hed never lost a case.In reality, a number of the most high-profile America First members of Congress were in cahoots with a paid agent of the Hitler government who was supplying them with propaganda intended not just to keep the U.S. out of World War II, but also to divide Americans along political lines, racial lines, religious lines, class lines, all in the interest of national demoralization. George Viereck and the Nazi government were using the America First movement and America First members of Congress for those ends.Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, a leader of the America First Committee, has threatened to demand a Congressional investigation of the way the Justice Department has been handling the prosecution of Nazi sympathizers.This is a moment of great political danger, for these men.Wheeler used his position as a sitting member of the United States Senate to lobby the Justice Department to fire Maloney.

Caesar was forced to march on Rome because the conservatives were wrecking the constitution simply out of spite and to take vengeance on him. Pompey's sole consulship was a travesty of Roman Law. As was the blatantly partisan attempt to pin any charges they could think off on Caesar to deny him the right to stand for election which everyone knew they would win. The people who broke the Roman Republic were the likes of Cato and Cicero.and after him was a brutal civil war, Yes. One that Caesar was *incredibly* restrained in. The brutality tended to come from his opponents. And later his successors. Caesar was constantly granting clemency to his opponents. And his actions both before and after the Rubicon speak to someone who was a lot more constitutionalist than his opponents had ever been. During his first consular election he chose to give up his own triumph in favor of abiding by Rome's laws. This wasn't a dude who was trying to tear the system down. He was forced to do it by his opponents who hollowed the system out and weaponized it against him and the people. Not very differently from what the Republicans are doing. It is what conservatives have *always* done. They use the law, but only to bind their opponents and ordinary folks. They hold themselves above it. which lead to the Empire.  Augustus and Antony created Empire. After Caesar was assassinated by the very people he spared and returned to the Senate in dignity. That's why I call Trump Julius as opposed to Augustus - he plays at being popular, but his grasping at ever-more-power will have ramifications we can't conceive of yet.And that's my point. Caesar did not play at popularity. He was popular. And it was because he looked out for regular people. Caesar was forced into action by a bunch of corrupt conservatives who were the ones who made a mockery of the justice system and weaponized the institutions of the republic against him and regular Romans.They were aided in this by Pompey, who was also popular, but who leveraged his popularity to cater to the interests of the moneyed elite. Pompey was a convenient puppet, who did whatever the corrupt, conservative elite wanted because his ego was injured.

Slightly longer answer: Its not just the top positions that transition, but also all politically appointed leadership and staff, and those people need to be vetted and interviewed and trained, and all of that requires people doing work, which means they need to get paid from somewhere. It also requires the exchange of sensitive and classified information, so there are ethics agreements and background checks as safeguards so that info doesnt get into the wrong hands. Usually this is funded by the federal government and special transition campaign accounts that have mandatory reporting on who donated, how much, etc. It also includes ethics agreements for paid and unpaid staff to prevent conflicts of interest, corruption, self-dealing, etc. So what Trump is doing is skirting all of that to hide who is paying for all of this and what conflicts exist within his team, whether theyre financial conflicts or foreign influence.

He was militarily good, but I actually don't think he was a genius. Caesar, Lucullus, arguably even Agrippa were more competent than him IMO. The only real victory Pompey had that was entirely his was campaign against the Pirates. In most other situations he either picked up from where others had left off (as in Greece where Lucullus had done a fair bit of damage to Mithradates already, and whom Sulla had trounced before) or he made things worse before he had help in fixing stuff (as in Spain, where Sertorius whupped him before worked with Metellus Pius). And in atleast one case he just straight up stole credit, when he claimed he defeated Spartacus after Crassus crushed the revolt.Besides the kid was calling himself Magnus after having done very little. His other nickname at the time \\"child butcher\\" was probably more appropriate. He was definitely all ego. And a puppet to conservative interests in his dotage. Which is why the comparison to Trump is apt.Caesar was a lot of things, but his credentials on trying to do right by the people of Rome were inarguable. Even before his dictatorship, his laws tended to be relatively balanced. Yes he favored his allies. But he also passed laws that were good for ordinary Romans. And then there were things like his calendar reforms which are arguably just plain reforms that Rome badly needed. Trump and the Cons come nowhere close to the sort of good Caesar was trying to do. Their analogue is the Optimates, who were interested *only* in the interests of the wealthy aristocrats. Nothing else.

Trump appointed a bunch of them during his time in office.I assume you also want Hunter Biden's investigations to be tossed, those were derived from a special counsel, yeah?It was not explicitly rejected by the court, that's why he has immunity. The carve outs for non-official acts was to limit the ruling, but it still leaves it as an open question for the courts.(c) Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one the Court recognizes, contending that the indictment must be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a Presidents criminal prosecution. But the text of the Clause does not address whether and on what conduct a President may be prosecuted if he was never impeached and convicted. See Art. I, 3, cl. 7. Historical evidence likewise lends little support to Trumps position. The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies concerned the checks available against a sitting President; they did not endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a former President from prosecution. Transforming the political process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of the Nations GovernmentThat is from page 7 of trump v United States.

Other consumers might not see a change in their demand, but will simply shift it between domestic and foreign goods based on the relative price differences","title":"Huge relief. CEOs exhale after Trump taps Scott Bessent to lead Treasury | CNN Business"},{"text":"You don't understand how the DOJ works, how the OLC works, or what Special Prosecutors are.The DOJ has rules. It has an Office of Legal Counsel which provides opinions that set those rules. OLC opinions are binding. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Legal_Counsel OLC's written opinions have historically been considered binding on the executive branch, unless they are overturned by the attorney general or president.The only people who can overrule those opinions are the president or the AG. That will be Trump and whoever ends up being confirmed.Special Prosecutors are not independent. 28 CFR 600 is the latest version of the law that governs Special Prosecutors. https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-VI/part-600 A Special Counsel shall comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice. He or she shall consult with appropriate offices within the Department for guidance with respect to established practices, policies and procedures of the Department, including ethics and security regulations and procedures. Should the Special Counsel conclude that the extraordinary circumstances of any particular decision would render compliance with required review and approval procedures by the designated Departmental component inappropriate, he or she may consult directly with the Attorney General.The law is very clear. The Special Prosecutor must follow the rules as the DOJ makes them. And the only escape clause is the AG.Jack Smith cannot just decide not to leave. The OLC says that the DOJ cannot prosecute a sitting president. He can't ignore the rules and then wait to be fired. Unless Biden or Garland overrule that rule, Jack Smith must follow the rules that he should not be setting up a lawsuit against a president.Biden and Garland have been dragging their feet on this for 4 years. They could have prosecuted Trump 3 years ago. Don't blame Jack Smith. He needs to follow the rules.

And the things they advocated for are often moved past; what matters more (fitting the post) were the *vibes* they brought, of disgruntled and angry folk.     \\nThe same people who tend to worship the vibes?   \\nMight not necessarily share the *goals* or *actions* that you, I, *or the candidates embracing a more masculine-coded campaign* might.     \\nThey are just as likely to support an Avenatti with no fixed principles or morals in common because he seems 'tough' and 'masc,' over someone -  \\nLike Randy Bryce, who has and had plans and goals in mind.So, you can end up having candidates who lose, not because they were bad candidates; sometimes, you *just lose.*   \\nNo matter how good you are as a person, no matter your campaign, no matter your persona and demeanour.   \\nYou are left alone, people abandon you quickly, and they move on to the next outsider because the 'problem,' the 'one quick fix' -  \\nWas that we didn't run a masculine-coded enough candidate, not yet.Naturally, there are no quick fixes, and I cannot repeat this enough -  \\nMy electoral life is littered with the bones of these kinds of candidates.    \\nQuite a few of whom I've supported and done volunteering for, but who failed to match what a more conventional candidate would or did.    Which doesn't reflect on them, but is often forgotten in the drive to find an easy way to win.There's more, too; a lot more.   \\nAll of which takes time to explain, and unfortunately that's part of the problem.    \\nI can't condense any of this; you can't either, most likely.   \\nSaying 'assuming that candidates running on punchy machismo do better ignores results and harms both them and other people in our camp' is one thing; explaining how our voters don't even respond the same way to the same messaging is another.   Pointing out how in areas where we - just recently - campaigned did much better, nobody wants to hear that after a defeat.   \\nBut I have always felt leadership doesn't begin when you win, or even when you have to face a loss.   \\nIt's when you've put everything you have into campaigns, and understand that sometimes that *isn't enough,* but that you have to move on.Anyway, could go on about this for way too long.1\\\\. Antoninus Pious - haha, alright, sorry, thought a bit of light-heartedness was in order...   \\nBarack Obama is a great example of someone who alternated between what we'd gender as masculine and feminine traits in his speaking.   \\nHe is, and remains, one of the best orators we have - and we have a lot of amazing speakers.   \\nBut he's also a great example, because you can clearly see by following his political trajectory where our voters, and swing voters didn't respond well to one or both approach.   Needing to offload 'angry' and 'masculine' rhetoric on Joe, because it would be perceived 'worse' coming from a man like Barack Obama - \\nIs entirely it's own Table Talk, most like.  \\nAnd when Obama was speaking neutrally, a lot of critics used that to try to weaken and demean not only him, but the party.  Some of us may remember how the media, always our steadfast friends, referred to his visits abroad as an 'apology tour.'2\\\\. Repeating what I said above, I think the problem is that voters often don't know what vibes voters go for.  \\nThe energy Kamala raised was genuine; it is very difficult if not possible to fake that level of enthusiasm.  \\nBut statistically speaking, a decent chunk of the voters present at events either stayed at home or switched sides.   \\nEven if it's only one-in-one-hundred, that's one person in every hundred who felt deeply in tune with the vibes, and then was convinced by -  Well, in Romania just recently, the more monstrous presidential primary winner basically ran on being an anti-candidate.  \\nEverything's bad, you have the right to do whatever, hurt whomever. \\nMany human beings can swap from positions of care, or thoughtful aggression towards the right causes, to absolute madness and cruelty.  Disassociating our portion of those people from the worst of these excesses is going to be hard. Something I think that's on all of our minds.3\\\\.

I will have to digest it (so to speak) and then come back for some more observations beyond what is flying off the top of my head now.But one thing I want to point out right away is that this desire for Male Coded traits is what leads some Democrats to want celebrity candidates like Jon Stewart (or, for that matter, remember when a thankfully few people wanted Michael Avenatti to run for POTUS?). They harken back to the glory days of Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson having control of a compliant Congress. All these men had to do was Use The Bully Pulpit and voila! Congress obeys, laws are passed! Somehow people forget all about Eleanor Roosevelt, and how she was both against the internment of Japanese Americans in WWII (apparently that was one of the final nails in the coffin of the Roosevelt marriage), FDR felt that Eleanor was going to antagonize the Dixiecrats he needed to pass the New Deal with her annoying insistence that Lynching Black People Is Bad Mmmkay and telling the Senators to do something about it. (Eleanor Roosevelt was so far ahead of her time she had windburn.)In addition to the coding (Ill return to it when Ive formulated my thoughts better) it helps to have a coalition. Or to be able to work across the aisle. For various reasons - mostly the demise of the Dixiecrat, a good thing, and the disappearance of earmarks, which was legislated with all good intentions but backfired spectacularly - we dont have those kind of coalitions that used to be able to get work done.

The reality is that, while Trump and other republicans did win the popular votes, the American people are still very divided. Of course the election is still a crushing blow to the Dems and should signal some serious rebranding by appealing more to the moderate voter by dropping loser issues (LGBT, open borders, gun control). Youd have to be legitimately insane to not think that. If the Dems pull their act together and actually give an ounce of effort, they would completely dominate the Republican competition.The fact that the election is so painfully close despite running a loser candidate with a loser platform against a populist candidate like Trump should signal that the nation has NOT turned red.

Himes stating the polls showed Trump beating Biden and therefore he supported Biden stepping down.  \\n  The problem I think is the same the Union army had at the beginning of the Civil War. The Union army was defeated multiple times because the generals were old, cautious and incompetent. It was a process of getting out those generals that took approximately two years. At the beginning of the war, Ulysses Grant, Phil Sheridan, George Thomas, William T. Sheridan and others were working their way through the ranks. It took Grant to take in leadership position to come up with a winning strategy. Grants strategy was not to retreat. After Grant lost the Battle of the Wilderness, the Union Army would not retreat back to Washington D.C.  Grants strategy took some time but he did not retreat. \\n   The Democrats need to get out the old leaders and stop retreating after losing elections. Get the messaging right to get their voters to the polls and stop retreating on progressive policies to get white suburban women voters.","title":"MLK Jr.s daughter: Americans should not retreat or recoil after Trump win"},{"text":"real take: I doubt the people that backed trump and his policies are the ones that filing grievance over the shortage of unregulated labor.This post should be tagged *\`meme\`*, were it not for the AP source.","title":"US farm groups want Trump to spare their workers from deportation"},{"text":"No justice, no peace.","title":"Special counsel moves to dismiss election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump"},{"text":"Discontinue the lithium","title":"Do you question the timing of raw milk being found to have traces of H5N1 bird flu in California on the week Trump nominates him?"},{"text":"Are you talking about Hunters laptop?","title":"Judge dismisses federal election interference case against President-elect Trump"},{"text":"Rev up those deporters!","title":"DEMOCRACY: 73% of Americans think Trump should make mass deportation a priority of his administration; majority believe ALL illegal immigrants should be deported"},{"text":"I dont know where youre getting Im pro cheating elections when that hasnt been mentioned.

People routinely overestimate their ability to do so, but doing it properly is hard.Yes they are, but you've got an uphill battle if you're trying to say that it's not the modern left wing that's more prone to logical fallacies.Here's a perfect example that I still see spouted today: \\"Trump mocked a disabled person\\"In reality, Trump had been making the hand motion he used to mock many people, most of whom were not disabled, and he was unaware that the person he was mocking was disabled, because he'd only read their writing, never seen them on video. Once this incident happened, he stopped mocking people with that hand motion altogether. It is indisputable that Trump did not *knowingly* mock a disabled person for being disabled, but try and tell a left wing person this, and they will completely flip out and become illogical.Political dogwhistles are, by design, difficult to spot.You mean like the \\"OK\\" hand symbol being a dog whistle for white supremacists? \\"Dog whistles\\" are about as difficult to spot as shadow people, because they're both a hallucination. If you want to see them you will. It does not require a \\"special skill\\" to spot \\"dog whistles\\", it takes political bias. Codes used by criminal organizations can mean very dangerous things but look innocent enough in some contexts.You mean like the pedophile symbol being all over Comet Ping Pong?Manipulation tactics used by abusers require years of training to spot well, and are especially hard to spot for the very victims.Another argument that can be used against the left wing, who act like white knights to illegal immigrants, when really what they're defending is essentially slave labor.

I was talking to the PMC/MSNBC crowd the other day and this topic came up. They were bragging on how with Bluesky they could control what they heard by blocking anything they didnt want to hear. Its all about controlling what they hear, see, and read. That is anti-science and anti-truth IMO, and thats not good.\\n \\n I finally heard enough, and made a huge mistake. I told them by going to a platform (or whatever) is like the digital equivalent of stuffing you head up your rear end. Oh boy, that didnt go over well. I asked why not take the information we have (no matter where it comes from or what it is C science or whatever) and throw it on the table and have an adult conversation about this in the search for the truth.Those are clearly better arguments than what liberals are offering. That person critical of liberals for their echo chamber is clearly offering a better argument. Whether you want to pretend otherwise is another matter. How could anyone objective see the liberal as having the better argument in the above passage, when the liberal sees the ability to not see Opposing points of view as good? Donald Trump supporters are some of the dumbest motherfuckers in the nation.You can't expect to treat people with contempt and expect their support. You can't say \\"I have your best interests at heart, but I think your are an idiot\\". There were perfectly valid reasons to go for Trump. Let me give an example:https://lesleopold.substack.com/p/the-revenge-of-the-deplorables For me, the symbolic turning point was the Harris campaigns pathetic response to the John Deere companys announcement about shipping 1,000 jobs from the Midwest to Mexico.  Trump jumped on it right away, saying that if Deere made that move he would slap a 200-percent tariff on all its imports from Mexico. If I were a soon-to-be-replaced Deere worker, that would have gotten my attention.\\n \\n The Harris campaign responded as well, but not in a way that would convince workers that she really cared about their jobs. The campaign sent billionaire Mark Cuban to the press to claim such a tariff would be insanity.   He and the campaign said not one word about the jobs that would soon be lost. Trump promised to intervene. Harris promised nothing.\\n \\n The sad part is that the Biden-Harris campaign could have at least tried. They had the power of the entire federal government. They could have cajoled and bullied, waved carrots and sticks. In short, they could have easily made a visible public effort to prevent the export of those good-paying jobs by a highly profitable corporation that was spending billions of dollars on stock buybacks to enrich Wall Street and its CEO.  Here was a chance to defend jobs against overt greed.  Instead, they essentially told working people that Harris wasnt willing to fight for those jobs.Do you have any idea how devastating being laid off is in a rural community where there are limited job opportunities? Trump, whatever his other flaws, at least pretended to care about those workers. Kamala couldn't even be bothered to do that.Also, food for thought - in your ideal platform, would this type of critique of Biden and Harris even be allowed?

They can believe it's murder, and believe controlling women's bodies is a way to prevent murder. Whether they acknowledge it or not, that is what they're requesting when they sign a law that limits a woman's ability to choose. They don't have to say it out loud for it to be true. And maybe they aren't sneering at women and wholeheartedly believe they are just preventing murder, but...That also doesn't stop them from being part of the same political block that says 'your body, my choice' to women. They vote on the same exact ballot lines, granted for different reasons, but to the same detriment. So framing it as an attack against women's autonomy is completely valid, because it is that.This is why being overly literal about arguments and rhetoric is not exactly helpful. You're trying to stick to the soundbite, but the implications and the practical applications of that rhetoric will always be different than the rhetoric itself...You have people that believe abortion is murder voting for politicians who lean more to the 'your body, my choice' crowd, because that's what political expedience looks like in America. They legislate towards anti-abortion laws, but also investigations and possible imprisonment of women who are ill and would medically need an abortion to survive, towards women who miscarry while unsupervised, towards children who get pregnant including those who would have a medically unsafe labor due to age, towards victims of rape who end up pregnant, etc. You get more medical investigations carried out at the hands of the state invading the lives of women. In some places, you can now call in that any woman is a threat to a fetus and that person will be investigated and possibly arrested.All the anti-abortion folks who claimed they weren't anti-women voted for the above results without consideration to these possible outcomes. All of those things I mentioned have actually happened. It would be intellectually dishonest to sweep that under the rug.","title":"CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric."},{"text":"You forgot foreign powers.","title":"Elizabeth Warren Warns That Trumps Transition Threatens the American Public: And as the New York Times reports, we dont know whos funding the transition team."},{"text":"While this is true, a more generous assessment is that the messaging should be catered too the intellectual level of the people it is directed too.\\nUnfortunately, for the average American intellectual level, the easiest message to digest is \\"Mexicans bad, \\"strong\\"man good\\".

I hate to say it but laying low and getting  democrats back in control of congress and the White House to over turn the bans and get some strengthening legislation seems more likely than get a favorable ruling in the SCOTUS. I know its not nearly as big a deal as getting kicked out of the military, but my state Ohio just did a trans bathroom ban in any public institutions of higher learning. I live in a liberal College town, and I was hanging out with some trans friends they were the ones that thought of it. They said, its awful but the college administration wont enforce it and the college and town in general is supportive. Right now if we really fought this where does it go, to the Ohio Supreme Court which is a republican biased court, loose then appeal and end up at the US Supreme Court, we will almost certainly loose there too. Then have we made it way more difficult for every state that wins back seats in midterms a chance to remove a law or make a law to prevent a ban, and giving everyone precedence for their own measures. I was kinda surprised because these two were front and center protesting and organized on every LGBTQ issues through college and years after.

I propose that people don't care much about policy.  Or experience.  Or the candidate's life story - in and of itself, anyway.  Or even their character.  My source for all this is Donald Trump being elected twice, but we can all think of other examples.  So, what do the people crave?*Vibes.*A vibe is *\\"a distinctive feeling or quality capable of being sensed.\\"* (Yes, it's in the dictionary now).  And voters, they can sense the kind of leader they want!  Just look at any video of a Democrat making a stirring speech, and I promise you'll see at least one '[this Dem] for President!' comment.  But most of those commenters couldn't tell you one fact about that Dem.  It's all vibes.  They like the feeling they get from that person.So vibes are pretty important.  But they can be a vector for anti-woman bias. And this will be an uncomfortable one because I'm not just ragging on the dipshits in the GOP.  On the subject of vibes, we've got to take a good look at ourselves.**Good vibes only?  Well...**So, what are the vibes voters want?  People will give all sorts of answers to this question - but, as with most things, you get the best answers when you're not directly asking the question.  How many times have you seen quotes or article titles similar to these real examples?* \\"Democrats have tied both hands behind their backs in the sake of bipartisanship, but Republicans have just used the chance to stab them in the gut while Democrats look on shocked. Instead of looking like fighters fighting the good fight, Democrats looks incompetent, weak, and like it is just a performance. Ive seen the Dems capitulate, go high, try to do the right thing, etc and just get kicked in the teeth\\"Wow, that's a lot of violent metaphors for politics, which is generally a non-contact sport.* \\"Ocasio-Cortez DESTROYS Meghan McCain live on air, gets huge ovation\\"There are lots of videos like this - AOC is a fixture of them, but so are lots of other Dems.* \\"How Democrats Fought Dirty and Won. They finally campaigned like Republicans.\\"  Actually, just Google \\"Democrats need to fight\\" or \\"Democrats need to fight dirty\\" and look at the results.  Note the general tone and the metaphors used.* 'Avenatti insisted on tough tactics, telling the cheering audience: I believe that our party, the Democratic party, must be a party that fights fire with fire and warned that for too long the party has had a tendency to bring nail clippers to a gunfight.'Astute observers will note that the quote is usually 'bring a knife to a gun fight', and ask what Mr. Avenatti meant by 'nail clippers'.  More astute observers will note that the crowd, presumably Democrats, was cheering at this.I could go on, but a quick way to get lots of praise is to demand a leader who will FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT, throw out the rules, and figuratively (I hope) murder the opposition.  But the people do *not* want someone who's timid, gentle, reaches out, and uses nail clippers.Let's dig a bit deeper.**Cracking the code**The words people use when talking politics aren't accidental.  They reveal what we value in our leaders.  To understand this, you need to understand gender-coded language.[Gender coding](https://www.simplypsychology.org/gender-codes.html) is the idea that certain traits and behaviors are viewed as male or female.  For example, being strong, tough, and decisive are generally male-coded traits, while being kind, inclusive, and thoughtful are generally female-coded traits.  Yes, it's based on stereotypes.  But stereotypes are extremely powerful, and even if they're bullshit, they heavily influence our thoughts.Those descriptions that get the people excited - fight fire with fire, kick 'em in the teeth, don't play by the rules, and destroy the opposition?  Male-coded as hell.Those descriptions the people hate - timid, passive, going high (when they go low)?  Female-coded as hell.\\"But wait, didn't you give an example of AOC DESTROYING someone?\\"  Yes, but it's not the gender of the person that matters here.  It's the gender they're coded with.  A woman can do male-coded actions and win accolades (sometimes, it's complicated, and it doesn't go so well if she DESTROYS a man with status in the system).  But men who exhibit female-coded traits?  Yeah, that's a one-way ticket to losing the respect of others, especially in politics.The point is: **often times, \\"vibes\\" is just another way of saying \\"male-coded behaviors\\".** Voters want someone who'll act like a MAN, and destroy the enemy in a MANLY way.  And we all know that this was basically the whole point of Trump for the GOP...but guys, all those examples I gave earlier were from people on our side.  We've got to talk about this.**So what?  What's wrong with male-coded behavior?**By itself, nothing.  It's important sometimes.  But if it's the only way you do politics, you're going to fail, and you're going to get to some ugly places.Think of your average political comment section.  When a Republican government passes a terrible law, what's the response? *\\"Why don't Democrats do something?  Why won't they just get tough?\\"*  Well, because getting tough doesn't stop a law when you don't have the votes, and you know it.  You can scream at and insult Ron DeSantis all you like, but it doesn't change the political process.  You can make a hundred big speeches, but it won't stop the process.  You can ignore the rules...until the courts smack you down and the bad things happen anyway, with you looking even dumber.  Same when Dems want to pass a law - you can't just grab a holdout and scream in his face until he votes the right way.  Adult relationships don't work like that.  But sometimes, a true warrior has a better way.  As long as you're the biggest, toughest badass on Capitol Hill.  And I'm not talking about the big, bald, bearded dude from Steeltown, or the former linebacker from Dallas.  [I'm talking about the five-foot-four old lady from San Francisco.](https://time.com/5832330/nancy-pelosi-obamacare/)I know, it's a long article, but if you want to see how to blend male-coded and female-coded leadership, Nancy Pelosi is the master.  She knew when to negotiate, when to compromise, when to empathize, and when to say \\"cut the bullshit\\".  And she's the reason half of you have health insurance today.  She convinced a lot of Democrats to sacrifice their careers for this bill.  In other words, she accomplished what a thousand tough-talking speeches and well-placed burns never could.**So what do we do?**Again, male-coded traits aren't bad in and of themselves.  But when we only value them, and discount female-coded traits, we cause a lot of damage.We ignore people who'd be strong candidates and leaders.  We alienate the growing number of voters who don't like the hypermasculinity of so many political spaces.  And we shut out the people who actually get things done.  If you volunteer, you know what I mean - try and remember the last phonebank you did that wasn't at least 50% women over the age of 60.  Not a lot of DESTROYING going on in those phonebanks, but you should thank them for those election wins you enjoy seeing every Tuesday night.Take some time to think about this.  Do you think male-coded traits are better?  If so, be honest with yourself.  You can't just turn it off.  But you can notice yourself making those judgments, and question them.  And from there, they get less powerful.  And then you can gain more respect for more people, and be a part of a movement that includes everyone.  Then we can win the gunfight, whether it's with fire or nail clippers.  (I don't know what that means, either, but I like the vibe of it!)**Questions to consider**1. Think of a leader you really admire.  How did they use male-coded and female-coded traits in their leadership?2. Are there any other 'vibes' that voters seem to go for?  Do you think these are male- or female-coded traits?3. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 25, 2024"},{"text":"I wouldnt classify him as evangelical.But hes right","title":"A prominent evangelical leader says Trumps victory means theres a deep moral problem in America"},{"text":"But she said it in New York.

Sure, that *one* Trump comment you mention about Catholics was widely exaggerated or misinterpreted by Democrats - along with several other notable examples. I don't think there's evidence that Trump is deliberately planning to make himself a dictator or end all elections, for example.  But it's not an exaggeration to suggest that Trump is a serious threat to democracy. He really has been promising to be \\"your retribution\\". He really has tried to prosecute his political opponents. He really did try to nominate as attorney general of the United States a man who probably paid for sex with an underage girl, whose central qualification was loyalty to Trump. Etc.Perhaps what you're saying is just that we should focus on the things Trump really did, as there's no *need* to exaggerate - if so, I agree 100%. But I think Democrats have *mostly* been doing that. E.g., I think that the focus on Project 2025 was warranted, despite Trump's disavowals of it - not because Trump was the mastermind of Project 2025 (Trump isn't a policy wonk), but because it was very clear (and still is clear) that Project 2025 outlines the sort of thing that Trump will do as president, and that the people around him are trying to make happen.","title":"CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric."},{"text":"Except they are not giving money to Ukraine.They are giving weapons to Ukraine - they pay their Military Industrial Complex Billionnaire ~~oligarchs~~ mates to produce more weapons, and the older weapons are sent to Ukraine and are replaced by the new ones.(not 100% but the majority of funds)Supporting Ukraine is seen as altruistic, but is implemented in a manner designed to transfer money from the working class to the billionnaires.","title":"Republicans in a nutshell"},{"text":"It has been since 2006!","title":"'The View' is now a pointless, irrelevant Trump-loathing joke"},{"text":"Remember how private business and Republicans fought so hard to break up unions in order to switch from pensions to 401ks?This is the endgame of that.","title":"Dollar falls after Donald Trump names Scott Bessent to Treasury role"},{"text":"I dont get it either.

What they do is change the relative prices of goods. When tariffs are imposed, the cost of imported goods rises, which can lead to higher prices for those specific goods and potentially for related products. However, not all prices in the economy are affecteddomestically produced goods, for example, may not see any direct price increase. As a result, tariffs dont necessarily cause inflation in the broader sense, because they dont push up the baseline of all prices across the economy.That said, tariffs do have clear, negative economic consequences. By raising the cost of imports, they reduce consumers purchasing power, making them effectively poorer. They also limit the variety of goods available, reducing consumer choice. So while tariffs may not cause inflation in the strict sense, they do lead to higher costs for certain goods and a less efficient, less dynamic economy.","title":"Huge relief.

They're not making a grammatical argument.   Even if the argument doesn't make sense, people need to understand what they're trying to say. The people who express this idea generally believe (or at least assert) that Israel  and/or the Jewish people have a god given right to possess \\"the holy land,\\"  or the land that was previously occupied by the historical first kingdom of Israel circa 1000 BCE.    So, in the 1940's, when the modern nation state of Israel was created out of the British Mandate in Palestine. The question was raised,  what happens to the current, mostly Arab, inhabitants of that land?   The people who call themselves Palestinians.  Some people hand-wave away the problem by defining those people out of existence. They say \\"oh,  there's no such thing as Palestinians, those are Jordanians, and Syrians and Egyptians and Lebanese etc. because they are all peoples who moved there 'recently.\\"     Therefore, in their minds there is little problem with saying that those people should simply be able to return to those countries.  Putting it in an entirely different context. It is not dissimilar from someone saying \\"there is no such thing as an American.\\"   That America consists of English, and German and Irish and Scandinavian, and Eastern European and Chinese and Mexican peoples.   The problem here, if it's not obvious, is that it doesn't work like this. If your family has lived in an area for even two or three generations. (Your grandparents and parents lived here) that area is your home and being forcibly expelled from that area is a big deal.    People would have every right to oppose it.   The fact that Palestinians are not a unitary ethnic group (people that live in the Sinai Desert have different cultural practices from those who live in Jerusalem, and those are different from those who live in the Golan Heights) does not meaningfully change this.","title":"Far-Right Pundit Sebastian Gorka Returns to Trump WH, Recently Claimed Palestine Doesnt Exist"},{"text":"So there was no fake elector scheme and he never pressured Pence not to certify the election?

Most people are not Nazis. Just because someone disagrees with a liberal does not make them a Nazi. Only a small percentage of people have genuine beliefs that align with the Nazis (mostly the pro-Ukrainians and a handful of white supremacists). Again - let's go back to the original comment:Oh boy, that didnt go over well. I asked why not take the information we have (no matter where it comes from or what it is C science or whatever) and throw it on the table and have an adult conversation about this in the search for the truth.This is a person who is interested in truth. They are interested in seeing other points of view and drawing conclusions based on evidence. They are not a Nazi for doing so. What part of what they said suggests they support Nazi Germany? They were responding to a liberal who said this:I was talking to the PMC/MSNBC crowd the other day and this topic came up. They were bragging on how with Bluesky they could control what they heard by blocking anything they didnt want to hear. Its all about controlling what they hear, see, and read. That is anti-science and anti-truth IMO, and thats not good.These liberals by contrast, are not interested in truth. Describing the decline in discourse on the internet as a uniquely liberal flaw is disingenuous. On the contrary, liberals seem to be the one leading the charge right now.  It used to be that those who opposed war were \\"cancelled\\" by the conservatives (witness what happened to those in 2003 that said that Saddam didn't have weapons of mass destruction). Today it is liberals that are leading the charge on waging lawfare, and imposing censorship under the pretext of stopping \\"disinformation\\".","title":"The emergence of BlueSky is due to the liberals looking for an echo-chamber and their declining debate skills"},{"text":"They want to break up the country into fiefdoms so each can rule their own area as they see fit.

The RAND study found that allowing *gender transition* would impede readiness, limit deployability, and present the military with substantial per-service-member costs. It concluded, however, that these negatives were ultimately negligible given the small number of estimated transgender service members at the time relative to vastness of the U.S. military.

You're absolutely right. I recalled it clearly as \\"from\\", which is my error. But there might be a good reason I and others have recalled it this way. Even without saying \\"from\\", the way she has quoted him is dishonest. He did not say he would be a \\"dictator on day one\\". He referenced a question that he claims Hannity asked. The question was: \\"Youre not going to be a dictator, are you?\\"To this question, Trump responded:\\"No, no, no. Other than Day One\\"There is a stark difference between Trump's message and how Harris portrayed it. The only time Trump refers to being a dictator is when he says \\"no\\" three times and then says \\"other than day one\\", before explicating what he means by this, saying \\"were closing the border, and were drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, Im not a dictator\\".This is how Harris portrayed his comments: \\"The former president openly talks about his admiration for dictators and has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one\\"The reason I probably heard this as \\"from\\" is that she quoted \\"day one\\" to imply \\"from\\", by intentionally removing the following pieces of context:* **Time-limit:** There's no two ways about this. Trump said \\"No, no, no. Other than Day One\\". He has never implied he will be a dictator in any meaningful and enduring way and the only time he has referred to it, he has qualified it with a narrow time limitation. \\n* **Definitional statement**: After saying \\"other than day one\\", Trump said: \\"Were closing the border, and were drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, Im not a dictator.\\" This explanatory statement set bounds for what he meant by \\"dictator\\". You're right, she did correctly say \\"on day one\\". But by removing the context and paraphrasing it in a broader statement about well-known dictators, it seems clear to me she sought to imply that Trump stated he would be a dictator in the usual way, without the limits made clear in the original context. This is something in the debate that should have been fact-checked. Because, in context, the statement doesn't say what she implied it did (though, granted, it was a very, very stupid thing to say). I love Kamala, but the way she quoted this was dishonest  even if it's less nakedly dishonest than saying \\"from day one\\".","title":"CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric."},{"text":"They think there are just roving gangs of immigrant murderers and rapists that arent working and are just collecting free government money and healthcare.

It relies on people following laws because they're worried about the consequences of not following the law. However, the people in charge of enforcing those consequences are often reluctant to do so for understandable reasons.Imagine you've got a kid who keeps texting in class. The teacher tells them to stop. The kid keeps texting. The teacher tells them to hand over their phone. They refuse. The teacher tells them to go to the principal's office. They refuse. The school probably doesn't have security guards, but let's say they do: they call security and ask them to escort the kid to the principal's office. The kid doesn't go with them and keeps talking.Is the teacher going to tell the security officers to physically grab the kid and DRAG them to the principal's office just for texting on their phone? Espescially if other kids start filming it? The teacher might look insane and get a huge hate mob coming after them.Now imagine either ALL the kids are acting like this... Or the one kid that is acting like this is a celebrity or has rich and important parents that will sue the school for anything, pressure people to pull donations, etc.It's much easier for the teacher to just inform the kid that they'll tell their parents about it... And if the parents don't care nothing changes.While there are laws and systems governing the process of dealing with an unruly student in public school,  people expect students to be worried about \\"getting in trouble\\" to some extent and to follow the instructions of authority figures without having to be forcibly dragged through the school halls to the principal's office. Once people stop complying in situations where the stakes seem kind of minor, enforcing the laws we have starts to feel \\"extreme\\". It's easier to tell yourself it's not a big deal, or \\"not worth it\\" as pelosi said about impeaching trump originally.This is why many people that get incredible personal power share this trait: Remarkable pettiness. When you ask most people \\"what are you going to do about it?\\" they shrug and move on. But people like Robert Moses and Trump responded to the smallest slight with overwhelming destructive force, to the point people were afraid to ever get into conflict with them. Like Trump, Robert Moses didn't follow laws he didn't like.For example, if he wanted to build a city park on some land that he had no legal right to do that on, he'd just start building and let people sue him over it. By the time the case was done the park was already built, and the judge was loathe to order the government tear down the structures they'd already built - structures that people in the city liked and that had been built at extreme taxpayer expense... So he'd just issue a stern warning, maybe a fine, and moses would win.Trump works the exact same way. He asks people \\"what are you gonna do about it?\\" and the answer is \\"nothing\\". However if anyone crosses him in the slightest way, he tries to destroy them. The only way out of his grudge is to start being useful to him again... And that's how he builds power. He isn't the richest man and he wasn't the most popular man when he first started his political career - but he was the pettiest and most shameless kinda-rich kinda-popular man, and that let him build power.","title":"Jack Smith files to drop Jan. 6 charges against Donald Trump"},{"text":"What the fuck","title":"Special counsel Jack Smith moves to dismiss Trumps D.C. prosecution"},{"text":"The author can't seriously believe Trump will read this....I hope he considers the wisdom of economist Thomas Sowell...Seriously?","title":"A national service program to help Trump solve the border crisis"},{"text":"Just believe bro","title":"Did the lp hold up their end?"},{"text":"And another troll blocks me!u/AndIntroducingChris. waah-waah-waah.","title":"The emergence of BlueSky is due to the liberals looking for an echo-chamber and their declining debate skills"},{"text":"Yeah, I mean it's cyclical.

It is closely held and remains ongoing, with no findings to date.The internal evaluation comes as tensions flare among certain allies of the president-elect, spilling into public view as factions within Trumps network compete for influence and access. One focus of the inquiry, according to three sources familiar with the situation: Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser and lawyer who has faced claims inside the transition team of attempts to trade on his closeness to Trump.These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again, Epshteyn said in a statement through the campaign.A transition spokesperson, Steven Cheung, said in a statement: As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaigns consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others.
