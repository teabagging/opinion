I say that just to make the point that it's almost impossible for a Republican to spend a great deal of time in DC and not fall in with the Establishment (Left) Crowd to at least some degree. Even if you assume the Republican congressional staffers are conservatives, which is not always the case, it's probably fair to assume that most of the people working for government agencies are Leftists. You don't even really have to dive that far into it. Just look at DC voting patterns.With all of that in mind, it makes sense to me that Pence and former Trump, Bush, and McCain staffers are anti-Trump. While they may still like to think of themselves as Republicans, most of those people have been in the \\"in-crowd\\" for so long that it's safe to assume they've been sucked in to the establishment vortex. Being a former presidential cabinet member can be a very lucrative gig.This anti-Trumpism matters because, well, Trump is running again. This is almost unprecedented. He didn't just slink away. He didn't spend the rest of his life rallying the base and holding court in Florida. He decided to make one more big anti-Swamp push as a candidate. Of course people are going to be rattled by it. When a senator loses an election, he becomes a corporate board member or a lobbyist down the line or some other \\"respectable\\" thing within a standard framework. And when try to mount a comeback, it's no big deal because it typically fails and no one has to care. See: Rick Santorum. What's happening now with Trump is something else entirely. It's also dangerous to The Swamp because of the post-Trump implications. Even if 45 loses this year, the \\"MAGA People\\" aren't all suddenly going to go away. They're a substantial political minority now.

Couple days ago I learned that the Florida GOP's so-called \\"1 million registered voter advantage\\" is a complete fabrication according to Nikki Fried, the Florida Dems' new chair. The reason is ironically because of exactly what you said. Roughly 900,000 Dems stayed home that cycle, because they were distinctly unimpressed with Crist as a candidate. Repubs didn't win by 19 points, Dems *lost* by 19 points. As a result, those Dems ended up getting taken off the active voter roll. They can still vote just fine, they're not suppressed or anything, it's just a stamp saying they didn't vote last time. But Republicans have been using it as a way to spread the notion that Florida is somehow overwhelmingly red.Here are the actual facts: one third of voters in the state are Republican. One third of voters in the state are Democrats. And the last third are Independent.Now guess which party Independents have begun heavily leaning toward as of late?We're coming in with the steel chair.","title":"Ted Cruz Losing to Colin Allred for First Time: Texas Poll"},{"text":" Its odd how this broke now, instead of OctoberFrom what I have seen, it isn't odd, because it was leaked by republican staffers and operatives who were afraid that it would get found in October and this was a last-ditch effort after weeks of private attempts to get him to drop out (specifically to avoid the situation they are now in)","title":"Democrats launch new ad push to tie Trump to Mark Robinson following reported porn website comments"},{"text":"Literally the most deadly mass shootings?

Thats obviously hard to say, but I want to flag one thing that caught my eye: **our polls do not show Harris doing well with the white working class** In PA, its Trump 61-Harris 34; nationally, its Trump 67, Harris 30. In each case, thats = 10 points worse than our final pre-election polls four years ago. **Its also worse than the estimated Biden 20 finish with these groups.** This doesnt rule out a polling error, whether by chance or bias. The polls entered the field immediately after a debate; this is a classic environment for response bias (notably, she leads PA bc of gains with college educated whites, who may be most likely to react to news). This also doesnt mean were not underestimating Trump among white working class voters. Trump could easily be doing even better among white working class voters than these polls. **But this doesnt look like 2020 to me,** even though the topline seems reminiscent of itAgain this sort of goes to the continual point that in order for there to be a comparable polling error underestimating Trump this year, he has to be doing things hes never done before, capturing vote shares hes never captured before.!ping FIVEY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"His speech at the DNC is still stuck with me.","title":"Who are the best debaters in the Democratic Party?

Once you do, remember step 2: do not fret and try to buy stocks, because youll lose it all again.4) If you ignore the previous advice and invest, then put all your money into one position, preferably a complex, bespoke derivative.

Project 2025 is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President unilateral powers, strip civil rights, worker protections, climate regulation, add religion into policy, outlaw porn and much more. The MFL has been around since 1980, Reagan implemented 60% of its recommendations, Trump 64% - proof. 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge hell likely get past 2/3rds adoption.The Heritage Foundation already writes bills for Republicans to submit. Thats how there have been over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills submitted to states since January 1st, 2024. Theyre the ones writing these bills and getting the GOP to pass them. They were also the ones who wrote Texass pornography ID law that was passed. They have been behind abortion, contraception, and anti-drug laws, too. And Harrison Butker? They were the ones who sponsored him up on stage as Butker works with them frequently. And lets not also forget that The Heritage Foundation has frequent confrences that showers GOP politicians with lavish gifts while teaching them how to create right-wing propaganda and craft bills against LGBTQ+ people, abortion, and everything else.There is no might. It will happen. The Heritage Foundation controls the GOP.Theres always a right-winger trying to make people think Project 2025 is no big deal. No, its not just a think tank, its The Heritage Foundation. They have massive influence over right-wing politicians. Ronald Reagan took direction from them, and Donald Trump let them pick his administration. Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, and Jeff Sessions were some of the people they picked.Back in 2022, The Heritage Foundation completely reversed its position on helping Ukraine. Most Republicans followed suit. They have a lot of power and a lot of Republicans licking their boots. Its definitely something to worry about.\\nHere are all the connections between Project 2025 and Trump statements.Christian Nationalismhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/evangelicals-trump-christianity.htmlhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-hell-defend-christianity-from-radical-left-that-seek-to-tear-down-crosseshttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-end-church-restrictions-politics-1234728218/Canceling Climate Changehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2022/03/21/on-fox-donald-trump-calls-climate-change-a-hoax-in-the-1920s-they-were-talking-about-global-freezing/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-climate-change-global-warming-b2459167.htmlhttps://www.npr.org/2020/09/14/912799501/i-don-t-think-science-knows-visiting-fires-trump-denies-climate-changeControl of the Federal Governmenthttps://newrepublic.com/post/174370/inside-trump-fascist-plan-control-federal-agencies-winshttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2019-04-23/trump-seeks-more-control-of-fed-sec-and-other-agencieshttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/324408-the-19-federal-agencies-trump-wants-to-eliminate/Use the DoJ and FBI to arrest critics and opponentshttps://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-has-threatened-dozens-of-times-to-use-the-government-to-target-political-enemies/Fire the Civil Servicehttps://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0507/trump-biden-schedule-f-civil-servicehttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plan-gut-civil-service-triggers-pushback-by-unions-democrats-2023-12-22/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/donald-trump-civil-servants-schedule-fReplace civil servants with loyalistshttps://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/03/distressing-republicans-eyeing-2024-race-support-plot-purge-federal-workershttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-civil-servants-plan-loyalists-b2132020.htmlhttps://www.project2025.org/personnel/Mass Deportationshttps://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/trump-immigration-what-matters/index.htmlhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-donald-trumps-2024-vow-deport-millions-migrants/story?id=110469177https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyxSA_udawkMake abortion illegalhttps://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/index.htmlhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/16/abortion-rights-line-if-trump-administration-gets-4-more-years/5779444002/https://apnews.com/article/health-donald-trump-ap-top-news-politics-election-2020-1210f9012eec9818b25ac9abad46b955Canceling transgender rightshttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-attacks-transgender-rights-video-1234671967/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/donald-trump-transgender-protections.htmlhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article277322158.html\\nCommenting this for visibility.

Casualties are floating around ~3000.So, for every one civilian wounded, two *ranking members* of Hezbollah were taken out. That's pretty surgical if you ask me... a lot better than drone strikes.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"\\"But I'm not a shill!\\"many do it for free: \\"militia\\"","title":"All shills and \\"militia\\" make ready for low effort DNC talking point volley: \\"This sub is so wierd\\""},{"text":"Not at all,  just awoken and educated to what's going on.

Every election my polling place has changed. The only listing from the .gov website I can find each time is one looooooooong text document and you have to run a browser find just to look it up. No search feature as far as I can tell. The sample ballots are typically wrong cause I live in an unincorporated part of Austin. Its difficult to find each candidates information and policies. They dont allow the use of your cell phone when voting, so you need to write things down on paper before going. Mail in voting is shit. They use confusing naming or language to obviscate what each ballot initiative is. There was a initiative to raise teachers pay and in the entire text of the initiative it said nothing about that. Lastly in the last local election I made a selection and then went to review my choices on the print out (something a lot of people do not do) and one of my choices was flipped. Made a stink about that and recast my vote, but that really made things questionable.Most of the recent social insanity by state leaders is aimed squarely at stopping more people from moving here and make the state as unappealing possible to democrats. The repubs here can see the direction things are heading as more industries move here. So they are doing everything to convince people their vote doesnt matter or as difficult as possible to vote in general. Elon says he is moving space x here, where does he think most of those engineers are coming from and do you think they will vote R? No. Just look at their plans to turn each county into an electoral college style. Under that plan, Loving county, with I shit you not, a population of 94! Would have the same voting power as Harris county with a population of 4.8 million they are scared as shit of the population voting. They dont allow voter initiatives for christ sake.

Israel would have been in violation of the LOAC if they had sabotaged a random shipment of pagers going into Lebanon, without trying to ascertain whether the pagers were ordered by Hezbollah or civilians.

It's not like we had a sniper confirming the identity of people then shooting them in the head. There was no way to confirm who was holding those pagers.  For god sakes several children were killed, these things went off in public (in a store, on a buss).  That's not a targeted attack.The pager attack is smart, it was \\"cool\\" such as anything that kills people can be cool.  And I think Israel has a right to attack Hezbollah.  But if it was any arab group or nation who'd done it, we would all be calling it an indiscriminate terror attack, and we'd be right. The attack fits the definition of an indiscriminate attack, and should therefore be forbidden under international law. According to this by The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (found here:\\nhttps://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/09/exploding-pagers-and-radios-terrifying-violation-international-law-say-un )Here's some important passages To the extent that international humanitarian law applies, at the time of the attacks there was no way of knowing who possessed each device and who was nearby, the experts said. Simultaneous attacks by thousands of devices would inevitably violate humanitarian law, by failing to verify each target, and distinguish between protected civilians and those who could potentially be attacked for taking a direct part in hostilities. Humanitarian law additionally prohibits the use of booby-traps disguised as apparently harmless portable objects where specifically designed and constructed with explosives C and this could include a modified civilian pager, the experts said. A booby-trap is a device designed to kill or injure, that functions unexpectedly when a person performs an apparently safe act, such as answering a pager.It's against humanitarian law.  I get that war is war, I understand that Hezbollah attacks Israel all the time (and are condemned for it all the time).  But what's happened with these pagers is sinking to their level.  We (the west, including Israel) are supposed to be the moral people in conflicts.  We are supposed to be \\"the good guys\\" and a big part of that means that we don't do or support stuff like this.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Pay no attention to polling.

They have gone too far left for me.","title":"My convo with my liberal friend?"},{"text":"It's a murky area because the legality and morality of the attack can only really be determined by information that will fundamentally be hard to get out of either side.On the one hand, it can be assumed that Mossad(assuming Israel are responsible) Did correctly assess which Pagers were being purchased by Hezbollah and rigged those. Reports from doctors in Lebannon seem to point out that the majority of patients coming in from the attacks are young men in their 20's, about what you'd expect for militants. That said, we currently do not have any confirmed information regarding if any of these people were in fact militants, so again, we'd be working on the assumption that most of the victims were members or affiliates of Hezbollah.The problem is, how could Mossad have confirmed this? It is perfectly plausible that Hezbollah would choose to sell any excess of Pagers on the civilian market. Given one of the places that blew up was a phone/tech shop, it's certainly not outside of the realm of possibility. This means that unless they had some means of confirming that the Pagers that blew up were in the hands of Hezbollah, then it was potentially a completely indiscriminate attack on anyone who had a rigged pager. This inheritly would require Israel to accept responsibility for the attack and lay down their argument for why they carried it out.Carrying on from this was where these attacks took place. It did not happen on the front line, it happened in marketplaces and homes. Choosing such locations carries with it the implications that they deliberately chose these places to incite terror into the civilian populace. If this was indeed part of the point of the attack, then it is perfectly reasonable to call it a terrorist action. At that point, it doesn't matter that the targets were Hezbollah militants, as the attack would have deliberately affected the entire civilian population. Do note that I'm not calling the Israelis terrorists in any way, merely that deliberately turning unassuming items into bombs, regardless of their use in Hezbollah's communications network, with the vague intent to scare the civilian population to apply political force to get Hezbollah to back down falls within the description of terrorism.All of this requires proof to make any proper conclusions. Hezbollah would have to reveal how many of the wounded were Hezbollah members, and Israel would have to take responsibility for the attack and explain to a body like the UN what their intentions were. I think it's highly unlikely that any of this will happen and it would be naive to expect it to. As such, it sits in a murky area where there are plenty of different interpretations that can be used, so there's enough plausible doubt for Israel to get away with it. The loss is minimal to them, and they have indeed managed to cripple Hezbollah's communications system. Strategically, it was an incredibly well enacted attack.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"And look at how many times the Obamas and Biden dogs bit someone.

Do I love every new wrinkle in the worldbuilding or every new show or movie?  Of course not, but that doesn't take away from the good parts of the old things, or the good parts of the new.People have talked to death the effect the SFX have had on pop-culture, but one thing I don't hear as much and will never get over is how the franchise revolutionized the visual cinematic language of *both* sword fights and gun fights with something as simple as some splashes of color, and even to this day still sort of own that visual language.You watch most cinematic gunfights (especially the classic western) and it's just blanks  sound effects  squibs.  Even if it is realistic, invisible bullets mean that so many cinematic gunfights devolve into characters hiding behind cover to deliver dialogue with no real sense of danger.  Blaster bolts change all that (and are miles better than previous \\"sci-fi beams\\" that often call for the actor and camera to freeze).And just the utter simplistic brilliance of replacing sword blades with beams of (thematic) color.  Instantly, you can turn confusing or even mediocre fight choreography in a dark scene into a literalized struggle between two characters' core essences.  I know Star Wars didn't invent these ideas out of whole cloth, but they were the first to nail them down in a film (along with a vocabulary of sounds that sell the fantasy).  And I will gush about details like this all day.Nitpick?  Sure, I'll nitpick on occasion, and maybe even be a bit sour if something rubs me really wrong.  But love is love, man.

So here's some important context:In 2022, The Heritage Foundation, in collaboration with over 100 conservative partners, established and spearheaded Project 2025, which has been literally labeled a political blueprint intended for the next Trump administration.The Heritage Foundation, also known as 'Heritage', is a conservative think tank that's had an enormous impact on U.S. politics and public policy since the 1980s.Heritage published its first *Mandate For Leadership,* in 1981, a series of reports that helped advise an incoming Reagan Administration with thousands of strategies they could employ to advance conservative policies and carve out a path for future Republican administrations. Reagan later described The Heritage Foundation as a vital force in helping to elevate his presidency In 2023, Heritage published its nearly 900 page manifesto, *Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise.* It was written by hundreds of conservatives, many of whom were former Trump admin officials, and it was collaborated on by multiple right wing organizations and dark money groupsThe director of Project 2025, Paul Dans, served under the Trump administration. Spencer Chretien, one of the Projects associate directors, was a trusted representative and special assistant to Trump.2/3 of the men that were serving on the Project 2025 board of executives worked directly under Trump.Trumps demagogic rhetoric and half baked policy proposals on the campaign trail have aligned VERBATIM with the broader goals of Project 2025.Not only does Trump's campaign rhetoric and his alleged separate agenda resemble the policies and the platform outlined by Project 2025, but Trump and conservatives in power have already implemented and set in motion some of Project 2025's most ambitious proposals.Trump is espousing Project 2025 objectives on the campaign trail, while simultaneously lying about having nothing to do with the agenda, and in all likelihood, he probably doesn't even know he's doing it. His supporters are also pushing the Project 2025 platform without recognizing it because none of them have bothered to inform themselves or do their \\"research\\" about Project 2025, its aims and proposals.An important piece of the Project 2025 agenda is the implementation of the unitary executive theory.This plan of action *already* underwayIt will provide Trump with the absolute powers he needs to carry out the Project's plans. The UET seeks to destroy the separation of powers. One of the project's other major goals includes the targeting of the administrative state\\" through executive actions like schedule FSchedule F was already instituted under Trump near the end of his last term, but he never got the chance to follow through on it thanks to him losing the 2020 election.Schedule F is, by far, one of the most ambitious goals of Project 2025. Through Schedule F, the Trump admin will seek to destroy the independence of most government agencies, and put them under his direct control.And he has already confirmed that this is one of his own goalsThe two *most significant* aspects of the Project 2025 platform are not only part of Trump's plan for his next admin, but they are also being put into motion as I speak.Do you get it now conservatives? Project 2025 *is* TRUMP'S AGENDA!Not only does Trump's dangerous rhetoric, and his plans for his next term, practically mirror the policies and the goals outlined by Project 2025, but Trump and conservatives in power have already implemented some of Project 2025's most essential proposals!The broad immunities recently granted to Trump, the unchecked executive powers he will receive as president,  along with his admin's implementation of Schedule F will restructure the government to serve Trump and transform the position of president into that of a damn king'sAnd these aren't Project 2025's only aimsDuring his campaign, Trump has promised multiple times to implement a plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants.Project 2025 has the same plan in mind. One that will build an operation for the mass deportation of immigrants. The operation would include creating a force of immigration officers, made up of the National Guard, deputized police officers and agents belonging to various agencies under the control of the President. These forces would go around the country arresting illegal immigrants in large-scale raids who would then be taken to large-scale staging grounds to be held in internment camps prior to deportation.Important to the Project 2025 platform is also the creation of a personnel database filled with potential recruits who will be enlisted to play a role within the next administration depending on their own ideological views, their undying commitment to Trump and this authoritarian agenda.Another Project 2025 \\"pillar\\" is the creation of an educational system called \\"the Presidential Administration Academy.\\" It's described as an educational and skill-building program designed to prepare and equip future political appointees to be ready to serve Trump on day one.The Presidential Administration Academy and the diehard Trump sycophants it intends to recruit, will be  permitted to serve based on their unconditional support for Trump and every dangerous, unilateral action he intends to take while president.","title":"House Democrats plan multimedia Project 2025 hearing"},{"text":"Steven Bonnell aka Destiny is probably on of the best left wing debaters on the internet today.

Medical professionals used these pagers and were injured or killed. An 11 year old girl was holding her fathers pager to give it to him when it blew up and killed her. I would argue its indiscriminate in that sense\\nI would say I am emotionally charged when it comes to Israel/Palestine in particular. I have always been on the side of wanting Israel to be sanctioned for their treatment of Palestinians, and have personally boycotted a lot of Israeli goods most of my adult life. Its been a movement here in Ireland for years but the wave of atrocities committed by Israel to Palestinian citizens has brought this issue to the forefront and made it a huge talking point, which is why we see a lot more people talking now.\\nI think the attack in Lebanon has set a very dangerous new precedent and has opened the floodgates to any bad actors who want to pull off something similar. There is a sense that our devices we hold in our pockets feel like ticking time bombs, and that fear is probably much more founded and rational in Lebanon.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"How many opps you really got?I mean, its too many options(Kendrick Lamar)","title":"Kamala Harris Says Anyone Who Breaks Into Her House Is Getting Shot"},{"text":"[Who could it be?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_mePjkQW_c)","title":"Who actually owns Democrat Party Inc.?"},{"text":"Which, of course, did not stop Trump from loudly proclaiming that Harris was complicit in the Iranian hack and she should be barred from running for president because of it.

I support Israel's right to exist and I am willing to give the IDF the benefit of the doubt on many things, because they're a tiny nation surrounded by what I view as a genocidal enemy.However, I don't not believe the pager attacks were legally or morally justifiable for the following reasons:1. The attack was indiscriminate.Likely every pager and walkie talkie that could explode exploded. The hope was it would injure enough bad guys to be worth it. But it also wounded civilians in the wrong place at the wrong time and in professions not directly linked to terrorism. Maybe only Hamas members had pagers (doubtful), but a lot of people including firefighters, construction workers, and truck drivers use hand radios.2. The attack likely achieved little of military value.The attacks are said to have killed maybe 40 people. Wounded a bunch more. That's not much by military standards and now Hezbollah is just going to bulk buy new comms gear. This might have given the Israelis a big advantage if a major attack followed within hours, but by now the element of surprise is lost.3. It likely violated protocol 2 of the Conventional Weapons Convention to which Israel is a signatory:Article 61. Without prejudice to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict relating to treachery and perfidy, it is prohibited in all circumstances to use: (a) any booby-trap in the form of an apparently harmless portable object which is specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material and to detonate when it is disturbed or approached\\\\[.\\\\]Article 4Restrictions on the use of mines other than remotely delivered mines, booby-traps and other devices in populated areas(a) mines other than remotely delivered mines; (b) booby-traps; and(c) other devices.2. It is prohibited to use weapons to which this Article applies in any city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians in which combat between ground forces is not taking place or does not appear to be imminent, unless either:(a) they are placed on or in the close vicinity of a military objective belonging to or under the control of an adverse party; or(b) measures are taken to protect civilians from their effects, for example, the posting of warning signs, the posting of sentries, the issue of warnings or the provision of fences.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"I'm not sure him leaving would give him any less power over our politics.

Millions of voter registrations in any states the president decides are problematic could be removed until those voters cure their registrations, and state authorities would have no say in it.And what will the law require citizens who want to vote do? Lacking a passport or other proof of citizenship with their married names, they must produce both a birth certificate (with the seal of the state where it was issued; no copies allowed) and a current form of identificationboth with the exact same name on them. That could instantly disqualify about 90 percent of all married women without passports or other proof that matches their birth certificates or proof of a legal name change.For women in that situation, they can still register to vote if they can prove that they went to court to change their name when they got married, but most women just start using their new married name without ever going through all those formalities (although a few states recognize marriage as a legal name change).In the name of solving a non-problem, this act can also be used to disenfranchise a significant percentage of the population.

Prior to the 1860s in the US, abortion was not illegal or regulated in any fashion. It was regarded as a private decision made by women and families. Colonial and American society largely had no moral issues whatsoever with women aborting a fetus prior to the quickening, or when women feel the fetus moving, which is around 5-ish months or 20 weeks. The term abortion was not used, it was regulating menstruation that had gone off-cycle. Women used herbal abortifacients that were publicly sold in newspaper advertisements, purchased from a local midwife, or even concocted from a family recipe. Notably, these remedies were dangerous and not always effective. But women at the time had good reason to regulate their fertility and space out children with high rates of maternal and infant mortality- enough reason to risk their lives. Abortion did not enter public debate, i.e., debate among men in power, until around the 1860s which coincided with men taking over obstetric care from women. This occurred as medical professionals underwent formal training at educational institutions that barred women from attending and instituted legal requirements for certification to practice. Anyway, one male obstetrician in particular drew politicians (men) attention to the issue as moral, not personal, and in the 1860s the first abortion legislation emerged.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"The inevitable behind the bastards episode will be glorious","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 19, 2024 - 47 days until election day!"},{"text":"it looks like he still has some leftover cat on his face","title":"Colin Allred can defeat Ted Cruz"},{"text":"i feel the the context NEVER helps trump, if anything it always makes it worse ?? that man is a fucking walking conspiracy theory","title":"I promise you, the ones who want to suppress speech are not your friend."},{"text":"This is old news","title":"Kamala Harris just gave her first solo interview as the presidential nominee.

I've had to learn the TCPA quite well for a non-lawyerRobotexts from political campaigns without your explicit consent are *already illegal*. They are expressly banned by the TCPA. There is no political carveout for robotexts. Nor does putting your number on voter registration constitute authorization for robotexts.The issue isn't the law, it's the enforcement.Political groups *cannot* send you a text based on the phone number in your voter registration unless they have an *individual human being sending each text*. Anything automated requires explicit consent. It is almost certain that many of the texts you are receiving are already illegal. I can absolutely confirm the DNC follows this religiously, cannot say what the RNC does.But almost certainly the vast majority of texts you are getting are from small PACs that are not directly affiliated with the campaign. Because the FCC has essentially no enforcement arm, and these PACs don't have the deep pockets of the actual campaigns, there's no one taking enforcement action against them.So yeah, what you're complaining about is already illegal, but the government makes no effort to enforce the law as written, because the people who have an incentive to make sure the laws aren't enforced also control the purse strings of the government.Unless your argument is 'individual humans should not be allowed to text me about political stuff' (which is a different more complex discussion) your CMV is kind of moot because the thing you want is already true!Welcome to America!","title":"CMV: Political mass-texts should banned"},{"text":"I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of today's scandals until I can ~~figure out what is going on~~ catch up on all of them, what the fuck man","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 19, 2024 - 47 days until election day!"},{"text":"NV elected Trump endorsed Joe Lombardo (R) as Governor in the last election.

Hezbollah is a much scarier paramilitary with better experience, training, and weapons stockpiles. But their organization is why an attack like this was possible. This is why Hamas is condemned for using human shields. Hamas doesn't have supply chains that are as organized, and many Hamas affiliates live within the civilian populace without identifying themselves by uniform. How exactly do you expect Israel to replicate something like this in Gaza?Imagine what warfare would look like if all soldiers lived in civilian populations and didn't have uniforms. What would warfare between two countries look like in that situation? There is a reason soldiers stay in barracks and wear uniforms while on duty, and generally keep their combat infrastructure separate from civilian populations. Hiding within a civilian population may deter attacks at first, but once a country decides that they will accept civilian collateral to kill hidden enemy combatants, then those hidden combatants have created a situation where they guarantee increased civilian deaths. I know that this isn't really answering your CMV, but thinking that exploiting a supply chain vulnerability with an organized terrorist paramilitary means that Israel can achieve the same precision with a guerilla terrorist group aiming to increase civilian casualties makes no sense. That being said, yes, people that really care about the civilians of Gaza should respond differently than those who are just jumping onto the next trendy social issue.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"People on this sub would be throwing a tantrum if Maine changed their system before Nebraska because they'd argue Kamala could win Maine's 2nd district too since Obama won it, so no need to change.","title":"Maine Democrats have likely run out of time to change Electoral College laws if Nebraska GOP acts"},{"text":"No dog\\nThis is some of their finest ammunition lmao","title":"Help me answer this text from my liberal friend"},{"text":"Notice how he didnt say disinformation.

I actually pointed this out in a thread a couple days ago. I was pretty much the only one not praising it. Im not an expert in international law, but I do have a degree in military history. My first thought was this exact thing. International law has a formula for civilian casualties and this attack definitely falls within those ranges, probably by a lot actually. Thats not the only thing the law says though. It requires you to be able to predict what those casualties are beforehand. Its impossible to do that with this type of attack for the reasons that you mentioned above. You also have to consider the terror component of this type of attack which  is a violation of international law too although that one is more subjective and harder to prove. I think that Israel can and should use more precise targeting in Gaza, but this has nothing to do with that. It is not a targeted or precision attack by any means. If the casualties are unpredictable, then that is the opposite of precision. You cant have both. It is a pretty ingenious way of committing a war crime though, I will give them that. \\nIm very sure they will never be held accountable for it though.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"I have noticed that if youre a slightly more centrist content creator, your fanbase will always end up full on leftist.","title":"Notice conservative subs taken over by leftists?"},{"text":"Maybe its the friends we made along the way.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 19, 2024 - 47 days until election day!"},{"text":"We are going to have to punish Nebraska tomorrow for this.

We need to have conversations around the patriot act, the CIA (why are the final 7 pages on using opinion polling to influence elections redacted?), the NSA, section 230 (should we really allow monopolies on internet platforms to regulate their virtual town squares beyond the letter of the law? Let alone coordinate to silence specific people and entities), and the corruption in our studies around chemicals in foods, pesticides, and drugs. These examples are just from the top of my head.","title":"I promise you, the ones who want to suppress speech are not your friend."},{"text":"I somehow missed that.

(Maybe i should write that book everyone keeps telling me to.... Ha!)It's been really transformative for my own life to finally track down exactly what was causing my feelings. Anxiety and ADHD are the main issues, but the causes of the anxiety are what are finally making themselves known to me currently. I used to feel my palms sweat, my muscles tense, my heart race, and start grinding my teeth for absolutely no reasons at all; other than a diagnosis of \\"generalized anxiety disorder\\" and \\"unspecified depressive disorder.\\" I knew I had terrible anxiety, but I didn't know *why*. I finally made a choice to start really working hard on my anxiety. Unfortunately, it came too late, as I had a mental breakdown of epic proportions (at least for me) and ran home to my dad's... Huge mistake, but maybe not in retrospect; i CLEARLY have severe PTSD from my childhood. I didn't know it, but being back in the same house with my abusers (brother lives there, too) just brought my PTSD to the surface hardcore. I lost 30lbs in 3 weeks simply from anxiety and not eating. I weigh 102lbs right now. I lose about 5 lbs a day, so I must eat enough to gain 5lbs a day. I usually have 10-13k steps in before noon. I can't stop it, well without thc gummies (out of 10 meds, this is the only thing I've found.)SO, my point: I'm getting healthier every day now that I have identified my triggers being my dad and brother. Now when i go into fight or flight, i feel it coming and i \\"throw it away.\\" I literally pretend I'm throwing something down to the floor and say throw it away out loud, and it works. I'm making more money, I'm connecting with people, I'm living life for the very first time in almost 40 years of existence. I had cancer from 6 to 14 (remission at 12), all while my mom told me she hated me and wished i was never born, my brother and his friends threw blankets over my head and beat me, and my dad never talked to me but left his porn right there on the coffee table. I'm a fucked up person, but I'm getting so much healthier every day, and these are the things that are working for me, so I feel a duty to anyone else on the planet that is in a similar situation to share my story. Stay strong, we *will* get better.","title":"Trump said that the stock market would crash if Biden were elected president. Did he lie?"},{"text":"The Maine democratic party is very effective.

Ironically, the number of Americans who died during their presidency is never taken into consideration. As for Abraham Lincoln, he did not think blacks were equal, although he opposed slavery. However, here is some food for thought on the Civil War. Was the Civil War fought over state's rights or to abolish slavery? I have a relatively historically accurate thought to answer that question. I think the Civil War was fought not over Slavery for equality but because the Northern factory owners were mad they were having to pay Union labor cost while rich Southern plantation owners used slave labor. The wealthy and elite business classes fought over that issue, and as usual, the rich used the poor to fight over who should be richer...\\nI can provide several specific actions by the North that would have me fighting for and against them. The North lied to slaves about 40 acres and a mule to get them to fight the front lines for them, and as for fighting against them... Regardless of my views on how evil slavery is, if General Sherman marched through my town burning it to the ground, raping, and killing women and children I am going to take up arms against his army every day and twice on Sunday. That, of course, is assuming I wasn't already forced to fight for another side when the wealthy came through and forced you to join their side or die...","title":"Thoughts on Abraham Lincoln"},{"text":"Biden should've fired him early in the administration and gotten the controversy over with already.

Hamas and Hezbollah are different organisations that operate differently, and Israel was only able to do this to Hezbollah this one time because they set up a shell company to sell these pagers to them long in advance knowing that their enemies needs lower tech to communicate without being spied on. They cant make Hamas buy these pagers, they essentially went fishing and caught fish. Furthermore, this is very likely a one time thing. Its a novel tactic that people will be checking for in the future and cant really be repeated, and even if every one of the thousands of pagers that Israel made killed a Hamas member, that would still leave tens of thousands left that can now only be targeted through conventional warfare. Operations this targeted are basically impossible in normal circumstances for any country. Israel didnt need any particularly advanced intelligence on the Hezbollah members after the pagers were supplied to them, because they would almost certainly be on their person when it detonated, but Israel cant know or easily find out exactly where the Hamas members are and safely eliminate them in a targeted fashion with no civilian casualties, theres a complicated tunnel system and they hide amongst a civilian population. Despite not having a magic Hamas locator Israel is actually doing a pretty good job in limiting civilian casualties from what I can tell, as The UN, EU and other sources estimate that civilians usually account for 80 percent to 90 percent of casualties, or a 1:9 ratio, in modern war, whereas basically every source I can find is putting the ratio in Gaza at 2:1 or less.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Hopefully their verdict isnt too hard.

Forgive me for copy/pasting my response from that post:  \\n  \\nThe constitution only refers to the states in the plural. The United States \\"are\\" ___. It is never the United States \\"is\\" ___. This distinction is important, because it gets to the heart of what the federation of States actually is. Before, it was an agreement between equals entered into by consent. After, it was a right of the group to dominate the lesser. This fundamental change inevitably leads to the end of liberty, because liberty and consent of the governed is no longer the justification for the union. The benevolence and righteous aim of the union is the justification. It doesn't matter if the \\"aim\\" of that union is supposedly \\"liberty.\\" The fact is that States are required to give up liberty so that the Feds can give them liberty. If that sounds strange to you - it should. There are lots of details and examples you could get into with Lincoln's decisions and administration, but the definition of the spirit of the Union gets to the essence of the issue. Lincoln is more responsible than anyone else for the bastardization of the constitution that we experience today. Others have accelerated it, but Lincoln provided the precedent and moral propaganda for it.","title":"Thoughts on Abraham Lincoln"},{"text":"What book is banned?

What the poster you're responding to is pointing out is, due to the nature of the attack, the people detonating had no way to know who else was around when they detonated. Could've been in the middle of field harming no one but the carrier. Could've been in a Hezbollah bunker taking out multiple legitimate targets. Could've been in the middle of a mall or park and killed unrelated innocent children. This is quite different from your rocket launcher example because they not only could, but are likely to be carrying the pager in public while on what would appear to be normal business. Any normal civilian sees a guy with a rocket launcher, they're going to get out. A guy with a pager on his belt, assuming its visible at all, would not be cause for alarm. Its hardly cause for a second look.You turned this into \\"If they stole their equipment among civilians...\\" but that's not the discussion. First, if they did store it among civilians and Isreal knew that information, they would not be legally justified in carrying out the attack,  because then they knew civilians would get hurt. But where they stored it isn't relevant because expected usage is the question, not storage. The pagers being on Hezbollah personal is expected, but where they are when you choose to detonate is up in the air. And it could very easily have been among a bunch of unrelated civilians. So the attacks meet the legal definition of indescriminate; you can't discriminate if you don't know the circumstances in the first place.

If (sure, lets call this alleged) this was Israel, this operation would have fallen under the jurisdiction of Mossad, who handles covert operations *abroad*. Legally, Israel considers Gaza to be its domestic territory under the intelligence jurisdiction of Shin Bet and AMAN (IDF intelligence). These are different departments with different capabilities. Aside from jurisdictional issues, this seems like it could have been an attack of opportunity based on knowing when technology was being replaced and getting into the supply line. Israel has clearly been unsuccessful in intercepting Hamas supply line, at least until the relatively recent capture of the Philadelphi Corridor.Now to the legal / ethical issues:Whoever did this (I wonder who it could have been!) seemed to know these were being distributed by Hezbollah, to Hezbollah. But even Hezbollah has protected personnel that are not supposed to be targeted for assassination, notably medics. It does appear that medical personnel were in possession of some of these devices. I do not know what level of care is owed to these personnel in an operation like this because I dont think theres ever been an operation like this to set a precedent. You could legally excuse danger to medics who are in the vicinity of an airstrike, but you cant shoot at them. Somewhere between those parameters, someone is going to have to determine how targeted this attack was and whether they were improperly included with potential targets.The other issue is the ethics and legality of weapons designed to inflict superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. This also seems like a legitimate point of dispute. The argument will be that while these weapons were designed in a way that would cripple rather than kill, that they were designed that way to minimize collateral damage. The question is was the injury superfluous? Which effectively becomes a question of was this operation *necessary*? I would say that sending a message is not a valid justification, but dismantling communications *may* have been, depending on what larger operational goals it successfully furthers.Overall, I think that if this is incredibly interesting but that we are still *far* from being able to make an interpretation of whether it was permissible or justified.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"My boyfriend just started a new job and is shocked by how many people are voting for Trump there.

To sum the argument up, I reject the idea that targeting unarmed people in their homes, even if they are associated with Hezbollah, is legitimate, and I will try to outline why, and maybe change your mind.If Hezbollah - from whose perspective the IDF cannot be described as anything else than a state-sponsored terrorist group - If Hezbollah had captured pagers and done the same thing, which then went to IDF personell, and blew them up in their homes, would you have said \\"fair game, that's a targeted attack, very precise\\"? The fact that one side recognizes Hezbollah as a terrorist organization is basically meaningless. Nelson Mandela was on the US terror list until 2008.Consider for a moment that what seems to happen is that the moment somebody is part of something that is designated a terrorist group, you stop applying the same moral frameworks that apply to others. Being plausibly associated with a group that engages in what you choose to define as \\"terrorism\\", their lives are forfeit. Hezbollah is an official party, part of the lebanese national assembly. They have administrative staff, politicians, secretaries, and so on. What these people are not, are active combatants. Many are civilians associated with a group that you put in a category where suddenly, these civilians are fair game to kill. But this is a slippery slope, is it not? If the \\"other\\" side designates the IDF a terrorist organization (which, essentially, from a certain perspective, they are a state-sponsored terrorist organization), how far does this extend? Is every IDF member and their family a viable target - not just soldiers, but administrative staff, managers, technicians, and so on?Let's keep flipping the script, I'll go even worse. I want to clarify, this is not my opinion, but you should consider it to understand along which axis you judge these types of military operations when it comes to collateral damage. With your logic, you could even reframe October 7th as an extremely precise military attack on a foreign terrorist organization, only harming \\\\~2 civilians per one IDF personell, [a ratio much lower than what Israel deems acceptable when targeting the lowest rank of Hamas militants](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/). Why is it then that we deem it a horrible terrorist attack and not a precise military strike?The human brain does a funny thing where if somebody belongs to the \\"other\\" group, suddenly we do not apply the same logic as we do if they were  part of \\"our\\" group. Of course the October 7th attack was barbaric. So is targeting unarmed people in their home with exploding pagers, even if they belong to a militia/military/terrorist organization. If we blur the lines there, all bets come off.  To leave you with a cherry, the official position of Israel is that [students peacefully protesting in the US are terrorists](https://twitter.com/Israel/status/1781951509070012435). Would you, on this basis, agree that their lives are forfeit by being terrorists, and blowing them up in their homes with a precision strike like this one is justified?","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Oh dear lord democrats need 100 more no-shit-takers just like her!","title":"Representative Jasmine Crockett absolutely rips into the GOP and Heritage Foundation at todays House Oversight meeting, and it is GLORIOUS.

People who are Zionist or at the very least Zionist supports who will, under no circumstances, feel any negativity or moral hiccup with anything Israel does whether it be imprisoning literal children for a decade or more (even before the October attack), raping women and children, torture, official statements of non-Jews being subhuman, etc. It's been very clear throughout the last 80 years and even more recently the last several that Israel has supporters who are unconcerned with anything that doesn't benefit Israel. No amount of war crimes, atrocities, and destruction are every going to lead these people away from supporting Israel.I think most sides have been established. People who are in support of Palestine seem equally steadfast in being against Israel. Arabs, atheists (the discussion of religion and war has been around for longer than anyone posting in this thread have), Jews who condemn Israel as it is and not whatever the idealic version they'd like to exist, human rights activists, etc.Really, the only people who can be swayed one way or the other are people who are either detached from news and adopt whatever the first voice who tells them who to support or people who get their news but from singular sources like Fox, CNN, or some TikToker who has an underbaked understanding of the history of the conflict, the conflict as of current, and is communicating their views with an impressionable, younger audience.And does any of this even matter? Israel is pretty unconcerned with what its citizens want regardless of their support or condemnation. Nobody in Israel is going to start rioting, America isn't going to step in despite Israel killing Americans in the conflict and openly saying they'd go to war with the US if they tried to stop (but American politicians are boot-lickers so they're fine with just accepting the threats, plus Israel is for all intents and purposes America's child), and the UN and neighboring Arab nations are unwilling to send any kind of real support.Israel knows they can do basically anything and get away with it.

I like these folks and commented mildly that as long as both major parties are functionally owned by corporate special interests, the outcome of these increasingly farce-like electoral shows will make little difference to most Americans. I also chimed in about being surprised how few people objected when a clearly cognitively challenged Biden was allowed not only to run but to take office, how his mental condition was covered up with widespread complicity, and how doing that allowed Harris to become the nominee with no primary challenge, which wouldn't have happened if Biden had kept his pledge to be a 1-term president and reaffirmed that at the start of the election season.They listened politely, some nodded about Joe's addled state, then went back to discussions of the federal agencies Trump would abolish. I noted that he can't do that by executive order, and even an R-controlled Congress wouldn't likely do that but might atrophy agencies like EPA by starving them with budget slashes.

First I would say Im not American, so this is the opinion from an outsider, but I did study a bit of American history. I believe the civil war was just. At a first glance, attacking seceding states would be absolutely against Libertarian ethics. However, those states were doing so to literally enslave a huge chunk of its population, so I see their rights to secede void, as they themselves were disrespecting individual rights. The lost cause is bs and there is no way to run from this fact, the war was about slavery.That said, even though the union had the ethical highground. Lincoln, even though having a \\"good heart\\", did not solve the war by sticking to libertarian ethics. Suspension of habeas corpus, draft, and other measures were authoritarian and some arguably not even necessary to win the war, such as the persecution of anti-war/pro-south agitators in the north.Furthermore, the union enforced a lot upon the south, such as \\"reconstruction\\" which was used ina lot of ways to weaken the south and force it to be loyal.So yeah, it is a really complex topic, even more so when debating libertarian ethics.","title":"5 most libertarian presidents"},{"text":"The only reason Nixon founded the EPA is because he had no choice.

The attack as a whole was more disruptive to the group's communications and organization and ultimately feels like a precursor to more conventional attacks designed to neutralize the organization as a threat. If the pagers were the only attack Israel used, Hezbollah would at best be in chaos for a few days and be fully recovered within a few weeks.Had Israel used a similar tactic against Hamas, it would have accomplished little to nothing. The hostages would still be hostages, Hamas would still fire rockets into Israel, they would still be entrenched in tunnels under civilian areas, and Israel would still be forced to use ground and air assaults to do any real damage.","title":"CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause"},{"text":"Im a dad.

The cycle will keep going. \\n? the ultimate goal is to use the working class physically, financially and spiritually. Its to keep the working class blaming one group rather than those who have sold us out to fuck children at the top. \\nI havent been the same since. Its really fucked me up. And we need to plan if we want to beat this.","title":"Notice conservative subs taken over by leftists?"},{"text":"It is unfortunate that happened to you.

Thats going to be on full display and in stark contrast to Walz.
