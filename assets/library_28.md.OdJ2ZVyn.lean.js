The Facts:When Rudy Giuliani prosecuted the Italian mob in the late 80s he opened the door to the NY Russian mob and the Russian Oligarchs, both groups of which are strategically placed within the KGB organization. The Russian mob is made up of over 6,000 groups covering every part of the globe. Rudy is deeply tied in with this mob as is Trump through the sales of his laundered properties.I believe Trumps 2015 run was planned years in advance. His first wife Ivana was discovered to be  working with the Czechoslovakian Government and was investigated by the FBI but later dropped.Fox News ties: Murdock worked in Russia constructing billboards for Putins first campaign run in 2000. Murdock married Putins Asian x girlfriend Wendi Deng. Deng has been photographed selfies with Trumps daughter Ivanka while on vacation in 2017 and posted in the Guardian News. Fox Organization, Trump and Rudy apparently all work for the KGB and Putin. I believe the mob set up the Butler rally assassination performance. Crooks was just a patsy who was told to just shoot in the air , but he failed those instructions. The MOB also paid off five rouge Secret service members. 2-tactical shooters, 2- on stage and 1- the team director.  And the rest of the group just followed the questionable procedures and kept in line. There were exactly 5 in that group that were pulled off duty a week after the event. This is the same team that scrubbed all of their texts by an auto reset during the Jan 6th insurrection. Im sure the FBI who questioned over 600 people had to include polygraph tests on the team as required by its SS protocol. I imagine they put the puzzle together pretty damn fast. They handed it over to Homeland and they decided not to prosecute this rouge group and especially Trump because of the involvement of the Mob all the way up to Putin. It seems they decided to forgo justice and sacrifice two severely injured and one dead citizen so to wipe the slate clean, hoping the election outcome would favor Harris.I imagine Biden made the ultimate decision not to go forward, make public and start a conflict that would get out of control . I think he decided that if we lost the election then it would be easier to deal with Trump than trying to start a major war with Putin. US Military law states that a person killed on American soil directed by a foreign head of state is considered an act of war. If this was never labeled as an assassination investigation it would have been investigated as a double murder as required by law to satisfy victims rights. The victims have already received  millions of dollars through a sketchy Go Fund Me so the case apparently is not going forward.","title":"Watch, next week Trump will nominate Ed the Sock for something! ??"},{"text":"Finally gave up cheating?","title":"Democrat Bob Casey concedes to Republican David McCormick in Pennsylvania Senate contest"},{"text":"I don't see anything about that in her Wikipedia, not even words like \\"alleged.\\" Not that they are the best source of info, but because they are massively biased against conservatives.

Putin only has to pin Ukraine down and clamp down on their last-minute offensives, as Trump will at the very least cut Ukrainian funding and will try to wind down the conflict. The current exchange is both sides trying to intimidate the other into making a mistake. Now, I will say that China, which holds Russia's purse strings, will not let Putin go nuclear if at all possible. The reason being that China also has many border disputes and unhappy neighbors. If Putin even just uses a tactical nuke, it encourages Japan, SK, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Vietnam to arm themselves as the nuclear genie is now out of the bottle, and nukes are no longer unthinkable.

The Facts:When Rudy Giuliani prosecuted the Italian mob in the late 80s he opened the door to the NY Russian mob and the Russian Oligarchs, both groups of which are strategically placed within the KGB organization. The Russian mob is made up of over 6,000 groups covering every part of the globe. Rudy is deeply tied in with this mob as is Trump through the sales of his laundered properties.I believe Trumps 2015 run was planned years in advance. His first wife Ivana was discovered to be  working with the Czechoslovakian Government and was investigated by the FBI but later dropped.Fox News ties: Murdock worked in Russia constructing billboards for Putins first campaign run in 2000. Murdock married Putins Asian x girlfriend Wendi Deng. Deng has been photographed selfies with Trumps daughter Ivanka while on vacation in 2017 and posted in the Guardian News. Fox Organization, Trump and Rudy apparently all work for the KGB and Putin. I believe the mob set up the Butler rally assassination performance. Crooks was just a patsy who was told to just shoot in the air , but he failed those instructions. The MOB also paid off five rouge Secret service members. 2-tactical shooters, 2- on stage and 1- the team director.  And the rest of the group just followed the questionable procedures and kept in line. There were exactly 5 in that group that were pulled off duty a week after the event. This is the same team that scrubbed all of their texts by an auto reset during the Jan 6th insurrection. Im sure the FBI who questioned over 600 people had to include polygraph tests on the team as required by its SS protocol. I imagine they put the puzzle together pretty damn fast. They handed it over to Homeland and they decided not to prosecute this rouge group and especially Trump because of the involvement of the Mob all the way up to Putin. It seems they decided to forgo justice and sacrifice two severely injured and one dead citizen so to wipe the slate clean, hoping the election outcome would favor Harris.I imagine Biden made the ultimate decision not to go forward, make public and start a conflict that would get out of control . I think he decided that if we lost the election then it would be easier to deal with Trump than trying to start a major war with Putin. US Military law states that a person killed on American soil directed by a foreign head of state is considered an act of war. If this was never labeled as an assassination investigation it would have been investigated as a double murder as required by law to satisfy victims rights. The victims have already received  millions of dollars through a sketchy Go Fund Me so the case apparently is not going forward.","title":"Trump selects woman who enabled the sexual exploitation of kids by WWE employee to run Depart. of Education"},{"text":"If she's got ties to Scientology, the LAST place you want her is anywhere near sensitive government information.?\\nJust ask the Germans: https://www.dw.com/en/scientology-accused-of-attempting-to-infiltrate-government/a-2308932","title":"Trump announces Pam Bondi as new attorney general pick hours after Matt Gaetz withdraws"},{"text":"Its a moot deflection and its off topic.

I keep thinking of a West Wing episode where they've invited representatives of a new eastern european democracy to the White House to draft a constitution they can take back with them to use. Toby asks a fictional Larry Lessig how they can be taking a 2 hour lunch break when they only have a week to craft a set of laws these guys can take back home- the fictional Lessig replies it's not the *set of laws* that is important, but [*a sense of the rule of law*.](https://youtu.be/K3wFWpCvrQ8?t=43)I don't know when we've ever *really* held those values in a broad way among the citizenry as a whole... but we've surely held those values in greater regard than we do today in some way that mattered.I *am* rather concerned about Trump and nukes and what he might do to the military in his second term, but aside from that, the damage done from a law being passed or repealed can be fixed in 5 or 10 years. The damage done from the erosion of our civic society and the *shared understanding of what is acceptable*.... is much harder to fix.Those more fundamental principles are something we've been unsuccessful at instituting in other countries, despite decades of trying in many different countries.

A member of the Republican Party, she has been a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, participating in his defense during his first impeachment trial in 2020. In November 2024, President-elect Trump nominated Bondi for the position of U.S. Attorney General after his initial nominee, Matt Gaetz, withdrew amid allegations of misconduct. Bondi's career has not been without controversy. In 2013, her office was reportedly considering joining a lawsuit against Trump University over fraud allegations. Around the same time, the Donald J. Trump Foundation donated $25,000 to a political group supporting Bondi's re-election campaign. Subsequently, her office declined to pursue the case against Trump University. This sequence of events led to allegations of a potential conflict of interest, though both Bondi and Trump denied any wrongdoing. Additionally, Bondi has faced criticism for her stances on LGBTQ+ issues and her involvement in legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act. Despite these controversies, Bondi has maintained a prominent role in Republican politics and continues to be a significant figure in the legal and political arenas.","title":"Trump picks Pam Bondi for next attorney general"},{"text":"I was in my Grade 2 class.

The thing is, though, tactical ballistic missiles (which in some cases are also nuclear-capable) have been in use practically since Day One of the conflict. Supposedly this is an intermediate range ballistic missile, but again there really isn't a marked difference between yesterday's Russian strike on Dnipro and the one two years ago on the Kramatorsk train station, or the Ukrainian one three days into the war against the Russian air base at Millerovo other than \\"this missile can travel farther\\". And frankly, that hasn't been demonstrated with this strike versus, say, the Russian massed missile strike on the Yavoriv Training Center, nearly on the Polish border, two years ago.

Absolutely pivotal stuff.    \\nI think, on a broader note, going over *how radically world and American history, both, have changed* is something we can't have enough of.   \\nWith plenty of more room to grow, of course, but it's fairly humbling and sobering both, to think about.1\\\\. Not particularly, but that's also due to my political mentor, who I think would have found the recent results faintly amusing (we shared a similarly gloomy sense of humour). Not amusing in a *fun* way, of course, but - so it goes.   What I do think is that there are an *incredible* amount of people who simply *don't* think. For some it is because of entrenched beliefs, sexism. But I think you can find even people whose actions are mostly good, who will - if left to their own devices - often return to a baseline of being... Don't know how to put this, mildly-to-severely sexist/racist.I'd also add that *scepticism* of power and institutions is more often directed at women then men, for many reasons; it's acceptable, they are perceived to be 'soft' targets, and it can 'earn respect' with others who feel similarly or are unaligned.2\\\\. Listen, quite honestly. I only bloviate online, and mostly just nod sombrely offline, bahahaha!.. More seriously, though, I think the most important thing is being *willing to confront friends and family.* We often let those we care for and love have more wriggle room, *because* we care for and love them. But those are precisely the kinds of people, when we are in an environment where it is safe to stand up to them, it is vital that we do so. Even if the metaphorical man in question didn't mean it, he does good work; even if the metaphorical woman in question couldn't mean it, she has had similar struggles, it was just a moment that 'slipped out.'   \\nDefending our candidates and colleagues from people we care for is often the most difficult, and most important task I think we have.3\\\\. This doesn't feel old to me, but I suppose it counts as old, now. There exists a certain candidate who has been repeatedly attacked for being stiff, practised, and cold. This candidate also was emblematic to many of certain political strands and tendencies - really, *any,* because it became fait accompli to place any position the person didn't like on her. And when people learned about her or interacted with her, they were often shocked - and then *angry,* at *her.*  Where was the punchy, fiery, amused woman they'd seen? Why wasn't *she* campaigning, she'd win a billion votes!Obviously, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton.   \\nBut I don't think there are many, even here, [who really remember](https://fair.org/extra/the-media-factor-behind-the-hillary-factor/) how far this goes.     \\nAttacks at the time were absolutely abominable.   \\nConspiracy theories about Clinton using security detachments to retrieve tampons, everything cartoonishly evil you could imagine.I often wonder if many of her critics would have been able to handle the amount of horrible materiel thrown her way with a fraction of the dignity.  \\nAnd of course, these attacks are hardly new for women in politics, those in our party and otherwise;   \\nShe is just a perfect high-profile example, and one that's important because many people *continue* to hate her, to this day, and get weirdly defensive without being able to label the exact reason why.None should have to instantly like a politician or a person; but I think it takes great strength and moral character to look at oneself in the mirror, ask 'hey, are my opinions just as vulnerable to mass politics as anyone else's?' and come back a little more humbled, and more aware.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 21, 2024"},{"text":"Whats the point?

And she was among a group of Republicans who showed up to support Trump at his hush money criminal trial in New York that ended in May with a conviction on 34 felony counts.For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore, Trump said in a social media post. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.

And then point to Trump repeatedly promising to use the military to round up millions of people, and saying the military should be used on the \\"enemy within\\" which he explicitly said included elected members of government. And how he has a special panel to remove \\"woke\\" leaders from the Pentagon (tangentially, high turnover in your leadership is the best way to keep your military in fighting shape, smart move all around).\\nOr how Trump did in fact try to do very Nazi like things in his first time, like asking why the military couldn't be used to shoot protesters and saying he wished his generals were more like Hitlers generals, or saying Hitler did some things right. And how he was only held back by reasonable people who had remained in the administration. People who aren't going to be there this time.\\nBut it doesn't matter. Because the real question is why risk it? Between someone who is kind of Hitler like and someone who is just kind of mediocre, you should pick the mediocre one. Basic risk assessment. The risk of being wrong is immense.\\nThe US rounded up folk during World War 2 and put them in camps. Most of those people were US citizens. During the Bush administration the US tortured people, despite knowing it wasn't an effective interrogation tool and knowing it would torpedo criminal prosecutions. The 50th state to legalize no fault divorce did so in 2010. Your rights are not deeply entrenched and infinite. They are fragile and easily destroyed. Every horrible thing you can imagine can happen again in your country. Democracy requires constant vigilance to protect what we fought for in WW2.\\nWhich all begs the question. What if you're wrong? What are you going to do? Are you willing to support your fellow Americans if it comes to protesting or worse to protect your country? You going to grab your gun and fight fascism if it turns out Trump is everything your fellow Americans feared?\\nTrump is already upset Congress passed a bill to protect journalists. His cabinet is full of people who helped write Project 2025 which is a literal blueprint to destroy the US and everything it stands for. Like my dude, he is telling you what he wants to do. It's right out in the open. Don't come crying to me if the worst happens.

Red states then on the net get money from blue states to do things their way, but there's no such thing as a free lunch. Red states get a fraction of what it costs to implement it their way before even considering compliance costs. Red states want the freedom to do it their own way that works for then with the budget they have rather than someone else's way that then wrecks their budget.Most notably, the DoE is not only new but wholly redundant and grossly inefficient. I've even seen TEACHERS think that getting rid of the federal DoE means closing all public schools. How anyone could even think that is how it works is beyond me.

Five years ago, all of my claims were based on simple observations. They had absolutely nothing to do with the Bible or Christianity. In fact, in my September 2019 Reddit post about the time difference, it was another user who informed me of Matthew 24:22.In regard to the Mandela Effect, context is everything. For the anatomy changes to make sense, you don't need the time difference. But the reverse is not true: For the time difference to make sense, you ABSOLUTELY need the anatomy changes (since things like track and field records are the same on Earth and Bozrah, which is mainly due to the differences in human anatomy). But lo and behold, I discovered the anatomy changes BEFORE I discovered the time difference! I discovered the anatomy changes in August 2019 and the time difference in September 2019. That matters a great deal, because it's not as if I discovered the time difference first and then desperately tried to figure out why sports records were the same on both planets.And by the way, all of that biblical stuff that you see on the 812info.com Reddit page was written just last year (2023).

I live paycheck to paycheck and have a household to provide for. However when it comes down to whats at stake:1. The stated day 1 policy of hunting down illegal and naturalized citizens in our country will drastically affect food prices. This will make it unaffordable for me to live, and we are at the first of many policies that will affect me.2. The repeal of the ACA - my brother was born with a congenital heart defect that insurers have been banned from refusing insurance for. He is at risk of losing health insurance, and my immediate household has ongoing health issues at the moment. We would be affected monetarily by this decision as a family, and as individuals.3. Tariffs on goods - I work in an industry that manufactures HVAC equipment out of country and the immediate effect of this asshats tariffs are going to cause a ripple effect through construction, slowing us down, and raising costs. We will be out of work, and I will be affected directly.I dont think I need to continue with how I will be impacted to prove my point. It doesnt matter if you cant afford a couple weeks/months off. None of us will have the home we once had, nor the rights we once had, nor the ability to provide for our families.But what we can do:We can band together. We can rely on each other. We can prove that even though it hurts us, we are resilient. We as Americans, all Americans live in a home founded by people who left everything behind to make a better future for themselves and their families. Now is our time to stand and show that we are made of the same ethos as our founders, and that we are willing to suffer collectively, so that we may live in prosperity and truth again.I will never bow, and I will never be complacent, and I ask everyone who reads this to not be afraid of the future.

I went to Denver for the first time shortly after (January, 2015). I could not believe a city as big as Denver could be as safe and clean as it was. This held true even in 2019. Between 2020 and 2022, Denver turned into a nightmare. I'm from California and had watched its collapse with each subsequent visit home; in 2012, when I went to basic, LA was still pretty awesome; It had been on the slow decline for about 10 years, but it was still a great place to be. Obviously, there were areas you avoided, but the tourist spots were relatively clean and safe. By 2018, it was untravellable. The same happened in Denver, but at hyper-speed. Whereas LA was a slow descent between 2004ish to 2019, Denver went from great in 2017 to an apocalyptic nightmare by the end of 2020. I was a radio host from 2021 to 2023, and I reported the crime data. You would not believe how rapid the descent was. Denver should be a warning to the rest of America. You think California's policies will have a gradual effect on your quality of life, but you're wrong. Denver, in its attempt to be the \\"California of the Rockies\\" showed that the deleterious effects of Califronia's policies will *quickly* destroy your community. Progressivism is a cancer that moves quickly, and once discovered, requires immediate treatment or its effects will linger until death. California has entered the stage of Cancer treatment that I (through personal experience) like to call the \\"It's not too bad, we can still deal with it\\" phase. They believe that all they have to do is rescind the policies that caused the problem. They are wrong; in order to treat the illness, they must be ruthless and aggressive. Denver hasn't even listened to the oncologist; it is plugging its ears and saying \\"LALALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU\\" as the doctor tells Denver it is on a crash course with death. I normally would say something positive, but I have nothing. Good luck, Colorado.

Excerpt:?It felt all too fitting that the Christian fundamentalist House Speaker Mike Johnson chose the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance  a day intended to both memorialize past victims of violence, including at least 30 and perhaps far more murder victims every year, and to fight this scourge  to side with South Carolina Rep. Nancy Maces vocal and bigoted efforts to prevent transgender people from using Capitol restrooms or other single-sex facilities of their chosen identity. Johnson claimed to be solving a problem that didnt seem to exist for Capitol visitors or staffers before McBrides arrival. More importantly, advocates like Sanchez know how such high-profile moves give license to everyday people to more openly voice anti-trans hatred. This normalization of transphobia in American politics, and the signs of looming government repression, poses a major moral test  the first of many to come  for how the political leaders for the nearly 77 million Americans, and counting, who voted against Trumps MAGA movement (for Harris or third-party candidates) are planning to respond. []?It seems to me that if Democrats want to have any hope of staying relevant over the next four years, let alone regaining power in the anti-small-d-democratic climate of the Trump regime, they need to embrace their inner Andy Beshear, and reject the shortsightedness of the Seth Moultons out there. Again, think back to history. In 1964, just months after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his I Have a Dream speech, 74% of Americans said mass demonstrations were detrimental to racial equality. President Lyndon B. Johnson knew that signing civil-rights legislation would probably mean near-future political pain for the Democratic Party, and he was right. But think bigger picture. During that era, Democrats and their liberal base did build  however imperfectly  a brand that they were the party that had fought for civil rights and equality, not only for Black Americans but for Latinos, women, the LGBTQ community, and other groups that felt marginalized by conservatives. That brand  built around a moral belief and not the polling data  is how Democrats won the popular vote in seven of the last nine presidential elections, even including the disappointment of Nov. 5. Selling out more than 1 million transgender Americans would wreck that brand, permanently  telling voters Democrats dont stand for anything beyond surviving the next election.","title":"Transgender wars are a test of whether our humanity can trump focus-group politics"},{"text":"DEI hire","title":"Watch, next week Trump will nominate Ed the Sock for something! ??"},{"text":"It's only because marco is a racist against latinos!!!","title":"President Trump nominated Pam Bondi as the next Attorney General"},{"text":"Why would they say that?

During World War II, Stalin deported the Crimean Tatars en masse, accusing them of collaborating with the Nazis, which drastically altered the regions demographics. Transfer to Ukraine: In 1954, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. At the time, both were part of the Soviet Union, so the transfer was more administrative than geopolitical. When the USSR dissolved in 1991, Crimea became part of the newly independent Ukraine.In summary, Russia controlled Crimea for a significant period before Ukraine, particularly during the Russian Empire and early Soviet eras. However, the 1954 transfer established Crimea as part of Ukraine, which remains the basis for Ukraines claim today.","title":"Tax Dollars to Ukraine"},{"text":"Damn, I can see it now: a bunch of leftist women becoming extremely insecure and start seething over her looks, and the myriad of posts of why she's unattractive.","title":"Trump Names Pam Bondi as Attorney General Amid Gaetzs Withdrawal"},{"text":"With a nice Chianti","title":"Shocking New Details on Matt Gaetz Sexual Misconduct Probe Released Minutes Before He Withdrew From Nomination"},{"text":"I mean it's a thing, but you can just shuffle back.","title":"Trumps NATO Pick Has Bizarre History With Company Hawking a Masculine Toilet"},{"text":"Anyone else convinced this recent series of events with Gaetz and this lady ultimately getting nominated was the plan all along?","title":"President Trump nominated Pam Bondi as the next Attorney General"},{"text":"Id settle for Morbin time right now.","title":"Trump announces Pam Bondi as new attorney general pick hours after Matt Gaetz withdraws"},{"text":"Hey, Nancy, youre up.

A spokesperson for Bondi announced that her office was considering joining a lawsuit initiated by Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, regarding tax fraud potential charges against Trump. Four days later, however, a political action committee established by Bondi to support her re-election, And Justice for All, received a $25,000 donation from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, after which Bondi declined to join the lawsuit against Trump University.... In September 2016, the IRS determined that the donation to Bondi's PAC violated laws against political contributions from nonprofit organizations, and ordered Trump to pay a fine for the contribution.His illegal donation to her election campaign (that was definitely not in return for her not charging him with fraud) was not paid back, as his foundation was shut down for all sorts of illegal activity before then.And that's not the only corruption controversy around her...","title":"Trump says he will nominate Pam Bondi as US Attorney General"},{"text":"The same AG Trump paid off all those years ago.

I'd relate it to the ultimatum game. A has to divide 100 between themselves and B. But B is the one who decided whether to accept the deal or of them to both leave with nothing. If they only ever played this game once. A should propose they get 99 and B get 1 and B should accept that offer. Since B's options are 1 or 0. But that's not what we observe people doing, A tends towards fairer offers, and B rejects offers they don't judge to be fair even though that means B gets less money.The reasoning is that your actions are also going to influence how other people act, being an A who is fair encourages other people to be fair when they're A and you're B. Even if being violent to people hurting you is the 'correct move' in the moment it contributes to a culture where violence is more acceptable and so people are more likely to be violent against you later.

But we'd be selling this topic short if we didn't zoom out and look at how sexism crops up in every corner of politics.  Even where women have gained power.  In some cases, *especially* where women have gained power.  The big things you're going to notice are:1. It took a ridiculously long time for women to gain political power, even when they weren't barred from doing so.2. There were a ton of efforts that came up short along the way.3. Every step of the process was met with disgusting attacks that were specifically based on the womanhood of these candidates and leaders.4. These effects were multiplied for nonwhite, LGBT+, or other women belonging to another group that gets shit on regularly.**The long, halting history**I'm going to ask you to [read over this excellent timeline of women in US politics.](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/milestones-women-american-politics)  There are some pretty incredible stories in there, but it's a very sad list overall when you consider what's missing:* It was 21 years between the first female candidacy for anything (Elizabeth Cady Stanton's 1866 Congressional run) and a woman being elected to anything (Susanna Salter's successful Mayoral run in 1887).* Most early women in power only lasted a single term before being defeated.  * More powerful elected positions took even longer.  We didn't see a female Governor until 1925, or a female Senator until 1931 - and both were originally appointed to serve the rest of their late husbands' terms.  Voters seemed to need that 'seal of approval' from a man to let them have power.  The first woman to arrive in the Senate without originally filling her husband's seat at some point was Nancy Kassenbaum in *1978.** Even today, there are [12 female Governors out of 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_governors_in_the_United_States) and [25 female Senators out of 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_United_States_Senate#Currently_serving_female_U.S._senators) (not including the 2024 elections).  Remember, women are about half the US population, and a slight majority of voters.* The stats for women of colour are even more ridiculous.  [Four Black women have been elected to the US Senate in history, and two of them were elected in 2024!](https://19thnews.org/2024/11/us-senate-history-black-women-angela-alsobrooks-lisa-blunt-rochester/)  Catherine Cortez Masto [is the only Latina Senator in US history.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Catherine-Cortez-Masto)  At the state level, [three women of color have been elected Governor,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_governors_in_the_United_States#Demographics) and not a single Black woman.The general rule: The more powerful the office, the longer it took for any woman to get elected to it, and the less likely they are to be there today.  This helps explain why we haven't had a female President yet.  (We'll come back to that point, too).**It's not just the numbers**So, how can I blame this inequality on sexism?  By looking at the stories those women tell during and after their careers.* Susanna Salter's historic Mayoral election in 1887?  [It was a prank by men to humiliate women that backfired because her politically connected family intervened.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_M._Salter#Mayor)* [Women in politics have historically faced gendered attacks](https://www.vox.com/culture/23671498/don-lemon-nikki-haley-sexism-politics-women).  Whether it's Jeannette Rankin (the first female House Rep) being accused of crying and called a 'schoolgirl' for voting not to go to war, or Carol Moseley Braun (the first Black female Senator) having her appearance mocked on a magazine cover, women faced very specific insults when they tried to gain power.  And let's not forget [the rape threats and the kidnapping plot Gretchen Whitmer - but not male Governors who implemented the same COVID restrictions - faced in 2020.](https://theweek.com/articles/942682/gretchen-whitmer-abduction-plot-window-into-american-misogyny)* Think it doesn't happen today?  [Let's hear from elected women themselves,](https://beatty.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/19-women-in-congress-reveal-the-subtle-and-overt-sexism-they-ve-dealt-with-on-capitol-hill) who deal from everything from being mistaken for waitstaff to people thinking their husbands are the Representative or Senator.  And that's before we get to the subtle stuff (the clothing expectations, being expected to manage their kids' lives as well) and the scary stuff (the death threats).  [The problems are even more insane at the lower levels of politics.](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a60568936/women-in-politics-challenges/)**OK, now it's making more sense...**So if women still face ridiculous bullshit when they run for lower offices, you can only imagine what happens when they run for President.  Actually, you don't have to imagine, I'll tell you.* Go back to that original timeline.  Women ran for President from early on, but they were usually relegated to third parties with no chance of success.  [It wasn't until 1964 that a woman got any serious support for President in a major party,](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/federal-executive/women-presidential-and-vice-presidential-candidates-selected) and Hillary Clinton was the first female candidate to win a state in a major Presidential primary in 2008.  Other women ran, but their campaigns died due to lack of popular support, even if they were as qualified as their male contenders.* Both [Hillary Clinton](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/03/hillary-clinton-faced-constant-sexism-in-2016-campaign-says-ex-aide) and [Kamala Harris](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/1108/harris-trump-election-women) faced overt and subtle sexism in their campaigns.  We've discussed the overt stuff at length, and I'll have lots to say about the more subtle sexism in upcoming posts.**The big picture**This post paints a pretty sad view of women's history in US politics.  But there are obvious signs of hope, too.We may have only 12 female Governors and 25 female Senators - but compare those numbers to a generation ago.  We may have taken far too long to elect women of color to prominent roles - but finally, that's starting to change.  And while it may be unthinkable to many voters to have a female President, history will remember Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris as the ones who first set the path.History bends towards progress because a lot of people keep fighting for it.  And we can't let one election - even one that results in Donald Trump - throw us off that course.  While women have had to wait far too long, and work far too hard, for the right to lead, they've kept it up and changed things dramatically.  Together, we can keep it going if we don't give up.  That's the biggest lesson history teaches us.**Questions to consider**1. Did anything about the sexism faced by female candidates and officeholders surprise you?  What do you think goes through peoples' minds when they treat women in power like this?2. Some of the articles in this post talked about how elected women help each other out.  What can we do, as voters and activists, to support women who step up and run?3.

Then came the Reichstag Fire and the Enabling Act which were obviously not democratic, but his initial accession was.Yes, he was appointed by Hindenburg. No, the Nazis never got more than 37% of the vote. Yes, the last free election prior to his appointment saw Nazi support dip to 33%. None of this is remarkable as that's just how parliamentary systems with proportional representation - like Weimar - work.The head of state appoints the head of government, who is usually the head of the largest party (as the Nazis were). Not only that, it's quite rare in proportional representation systems for a party to have much more than 30-ish percent of the vote (modern Germany is one of the few countries with proportional representation where this happens regularly, Weimar was not and immediately prior to the unstable von Papen/Schleicher presidential chancellorships, it was often governed by Center/Liberal coalitions led by parties that had &lt;20 percent support). Getting 33% in a proportional representation system as the largest party is usually a clear win, getting 37% as the Nazis did in the immediately preceding election is a full-on mandate. Now, the Nazis were prevented from forming the government in the prior election because no other party would coalition with them. The third-largest party were the Communists who nobody would coalition with either (and to be fair, while obviously preferable to the Nazis they had previously launched an armed revolt against a Social Democratic-led government). The Nazis and the Communists together were a majority so no government was going to be stable. In November 1932 the Nazis slipped to 33%. Despite the slip, along with the Communists the Nazis still constituted a majority and no government could be sustained without the support of one of the two. The right wing but not Nazi von Schleicher government tried to make concessions or form coalitions to split off Nazi factions or win their acquiescence but failed. Hindenburg basically had to choose between governing by Presidential decree, constant unstable governments and elections every 3 or 4 months, or acceding to the democratic will of the people and letting the Nazis into government. The Nazis slipping to 33% helped convince von Papen that they could manage Hitler and so they chose to appoint him Chancellor. Obviously, this was the wrong choice and led to the end of democracy. But it was the choice that best represented the Weimar electorate at that time.","title":"RFK Jr. compared Trump to Hitler and praised descriptions of his supporters as Nazis"},{"text":"And racist.","title":"Trumps Border Czar Issues Chilling Threat to Democratic Cities - Tom Homan is essentially promising to invade certain cities."},{"text":"Meanwhile, his support base is absolutely ecstastic about his quasi fascist actions.As they say, \\"when someone shows you who they are, believe them\\"","title":"Trumps Border Czar Issues Chilling Threat to Democratic Cities - Tom Homan is essentially promising to invade certain cities."},{"text":"And gain nothing.

I worked with a lot, and most of them did it in ways that would make any evidence they had inadmissible in court. Many of them would talk about meeting them irl, which is a bad idea for reasons I should not have to explain. I worked on Mamamaxs team for a while, and left because they were a bunch of self important losers who got mad at me because I said we shouldnt be compromising the evidences admissibility in court just to make the logs more spicy. All of this said though, it can be done right. Around the time I was 20, I had a group of me and 4 people that were all very good. We all were read on how to gather evidence that is admissible in court, we all would report the person to the FBI, state police (if there were any), county sheriff, and local pd, and everyone agreed meeting them irl was a bad idea. That year, we had made police reports for 40-50 people, and several were arrested. I cant give an exact number. As for this stuff hurting the families of the people thats not my fault, and I refuse to take even an ounce of blame for that. In one of the cases I worked, the guy committed suicide after being released on bail pending his court date. He had a wife and 2 kids. That weighed on me heavily. Do I feel terrible for his family? Absolutely. Is it my fault? No. Im not the one going on the internet to groom children, and Im not the one who killed my self to avoid accountability for doing so. Who knows what he was doing to his kids, or how many people he has hurt. Good riddance.Tldr, it can be done right. It often isnt because people are overly emotional or they are just grifters wanting internet clout, but that isnt always the case. I wouldnt recommend people do it because its emotionally taxing and learning about court admissibility can be a little tricky, but it can be done right and is by many people.
