Alex Padilla says Donald Trump has \\"made it no secret that he has it in for California\\""},{"text":"The hypothesis that Trump won by cheating does not require \\"vote fraud to the tune of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of votes\\". Instead it requires total and massive corruption of our entire electoral system at EVERY level. ALL 50 states + the District of Colombia. ALL the Boards of Elections in ALL 3244 counties. ALL the employees and volunteers responsible for counting and reporting votes in ALL 120,000 or so polling places. To see why the corruption had to be this massive, if it happened, you must look at the reported election results on a local to national level.What happened according to the *reported* 2024 results is Trump gained 2% to 6% in margin (= difference between Trump percentage and Biden / Harris percentage) in each of the swing states: MI, PA, WI, GA, NC, and NV. But Trump made similar or larger gains in all the other, non-swing, states, too. So the national popular vote went from +4.5% D to +1.6% R, a shift of 6.1%. And the R gain in each state wasn't in just one part of that state, it was in most or all of the geographic regions and counties throughout the state.Just as an example, in my state of Colorado, where the outcome was never in doubt, the 2020 margin was +13.5% D, the 2024 margin was +11.0% D, or a shift of 2.5% toward R. In California, where the outcome was \\"even more certain than certain\\", the 2020 margin was +29.2% D, the 2024 margin was 20.2% D, or a much larger shift of 9.0% toward R.So now I can present three hypotheses.HYPOTHESIS I. Total and massive corruption of the election by the Trump/GOP side, including engineering big shifts toward Trump not just in the swing states but in the \\"solid\\" states like CA, not just in all the states but in almost all the counties, presumably to make the result look more conclusive and give Trump a popular vote (plurality) as well as Electoral College win. Obviously the corruption would have to be extremely widespread covering most of the 3244 counties and 120,000 polling places.HYPOTHESIS II. There was a REAL shift toward Trump of 2% to 10% in all 43 non-swing states + NC (which is considered \\"swing\\" but Trump won both times). But the voters in the 6 remaining swing states behaved completely differently than the voters in the other 44 states, and voted as much D in 2024 as in 2020. Trump then needed to corrupt and steal the election ONLY in the six swing states (but including most counties and polling places in those states). Now if we review all the elections from 2000 to 2020, we see there was a NATIONAL shift from D to R or R to D in every pair of elections, including swing and non-swing states.2000 - 2004: national shift D to R2004 - 2008: national shift R to D2008 - 2012: national shift D to R2012 - 2016: national shift D to R2016 - 2020: national shift R to DSo HYPOTHESIS II has to explain TWO amazing and unprecedented things: how the voters in the swing states, for the first time, didn't shift in the same direction as the rest of the country, and then how Trump/GOP managed to steal the election in those 6 states. I say HYPOTHESIS II is so bizarre it can be discarded in favor of either I or III.HYPOTHESIS III. The vote count wasn't corrupted period, Trump actually won both the popular vote and the swing states. (One could still argue that the election was corrupt in the sense that the Trump win was built on propaganda, emotional appeals, and lies, which the media allowed his campaign to get away with, but that's not at all the same as corruption of the vote count itself.)","title":"Trumps Next Term Could See Americas First True Oligarchs, Warns Democracy Activist Garry Kasparov"},{"text":"Excellent.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Departments decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. \\n \\nThe charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.   \\n \\nNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter C who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. \\n \\nFor my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. Theyll be fair-minded. Heres the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice C and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.

Some of us have read a history bookSorry, Ayn Rand doesn't count as history.","title":"[Open Discussion] Bernie Sanders and the Pentagon budget"},{"text":"Voters have memory-holded Trump's foreign policy record. Consider what the state of the war would look like under a second Trump presidency before talking about how history will remember it. When Biden stepped into office, he was stuck in between a rock and a hard place. This century's old conflict was not escalated by the Biden administration. If you want to criticize the U.S.'s long standing, geopolitical partnership with Israel, that's fine, but if you take issue with Biden's \\"complicity\\" in that partnership, which was on some level, obligatory, consider the alternative for a moment.Trump's middle east, foreign policy platform was built around anti-muslim/Palestinian policies, contentious strategies that favored Israel and heightened tensions in the region, his transactional relationship with autocrats and strong men around the globe, his coalition of vehemently pro-Israel allies, and his hardline stance on the war in Gaza. Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with other \\"strongmen,\\" Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. I don't take an indiscriminate or one sided stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as \\"Zionism out of despair\\" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. That being said, Trump's record indicates that he is willing to take an uncompromising stance on this war that he likely knows nothing about.Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved in. When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his handlers, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.What's more, Trump's \\"Middle East peace plan\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. As foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably brief, insincere and ineffective plan also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.In terms of his rhetoric, Trump has referred to all pro Palestinian protestors as \\"radicals.\\" Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said, Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,Trump has not only vowed to crush pro Palestinian protests, but he's threatened to deport *all* demonstrators. Trump has made statements like, they (Israel) \\"have to have a victory.\\" And speaking to Netanyahu, Trump has stated, \\"do what you have to do\\" in Gaza, while he has also said that we have to \\"let Israel finish the job.\\" Republicans in his orbit have also been pushing to annex the West bank, which is a real possibility considering Trump's MAGA coalition is willing to trade their loyalty for a chance to use him to enact their Islamophobic agenda.Trump hasn't laid out a viable plan for addressing the war in Israel. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gazas current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy. Gazas waterfront property could be very valuable, Kushner saidCaution around the controversial topic hasn't kept Trump from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.Trump has a long history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a \\"Muslim problem.\\" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.In 2015, he said he will \\"look at\\" closing mosques.He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.Trump once said he would certainly implement a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registryHe called for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\\"He's called Muslims \\"sick people.\\"Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that the Judeo-Christian west is engaged in a global war against jihadist Islamic fascism.Then there's Trump's first \\"Muslim ban\\", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of \\"radical islamic terror.\\"While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.Let's not forget the recent \\"rally\\" at MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points. Some of it directed at Palestinians. Trump even used \\"Palestinian\\" as a slur during his debate with Biden.All that being said, the consequences for Palestinians and Muslims will be far more severe with Trump in office and a MAGA coalition of fierce loyalists behind him. Not only that, but over the next four years, this agenda will encumber any future progressive efforts.","title":"History Will Not Be Kind to Biden's Complicity in Gaza"},{"text":"It's because they are in Trump's cult and believe anything that felonious, lying, pedophile, racist, rapist scumbag says.","title":"Trump and His Team Are Laughing at Bidens Commitment to Decorum"},{"text":"Instead of criticizing Biden for what he?*has*?done, you want to focus on Trump for what he?*hasn't*?done yet.

This also supports millions of civilian jobs in engineering, logistics, and manufacturing at prime contractors, their countless supplying feeder companies, and the supply chains in between them. Where do the budget cuts come from here, and how do we deal with mass unemployment they may inflict on a lot of cities and regions?Theres undoubtedly a lot of waste at the DoD, much of it from decades of bureaucratic processes and corruption, or development programs that never panned out, but when you dive down into the details, theres really not quite as much to easily cut as people think, unless you dont consider the job creation and support to have value on its own.","title":"Bernie Sanders Agrees with Elon Musk on Slashing the Pentagons Budget"},{"text":"Haley became UN Ambassador on January 27.

Are there not enough male teachers that can connect with younger boys? Are there differences between developing boys and girls that arent being considered?

Theres a real problem of men being afraid to ask for help because of widespread social stigma. Whether this means new outreach programs or introducing more counseling and emotional skills into schools, theres actions we can take to intervene.

Trump did equally well with voters who agreed that inflation had caused them and their family significant or moderate hardship. Among the 46 percent of voters who said their familys financial situation is worse now than four years ago, 81 percent cast a ballot for Trump.This is unfortunately the reality of todays electorate. Despite the strength of the economy and the best in class recovery, there are people who are still struggling and decided to put their trust in the orange sex offender who presented no coherent economic policy and is demonstrably anti worker, anti union and anti-lower class. The Trump populism is real, his message of racism, xenophobia, and transphobia resonates with a large part of the electorate made up largely of working class white voters. This is not faux-populism, it is very real and speaks directly to a large segment of working class, who blame the difficulties of the post pandemic economy on the dirty brown pet eating immigrants. This is as tragic as it is hilarious. There is considerable doubt whether the electorate has any desire for left leaning policies or economic populism. The left leaning congress representatives are quite few and the only democratic governors and senators who have any success in red districts are decidedly moderate centrists. Manchin was a typical example of this and once he left the democrats lost that seat. Leftist policies play well in California and New York but not as well in the rest of America. There is no data to support that there is any reason this will change. Even more clear is that red states have lower minimum wage rates and lower Medicare coverage but the state politicians do not have any pressure to adopt more progressive policies.

I disagree as to your reasoning.Democrats win when they cater to the middle.  Clinton's third way/DLC was the blueprint for the \\"emerging Democratic majority,\\" and Obama was able to position himself as the moderate choice in 2008 and 2012 (despite his left-wing leanings).  [Trump was viewed as more moderate in 2016] (https://www.vox.com/2019/7/2/20677656/donald-trump-moderate-extremism-penalty), and [was viewed as the moderate alternative this past election] (https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/presidential-polls-trump-moderate.html).  The Democratic Party [has moved to the left] (https://jabberwocking.com/if-you-hate-the-culture-wars-blame-liberals/) and moreso than the Republicans have moved right since 2000.  Gallup also does a yearly survey where they ask about people's ideology, and [the most recent survey once again shows \\"liberal\\" as the minority viewpoint] (https://news.gallup.com/poll/548459/independent-party-tied-high-democratic-new-low.aspx).You argue that Bill Clinton pulled the party to the right, and that brought us Trump.  In reality, post-Bill Clinton, the Democrats lurched in the opposite direction, and only when they ran people who could credibly be considered moderates did they win their elections.  So why is Bill Clinton sort of the starting domino that led us to Trump?  [The impeachment in 1998] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton).  The impeachment was perhaps the apex of the \\"moral majority\\"-style thinking that underpinned Republican politics from the 1980s through the \\"Contract With America\\" era.  Clinton's philandering, and the crimes associated with it, should have been a slam-dunk, but Democrats didn't get on board and Clinton [nearly got away with it] (https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/politics/exiting-job-clinton-accepts-immunity-deal.html).  It did, however, put the sort of morality politics on the downswing around the same time that the DNC killed off the DLC-style triangulation of the Clinton/Carville years, with a last gasp on the stem cell issue for Republicans back in the mid-2000s.  Then comes 2010 - the Blue Dog coalition is the last remaining vestige of Clinton-era Democratic Party activity, and they went in with Obama on the stimulus and ACA and got absolutely killed in the 2010 election for it.  Going into the 2009-10 session, there were 54 Blue Dogs in the House. 28 of them lost in 2010. Today, there are 11.If you want to blame the Democrats for not being progressive enough, that's fine.  But you can either be more progressive or win more elections, not both.","title":"CMV: Bill Clinton is the person most responsible for Donald Trump"},{"text":"What border security lmao","title":"[Open Discussion] Bernie Sanders and the Pentagon budget"},{"text":"Look, Ive greatly appreciated his contributions to unions.

The concept of gravity is only a theory, but we accept that gravity exists because the theory makes sense.  Also a democracy just means everyone gets an equal opportunity to express their opinion, it doesn't require that the opinion has to be shared, \\"correct\\", or validated.Yes that is exactly my point. Democracy cannot function properly if the people are poorly informed and largely incorrect or incompetent. That leads to unqualified leaders and officials who act out of spite as opposed to acting out of virtue. Objective facts are not debatable.My point is that there is a large enough population of people that exist who believe that everything is debatable. They are so uninformed that even if you provide them with adequate evidence as proof of a position, they will still refuse to accept it. And they get lied to daily by biased entertainment networks like Fox News. Climate change is debatable depending on the scope of the timeline and the degree of change.Not if youre acting in good faith it isnt.  Furthermore, science by definition is largely  refutable. Yes, by qualified experts. Not by your conspiratorial neighbour who believes vaccines cause autism. One allows for good faith critique and discovery. The other leads to the degradation of faith in scientific inquiry and the rise of anti-intellectualism. It's true that some things become universally accepted, but that doesn't necessarily make them correct.That is exactly the crux of my point. Democracy fails to function properly when people who refuse to understand how anything works get a hold of power and begin breaking down the system and procedures. I also don't think that most people have a problem with facts they can understand, they have a problem believing in a \\"fact\\" that is communicated to them by people who have previously been untrustworthy.No they dont. They have a problem with believing facts that cause them to have to reevaluate their understanding of the world. If it was merely a problem with untrustworthy actors, then nobody would believe Trump at all. But he has a cult that believes him despite famously being a pathological liar.\\n Bias pseudo-journalism. Relaxed border/immigration policy. Career politicians. Among other things.I would have said money in politics and out of touch politicians. I have no problem with someone who has made politics their career as long as theyre honest and virtuous like Bernie Sanders. Either way, the US already has all of those things and theyve gotten exponentially worse during the Trump era.Funnily enough, nations do well with more immigration. Especially developed nations, since the more nations develop, the lower their birth rates fall. So a steady income of young labourers is vital for a functioning society. The problem comes when corporations exploit immigrants to keep pay low.

I am willing to agree to your submission that Clinton set the wheels in motion, so to speak. However, does setting the wheels in motion make you the *most* responsible. Also, did Clinton actually set the wheels, or was he simply another cog in the machine?There is a 16-year gap between Clinton and Trump's first term. It find it hard to believe that nothing more important happened in those 16 years to promote Trump. For example, what about Trump's TV show the *Apprentice*? I submit that Trump being on primetime TV from 2004 to 2015 made him a household name, and greatly contributed to his election. As such, I submit that whoever green-lit the show is more responsible than Clinton.Whatever about the rise of social media? I do not think it is controversial to say that Trump was elected both times because he had a more persuasive social media presence. So how much responsibility do the creators of social media have?How do you explain Obama? Obama is was a popular Democrat. In 2008 he won Iowa, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana. In 2012, he maintained Iowa, Florida, and Ohio. These states now are mostly solid red. If Clinton killed the Democrat party, why did the Democrat Party have such as popular President?What about Bush Jr.? The war on terror in the first decade of the 2000's created a dramatic shift in American politics and society. Also, Bush only won by a slight margin. Had the Supreme Court ruled differently, Gore could have been President. If not for the Supreme Court in 2000, the 21st century could have looked a lot different.What about before Clinton? What about the effects of Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy? Take Nixon for example. Nixon is credited for starting the war on drugs. The war on drugs increased the militarization of the Mexican and Columbian cartels. This lead to more emigration from Central and Southern America. Trump ran on a strong anti-illegal immigration policy. Without Nixon's war on drugs, there would likely be less illegal immigrants, and so Trump would have less ammunition.In short, there are simply too many factors to account for here. Sure, Clinton played a role. But then, everyone plays a role.

The 90s saw the lowest poverty rates for African Americans in US history. And obviously, we would not have Trump if not for HillaryThis actually ignores deeper systemic issues. Trump's rise was fueled by decades of Fox News propaganda, Citizens United (which Clinton judges voted against), and growing wealth inequality that started with Reagan, not Clinton.The real turning point for Democrats wasn't Clinton - it was Citizens United and the rise of dark money in politics.

Congrats on arriving at the party 30 years late. Clintons Third Way politics may have peeled off Reagan Democrats, but he was no conservative hero. He was just trying to survive post-Reagan America, and yeah, it pissed off the left while being nowhere near the right.And Clinton didnt move your party to the right; he moved it into the swamp of opportunism. Welfare reform, NAFTA, and tough on crime policies werent were centrist sellouts, not right-wing victories. He didnt embrace conservative principles like limited government or constitutional fidelity. He embraced poll numbers and whatever kept him on top.And blaming Bill for Trump is hilarious. Americas collective frustration with corrupt elites on both sides of the aisle did, not the Clintons. Trump was the wrecking ball people sent to demolish the establishment, including Clintons crony capitalism. And lets not pretend Hillary losing was some fluke. Her arrogant entitlement to the presidency alienated swing voters. She got out-hustled and outsmarted. Thats on her.The real problem isnt that Clinton moved the Democrats to the right, its that he turned your party into a schizophrenic mess. On one hand, youve got the Bernie crowd demanding socialism on steroids, and on the other, the corporate neoliberals clinging to the Clinton era. Good luck reconciling those two without tearing each other apart. Meanwhile, conservatives are just enjoying watching the Democratic party fall apart.But heres the kicker: youre quoting Bernie Sanders to bash Clinton, but Bernies no constitutional scholar or patriot himself. The guys platform reads like a socialist wet dream, completely out of touch with Americas founding principles of liberty and self-reliance. If you want to restore the working class, maybe try policies that actually empower individuals instead of bloating government.If you want to fix your party, stop blaming dead weight like Bill Clinton for your problems. Hes been out of the picture for decades. Trump didnt win because of Bill, he won because voters didnt trust you.

There are forces that were adversaries to the gods, but they are generally symbolic more than anything. They are usually described as monsters (apep in ancient Egypt) or demons (Raktabija in hinduism), but they are believed to symbolize primordial entropy rather actual than beings.There are deities of order, and then there are deities of chaos, but it's not the same as good and evil. They balance each other out and create a whole.The black and white thinking and categorization of beings into good and evil is generally rooted in Christianity and Islam. From a moral perspective, I would even argue that Satan isn't evil according to scripture. Defiant, yes. Not evil. The evil acts you find in the Bible/Quran is mainly carried out by humans starting with Cain, and ironically perpetuated by their god (ordering them to kill others, etc). All Satan did, according to the Old Testament, was to encourage humanity to defy authority.","title":"Magic: where did this knowledge come from?"},{"text":"That's why birth control is a prescription based medicineIn some countries yes, but here in the UK is it very much available over the counter and I believe some drug stores have them freely on the shelf.

Inevitably the conversation goes like this: They argue that both sides need to agree to a cease fire - cool. They argue that if Israel breaks the ceasefire, they should be sanctioned, punished, etc.. - again cool.They then argue that any aggression that persists from Gaza has to be accepted by Israel. Seriously, ask any \\"pro-Palestinian\\" in the West that if Israel agreed to a complete cease fire but then Hamas continued to fire rockets into Israel if that would be grounds to respond with force.  I've yet to have one say yes to this.  Instead you hear that the conditions and aggression is due to the conditions Israel created. Therefore, Israel has to accept the rockets and aggression until they have an agreement that fixes all the conditions that create the hostilities in the first place.  Even if you were sympathetic to this narrative, this isn't a call for a ceasefire, it is a call for Israel to stop their military aggression only.  Then engage in \\"negotiations\\" while Hamas is still allowed to fire rockets into Israel. Then you ask a negotiated deal looks like and this is typically something where Israel gives in to every concession and gets nothing in return.  Concessions could be as far as agreeing to dismantle Israel as a nation-state and have a one state \\"democracy\\" for the whole of Palestine.  If this is the demand, there is no negotiation to be had. Some have stated 67 borders as what Israel should agree to now.  In a moral sense, I actually agree.  The settlements are BS.But the reality is there are too many of them, the population of them is too much. Imagine trying to bring back this many people to Israel proper - this would make their housing issues even worse and be a political disaster.  No Israeli PM is going to agree to this.While it may seem bad, the issue is an offer that pretty much was 67 borders was on the table back at Taba and Arafat never accepted it, then the 2nd intifada occurred.While I agree that 67 borders is probably the \\"ideal\\" at this point, from the perspective of Israel, you can't say no to a deal, launch a war, lose the war, then say \\"hey can we go back to that deal you offered before our aggression?\\". But this is all a Western centric take, this conflict is largely not actually about the amount of land.  It is about the specific land and the loss of dignity Palestinians feel from losing their specific homes.  They don't want \\"land\\".  Families want \\"their specific\\" land. If you offered land swaps with essentially 67 borders, where Palestine gets its own full state, even connecting the West Bank to Gaza and offered to rebuild Gaza but in exchange, Palestinians had to give up the right of return in full with recognition of Israel's borders - just like in 2001 at Taba, they likely do not take it. So really, the TLDR is the calls for a ceasefire are really calls for Israel to stop their military operation and agree to everything being called for from the other side (and anything short of that justifies continued Palestinian aggression but not an Israeli response).","title":"Up to Hamas now, Biden says, announcing US-brokered Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal"},{"text":"I highly recommend the book This Is Your Brain on Birth Control by Sarah E Hill PhD.","title":"Any interesting conspiracies about birth control pill?"},{"text":"Dont drop your guard.liberals are like the hydra!

And he did. Pence got to run the country and execute most of his desires while trump went around playing power queen.   Trump has no interest in actually doing the actual job of president (and he's said so in various ways several times)  and as long as they're going to be a loyal lapdog to him and not upstage him they'll get to run the actual job however they want again.  Pence was practically a genie in a bottle for right wing christian and nationalist policy.  Vance knows the game.  And being that vance, theil, musk, miller, bannon, etc. are all various forms of accelerationists we are in for one hell of a ride.  And Project 2025 is a wish list and full playbook written by vance and friends.   Trump will be out golfing and rallying (what prez needs to do a rally every other week during the job?!)  and playing bachelorette with our institutions and robber barons, throw in some chaos several times a week for the cameras and to keep the OODA loop going and the spotlight on him.  Republicans got caught flat footed in 2016 with the chaos of actually taking power and installing a working cabinet-  Now that their eyes are open to just how much they can do with impunity when trump is in power and how much more power they can seize,  the think tanks have all learned their lesson and they've spent the last 8 years planning with stacks of executive orders ready for an autograph party.      Again, Vance had a LOT to do with project 2025.  Wrote some of their other papers and was going to be head of heritage too.  And heritage is the think tank with nearly every important right wing group contributing to them. They are the republican base. The republican meda and the christian right base and media. Let's also add that Vance (and musk, and thiel) and his far right catholic nationalist youtube bros are into a religious techno monarchy dream ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrPNvVhKLU ) of Curtis Yavin's philosophy.  So I'd expect quite a bit of 'regime change' this time around coming from vance and friends. \\nAnd this is nifty:  \\n\\"Years before he was the Republican vice presidential nominee, however, Vance openly touted that influence. So theres this guy Curtis Yarvin who has written about these things, Vance said on a right-wing podcast in 2021. Vance didnt stop at a simple name-drop. He went on to explain how former President Donald Trump should remake the federal bureaucracy if reelected. I think what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, and replace them with our people. And when the courts stop you, stand before the country and say, The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.This piece of advice is more or less identical to a proposal Yarvin floated around 2012: Retire All Government Employees, or RAGE. As described by Yarvin, RAGEs purpose is to reboot the government under an all-powerful executive, a sort of debugging. Yarvin sees elections as ineffective methods for political change because, while the head of state and their political appointees may change, the career bureaucrats (who, in Yarvins view, are really calling the shots) stay put. If Americans want to change their government, theyre going to have to get over their dictatorphobia, Yarvin said in the 2012 speech in which he described RAGE\\" https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24266512/jd-vance-curtis-yarvin-influence-rage-project-2025Here's some lowdown on the nationalist catholic bros. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrK9S5YxJfEAnd here's 2025 in full from their site.

The rules should be moral and carefully examined by experts, and based on universal values and virtues.Second, all hospitals should be private, and any working person should choose to make a contract with a private insuranse company that should be competitive with other companies about the benefits you can get (the amount of money you are insured for in case of disease or injury etc., and most importantly the hospital(s) that you can go to in case of an emergency). It's up to the individual to climb the social ladder and get a better deal for themselves to get even better healthcare. A clear threshold should be introduced as a law, about what benefits a working individual should have even with a minimal amount of monthly payment. If a working person becomes an invalid beecuase of a disease or injury, no matter his social standing, there should be a law that will guarantee a clause in his contract with the insurance company that will cover his expenses until the expiration of his life.Third, people that cannot work because of a disability during birth should be helped by nonprofit organizations, to be more blunt, by the vast amounts of money that churches (religions) accumulate, and in that way actually practicing what they preach. This will raise their reputation and humility, as well as humanity that they are losing, that will lead to people being more emphatetic to each other, and donating even more to them. Of course, other secular nonprofit organizations should exist.Four, all people who can work, but do not work, should have access to healthcare, but will not have a privilidged status for examination (if not an emergency), and will pay an unfavorable amount of money to the hospital, since they are not insured. IOW, the individual is responsible for his own finances, I should not pay for the health of a stranger. Five, it should be your own choice, no matter if you work or not, whether you would want to pay for your own healthcare, and the govenment should not be able to take your money as taxes, even if they claim they are for your benefit.","title":"My views on healthcare as a foreign libertarian."},{"text":"We constantly underestimate how many low-information voters there are","title":"Trumps Next Term Could See Americas First True Oligarchs, Warns Democracy Activist Garry Kasparov"},{"text":"Trouble is that so many people think that with a stroke of the pen is a way to solve everything.

I've heard people like John Stossel use the comparison of LASIK saying \\"Let the market handle it\\", but the problem is that you can survive just fine without LASIK, but for most ER situations you just can't shop around and pick a lower price vendor.  The other challenge is with the Insurance model; that's great when it's a rare event and many people can pool together to cover those rare outliers.  But everyone needs healthcare, and not just when something goes wrong and the end up in the ER.  Everyone needs annual checkups and care for a variety of issues over their lifetime.  So yes, I think potentially healthcare in some form as a government service could be the best solution.  This is also easily the most contrarian position I hold to most Libertarian beliefs and I'm sure many people here will disagree.","title":"My views on healthcare as a foreign libertarian."},{"text":"No surprise when Pedos like Taylor Swift endorse Kamel toe.","title":"PEDO Liberal compares inseminating a cow to molesting a child.

Trump, like Orbn, has bent the powers of state toward personal enrichment  and allowed his top officials to do the same.When Hungarians found out I was American, many of them almost immediately pointed out the similarities between the two men. Several Hungarians told me, with an air of quiet sympathy, that they understood what we in the United States are currently going through.Trump and Orbn are lovely guys, Istvn Jnos Tth, the director of Budapests Corruption Research Center, said sarcastically.

She spent years afterward working to make the transition to democracy function, to turn the vision she had risked her freedom for into a reality. And now shes giving up her perch in government because, in her words, it doesnt really matter what you do in the legislature.Her trajectory tells the story of how a true believer in democracy can be defeated not by force of law but through exhaustion: a collapse of any faith in working through the system after years of fruitless struggle.Hungary is not the only country where people  even the best ones, like Szelnyi  can be ground down like this.

Theres a common belief that because weve lived in a patriarchal society so long, young boys and men as individuals dont need to be considered and should just step aside.If there arent liberal and leftist counterparts to Andrew Tate or any of the other right wing male public figures that are depicting masculinity, its hardly a surprise that young impressionable disaffected men think the right cares more about giving them a guide.","title":"Fetterman says Democrats lost male voters by being insulting, condescending"},{"text":"I know of the quote cause of Dune, but I don't think Frank Herbert made it originally.

After which, he and his family were killed in Bolshevik captivity. The Bolsheviks were responsible for Soviet Union/Russian communism through the 20th century. So, if one of the children (Tatiana) was not actually killed on that day that everyone was murdered, then her descendant would be the true last Romanov and royal bloodline descendant. Melania and Barron both. In a meeting with Putin few years ago he gives Trump a soccer ball. Weird gift right? Do Putin or Trump particularly like soccer?

Imagine if you had to make monthly payments to Walmart and if you shopped at any other store they would send armed men to seize the property you purchased and fine you.   That is how the central state operates. It is that sort of thing that is objectionable. It is the coercive use of violence and monopolization of important social institutions that is the problem. The problem with something like the FDA isn't that they certify drugs and set standards for food and labeling and such things. The problem with the FDA is that you are required by law to always make sure they are profitable and if you defy them, in either ignoring their edicts or failing to pay them, then they can take your property, fine you, and imprison you.  The certification and regulation of food, doctors, drugs, and such things are a very good thing.  The regulation isn't the problem.  The problem is the monopolization, compulsory payments, and violence. There are lots of private companies out there that provide certification processes for food and drugs that are far superior to that provided by the FDA and, in fact, the FDA relies on these sorts of companies in order to function.  People do it for a variety of reasons.  One of the major reasons is religious.  There exists companies that monitor and certify food to make sure it is Kosher or Halal. So, yes, if the FDA broke off and became \\"private\\" and people wanted to pay them for their services to help ensure proper and clean food/drugs/etc then that is perfectly fine. In fact this is all a possible way to move away from a central state. Just give up on the idea of restitution and compensation of the evils that state has wrought on society and allow all the bureaucracies to break off and become employee-owned groups. So instead of just dissolving things like the post office, FDA, FCC, and forestry service...  you just give everything over to those different groups.

MeToo was great, it really changed the conversation around men who sexually assault women. The problem is, in todays TikTok/Twitter quick hitting discourse, people refused to be careful about making sure they decried men who sexually assault women, without simplifying it to just men. Entertainment and media are no better about this, and a lot of modern dramas and sitcoms are written like theyre just copy-pasting confrontational progressive rage-tweets, which often means raging at men as a general class. It even extends to commercials: even as a woman, I notice that at least half of all the ads on TV have a man be the butt of the joke, an incompetent idiot, etc. in a way theyd never portray women these days.But its the same problem the progressive movement had with abolish the police.

Those tend to just end up hurting their chances even more by becoming insufferable. Even for those not in that camp, there still isn't an easy way out for them. Tim Miller from the Bulwark suggested Zelensky as a male role model, but unfortunately, it's just easier to jump on the hate train for people like him. Less thinking involved, more rage at everyone else. I'd offer Fetterman and  Ruben Gallego as other potential male role models (skipping Walz cause he looks a bit too old to appeal to younger dudes).

I don't want kids, never wanted kids. I have endo.

When my periods come in now, they're not as bad, though the pain is still pretty high from the cysts on the organs I don't even want. When I got off of the little amount of regulation the implant gives me (temporary when I was 26), my period came back like it was before - extremely heavy bleeding for 10 days, resulting in iron deficient anemia. And yes, I've been on record for over half my life - since I was 15, telling my doctors I don't want kids, please write it in my file so that when I'm in my 30s with no kids trying to get these painful organs removed, there's proof I haven't changed my mind. I'm queer, so no \\"husband approval\\" (also came out as queer before birth control).

Movie Keating is the fantasy version of teaching the way CSI is the fantasy version of forensics.I teach AP Literature and we revel in poetry all the time, so I'm about as close to him as a teacher can get (except I work in a public school).

A couple of times a year, I can command their attention with a really killer poem or passage. Most of the time, I need structure. What actually tends to happen to teachers like him is that they develop a close inner circle of students who are devoted to them, and who do probably learn and grow a lot. But then what's going on with the other 3/4 of the class? They're not learning. They're staring out the window or writing notes to each other or (today) on their phones. They don't do the reading, so their reading skills don't improve. The class in DPS isn't structured in such a way that there's accountability or instruction in the basics. The movie just pretends that if a teacher is compelling enough, all the kids will just listen. Don't get me wrong--I love the movie. The fundamental basis of what Keating believes is what I believe too.

Those who come forward to expose the lies maybe lying themselves.

Basically, the AI would have to screen people from voting, and only allow people to vote if they can demonstrate sufficient knowledge about various relevant things. And ideally it would have some sort of way to educate people, much like when Keanu Reeves learned Kung Fu in The Matrix. But I realize that's even less likely to probably ever be really achievable, so at the very least you could just disqualify people who are voting purely based off of emotion and propaganda, and don't actually understand the policies that various political people are trying to enforce. Of course, if we had an AI this big, would we even need people to govern us, or could we all just dedicate ourselves to science and arts and let the AI control the economy and the like, and maybe usher in a new era of global Peace?And before everybody comes and down votes me to hell, I know the chance of an AI like this coming into being is probably one in the trillion. But when I try to think of interesting ways that we could actually make sure that only people who really understand how things work to a point where they can make educated attempts at voting for people to influence policy, this is the only thing I even see having a chance of actually being fair. Because anything with supervision less than a perfect AI is going to be subject to the whims of the supervising board. So again, I realize it won't realistically happen, but I can wish. Because every time I hear one of my conservative friends talk about how they want to vote for Trump because they think he'll make gas cheaper. And they blame Biden for the prices on stuff, I just want to pull my hair out. Like, bro, Putin started a war a few years ago, that sent significant ripples through the global economic supply chain.

Meanwhile, every post I see from a European, they're at least intelligent enough to realize that whoever is leading their country is not responsible for all the disruptions that came about from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Anyway, forgive me my random tangent, I do agree that there's no perfect system available in our time. I wish people had the maturity to not vote with just their emotions, and to actually look at the policies and the history behind it all, but what can you do, millions of people are supremely disappointing.","title":"CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only"},{"text":"Fuck.

There were no podcasts or independent blogs up until the invention of the Internet. Though it could be argued that people largely agreed on ideas and \\"facts\\" throughout the early and mid 19th century, it could also be argued that there were too few sources of information for the public to make informed choices based on accurate data and diverse opinions - it wasn't until the Fairness Doctrine of 1949 that an attempt was even made to force broadcasters to provide neutral coverage of news and politics. It wasn't until 1896 that the public started calling for greater campaign finance restrictions. 18% of the population couldn't participate in this \\"civic duty\\" to vote until post civil war, and, even then, systemic discrimination and general racism were and still are a problem in determining who can participate. In spite of these things, we have the democracy we have had.Also, there's probably a great argument to make that the introduction of choice in what constitutes as \\"fact\\", as proposed through differing media sources, has likely created an era where true scientific facts are no longer treated with authority. By educating everyone to think critically about everything, we have allowed space for everyone to decide what constitutes as fact through finding an authority that agrees with them or becoming the authority they need to feel correct. I'm not advocating for state-controlled media, but, absent a true authority, the gaps will be filled by both independent, unbiased, factual authority seeking to do good and malicious, ignorant authorities that exploit and harm people incapable of critical thought.","title":"CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only"},{"text":"Our Father Love has a way of getting His Will accomplished without forcing it, as far as His children go.

But ultimately people who are *productive* (and educated) are progressive, so eventually the dead weight will shed and great things will be achieved.We didn't live through WW2 and Nazi Germany so honestly we've had a pretty damn good run so far, with amazing technological advancements and more freedom and luxuries than just about any time in human history.Stock markets melt upwards before they crash, night is darkest before the dawn, there's quiet before the storm - things aren't always what they seem.

It's like saying a guy isn't a pedophile, he's just a ebephile or whatever. Still shows he's a criminal and violates the bodies of women. A court determined he committed the same felony multiple times with a very contentious justification. They said his payment to Stormy Daniels was actually a campaign contribution even though it was paid back on full. When's the last time you heard of a campaign contribution being paid back like a loan? It's unprecedented. Those are misdemeanor crimes and are only felonies because another \\"crime\\" was committed. That justification would never fly for any other person on the planet.Nah, I'll side with the court here. Dude paid someone off to keep them from releasing damaging info. I don't care how common it is how he did it. The fact is he did it and deserves to be branded as a felon and a criminal for it.

This highlights that you've consumed and regurgitated some misinformation.

Apparently, Congress at the time when they were trying to stop any secessionists from holding office would have been just fine with the president committing treason.Regardless then, I'd still say it's pretty dumb to allow felons to hold office. Like, we stop them from being able to vote in most of the country yet it's just fine to let them hold the highest office in the land? Absolutely crazy.

People go on and on about the left and Democrats failing to message for men when they usually bend over backwards for them. Like, you mentioned how they focused the control of women's bodies, yet failed to mention how they also did ads on men being pressured to vote certain ways and the like. Also, are we supposed to pretend Republicans and their supporters aren't trying to control women's bodies? They've killed women with their draconian abortion laws yet apparently mentioning that and how this is a result of Republicans is us being too mean to the poor guys who just think women don't deserve to decide what should happen to their own body. Oh, and these same guys are the ones now going \\"your body, my choice,\\" so it's not like they aren't blatant about this either.I just think most men are more likely to be right-wing since superiority over women is always gonna seem like it gives them more than equality. Like, there are plenty of feminist and left wing guys out there trying to be good influences and role models for men (and they aren't telling men they're all evil like the right always claims). Yet, most will flock to whatever manosphere guy is blaming feminism for all their problems. Why? Because it means they don't need to do anything to improve themselves and can claim any problems they have are because of feminism. Like, oh, you can't get a gf because you demean every woman around you and are a creep towards them? That's just because evil feminism told them they deserve better while you actually deserve a submissive gf who does everything for you.This is also worse now because kids are all on social media where algorithms push them towards this crap. It was a thing even years ago when I was kid during GamerGate and started thinking feminism was this evil thing since all the gaming YouTubers I watched started recommending or covering this sort of crap. That same crap happens today, but often even more as even just having a new account start watching basic kid content will often end up on some Joe Rogan, Andrew Tate, or some other manosphere guy since the algorithms just push what gets views rather than what might be good content.","title":"CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only"},{"text":"Liberalism has, at its core, economic liberalism as it's economic philosophy.

He gave the Advaita Vedanta philosophy so that such things don't trouble the people who believe in the philosophy.Thus, I would say that those with evil intentions have always lived and existed between us. That's how god made them, to exist simultaneously with the good people and make everyone play the game together. It is all about deciphering what their black magic is.

The second ex was a researcher type, pre iPhone era but the internet was alive and growing.  She had reservations but had health issues that the BC would help with some symptoms, but she didnt like it and we used condoms too, in between trying different ones.My takeaway from BC and other Pharma, the Medical Industry, is that patients are used as guinea pigs to some extent.Theres a Freakonomics Pod/Radio show, a mini series of 3 episodes called Bad Medicine that goes into Pharma drugs, testing, the business, funding, and studies that get retracted.  I listened in 2016, but it had an impact due to my own tribulations with MDs.  Its very much worth listening to for the uninitiated, just like I was and to some degree, still am.  Ive heard some interviews over the years, probably on Fresh Air, about Birth Control.  I can recall one about Loretta Lynn and her song about the Pill, and how that impacted opinions of the day.  I can remember hearing stories about how it helped Women who were getting older and just didnt want kids.  Ppl may think of accidental scenarios, and those exist, but theres also just the attitudes about marriage and coupling, a man is the head of the house stuff where he comes home drunk, again, and she gets pregnant, again, and theyre already burdened with other kids economically, probably more.The Pill was part of the Womens Lib of the post 60s.  Women that didnt necessarily want the worries of getting pregnant, and wanted the freedom to have casual sex, just like the Men were already doing.  It gave Women control of their lives.For reference, Death, Sex, and Money Pod- has a 2 part episode, older, with Ellen Burstyn, actress.   As a dude, it was eye opening to listen to some of the obstacles she faced dealing with a Mentally Ill husband in the 60s.  Itll add context about why the Pill was so important then, among other things.  Havent heard that one in years either, yet Im referencing it because its good for ppl far removed from that era to see how far western society has come, and crazy how it wasnt until then.I think the idea of the Pill is/was a good thing.  Im not read enough on the Data, but I recall one ex speaking to links to ovarian cancer.  That explains also had cysts removed from her ovaries, my cousin did too.  I know my ex didnt use BC growing up in her conservative home, so IF her limited use of BC was a factor, it didnt take long for those symptoms to occur.I also think junk in our food is a major contributor to some of the health issues that Women have when theyre prescribed BC.  At least after theyre 18, beyond pregnancy risks.I never wanted kids and never had issues with condoms.  There was luck involved too, but even in my immaturity, there was actual acknowledgement in the moment from Her on where Id finish if I wasnt using one.  The dudes that have issues with condoms are dumb, imo.If a Woman wants and needs to use BC, thats her choice.  Women are informed and have the ability to decide.  Using it solely for BC because theyre dude wont use condoms speaks to their choice in Men, and the dude himself.  I know its not 100% effective, but he can pull out.  And if he says he cant, then hes double dumb, I say.","title":"Any interesting conspiracies about birth control pill?"},{"text":"I know this might be a somewhat serious aside, but if youre concerned for your mental health, it is far better to practice healthy detachment.Remove political news (and especially news, aka a bunch of opinion pieces and talking heads) from your *daily* routine.Lets be clear: being informed is important.

It seems some people are assuming its Fuentes because Destiny had written about finding a guy to suck off during or near the week that Fuentes was visiting Destiny to participate in some bloodsport stream.Fuentes also apparently claims to be a virgin, and to my knowledge, has never had a girlfriend, which adds fire to rumors that he is gay, like other bachelors of a certain age frequently are.  But Fuentes would probably say its because hes devoutly religion in his Christian faith and doesnt believe in premarital sex.Honestly, I wouldnt be surprised if Fuentes is gay.  I think its unlikely that he hooked up with Destiny.As an aside, theres also a breakup letter supposedly sent to Destiny from conservative internet pundit Lauren Southern describing their relationship, the affection and attraction she has for him, and why shes breaking up with him (due to his fallout with ex wife Melina).  So depending on if you think Southern is a Nazi, theres that.Maybe Destiny is a hatefucker, I dunno.  There was also leaked POV footage of Destiny fucking his ex wife and talking dirty to her, which is unrelated to anything here.Maybe the footage of Fuentes and Destiny will come out, but I havent seen it.","title":"When I said liberals are in bed with fascists, I didn't know it was literally true."},{"text":"Women are fertile for ~3-6 days per cycle/month. Hormonal birth control is a health scam. Fertility is a sign of overall health, and if a woman is experiencing cycle-related health issues, that is a sign their hormones are unhealthy/imbalanced. Things like PMDD and PCOS are \\"treated with\\" birth control pills (hormone therapy) but those \\"therapies\\" *mask her hormones* and *does not heal them.* Symptoms may be managed this way, but will never be healed. And going off the birth control will cause the symptoms (or even worse ones) to re/appear - because the pills did nothing at all!And worse, girls who have just started their cycles are put on birth control to improve minor things like acne!The rabbit hole into women's health is deep.","title":"Any interesting conspiracies about birth control pill?"},{"text":"Only had one dream like that.

Worker power needs to be built up to get out of this extended interregnum, and thats been the motivation to support sanders bid to transform the party all along.  A first objective is to disentrench the big donor base controlling the party by making the sanders campaign finance model a party platform plank.  Boycotting any politician that takes big donations would be paramount.  Naming and shaming, trump style, might help too.  Remember when trump called out his opponents in the primary debates when some of the audience booed him?  It was brutal and effective.If this broad objective isnt achieved, there will be no substantive change.  The challenge will be that they will be dealing with much smaller amounts of money.  Thats why its of utmost importance to succeed in making big donor connections anathema.Maybe its impossible, but its whats needed.

There is such thing as RISUG and it goes by other names that has been in clincial trials for ages now. It is either being actively suppressed or the funding will not go to it because it would hurt corporate profits. Basically a reversible vasectomy procedure that is cheap.
