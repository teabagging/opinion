But instead of having those appointed, those offices could be elected by a citizens assembly or other ways. What is important that even through representative democracy, there is proper separation of powers, there is not just one flow of democratic legitimacy through a single assembly per level. It is important for separation of powers and that more nuanced approaches are taken. The worst thing a representative democracy can devolve while seemingly still being one to is a super-parliamentary system, with essentially only party soldiers in it. Probably majority bonus with closed lists is the worst system (apart from FPTP and other single winner systems), with closed list PR following it. People will rightly resent not only not having personalized votes, but for the backroom deals as the dark side of coalitions. And I say this as someone who favors coalitions, likes parties. But parties shouldn't be too strong. And people should get used to casting not just choose one ballots and thinking in a tribal way, so that is also why closed list PR is one of the worst. At least in some systems you can vote differently for president, lower house, upper house etc, and don't have to subscribe wholesale for one party. That is the bare minimum for democracy.\\"Democracy is more than just the ballot box\\" - exactly, but deliberative democracy should be done in citizens assemblies, modern legislatures are really no longer the right place for it.But even within representative democratic aspects, it is important that multiple streams of democratic legitimacy check each other, and too strong parties should be highly discouraged. While there is such a thing as too fractured legislature, if democracies could work without parties, but that is unrealistic at the moments, and is not a priority, but incentives for strong party loyalty should be balanced out with opportunities for true independents to have an influence.","title":"What is the solution to Americans voting too often (too many elections) ?"},{"text":"Thin skinned douchebag.","title":"Trumps New Post on Obama Proves Hes Losing It"},{"text":"EDA is a tiny part, most of it is actual dollars. ?","title":"Biden Unveils $612 Million in Post-Hurricane Aid on Florida Trip"},{"text":"Remind me in one year","title":"US Deep state will assassinate Trump, blame the assassination on Iran and declare war on Iran and back Israel with troops on the ground in 2025."},{"text":"For the record, she never said anything about \\"Jewish space lasers.\\" That was made up by presstitutes. Her posts were focusing on actual satellite-based technology that we know exists, technology that appears to have been used repeatedly for land grabs. Then on a completely separate post she mentioned that a Rothschild is on the board of the company that produced the satellite. This is where weaponized propaganda invented the \\"Jewish space lasers\\" narrative.Also, there are countless patents on technology to control hurricanes and tornadoes. Not to mention the fact that the US and Russia have been controlling the weather as a weapon since WW2. The US even celebrates the fact that they used weather modification during the Vietnam war to extend the monsoon season to flood the ho chi minh trail. The UAE recently flooded their desert by underestimating how powerful the outcome of their weather modification would be.To think it's a coincidence that a record breaking storm just happened to wipe out the exact area where a deal between a mining company and the DoD was made and set to begin a couple of months later is akin to believing that the exact perimeter of a monorail deal that's been in the works for years *just happened to* burn out the exact properties that refused to sell to the state during a random wildfire.Our so-called representatives are bought and sold by the highest bidder.

And given the power of incumbency, it's hard to build a bench that can challenge entrenched politicians without giving upstart politicians a way to cultivate a base of their own.It's a hard and delicate balance to manage.

It was going to be a landslide victory, yet it came down to 40k votes across three states that determined the winner.

Now historically the polls have always underestimated trump, so I'm guessing that will still be true but to a lesser extent. RCP, a polling aggregator, shows trump taking Pennsylvania/Wisconsin/Michigan. He only needs one of those to win. Betting markets all have him winning. So I'm simply going by the available data we have. But here's what's more important. 2020 was a referendum against Trump. Now that democrats have been in charge, we're seeing a referendum against democrats. It's not that people love Trump or support him, it's people voting *against* democrats. Trumps current approval rating is higher than any time in his presidency. I also think Jill stein is going to blow her 2016 numbers out of the water.

The US already has a progressive taxation system but a flat tax would be not only more reasonable and easier to plan around for the country but also easier for the tax payer to understand and plan around 2. It has been proven time and again minimum wage increase triggers inflation to the tune of 30% of the increase at least, so at minimum if everyone gets a $1 increase inflation across the board will be at minimum $0.30.That also is not factoring in the additional costs that could come up. California recently decided to increase minimum wage on people who work at fast food restaurants, the result was an extreme loss of jobs through the implementation of automation that was held off due to the initial investment cost as well as the closure of many smaller businesses not only eliminating jobs but also competition allowing the remaining businesses to raise prices with impunity.3.

And that's just if he has only a billion, more than that and the numbers get insane, I promise you that money is worth it for them to leave.

The billionaires get that way largely through monopolies that enrich them, and monopolies mean less competition amongst employers for best employees (which suppress wages)\\n* Clamping down on immigration. Part of the reason workers couldnt unionize as effectively was because there was boat after boat of people coming in and offering to do the work (cheaper).\\n* A series of SEC fixes to stop stock market tricks and populations + various workers rights around safety and hours per week.Thats the formula, and we just need to repeat it.Liberals are fixated on the last one, aware of but completely inept on the first, and in utter denial of the second in a way thats rather out of touch.Conservatives have correctly identified the second as a problem area, and reject doing anything about the other two.You cant just pull the one lever you like and ignore the one you dont; you have to do all three. There are mega corporations now that should be split up.We are handing out student visas &amp; h1bs and ignoring illegal immigration, which is giving up opportunities to foreign nationals instead of American workers while driving down wages.A well documented hack that the rich use is borrowing money against their unrealized sock assets. Simply closing that hack (not allowing the stocks to be used as collateral until sold and taxed) is the kind of thing you need.A wealth tax sounds lovely and all, but fundamentally wealthy individuals can move to other countries and dont think for a moment that once the government opens the door to unrealized assets they wont point it to upper middle class pensions / home equity / you name it. They said the same thing about income tax when it was passed (ie, its only for the robber barons).So Id much rather we just employ the tried and true methods rather than some feel good band aid combo of wealth tax and aggressive minimum wage that have higher risks of backfiring.","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"\\"the daily wire news\\"Dude, this article was written so right wing pundits could attack Harris","title":"Why is Biden throwing Harris under the bus?

Wealth is your net worth in asset value while income is the amount of cash you actually receive in a given year, in simple terms. What you are talking about involves wealth confiscation which would by definition include people who have 401ks that have reached substantial values in the form of unrealized gains even if the income is relatively modest. You also seem to be under the misconception that wealth is zero sum. That is definitely not the case. There is not a finite amount of wealth in the world. You could write a song today on a napkin and copyright it and instantly become a millionaire if the song is popular. Your net worth is just what a hypothetical average buyer under no compulsion to buy would pay you if you were under no compulsion to sell. We calculate the net worth of most billionaires who own publicly traded companies as the current stock price times the number of shares they own. That is flawed because if they were to unload their stock into the open market the price per share would tank both due to higher supply and the fact that it would signal that something may not be right with the company. Finally the problem I think you and most others truly want to solve is poverty rather than income inequality. The most sure fire way to improve socioeconomic status for all is innovation.

However, I do also feel that addressing wealth inequality requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond just a wealth tax. Here are some major problems and solutions that I've come up with after doing some research which would address the wealth inequality (if our politicians could ever be convinced to implement any of them):1. **Capital Gains Reform**: Equalizing tax rates on income and investments ensures a fairer tax system, preventing the wealthy from benefiting disproportionately.\\n2. **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: UBI offers financial security for all, reducing poverty and dependence on unstable jobs as automation and globalization reshape the workforce.\\n3. **Education Access**: Investing in affordable education ensures equal opportunities for skill development and higher-paying jobs, addressing the root causes of income inequality.\\n4. **Stronger Labor Rights**: Strengthening unions and labor rights allows workers to negotiate fair wages and benefits, reducing wage stagnation.\\n5. **Estate Tax Reform**: Closing loopholes prevents wealth concentration in a few families, ensuring wealth circulates more evenly.\\n6. **Affordable Housing**: Policies that make housing more accessible free up income for savings and investment, helping families build wealth.\\n7. **Wealth-Building Programs**: Government-backed savings programs help low- and middle-income earners access tools to grow wealth, leveling the playing field.\\n8. **Healthcare Reform**: Affordable healthcare reduces financial strain on lower-income families, improving their ability to save and invest.\\n9. **Public Investment in Social Services**: Expanding public infrastructure and services like childcare and transportation increases economic mobility and reduces financial burdens.By implementing these solutions, society can more effectively reduce wealth inequality and create a fairer distribution of opportunities and resources.","title":"CMV: A wealth tax to reduce the income inequality is integral in improving the current economy"},{"text":"When you incubate a lab grown Hillary Clinton, this is what you get.","title":"Democrats Perplexed Why Candidate Nobody Ever Voted For Is Slipping In The Polls"},{"text":"When I was a Democrat, I used to say that Democrats should never worry what Republicans might say because Republicans were going to say something negative about Democrats, no matter what Democrats did or did not do.

It is proportionally representative, apportioned by the Cube Root Rule, and embodies procedural democracy.- the President moves over to the Senate, stripped of all executive power, and is instead appointed by the House from among the sitting Senators.  The VP is appointed by the Senate majority from among its own sitting members as well.  The President actually presides over the Senate, meaning they determine the business before the Senate floor.  The VP presides in the President's absence.  (Essentially this means that the House appoints the senate \\"majority leader\\" while the actual \\"majority leader\\" is more like the President Pro Tempe.- the Senate is no longer a voting body, buy instead serves as a Federal Council of State (the collective heads of state).  As such, they originate legislation and appointments to the House for approval.  They do so by holding public deliberations, analogous to a court, with each state (via concurrence of both Senators) producing its own version of a bill or its own nomination for appointment.  This means that the Senate transmits a set of options for the House to choose from.- the House can still informally originate its own legislation through its leverage over the appointed Senate President, in which case the Senate essentially reviews the proposed bill and returns amended versions.- Congress shall appoint the Cabinet, either whole or in part, through the appointment process.  The Senate hearings would essentially act as policy deliberations &amp; candidate interviews, and the House would choose from many configurations.  - Likewise, the Senate regularly summons members of the Cabinet, compelled by threat of suspension, and may impeach those officers, with the House voting to remove or not. - The Cabinet would be the collective heads of government, and be presided over by a \\"Prime Secretary / Chief Secretary / Secretary General\\", whose only natural powers would be analogous to that of the Chief Justice.  But each individual Cabinet secretary would otherwise have authority over their own department.- Congress shall institute Federal Academies by which all executive officers of the federal government shall be qualified, and no such officer shall have been elected to office within ten years of their commission, or be eligible for any elected office for ten years after their commission.- the Electoral College shall be rebranded the Executive College, and each state legislature shall appoint to it a number of qualified federal officers from whom the Senate may choose as nominations for Cabinet appointments.  In other words, the executive branch becomes a technocracy and not a political office.- Congress shall appoint judges to the inferior courts, but the all the appellate circuits shall be merged into one giant Supreme Court and all final appeals (what we think of as SCOTUS cases today) shall be heard by a panel of rotating circuit delegates.  Optionally, the full supreme court can opt to hold an _en banc_ ruling where all ~200+ Justices are limited to joining one of the opinions already produced by the chief panel.","title":"What is the solution to Americans voting too often (too many elections) ?"},{"text":"You really thought you were on to something here.","title":"Trumpsters blaming Dems for the simple fact Trump does not care about their safety nor their needs"},{"text":" triggered\\nYou mean fhrious?","title":"Trumps New Post on Obama Proves Hes Losing It"},{"text":"Democrats typically have more robust field organization than republicans.

Another is failing to answer: are aggressive people simply more likely to play violent video games, and its a situation where a normal person playing a violent video game wouldnt be affected?One study that Im having trouble finding attempted to answer that question by separating kids who had previously been disciplined for aggressive actions and kids who had not. They found that video games actually had no effect on the aggressive kids (didnt make them any worse or better), but did actually make the non aggressive kids slightly more aggressive.?Again, the issues are sample size and answering the question: is this a permanent change, or simply a brains temporary response to producing more adrenaline during a game.The point is, studies are pretty inconclusive, and I havent seen any that really settle the issue one way or the other.?","title":"Democrats shut down Arizona office after shootings\\n"},{"text":"I believe there is enough evidence already out there for Trump to sign an executive order when he gets into office to ban the Democratic Party as a terrorist organization.","title":"Top Dems Threaten Not To Certify A Trump Election Victory"},{"text":"Obama wasn't in office till after the 07 crash.

Only a handful mention Iran by itself.That all said, I don't see this happening, your interpretation is IMHO wrong. The move would make sense with a different VP, but not Vance.When anonymous actors got Oswald to kill JFK, it made sense because JFK was putting extreme pressure on Israel to be restrained with its nuclear program etc, it resulted in changes. Johnson reversed those policies, going so far as to even cover up the USS liberty false flag. In the case of Trump, Vance is more restrained on both Israel and Ukraine. He even spoke out on the 2020 Soleimani strike. Vance is no Mike Pence (or Lyndon Johnson). And Vance would not only become a living martyr himself, but he'd be able to appoint another isolationist as his own VP.The current posturing IMO is more of a backup plan campaign to pressure Trump into being more open to anti Iran propaganda, more John Boltons in his cabinet, if he wins.","title":"They're about to murder Trump for real - preparations already under way for war with Iran: \\"Biden warned Iran that US would consider assassination attempt against Trump as declaration of war\\""},{"text":" while ignoring Trump until Biden dropped outMost of the media is still ignoring it","title":"Trumps New Post on Obama Proves Hes Losing It"},{"text":"Thoughts and prayers","title":"Trumpsters blaming Dems for the simple fact Trump does not care about their safety nor their needs"},{"text":"Yeah right.

I understand your frustration, but my goal isnt to weaponize faith for political purposes. In fact, Im advocating for the opposite: faith should lead us to hold leaders accountable to moral and ethical standards, regardless of their political affiliation. This isnt about blindly supporting one side, but about seeking truth and upholding values like compassion, justice, and humility that Christ taught.Im equally critical of members of any political party. Democrats have certainly made serious mistakes, some of which have been incredibly dangerous. However, the overwhelming evidence of hypocrisy and contradiction to Christian values is more prevalent on the side of the GOP, especially when they often identify as the Christian party. Im simply highlighting how Trumps behavior shares disturbing similarities with the biblical description of the Antichrist. While we may never know for sure, I think its wise to steer clear of anyone exhibiting those traits.I believe these conversations are important, and we should engage in them without division or name-calling. We all have a responsibility to critically examine our choices and how they align with our beliefs.

Systemic racism exists in our modern culture in terrible ways, that's undeniable.  But that people like you openly to regurgitate fascist soundbites, suggesting that we would be better off returning to the most explicit form of this oppression (institutionalized by the law itself), thus endorsing our darkest behaviors, it a very very bad omen for our country.  \\nFor those of you who need the education: Jim Crow?refers to a?system?developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s to support white?supremacy?and?oppress?black citizens.? Although there were laws that?discriminated?against African Americans throughout the country, the?Jim Crow system?existed only in the South. Among other things, Jim Crow was an open attack on the humanity of black people, and  denied  black people access to voting. We can see the system better if we look at its parts:\\n1) Economic Oppression: Laws were made that separated the poor of both races. Blacks were given the worst jobs for the lowest pay.? Certain good jobs were set aside for whites only.? Workers of both races were stopped if they tried to form?labor unions.? Many blacks, and a few whites, were arrested and forced to work as slaves in plantations and mines.\\n?2)?Political?Oppression: To stop the black political threat, blacks were disenfranchised, or not?allowed to vote.?Lack of voting power made blacks unable to remove elected officials they did not like.? \\n3)?Legal?Oppression: Legal oppression went along with political oppression.? Blacks had very difficult times in courts.? All the judges and almost all juries were white. In most areas, black witnesses were not allowed to testify against whites.Ways People Were Kept From Voting: \\nUnder Jim Crow, From about 1900 to 1965, most African Americans were not allowed to vote in the South. This was especially true in the Deep South: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. White people in power used many methods to keep African Americans from voting.? Some of these methods also prevented poor white people from voting.\\n1) Violence:?Blacks who tried to vote were threatened, beaten, and killed.? Their families were also harmed.? Sometimes their homes were burned down.? Often, they lost their jobs or were thrown off their farms. Whites used violence to?intimidate?blacks and prevent them from even thinking about voting. Still, some blacks passed the requirements to vote and took the risk. Some whites used violence to punish those uppity people and show other blacks what would happen to them if they voted.\\n2)?Literacy?tests:?Today almost all adults can read.? One hundred years ago, however, many people C black and white C were?illiterate.? Most illiterate people were not allowed to vote. A few were allowed if they could understand what was read to them.? White officials usually claimed that whites could understand what was read. They said blacks could not understand it, even when they clearly could.\\n3) Property tests:?In the South one hundred years ago, many states allowed only?property owners?to vote.? Many blacks and whites had no property and could not vote.\\n?4) Grandfather clause:?People who could not read and owned no property were allowed to vote if their fathers or grandfathers had voted before 1867.? Of course, practically no blacks could vote before 1867, so the grandfather clause worked only for whites.\\n5) All-white primary elections:?In the United States, there are usually two rounds of elections: first the primary, then the general.? In the primary, Republicans run against Republicans and Democrats run against Democrats.? In the general election, the winner of the Republican primary runs against the winner of the Democratic primary.? The Republican or Democrat who gets the most votes is elected.\\nAfrican Americans were not allowed to vote in the Democratic primary elections.? White Democrats said the Democratic Party was a club and did not allow black members.? So blacks could not vote in the only elections that mattered.\\n6) Purges: From time to time, white officials?purged?the voting?rolls.?\\n 7) Poll taxes:?In Southern states, people had to pay a tax to vote. Many people had extremely low incomes and could not afford this tax.? \\nYour ideology is wrong and is a red alarm for where we are going in this country.  Please think before you repeat what you hear, or else the suffering of the past is forgotten, and we repeat it. \\nFor more information, go to ABHM \\"America's Black Holocaust Museum\\": https://www.abhmuseum.org/about/","title":"Jim Clyburn calls Trump's Project 2025 a Jim Crow 2.0\\n"},{"text":"Having a rally in MSG is free news coverage","title":"On why trump is campaigning in NY and CA during the final weeks of an election..."},{"text":"Thanks, I'm just trying to look past this singular election and what we're going to do with all the people on Trump's side right now once Trump has had his downfall.

Making time to vote is harder for some people than others; its harder for people with inflexible job schedules and needy dependents, for instance.

I definitely agree with you.  My father leans pretty far right and I'm sorta leaning a bit left.  We have this discussion here and there and still haven't come to a concrete solution.  I guess the issue where we differ is *who* in particular actually needs the assistance.  I despise the idea that we should pay for a mentally/physically healthy person to live, while the rest of us are working 40+ hours a week.  I'm all for helping out the disabled and those in dire needs, like a large disaster.  Idk if you care to share some insight, but my only rebuttal to my own belief is that those that aren't getting assistance will find a selfish way to get what they desire, like turning to crime.  I know if I was starving and without a job, getting in trouble for stealing from a grocery store would not be a concern of mine, since I need to eat.  I'm not necessarily pro-universal income, but I can see the benefit here.  Either we give the person money now to buy food or we wait until they take it for themselves.  This is obviously enabling the potential thief, but at the same time it prevents a person from being a victim since we took care of the thief's need for food.  Honestly, I don't see any other realistic option.  Some people absolutely suck and nothing will motivate them to work, especially when wages are abysmal.  Either we wait for them to steal and let the Justice system deal with them, which only makes it harder for them to get a job/housing/assistance, so they continue committing crimes since that starts to become their only option at that point.  Or we give them just enough to leave the rest of us \\"normal\\" people alone. Hey, maybe the government could create a program for non-violent criminals to get them some sort of job.  Give them a second chance and a sense of purpose.  Maybe that'd deter them from committing future crimes.  Idk, there's gotta be an answer better than either \\"give the lazy some money so they won't become criminals\\" and \\"tell them to kick rocks and then someone becomes a victim and only furthers that criminal' into committing crimes since rarely do they get a second chance\\".  I'm a dumb guy, but I'm open ears if you don't mind sharing.  Appreciate any info that might broaden my knowledge about this topic.

With the border theyve sorta left open, it explodes the local infrastructures where they land.    Most places dont have the ability to cover that.   Everything from police coverage to ambulance availability and schooling.   Portions most dont think about.   Schools near me are tier 1 schools.   So they get federal funding (and their curriculum design).   Schools were rebuilt at more than $36million starting just for the elementary school.    Why?    Cuz they bus in students from other counties and have an increasing number of students that dont speak English.    Within the first weekwas already overcrowded and notes going home about kids bringing in fans because the air circulation was bad.   As local citizens, were paying for that.  1 of the Middle schools came close to $50mil and the high school was $70.   Still have 1 high school and 1 middle school to go and a Tech school.    All cuz they exploded in student numbers.   Still dont have enough teachers.

So the power plants pollution increases instead of your car emitting emissions and youre paying by the mile to drive.They looked at Trumps tariffsbashed and had so much to say about themthen turned around and wouldnt change them after going thru and seeing the benefit.The lies the democrats spit are outrageous.   To think that many people supporting them dont bother to look into things and stand on pathetic ideals and useless aspects.   Project 2025 is good example, Trump decline it, bashed it a little and moved on.   Harris on the other hand, has turned into some massive fear factor folks arent thinking about simply because a Trump supporter wrote the document.   Not like she and Walz dont have some pencil pushing desk fiend that comes up with their own outlandish possibilities.A Harris win would be a disastrous thing for our country.    She is clearly not equipped or prepared to hold the office.    They claim Trump has all the big money folks when half of his donations came from middle and lower class (even his ads say if you cant donate thats ok, just support and vote).   Harris on the other hand had billionaires and millionaires filling their press boxes and were gloating about it at the Convention.  She isnt respected on the world stage with practically zero experience as her foreign policy is minuscule at best.   She goofed pretty heavily as a prosecutor.

We have [about 500k elected officials](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/3/29/1372225/-Just-how-many-elected-officials-are-there-in-the-United-States-The-answer-is-mind-blowing) in the US. We really just need proportional bodies at the national, state, and local level, and at the local level you can get away with just a dozen reps if it's proportional. They can appoint and manage bureaucrats to execute their policies. You don't need to be electing treasurers and secretaries of state and sheriffs. You elect their bosses.Then empower those institutions to actually govern without giving people who have the time to engage in politics in capacities beyond voting extra power, the way we do now, which distorts representation. [Demsas has made this point too](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/). This results in more accessible, representative, and comprehensible (especially to voters with less time available) politics.[*Democracy for Busy People*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo194847654.html) by Kevin J. Elliott is largely about this if you'd like to read more. The premise is that focusing on smaller numbers of institutions that are actually representative and that aren't as susceptible to rent-seeking by highly motivated citizens with extra time on their hands (who are disproportionately rich, highly educated, white homeowners) will make democracy accessible to busy (disproportionately poor and nonwhite) people.The other dimension of the book is focusing on how political parties play a critical role in making politics comprehensible to people with less time. You shouldn't have to spend hours looking up the political views of Independent Candidates #4782-4843 every two years, or even worse just guessing, which is prone to e.g. racial profiling based on name or photo. Assuming there are enough political parties for them to have distinct platforms (not the case in the US, [indeed the case in e.g. the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_Netherlands#Parties_represented_in_the_States_General_and/or_European_Parliament)), candidates being members of political parties allows busy voters to understand their stances quickly and accurately and so make more informed decisions.Having fewer elections, but making the remaining elections more representative by proportionally electing councils and legislatures instead of disproportionately electing mayors and governors, would make America more democratic, not less.","title":"What is the solution to Americans voting too often (too many elections) ?"},{"text":"CNN Pundit Says Men Believe Dems Care More About Dudes Who Want To Become WomenThere's no \\"belief\\", the D party enthusiastically puts trans high above men.

That is, whether or not someone was paid for their behavior or whether they were rewarded for it afterward without influence.Illegal: Some commitment to reward = Action Taken = Reward GivenIllegal: Some commitment to reward = Reward Given = Action TakenLegal: Action Taken = Some commitment to reward = Reward GivenLegal: Action Taken =  Reward GivenNo one in 2020 would have known that this offer from CAH was pending, so there is no way their decision to vote or not vote was influenced by some promised reward. QED: This is NOT paying people not to vote.PS: I think that both Musk's and CAH humanity skirt the intent of laws against paying people for their vote (or not to vote). I think there is moral difference between Musk's offer (which is clearly intended to sway the election) and the CAH offer which is responsive to the former and is arguably intended to highlight the problems associated with it.","title":"CMV: Cards Against Humanity 's paying people who don't vote is illegal."},{"text":"For what its worth Ive been trying to get in on the NYT focus groups for ages now so I can georgepill the massesI got to the second round of screening questions once but didnt get a follow up from that ??","title":"Why can't Democratic voters make policy arguments?"},{"text":"That your first instinct is to skip lver nearly everything I wrote and go with an ad hominem attack, it tells me that you don't really have much of a rebuttal for the substance of my critique.","title":"Kamala Harris presidential campaign raised more than $1 billion in less than 3 months"},{"text":"Keep going grandpa!

Vote for America.  For those who believed Trump when he said he knows nothing about, or doesnt support Project 2025, theres video of him saying he does support it. He for sure supports many of the measures outlined, including mass deportations of immigrants and other policies such as abolishing the Department of Education, saying at a recent rally in Wisconsin, We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education.  Because an educated electorate is not good for authoritarians.  And then you had Trump declining twice, on the debate stage, to say whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if it got to his desk. Project 2025 lists abortion over 90 times. In particular, the next conservative President should work with Congress to enact the most robust protections for the unborn that Congress will support while deploying existing federal powers to protect innocent life  I.e., We, for sure, will pass a federal ban if we control both houses and the presidency. But if immigration or abortion are not important issues to you, if you dont care Trump incited a violent mob on January 6 to attack our democracy, or that hes a convicted felon, and you vote with your pocket book, consider the following in your vote for the President.  Economy and Jobs - If a voter is voting with their pocketbook, several Nobel laureates have said the Trump economic plan will significantly increase inflation and the national deficit. Under Biden-Harris economics, inflation is now at 2.4%, unemployment fell to 4.1%, and interest rates are coming down. These are all thanks to the Biden-Harris administrations efforts on the economy.  In two years, the Inflation Reduction Act has created more than 334,000 clean energy jobs.  Every single Republican voted No.  Trumps economic plans will take more money from low- and middle-income Americans, with a tax cut for the richest 5 percent of Americans, and a tax increase for all other income groups.Housing - Todays rising housing costs are years in the making. Fewer new homes were built in the decade following the Great Recession than in any decade since the 1960s, causing a major shortfall in housing supply, by more than 1.5 million homes. During the Biden-Harris administration, they implemented the Housing Supply Action Plan to help with that shortfall and costs. This will be a long process, but it is in the works. Due to Bidens successful economic plan, interest rates are starting to fall. Meanwhile, Trumps plans include tax increases for middle class Americans making it more difficult to afford housing and necessities.Healthcare - If you are voting with your pocketbook, healthcare is a major consideration.  Again, the Biden-Harris administration has implemented several policies that have lowered healthcare and prescription costs.  On the flipside, Trump said he has a concept of a plan, but as we saw during Trumps presidency, when Republicans were trying to overturn Obamacare, saying Repeal and Replace, it became clear Republicans have no plan.Climate Change - If you are voting with your pocket book, climate change should matter to you. It is having a huge impact on our economy that requires extensive planning. President Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Accords on his first day in office. And the Biden-Harris administration is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda in American history through investments in clean energy. Meanwhile, Trump rants about climate change in an incoherent manner, and Project 2025 has plans to dismantle NOAA and FEMA.Choose to vote for a positive future going forward.  Vote Harris-Walz 2024.","title":"Lose-lose: These pro-Palestine Arizonans aren't buying Kamala Harris"},{"text":" Allreds response to Cruzs attacks shows it was a good message that resonated with voters, the national GOP operative said.It doesn't show that.

The party's all consuming hatred of Trump has caused them to take reflexively take positions that they never would have otherwise - rather than agreeing with Trump in those areas wherein they may have found some common ground, establishment Democrats have staked out positions that are increasingly alienating them from those who, 15-20 years ago, would never in their wildest nightmares have expected that in 2024, their party's standard bearer would not only accept the endorsements of Dick Cheney and other warmongering criminals, but tout them, as though proud of receiving them. It's insane that this is what the parry has become. Of course, Kamala - and by extension, her party's - willingness to abandon nearly everything that, for years, the Democrats once proudly stood for, to stand in alliance with the corrupt, morally questionable individuals and institutions whom they had no so long opposed on principle for fleeting political gain, is just one of the many reasons why the elite are throwing money at her hand over first.","title":"Kamala Harris presidential campaign raised more than $1 billion in less than 3 months"},{"text":"The guy who has violently raped women and openly plans to make women the property of cis white men?

After losing the 2020 election, Trump pressured officials in key battleground states to overturn the results in his favor. One of the most notable incidents involved a January 2021 phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump urged him to find enough votes to reverse Bidens victory in the state. Trump also targeted officials in other states like Arizona and Michigan, encouraging them to decertify or challenge the results. 2. A false elector scheme was concocted where Trump and his allies would create slates of fake electors in several states that Biden had won. The goal was to submit these fraudulent electors certifications to Congress, falsely declaring Trump as the winner in those states. These fake electors would replace the legitimate electors and at least create enough confusion to not certify the results. This plan was pursued in battleground states like Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona, where Trumps legal challenges had already failed. This is documented in emails and memos, testimony, and public statements by those involved.3. Former Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and other top DOJ officials testified that Trump tried to pressure them into declaring the election fraudulent and to help him overturn the results. Trump also attempted to install Jeffrey Clark, a lower-level DOJ official who was sympathetic to his election claims, as acting Attorney General to carry out these efforts.4. Trump repeatedly pressured Pence to reject or delay the certification of the Electoral College votes on January 6. Evidence includes public statements and private communications in which Trump urged Pence to take actions outside his constitutional authority to alter the election results. Pence himself has testified and publicly stated that Trump pressured him, despite being told it was unconstitutional. Trump was told by legal advisors that Pence had to legal authority to do this, yet he continued to press Pence to do the right thing.5. Jan 6 was clearly not an attempt to overthrow the government with a mob like some people think is being claimed. The allegation is that Trump knowingly allowed it to continue or even stoked the flames to apply further pressure to Pence (who was in the capital) to not certify the results, or at least cause a delay. This is the major reason Pence, Trumps own VP, refuses to endorse Trump this election.6. Trump filed over 60 court cases trying to find reasons to dispute results in various states and lost all of them other than minor procedural wins in a few. Although a lot of allegations were made that democrats stole the election, IMO these are at best just displaying that something COULD be done, not that it was, or media bias, or unique changes like mail in ballots that are still legitimate, but just favored democrats. I think these pale in comparison to Trumps attempts.","title":"I voted early, I'm worried"},{"text":"White people benefiting from the hard work of the black man.

Here is the timeline:First year - President decides on a course of action. \\nCongress debates the idea and passes a bill.  President signs itSecond year - Cognizant agency formulates new rules and regulations to comply with the new law.  They put them out for public comment. Six months later they close the mandatory comment period and publish the final rules and regulations.  Lawsuits ensue. Third year - The lawsuits are resolved and the rules and regulations go into effect.  Industry begins to adapt.  There are disruptions in supply, labor, finance, and other economically relevant areas.  Some companies grow, others decline. Fourth year - Economic activities stabilize.

He didn't deliver on the hope.  He did deliver on the change, but the change didn't help Americans, it only hurt us.  Biden's administration has been described as \\"Obama's third term\\".  Someone has been running the Biden administration, and it isn't him or Harris.  There is a lot of speculation that it has been Obama.  If so, he's been having Biden do all the things he wanted to do but didn't because he was concerned about his own legacy (and didn't care what people thought of Biden).Either way, Biden's term has not been good for Americans either, and Harris is running on \\"change\\" while also saying she was deeply involved in all the Biden administration decisions and that she wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight.As I recall, Trump's administration was pretty good for Americans in general, regardless of skin color - and a rising tide lifts all boats.To some extent, flag waving bravado is how you get elected, so you're going to see some of it from either party during election season.Most of the processes that regulate land and home ownership are at the local or state level.  Not really sure how the Federal government would get involved to make things better.  Harris' proposed $25k first time home buyer credit would just increase the prices of homes.The one thing that the Federal government might do is force foreign corporations to divest the huge amount of real estate they've bought up - but unless it just seized it, it would be sold at current market prices, which wouldn't really help individuals a lot.  That would still require action by Congress.Another thing the Federal Government could do is remove the 40 million illegal aliens currently in the country and secure the borders.  That would make a lot of homes available and drop prices, and would also open up a lot of jobs.  Only one candidate is promising to do that and has a history that makes that promise likely to be kept.Agreed that the tax system should be streamlined to remove loopholes.Upward mobility is absolutely possible for people who don't start wealthy, but it requires two things:1. A public education system that provides an actual education in more than just social justice activism.2. A desire on the part of the individual to put in the work required to succeed.Democrats are doing their best to prevent \\\\#1 from happening anywhere they control the education system, and American culture (and particularly American *black culture*) is robbing people of \\\\#2.I'm a computer engineer, and largely self-taught.  I earn a comfortable six figure income.  I was fortunate enough to have a good public school education in rural America.  One of my coworkers a few years ago was a man from Dallas, who grew up in an impoverished, single parent home.  His brother and sister were both addicts (as was his father, who occasionally dropped by).  His sister also became pregnant as a teen.  He decided that wasn't going to be him, so he taught himself the Linux operating system.  He got a job as a computer engineer, and worked hard at improving himself.  I helped him get a (deserved) promotion, and he's probably earning more than I do now.  Once he was stable, he bought a house, married his girlfriend, and they had a kid.  His *family* calls him an Oreo - black on the outside, white on the inside.  ...because he dared to prove that success was possible by actually working for it.That kind of thing has to change too.","title":"Obama Scolds Black Men and it BACKFIRES; 'I Got A Dad, And He Ain't You!'"},{"text":"Well a trump win guarantees blanket bombing in Gaza and unlimited supply of weapons to Isreal.

Comments are filled with people who say theyre voting for her because shes nice and stuff like that. We havent truly seen the effect of her recent interviews in the polls yet, but I think theyve helped her by making people less afraid of the unknown factor about her. By her avoiding policy discussions, shes framed the race as a choice between whos nicer, kinder and more empathetic to your needs, and that might be enough to get her over the finish line.Trumps campaign needs to sling more mud at her than theyve ever slung before, constantly, for the next three weeks. They absolutely will not win if they try to run a positive campaign. Republicans never really can win that way. Dukakis, Kerry and Hillary were beaten by being drowned in mud.

Just because the President says they want something to happen or tries to do something blatantly illegal doesnt mean the rest of the government will go along with it.For example, per the article he says he wants Biden to sign an executive order  declaring the Equal Rights Amendment as the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Even if Biden signed such an order no court would uphold it. SCOTUS didnt make it so what the President says is US law, all they said was if he commits a crime while acting as President he can be tried in court for it. Biden saying Im making a new amendment to the Constitution has no legal authority. Similarly he talks about Biden just declaring that all medical debt is eliminated. Again, he can write that executive order but it would almost certainly be overturned in court assuming he doesnt have legislative authority from Congress to do it. Moore is correct that Biden can pardon anybody he wants for federal crimes, including federal non-violent drug offenders and Snowden, but that has nothing to do with Presidential criminal immunity at all. He always had that ability even before SCOTUS ruling that hes got criminal immunity for his official actions.\\nMind you, Im in no way defending SCOTUS here, their ruling that Presidents are above the law is one of the worst decisions from the court in modern history. It opens the door to all sorts of ridiculous criminal shenanigans in office for no legitimate reason. But a President not going to jail for trying to be a criminal doesnt mean they are suddenly omnipotent. It just means if they try something crazy they wont go to prison but the crazy thing will still (hopefully) be blocked in court.","title":"Michael Moore Dares Joe Biden to Use Full Immunity in Last Days as Prez"},{"text":"I think voting has a stricter enforcement of rules and doesn't need explicit conspiracy","title":"CMV: Cards Against Humanity 's paying people who don't vote is illegal."},{"text":"Vote early.

The difference is that some of the things the alt-right believe are offensive to the other three, whereas the other three were vaguely tolerant of each other's ideas even if they didn't share them. But at the same time unless and until significant movements in the other three decide that the alt-right is so offensive to them that they'd rather ally with the left against it then that offensiveness is somewhat moot since they remain part of the same electoral coalition nevertheless.","title":"CMV: Alt-Right Ideology Is Not Conservatism"},{"text":"Everyone is attributing this to his vileness, which might very well be the case, as he gets more desperate.

Companies that manufacture goods are charged tariffs, not governments.  Those companies merely add the new tariff fees and tax onto the wholesale cost of acquiring the product.  Individual Governments never see a tariff or tax bill at all. In a worst case, once the tariff is added, a retailer marks up the product further to cover the retailers interest charges and other overhead to order the product, place it on a shelf.    In fact, it remains very normal for a retailer to mark up a products price 100% of wholesale amount when eventually its sold at retail.  So if the tariff is $20.00, the wholesale goes up $20.00 but an end customer may ultimately see an increase of $40.00.  Thats where inflation comes into play.   And its the same product. No other value added.Either way, if youve recently walked into a store like WalMart or BestBuy, many retail companies now use electronic price tags (instead of printed price tags.)  These electronic price tags make it easy to increase the price of any imported product or product line at the press of a button.","title":"Trump ruined the economy.
