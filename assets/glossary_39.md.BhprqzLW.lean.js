It is something they still believe despite all evidence to the contrary, so there is no reason to impeach him. Panama, Denmark, Canada, Mexico... this is different. This is bullying.The people who voted for Trump could not give any less of a shit. You think the racist deep south MAGA supporter who's concept of international relations is sex tourism and who's view of economic policy stops at their own paycheck cares about \\"bullying Panama\\"? Of course they don't! what he's doing actually destroys the peaceful, democratic international order that so many have worked for so long to establish.Yes, one idiot can destroy so much goodwill and stability, but they are allowed to do it when they are elected. Now that he's threatening Panama, every tinhorn dictator out there, and most of the democracies, are going to say to themselves, now wait a minute.... am I next? And their next thought is going to be: we need nukes. Like, right now.That has already been the view of many dictators afraid of external intervention and the same factors that prevented it are still in play. Trump being an idiot doesn't change the calculus much, because while he is belligerent he is also spectacularly ineffective in actually backing up such threats. For one thing he doesn't keep anyone in his cabinet around long enough to enact effective policy changes, and he is stacking the deck entirely with unqualified idiots from the start. What we can expect from his term is a huge amount of shit talk and nearly nothing actually being accomplished.","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"Thank you.

Just like Trumps!","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"Well, OK, I'll talk about it.  Let's talk about impeachment first.  The left, obviously, has had a hate on for Trump since he first ran for president.  I would say an unreasonable hate.  That was what actually got me supporting Trump in the first place, seeing how the left was steady calling Trump a racist day in and day out, and publishing his personal financial information in the paper, and stuff like that.  I just thought that was pretty low.And so it's no surprise they wanted to impeach him.  But impeachment isn't supposed to work if just one party wants a guy out of there; both parties have to agree, on that.  And he hadn't done anything to the Republicans; in fact, he helped get a few people elected.  And apparently hurt a few others, but whaddayagonna do.  People loved the guy.  And so Republicans really couldn't go along with it, and neither impeachment took.Then there's the charges.  And over all these charges hangs the taint of lawfare.  Letitia James ran on the policy of charging Trump with something.  When she did, the case was in a posture that was almost unique.  The only other case of its nature had been brought by Letitia James, and lost.  By posture, meaning there were no complaining witnesses.  No one had gone to the DA saying I wuz robbed.  The banks weren't complaining; no one was complaining.  But she brought the charges anyway, and guess what, she won.  Well, Republicans said, New York State, whaddayagonna do, it's a very blue state, we all know the libs hate Trump.Alvin Bragg ran on the policy of charging Trump with something.  I think this was the hush money payments, that he finally got a conviction on.  I don't think most USAicans really understand why it's illegal to pay someone not to speak to the press.  I'm sure those who wrote the laws had good reason; but it's just not... I mean, who is harmed?  Really.  I'm not seeing it.  And so he got a pass from the voters on that too.Then there's the sex assault case.  This sex assault occurred thirty years ago, and apparently the lady didn't complain to the cops at the time.  I don't doubt it happened; but you know, if you don't go to the cops when it happens... it can't have been that much of an assault.  No broken bones, not enough offended dignity to complain to the authorities.  Who knows, maybe she was still thinking Trump might be able to do something for her.  Just sayin'.  Possibility.Then there's the election interference case.  Now it took me a while to realize this was real.  Trump really did try to win an election that he knew he had lost.  But the left spent so much time caterwauling about an assault on democracy that none of them seems to realize that Democrats and Republicans alike do what we call gerrymandering right now, today, which is an attempt by the legislature to make sure that the will of the people will be unfairly represented at the ballot box.  An attempt, that is, to steal not just one election, but all of them.  And so it's hard to take all this too seriously.  Trump was working hard to win the election; we like a guy that thinks it's that important.  It says something positive about him, that he'll work that hard to get 'er done.In addition to which, of course, we have hundreds of thousands of federal felonies, and who knows how many state felonies, and how can you walk down the street without breaking some law or other?  It's hard to imagine.  And so until someone is actually harmed, Trump gets a pass on all that.Up to a limit.  This limit.","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"They make the Taliban look almost rational.","title":"White Christian nationalists are poised to remake America in their image during Trumps second term, author says"},{"text":"I mean, he'll never set foot in it, but will promote it to no end as the single greatest collection of knowledge and information the world has ever seen...

It's fine as long as you can pay the bond holders, but that requires economic growth. Infinite growth is not possible so at some point a bind default is likely. Even a default isn't the end of the world. Russia has defaulted, Argentina seems to every 20 years. It's not a good thing, as countries get frozen out of the international bond market for a period of time, meaning they have to print money which leads to inflation. The US defaulting would be a bigger deal than any other country since US bonds used to be considered safe beyond reproach, so there are a lot of foreign investors. Also since the dollar is the default international currency.","title":"House Republicans face massive debt problem"},{"text":"Just a few links that popped up when you google instances of Trump bullying. Honestly its a little surprising that 10 years into his political career there are people who arent fully aware of his bullying tendencies, but there you go:[Trump as a childhood bully](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/trump-the-bully-how-childhood-military-school-shaped-the-future-president/)[bullying workers for experiencing workplace harassment](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-campaign-harassment-bullying-lawsuits)[bullying at debates](https://time.com/6991882/donald-trump-presidential-debate/)[interesting correlation between supporting Trump and bullying. its almost like its a feature to his supporters, not a bug](https://www.k12dive.com/news/report-trump-effect-contributes-to-higher-bullying-in-republican-distric/532499/)[more bullying](https://www.frominsultstorespect.com/2022/10/29/trump-bullying-and-disrespect/)[from before he was elected the first time](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/7-times-trump-showed-how-much-of-a-racist-sexist-bully-he-is)[He has always been a ruthless bully](https://truthout.org/articles/trump-has-always-been-a-ruthless-bully-the-debate-exposed-his-weakness/)This has really been his whole shtick. Mocking disabled reporters. Attacking gold star military families. Even just his campaign bluster. He doesnt just attack other politicians for their platforms or policies, he attacks them with mean nicknames and slings lies like Obama was born in Kenya and Ted Cruzs father killed JFK and Kamala lied about being black. People might not like that hes now bullying allies, but bullying on its own is part of why he was elected and why people think hes real and tells it like it is.Putting the issue of whether or not hes always been a bully, I have three other problems with your view:1. The most concerning is that you seem to be advocating for impeachment/removal based on one thing that isnt illegal (bullying) but formally impeaching/removing him based on other charges. Its wild to imagine charging and prosecuting someone for a crime NOT because they committed the crime, but solely because they did something legal you dont like. The idea that the justification would be widely understood to be for a different reason than the actual charge is such a slippery slope for politics and the criminal justice system.2. Do you have evidence that there is a significant change in opinion from the people who just voted for him? He just won the election, and while you claim that this was before people knew he was going to bully these other countries, I dont think that a significant portion of his voters would have voted a different way if hed been making these comments on the campaign trail. 3. Even if Republican voters had serious regrets, the Republican political establishment does not. Theyve spent a decade trying to take control of government like they have now.

The occasion has been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power, we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.Straight from the mouth of James Monroe.

Then because entrants gave no consideration to Musk to enter his lottery, his breach of competition law by running a fake lottery also ends up being a minor matter with minor penalties rather than fraud.The reality is so much of the legal system is unfit for purpose, and when very well-funded organisations devote huge resources to actively hunt for ways to undermine it or abuse it, or to design methods to circumvent the intent of the law by sailing juuuust on top of the boundary between legal and serious offence, it invariably struggles.","title":"Trump campaign worker won Elon Musks $1mn election raffle prize"},{"text":"No surprise she would be that petty.","title":"Kamala Harris Shares a Trump-less Photo of Presidents at Jimmy Carters Funeral"},{"text":" it would have been a conflict of interest for the investigation of Trump's crimes to continue under Garland because Garland reports to Biden [...] Why?

We are not talking about kittens that can be drowned in the river. What is growing in the woman is human, and a distinct  human from the mother. One can argue timing, but the day/week/month before delivery, if the mother dies, there is a very good chance the baby could be saved. So in my mind you cannot ignore the NAP. Even weeks into the pregnancy, there is a separate heart beat, DNA, etc.As a previous poster mentioned, liberty is self ownership, and women choose. But choices have consequences, so if you choose to have sex, one risk/potential consequence is a baby. Given the wealth of birth control choices, and plan B availability for unexpected birth control failures, I think people have an obligation not create babies that they then kill.Obviously rape violates the NAP, and while I strongly prefer the plan B option so that we avoid conflicting rights (baby and mother), I think in the case of rape the decision must rest with the victim, within a reasonable time frame. Abortion of a viable baby at 9 months looks an awful lot like murder.","title":"Which makes more sense from a libertarian perspective?"},{"text":"As long as they're rich get richer and the poor get poorer, that's the important part.\\nEverything else is details.Oh, and robbing Social Security and Medicare, grandma needs to suffer and we need more sick people, because Social programs need to also fail, can't let people realize they a actually work, people might get ideas that other social programs might also work.","title":"House Republicans face massive debt problem"},{"text":"You mean of her boss.","title":"Kamala Harris Shares a Trump-less Photo of Presidents at Jimmy Carters Funeral"},{"text":"You're all the Empire.

I mean, you're stating almost the opposite of what has been seen in media publicly on repeat. That's a very narrow window of viewing you have.I think Stephen is making a very accurate point. Just look what Nancy Pelosi did to AOC, so shortly after an election for the Democrats that was supposed to be about progress, and going against a political opponent like Trump, who actively supports white supremacy groups, anti LGBT groups, and more hate based groups. I mean Trump very actively used hate in his campaign for votes as his major demographic was white and rural voting individuals. This election could have been an easy slam dunk for the Democrats, but all that Kamala Harris could talk about on stage was a woman's right to choose. How many times did she talk about raising the minimum wage? Or empowering unions? Or making sure that lower income class people feel respected dignified and earn better income? Trump didn't talk about it either, the problem is Trump already massively appealed to poor white people, which is the mass voting majority in America. Uneducated poor white people.It has nothing to do with backlash, it has nothing to do with the fact that leftists don't tolerate other opinions, they do. It has to do with the fact that despite all the turmoil, the Republican party used their strengths unlike the Democrat party. For everything that is terrible about Trump, for the facts that he is hijacked the conservative and the tea party movement with whatever he is, they still used his key feats as their strength, And Elon's money to buy votes in key states. You can't deny that it was a smart move. And if you think the Democrats are so dumb that they cannot recognize a smart move and accept how they lost, and then use it against you and double down the next time around, then you are the dumb one.","title":"STEPHEN A.

It's not simply a ''game'' of some sorts, that would undermine the complexity that goes behind all this stuff of politics, but the panorama of politics is certainy less hostile than people believe it is.These are people at the end of the day, they have lives, they suffer and they enjoy. Basically... why fuck around? be a better friend to everyone included yourself. Obama laughing with Trump could actually be a good thing but that's not any of our concern either.Regarding Trump's past with his opposition, think people should sit a second and put themselves on the position of a president or a candidate, what is the best and most direct way to gain popularity? throw shit at someone of course, so that's why Trump does it. But that doesn't mean he really follows what he says completely, he might agree with some things his enemies propose. At the end of the day once all the campaign is done you are left with 2 guys, you and your rival... why keep fighting anyway? let's just have a laugh and enjoy the rest of the day because what else are we living for? No sense in keeping shit going like it's WW2 24/7.Actually I'd go as far as to say the people high there would be better with us believing it's just a ''game'', making people think these things are more complex than they are makes then shift their interest to something else, more simple, and decide based on meaningless facts that don't do a good job at convincing you wheter someone is really fit for the role of a president or not. After all, the well known despicable figure of a leader that we all known would always prefer a uneducated, pesimist and weak minded follower that obeys anything than a well suited and ingenious follower who could rebel if he saw something out of the rightful norm. In reality politics it's a very simple thing, though with a very complex base that takes to me to get the hang of, and one thing that EVERYONE should know to the point of mastering, the world moves by politics, and he who knows how the world moves, MOVES ALONG IT. If not, you're handpicked by the despot of turn to follow the trail he chooses you should follow. There's an excellent quote I know very well, which is one of my favorites ever and says:  \\n''Beware he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart, he dreams himself your master.''But of course this means nothing, only a basis to follow, after all unless we get up there we can't be so sure how things move in the world of the ''elite'' all we can do is either stay as good citizens in the name of democracy or work hard to get up there and choose by ourselves what the next step will be. If anything else I could be granted to say, then it will be a very personal note that doesn't have mcuh to do with this topic but still, it's one that anyone can read if they wish: I haven't made any enemies troughout my life that have really meant a pain in the ass to the point of hatred, yet I have had enmity with people I disagreed... But you gotta make the most out of that rivalry, take in account everything he has agaisn't you and everything you have agaisn't him and contribute to make of you two a better version of your former selves.

And they voted for Trump because he's a white man promising to bring back the time period when white men were unquestionably in charge of everything. Sure, they might not be at the absolute top of the hierarchy because the rich white men will be above them, but they can at least aspire to someday being rich, and even if they're poor, at least they still have people to look down on. See Lyndon Johnson's quote, If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.For those who aren't white men: they're almost universally either white women or black men, which again means that while they might not be at the top of the hierarchy, at least they won't be at the absolute bottom. There's a reason why minority women have been Trump's worst-performing demographic in all of his election: they're well aware that they are the ones at the bottom, the ones who have no choice but to grin and take it. Sure the wealthy CEO will demean and abuse the white male worker, but he can always come home and take out his frustrations on his wife. His wife can then take out her frustrations on \\"the help\\" - the minority population that are relegated to low-paying menial jobs and have no choice but to treat her with respect. And the men among that group then get to take their frustrations out of their wives when they get home, the minority women who are at the bottom of the heap, who have nobody else to look down on and take their frustrations out on (except maybe their children.)It's all a nice hierarchy where it's easy to figure out who's in charge of who, where you always know who you have to suck up to and who you can shit on without repercussion.

The Republican Party lost the plot when they ousted progressives at the turn of the 20th century. Since then, it's just been corruption and criminality. Harding, Nixon, Reagan, Bush Sr and Jr, Trump. Well done, Republicans. The only GOP president to not be a total tit was Eisenhower, and even he played to modern Republican Greatest Hits with Operation Wetback (deported 300,000 people to Mexico, including citizens of the US). What Trump has done to the GOP is shown them they don't need to hide behind civility or the rule of law. Politics is sports for the average GOP voter, and in sports you always dismiss penalties against your team as unfair while claiming the refs aren't calling everything they should on the other team. It's amazing to me how common and un-examined that mentality is among sports fans.

I had zero run ins with the law before that, much less any behavioral problems. Was just an average kid.Had my first court date almost a year later and the prosecutor attempted to get the case out of juvenile court and charge me as an adult. They wanted five years for possession.I had a shitty lawyer who was not prepared for that (likely because he thought it was an easy one-and-done case and didnt keep up to speed on it). I pled no contest, was adjudicated as a minor (thank heavens), and sentenced to two years probation rather than facing time. I later learned that the judge had severe accusations of blatant racism and harsher sentencing for black kids specifically. Prosecutor thought, since I am white, they could throw the book at me and the judge would oblige because it would offset things by choking the future out of a white boy instead. But I showed up to court with a black lawyer, a man who he had already dug into a bit before.So I dodged prison time, and likely my whole life being thrown away, just because of some bullshit racist sentencing judicial seesaw.I have never trusted the justice system since that day. Ill hug a cop before I shake hands with a judge. And I aint hugging no cops.And if anybody wants to know, I got off probation a year early because my PO quit and nobody picked up my case. And while I had some questionable but fun younger years, I learned my lesson  dont get caught even *looking* like youre doing something illegal. And if you are and get caught, shut the fuck up first, and then shut the fuck up again just to be sure.But now can add a new lesson learned.

If a former leader of our government isn't bound by the same rules and laws as the people of the country it oversees, even when they aren't in office any longer, then it isn't *of* the people; that person is above us in some regard. For the same reason, if we can't expect a government official to face any accountability at all then it's clearly not *by* the people, since the laws that govern the people do not govern them. And if the people can't hold our leaders accountable at all for the things they do while in office then there's nothing to protect us and ensure that our government will ever function *for* the people, either.    \\n     \\nIn our case, it's a question of how a court of people chosen by our leaders can be within the law by ruling that those same leaders are not subject to the same laws as the people who elected them. If a Democracy should ever have leaders that find themselves immune from the law, then it's not a Democracy, and it's not just the presidential immunity issue we need to fix; it's that we're beholden to a Supreme Court that faces no consequences for a ruling that shouldn't be possible if our laws are being followed.","title":"Was This Fair?

However, this is limited to those for whom the surgery is deemed clinically necessary after discussions with both their parents and doctors, who have been consistent and persistent in their gender identity for years, have been taking gender-affirming hormones for some time, who have undergone informed consent discussions and have approvals from both their parents and doctors and who otherwise meet standards of care criteria (such as those laid out by?WPATH).??It is also exceedingly rare: In?one study?that conducted a retrospective chart review of a U.S. national pediatric surgical database, authors were only able to identify 108 trans minors who had received any form of gender-affirming surgery over four years (2018-2021)  accounting for 0.04% of all transgender youth nationwide. Only 10 of these patients were under the age of 16. And approximately 95% of these surgeries were chest surgeries.

It happened around 2023, right around the time Jean Carroll was jilling it to her delusions of grandeur. \\n It was just a little headline that popped up once or twice when it all started then vanished, but somebody put in a coordinated effort to deny him council.  I'm having trouble finding the lawyer story, but it's different from '[65 project](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/ethics-complaints-attorney-misconduct-trump-election-reversal/index.html)', which targeted Trumps 2020 efforts to contest the unlawful covid rule changes.  If it can be shown that a group of individuals coordinated everything, particularly in New York and Colorado, then there's a lot of people going down.  Particularly if the unconstitutional behavior was being pushed by someone like Chuch Schumer or Jamie Raskin in an official capacity.  It hinges on having some aspects being obvious bullshit, meeting the bar of prosecutorial misconduct, but we already knew.  And given how contrived and fictional the charges are it's clear that somebody pointed and said \\"Investigate everything you can and get him for something\\".  They took a list of famous trump controversies and looked into each one from a legal perspective, and bent whatever laws they needed to to make it fit.  Jean Carroll is the \\"grab em by the pussy\\" comment.  Hush money case is the Stormy Daniels story.  Georgia is the perfect phone call.  DC gets Jan 6.  Classified documents is the 'Lock her up' comment (\\"He he! We'll lock _him_ up for espionage!\\").  New York business loan case is for the failed casino and Trump university.  It's as if someone started with a list of things they hate, and everyone in on it passed it around trying to prove each one.They wanted to kick him off the ballot, have all of his assets siezed, send him  to prison for the rest of his life, make everyone think he was evil, and he was going to have to do it all without any good lawyers.  You even had that damn congress bill that would have had his SS protection revoked so he could be shanked in Rikers.  But since they had to go through the legal system to do it, they had to lie, cheat, steal, bribe, con, and to it all in a way that would prompt thousands of news articles calling him a scumbag.

Dont move. Dont sell your house, he crowed to a rapturous crowd in 2017. Were going to fill up those factories C or rip em down and build brand new ones.None of that happened. Indeed, within 18 months, General Motors (GM) announced that it was suspending operations at its one remaining -manufacturing plant outside Youngstown, throwing 5,000 jobs into jeopardy in a community with little else to cling to. Trumps reaction was to say the closure didnt matter, because the jobs would be replaced in, like, two minutes.That, too, did not happen. People moved away, marriages broke down, depression soared and, locals say, a handful of people took their own lives.Ordinarily, politicians who promise the moon and fail to deliver get punished at the ballot box. But that did not happen to Trump either. Instead, he has steadily built up his popularity in Youngstown, a city that was once a well-oiled Democratic party machine but has now turned into one of his most remarkable bases of working-class support.Trump voters would rather believe in fantasy while stagnantly suffering rather than face reality and work towards something better. I think this is reflected in Springfield, Ohio as well. The town was slowly shrinking, the working age population was unreliable and addicted to hard drugs. Immigrants came in and literally just showed up to work and that caused racist residents to become apoplectic and chase them out with made up stories. Now they're back to their continued decline into nothingness just because they couldn't handle change.

I personally disagree with people like Perez and Cuellar on environmental issues, but they're much better than having Rs in those seats. People will bring up how hard it was to pass the ACA, but we could only get to that point by having conservative senators in red seats (except Lieberman).

This helps me understand the historical context of the Bible and come up with a well-rounded theological perspective. In fact, many mainstream Christian churches require their ministers to have at least a Masters degree in theology.How are K-12 students supposed to make sense of all this when we adults in university often struggle to keep up with the curriculum? The short answer is, they wont. Its crazy and unconstitutional to think they should. If you look around most North American churches, youll see that young people arent in the pews. People are becoming more secular, and thats their choice. Others in the community come from different faiths or no faith at all.Its puzzling that public schools cant keep their free lunch programs for low-income students, but they have funds for a Bible curriculumI thought this group was about pro-life? As an academic, a pastor, and a theologian, I see this and think one thing: religious indoctrination. Theyre teaching a very specific and narrow theological perspective, and its not a viewpoint that many mainline Christians share.So even if there are Christian children in these classes, who knows if the faith they are taught in that public classroom is the same they're getting on Sunday?Im curious about the purpose of a public school theological education for children in  secular schools. It seems like they dont need it to get into college or pursue trades, we don't live in a theocracy. So, what exactly is it preparing them for?Also, with so many churches in your community, shouldnt it be a parents right to educate their child in faith spaces that they choose? You dont have to fund a public school Christian education. Most churches already have that - its called Sunday school, and its not funded by public tax dollars.So why are they pushing this? **Easy answer: it's to create a new generation of MAGA minds who believe horrible policies done under a theocratic lens are valid or are part of this nations history.

All they need to do is convince the public that it is true.Hell, they don't even really need to do that, they just need to claim it is happening, then they can sign emergency authorization to force legal regulation for censorship on platforms like Facebook.Volunteering to do it themselves may benefit them in the long run rather than letting the legal infrastructure be set up to force them.Not saying I agree with Zuck giving in, but I do understand strong reasons for why he did.Hell, a tonne of people still believe all sorts of claims about Russian interference in elections and Russian propaganda manipulating people on platforms like X, despite the fact nobody could ever prove that to be true, and in fact when the documents came to light it turned out to be nothing but a narrative being sold to the public as another means of problem - reaction - solution in support of increased censorship and control online.But those claims were made and then repeated endlessly through many different forms of media until many of the general public accepted it must be demonstrable fact.I still do not trust Zuck, I have no clue what the true motivations might be behind this change, and I am mostly pessimistic about the future of online censorship and freedoms. The recent move around the globe to increase censorship really made me wonder if any and all truth movements would soon fade away into obscurity. Zuck's claims of these new changes do give me a tiny bit of cautious, sceptical hope.This move really does fit in with the whole right wing counter-culture phase of modern politics, which is something that to me appears to have been a very, very successful ploy by the intelligence agencies to manipulate a tonne of the people who are losing faith in authority institutions, and re-direct that skepticism into the same old two party tribalism politics, following their \\"anti-deep state\\" leader (lol) DJ Trump. They (Intel community) even played out an entire psy-op that appears to have been meant mostly for the Christian portion of the voter base that the right has adopted in the 70's with the whole Q-Anon thing. \\"Q\\" was an absolutely fantastical and bizarre conspiracy theory that was very, very much void of any logical, evidence, or critical thinking based ideas, and yet it was wildly successful because it was specifically targeted at a demographic whose strongest beliefs are faith based rather than evidence based. This psyop helped to grab attention of that Christian side of the voter base, and manipulate them into being more aligned with the rest of the modern \\"counter-culture\\" right, while simultaneously being successful in their consistent goal of maintaining a left-right divide by having the right spread conspiracy theories that were obviously wildly false and irrational to people on the left who caught a glimpse. Of course, this would also be successful in the usual muddying the waters in general for \\"conspiracy theories\\" and \\"conspiracy theorists\\", helping to make sure that the unacquainted would continue to see everything conspiracy related as the wild ramblings of the schizophrenic and obvious intentional manipulation for money, disregarding any and all that question the official narrative, and self correcting any time they find themselves catching some rational, evidence-based ideas opposing the narrative because \\"Hah, wait what am I thinking?

I'm not being dishonest.I agree that \\"comparisons were made\\", but I think the comparisons were correct. Trump *did* admire Hitler - according to his former chief of staff. It's possible his chief of staff (a highly respected former general and secretary of Homeland Security) is lying or misremembering or misstating what was said, and if you want to make that argument we could go into it, but if we *were* to take John Kelly at his word:He commented more than once that, You know, Hitler did some good things, too, Kelly recalled to The Times. Kelly said he would usually quash the conversation by saying nothing (Hitler) did, you could argue, was good, but that Trump would occasionally bring up the topic again. \\\\[...\\\\] In his interview with The Atlantic, Kelly recalled that when Trump raised the idea of needing German generals, Kelly would ask if he meant Bismarcks generals, referring to Otto von Bismarck, the former chancellor of the German Reich who oversaw the unification of Germany. Surely you cant mean Hitlers generals, Kelly recalled asking Trump. To which the former president responded, Yeah, yeah, Hitlers generals.Important note: Trump *didn't* admire the Holocaust, and we have zero evidence that Trump has ever planned the mass murder of any group of people. There are far-left folks who claim that Trump is planning to set up death camps, or whatever, and that's ludicrous. Moreover, Trump is generally against war (for all his bluster), so it seems unlikely that he would launch World War III by trying to invade other countries. It's possible to admire dictators (as Trump clearly does, by his own public statements, as well as his repeated statements to John Kelly) without being as bad as Adolf Hitler. That doesn't mean Harris was wrong to criticize him for it.Finally: *there's a difference between saying someone is a horrible person and being rude to them at a state event.* For folks like Obama, patriotism means showing a certain sort of respect and civility even to those you strongly disagree with. I'm the same way; I think Trump is a horrible person, perhaps the worst person we've ever had as US president; by refusing to accept the results of an election, spreading totally unfounded lies about the election being stolen and leading to a mob breaking into the US capitol, he has harmed American democratic norms. I'm happy to tell *you* that, or anyone else who'll listen. But if I met Trump himself at an event, I wouldn't cuss him out or throw a shoe at him or anything, because what would be the point? That would only further degrade public discourse; it's exactly what I don't want.","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"Hell will be raised if he does even a fraction of the bullshit he plans to.

THAT is the main reason that Im upset when I see Obama getting chummy with Trump. I know if I were in Obamas position, I wouldnt give that person the satisfaction of being polite to them. I wish Obama treated Trump like how Obama handled that famous picture where he stood down Putin. THAT was powerful and sent a message, and we know Obama is capable of acting tough if he wants to, so I dont see how him laughing and joking with Trump acceptable when Trump tries to dismantle everything Obama worked for, openly, openly disrespects the mans own wife, he disrespects where Obama was born for Christ-sake.And, like another commenter said, Trump does VALUE these things. Im sure he felt great about himself being so accepted in such an elite club. And shame on Obama for giving the impression that he belongs there, and hes pictured laughing with him at Carters funeral. If I had two daughters like Obama, even if Trump didnt do all the shit that he did to Obama, Trump is still a convicted rapist and sexual assaulter, and hes responsible for the overturning of Roe v Wade, and makes it clear on a daily basis he doesnt care about Americans rights. And Obama is laughing with him.The man is literally, unironically talking about invading other countrys sovereignty.
