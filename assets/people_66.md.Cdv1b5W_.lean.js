(The one that Trump gave an award too, while bashing our Troops). She is a big Trump donor who wants full annexation of Gaza in return for her support in 2024. This should have had a lot more focus from the democrats to highlight that Trump is not going to protect Gaza at all and will probably open up a blank check to Israel versus the support they were getting from the Biden administration.https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/miriam-adelson-trump-donors.htmlThey also failed to even highlight that when Biden tried to claw back support, Mike Johnson was hinting at impeaching Biden for not sending more weapons to Israel.

The first thing to do is look at the demographic makeup of the early vote we're seeing coupled with earlier surveys of what groups of people are saying they are voting on election day vs early.  Then with that data in hand, compare that to the sampling methodology of the likely voter models used by the Seltzer poll versus some of the other more credible pollsters like Emerson, Ipsos, and NYT/Sienna.    What you'll see is that in these polls, their turnout models have two problems that have been addressed in the Seltzer poll.  One is that they haven't updated them a great deal since Biden was in the race, and I think you'd agree that Kamala is going to turn out more and different people than Biden would have.   And it's also becoming increasingly clear that the likely voter models they are using are hugely underestimating the gender gap we're going to see in the actual voting.  They're assuming the average 4-6% higher female vote that we saw in 2020 instead of the 10-12% we're actually seeing be the case.  I'm betting they're also very much  undercounting the African American vote, but I don't have as solid data on that.","title":"New poll spells hope for Harris as she leads Trump in four key swing states"},{"text":"Hes growing into his last cosmetic surgery, I see.","title":"I saw the Barbie movie and I voted.

The mainstream pollsters produced polls showing dems performing far better than they actually did in the last two cycles. This cycle they were trying to correct for missing Trump voters in 2016 and 2020, and they probably overcorrected (well know tomorrow). The thing to know about these pollsters is they are more famous for their election work, but they make most of their money doing other types of polling for clients. Those clients are looking for companies that can do accurate work, so there is no incentive for the firms to produce incorrect polling data on purpose. There IS incentive not to stick their necks out and look worse then their competitors when the election results come in, so they practice herding so as to not be off on an island of their own. In most of these swing states they are safe if they adjust their weighting to come up with a tied or near tied race, because that will almost certainly produce a result within the margin of error. Its that simple, no conspiracy needed.","title":"Harris leads Trump by 3 points in new national survey"},{"text":"They aren't seeing 1/3 of the stuff we are.","title":"Trump suggests releasing poll results he dislikes should be illegal"},{"text":"This is why I dont see him winning-\\tno one liked Hillary\\n-\\ttrump ran as a drain the swamp candidate\\n \\nNow all the educated people already know he is trash and already said no last time.","title":"Trump campaign acknowledges to staffers: He could lose"},{"text":"And the swing state losses were in margin of error.","title":"New poll spells hope for Harris as she leads Trump in four key swing states"},{"text":"Trump learned nothing and by the way he's still couping.","title":"Trump learned from his failed coup.

I am that old Boomer lady who voted for KH. It was a huge strategic error by the Trump campaign to assume we no longer care about reproductive rights. Abortion rights and reproductive autonomy have been a life-long, firmly held belief of mine. There have been many women who dedicated their lives and blood, sweat, and tears to securing these rights. Its not going to go away just because we cant reproduce anymore. The GOP simply doesnt understand that this issue is in our blood, ingrained in us. Women have died and are still dying because of politicians meddling in our bodies. I remember when Roe was enacted in January 1973 and I also remember the day in June 2022 when it was overturned. Many of us old girls felt slapped in the face by that and angry, not only for ourselves but for our daughters and granddaughters. Were not ok with them having fewer rights than we had. Women are the demographic and abortion access is the issue that will cost Trump the election, mark my words. Hopefully it will also lead to the reelection of Sherrod Brown for Senate here in Ohio as well, since the MAGA Bernie Moreno has openly mocked us about it.

Some consolidation of sub-orgs happens naturally.This idea that we lost some perfect blueprint / plan for how to navigate is silly - any deliverable they produced would still be owned by HHS. The pandemic response team was mostly sitting on deck to help in coordination. Death rates were much higher, per capita, in red states than blue The death rate is the % of people diagnosed got Covid who later died. That number doesnt tell you anything at all about the efficacy of policy to reduce spread, all it tells you is how healthy / vulnerable the population is to the disease.The co-morbidities are obesity and age - so all your death rate stats is that the Deep South is fatter / older / poorer.The number you want to look at is *case rate*. The number of people who got COVID. That measures spread and the efficacy of containment measures.And the case rates were no different at all between red and blue states. The only patterns is that in red states the cases spiked in the summer (because people are indoors more with re-circulated AC) whereas in blue states they spiked in the winter (because people are indoors more with re-circulated heating).","title":"CMV: from an outside perspective, the Democrats are responsible for Trump rise to power and continued relevance."},{"text":"So ... they know they're losing.","title":"Thousands of Trump supporters mobilized to block election certification"},{"text":"No, I want us to never forget this piece of garbage.

Trump, a former president, has no place in American politics and certainly no place leading the United States of America as its 47th president. We would make this assertion no matter whom he is running against.\\" The newspaper's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, whom it described as \\"the only choice in 2024,\\" offered an enthusiastic show of support for the vice president but largely served as a strong reprimand of the former president. It described Trump as a divisive figure promoting an \\"out-of-control, disgusting, hate-filled rhetoric\\" and a \\"man who belittles women,\\" among other things. The article made a direct appeal to Staten Island voters, a majority of whom support Trump in his bid for the White House. While New York City, the former president's hometown, remains solidly blue and is expected to vote for Harris on November 5, Staten Island is an exception, as it favored Trump in the past two election cycles. In 2020, SILive.com reported, Trump received 110,094 votes on Staten Island against Joe Biden's 67,223. In 2016, ABC7 NY reported, Trump received 57 percent of the vote on Staten Island against Hillary Clinton's 40 percent. Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx overwhelmingly voted for Biden four years ago and for Clinton in 2016. At the state level, Biden won New York with 61 percent of the vote against Trump's 38 percent in 2020, while Clinton won it with 59 percent of the vote against Trump's 37 percent in 2016. Newsweek contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment by email outside normal working hours. Staten Island's feelings toward Trump have hardly changed during the Biden administration. SILive.com reported that hundreds of people turned out for the Staten Island GOP's Triumph rally on Saturday to show support for Trump's candidacy. \\"We understand a significant portion of conservative-leaning Staten Island will disagree, some vehemently, in support of her opponent,\\" the Staten Island Advance/SILive.com's editorial said, before listing reasons that Harris should be the next U.S. president. \\"Kamala Harris sees America's future as bright and optimistic, full of promise of what an America pulling together can be. Donald Trump sees America as a dark place, a place beset with soul-crushing, mind-bending issuesissues he claims only he can fix,\\" the article said. \\"In this election, Kamala Harris is the only hope to save America from a continuation of the chaos we saw in Trump's first four years, and indeed, in the four years that followed as Trump continued to sow hatred and divisiveness,\\" the editorial continued, adding, \\"If our goal is a better, kinder America, an America where we are not afraid to be ourselves, Kamala Harris is that alternative.\\"","title":"Donald Trump's Hometown Stronghold Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Bringing back the robber baron era is their dream","title":"\\"I am scared every day\\": Experts say GOP men targeting no-fault divorce to keep women \\"trapped\\""},{"text":"those that forget history are doomed to repeat it.","title":"Ok folks, we got one day left to teach Trump a lesson about how not to mess with us!

Hes gone batty. The only remaining question is whether enough voters recognize it.Michael TomaskyNovember 4, 2024\\nDonald Trump points enthusiastically.\\nI woke up Saturday morning, as you may have, to the sight of Donald Trump performing fellatio on a microphone (no, Im not linking to it). The clip that was making the rounds on X was 27 seconds. As I scrolled down, I noticed a tweet from a MAGA person scolding the non-MAGA world and offering a clip that ran to about two minutes. This context, this person suggested, would explain why he did this and prove once again how diabolically slanted the media was, and how unfair the world was to Trump.I watched the longer version. Um, news flash: The context didnt help. His mic went out. Someone handed him another one. He griped about his mic for a while. He held the working mic at his side and started to speak, I suppose demonstrating what it was like to be standing on a stage speaking without being heard, when suddenly he did that  thing he did.So no, there is no context. Theres no conceivable explanation that would leave us thinking, Oh, OK, sure, so thats why he emulated a blow job. Who among us wouldnt?Well, maybe theres one.Trump is fully losing it. Watch any of his recent speeches for five minutes. Hes completely incoherent. He has been this way for months, but it keeps getting worse. The only thing thats different now is that its a news storyfinally!and more people are recognizing it. Also, his crowds are walking out on him now during these rambling speeches that run to an hour and a half or more.His campaign is a mess. Over the weekend, The Atlantic published a devastating piece by Tim Alberta about the infighting in the campaign. You really should read it if you havent, its full of stunning details. The bottom line is as you might guess: The chaos emanates from the top.But the most interesting thing about the Alberta piece is not any specific anecdote that appears in it. The most interesting thing about the Alberta piece is that it exists at all. That is to say, that all these key players in a presidential campaign are taking time out in the last month of the race (assuming that Alberta has been reporting the piece out for a little while) to gripe to a reporter instead of sticking to doing their jobs. Its insane.And you know what else it is? A sign that theyre preparing for a loss. I suppose it could be argued the other waythat Trump insiders are trying to ice rivals out of potential jobs in a new Trump administration. But Ive covered lots of campaigns in my day, from president to City Council. The people who are laser-focused on winning never do this kind of preelection sniping. You only get this from people who worry that theyre going to lose and who dont want to be blamed so theyre still considered employable. I have no doubt there are rivalries and grudges in the Harris campaign too. There always are. But we dont know about them and wont until the insider books come out. Thats the key difference.Saturday was quite a day. First, the fellatio clip. Then the Alberta piece hit. And last and best, as day turned to night on the East Coast, boom, the Selzer poll out of Iowa droppedHarris ahead by three. In Iowa. Could Kamala Harris really win Iowa? Nah, went the consensus. But this poll just might be telling us something about the momentum of this race.Im going to beg to differ. It absolutely might be telling us that Harris can win Iowa. First, Selzer is universally respected. Second, maybe Selzers polling method is a little different. Different how? Different in the way that is summarized in the headline Marcy Wheeler put on her write-up of the poll at Empty Wheel: Male Pollsters ShockedShocked!!When a Woman Pollster Discovers Women Voters. Consider for a second the landscape in Iowa: Late last summer, one of the most draconian abortion bans in the country went into effect.In the Selzer poll, independent women are backing Harris by 28 points. Senior women back her 63C28. Sit with those numbers for a second. Theyre staggering.Could they be wrong? Sure. But heres another question to chew on: Could the rest of the polling, which has tended to base its samples on 2020 turnout and the now-infamous recalled vote, and which is painfully concerned with undercounting Trump voters, be in fact undercounting Harris votersthe women who are jazzed about her candidacy and the women (and men) who are post-Dobbs Democratic voters?Well find out soon enough, but the point for now is that it was a pulverizing piece of news that ended a week in Trump world that started out, youll recall, with the fascist, racist, more-or-less-everythingist rally at Madison Square Garden. Ive been a little chagrined that coverage of that grisly event has focused almost exclusively on Tony Hinchcliffes repulsive joke about Puerto Rico, because so many other disgusting comments were vomited out from that stage. On the other hand, that coverage has given us polls like this one, again from Saturday: Puerto Ricans in Florida prefer Harris by 85C8. Not a typo. There are around 1.1 million Puerto Ricans in Florida; according to Puerto Rico Report, There are now more eligible voters from Puerto Rico in Florida than from Cuba. Harriss numbers among Latinos are up 15 points from July to October.I didnt even get to Trumps comments about women and RFK Jr. and his inability to grab a door handle. In sum: The odor thats emanating from the Trump campaign right now is one of total free fall. And Harris seems to be peaking perfectlyno mistakes, totally on message; great Saturday Night Live appearance; fantastic LeBron endorsement; wonderful cameos by people like J-Lo and Alicia Keys, who made beautiful remarks over the weekend at a rally outside Philadelphia.Thats what we have on this day before Election Day: a well-run campaign with a disciplined candidate who is actually talking about peoples lives, versus a Pollock canvas of a campaign led by a candidate who is both losing what remains of his marbles and stewing ever more deeply in the vinegar of his prejudices and hatreds. The only hanging question now is whether enough Americans have taken note.","title":"Donald Trump Has Lost His Sh*t"},{"text":"Trumps intelligence knows no beginnings.","title":"Trump: I'm smart, probably brilliant\\".

Black homeownership averaged 42.2 percent under Trump and 45.4 percent under Biden. Black labor force participation was higher under Biden. Contrary to false claims by some Republicans, take-home pay adjusted for inflation rose three times faster for Black workers when Biden was president. The percentage of Blacks without health insurance fell while Biden has been president, hitting a record low in 2022 of under 10 percent.The First Step Act, claimed by Trump as one of his signature achievements, was designed to help rehabilitate incarcerated Americans and reduce recidivism. Trumps Department of Justice, however, tried to set higher standards for and freeze applications from those seeking early release. Thus far, the program has had a negligible effect on the prison population.Trump opposed renewal of the Voting Rights Act and continues to support restrictions on voting access that affect millions of Black citizens, including an end to mail-in ballots, a return to one-day in-person voting and a requirement for an ID that one out of every 10 Americans say they do not have or cannot readily produce.","title":"What Trump has actually done for Black Americans"},{"text":"Let this be the GOP's Gettysburg.","title":"Almost as if the GOPs entire post-Dobbs approach has been a Little Bighorn-level strategic misfire"},{"text":"Looks like a toss up https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/pennsylvania/","title":"Trump and Harris are both a normal polling error away from a blowout"},{"text":"He gets in and its gonna toe-to-toe with the Rooskies!","title":"Trump and RFK Jr hold first cabinet meeting."},{"text":"It will enter months and months of fraudulent suits destined to lose.

From now til the election, an Indiana Proud Boy chapter posted on Telegram in July with a photo of a MAGA cap.A Telegram page for a chapter in Long Island, N.Y., boasted about members who it said attended a Trump rally in Michigan last month. If they only knew we were backstage and all over, the post states.Another Proud Boy Telegram post said members from a half-dozen states converged on Trumps Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pa., the site of the July assassination attempt. Their post, accompanied by a photo slideshow, said members were there to watch Trumps back and to experience the momentous occasion with the good people of the MAGA movement.Julie Farnam, a former U.S. Capitol Police assistant director over intelligence, who is now a private investigator, cautions that decentralized chapters make the Proud Boys harder to track.Farnam said potential presidential pardons for Jan. 6 defendants is a factor driving their support for Trump. Trump has floated the idea of pardoning Jan. 6 rioters. On Telegram, some Proud boys post photos of themselves, claiming to be outside Trump rallies, with signs like, free the J6 prisoners.They will expect that Trump will pardon, Farnam said.A Kentucky Proud Boys chapter said on Truth Social last month it was standing back and standing by, which it called a throwback to Trumps use of that phrase to the Proud Boys during a 2020 presidential debate. The chapter promoted a Sunday Traveling Trump Train event in Lexington that it said was organized by Christian conservatives.A Kentucky chapter member told the Journal his group doesnt have plans to gather for the election, but said there is a possibility members will attend the inauguration if Trump winsto celebrate and raise awareness of the Proud Boys imprisoned over the Capitol riot.Some Proud Boys also express support for Trumps proposals, particularly immigration.A recent Telegram post by an Ohio Proud Boys group said: 1/20/25: Trump is sworn in as President. 1/21/25: Me and the Proud Boys begin the deportations.","title":"Trump signaling the Proud Boys to stand by on Sunday.

Chapters have gathered across state lines, talked about watching polls and have been boasting about attending Trump rallies to protect the former president.The online chatter comes as law-enforcement officials confront an unprecedented array of aggressors this election season: foreign operatives, homegrown extremists and lone wolves such as those accused of trying to assassinate Trump.The digital activity appears to show the Proud Boys regrouping after the imprisonment of many members and top leadersindividuals that a bipartisan House panel called central orchestrators of the riot. Former national chairman Enrique Tarrio is serving 22 years for seditious conspiracy and other charges for trying to thwart the transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden.A Texas Proud Boys chapters Telegram account recently shared a post alleging a Democratic conspiracy to install Vice President Kamala Harris as president through millions of fake ballots.Replied a commenter pictured with a Proud Boys flag in the background: So we can shoot them then, right?A North Carolina Proud Boys chapter, which has formally endorsed Trump on Telegram, thanked its members who volunteered to work the polls in the primaries, calling it an excellent trial run for the general election in November. The chapter also talked about providing security for Trump at a September rally in Wilmington, N.C., and declared that Harris will not win without a steal, which is exactly what they are planning to do.The North Phoenix Proud Boys posted a picture of a gun arsenal on Truth Social last month, declaring, Proud Boys stocking up getting ready for NovIts going to be biggley!! An Ohio chapter warned on Telegram that once Trump wins, antifa will riot, adding, Prepare accordingly.The Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit tracking hate speech and extremism, documented in a new report a 317% surge in violent rhetoric related to election denialism by various groups on Telegram during October. The organization cited posts that used alleged rigged elections to justify an inevitable civil war and a call to Shoot to kill any illegal voters.Heidi Beirich, the organizations co-founder, said groups like the Proud Boys are planning to do poll watching and have signaled they are prepared for violence.In one discussionviewed by the JournalProud Boys members suggested keeping your rifle by your side.In a written statement, Telegram said it does not tolerate content that encourages disrupting legal democratic processes through violence or destruction of property. The statement added, Telegram is aware of rising tensions during election periods and is actively ramping up its human, AI and machine-learning moderation efforts to keep the platform safe for users. We are ready to cooperate with the authorities to remove criminal content.The federal government is planning dramatically increased security for this Jan. 6 when Congress meets to certify election results. Law-enforcement officials say they dont expect an attack of similar scale, in part because more than 1,500 rioters were charged.Yet the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security warned state and local officials in October that solo extremists or small groups, similarly galvanized by election-related grievances, could mobilize for violence between Election Day and at least the Jan. 20 inauguration.In the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, the Proud Boys were leading the on-the-ground efforts to storm the seat of government, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia said in a written statement after Tarrios 2023 sentencing.

Yet the decision this year is quite simple, the choice quite clear. Donald J. Trump, a former president, has no place in American politics and certainly no place leading the United States of America as its 47th president. Vice President Kamala Harris is the only choice in 2024, and the Advance/SILive.com endorses her enthusiastically and without hesitation. It is essential to elect a candidate who we can respect, a candidate who respects the people they will lead, a candidate who respects our global allies. Donald Trump is none of that. He has been called crude, vulgar, unhinged, and delusional. All of which Donald Trump is. John F. Kennedy, when elected, told America the torch was being passed to a new generation. It is time to pass that torch again, keeping it from a man who peddles hatred, who threatens his fellow citizens, who disparages anyone who has the temerity to disagree with him, who is so mercurial in his thought process C if there is a thought process C that no one knows what he might do next.Election Day is tomorrow everyone, it's time to turn the page on Donald Trump.","title":"Donald Trump's Hometown Stronghold Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Unfortunately Trump can't just grab the electorate by the pussy","title":"Axelrod: Trump not closing well"},{"text":"The 14 characteristics of Fascism fit Trump to the letter.The characteristics are:1.

Nothing would stop him from using the military against the American people *exactly* aligns with a conspiracy theory concerning [DoD Directive 5240.01](https://thewarhorse.org/far-right-misinformation-military-policy-lethal-force/) which the far-right is trying to use against you, and by repeating it (quite literally) you are reinforcing and giving validation to their ideas. Dont bring yourself to that level.Do you see what the problem is and why I might suggest going easy on the apocalyptic rhetoric, from a strictly practical standpoint? You might win a few more votes by making people afraid that the military will attack them, but probably not many.

It doesn't and it won't.So many people who are protest voting or going to protest vote are not even Palestinians-they are just Muslims who empathize with their religious (but not blood) brethren in Palestine-so they don't even have family in Palestine-so what are they really voting for? Increased hate crimes against them and their families IN America, increased Islamophobia online and offline (considering Musk's friendship with Trump, this is very much a possibility), increased othering of them and their people-all of Project 2025 policies that disproportionately target minorities?Instead they could vote for a better life IN America under Kamala and a leader who will undoubtedly listen to Palestinians/Muslims/other activists on Gaza more than Trump whose plans including criminalizing anti-Israel dissent which means you won't even be able to criticize Israel under his leadership.

John Larson (D-CT). The Democrats can hold public hearings, report bills to the Senate floor and then make the Republicans filibuster. **Let the GOP sweat a days-long filibuster of a bill establishing a $15 minimum wage**. Imagine the national TV coverage with Democrats rebutting the cruel or lying orations by megamillionaire Senator Mitch McConnell and his minions.\\n \\n As has been the practice for years, the Republican minority members in the Senate **merely sent the majority leader an email threatening a filibuster** (extended debate is the euphuism) and the majority leader placed the bills from the House in limbo.\\n \\n **Make the GOP filibuster** is a rising private cry of Democrats in the House led by Cong. Larson. **Let the GOP show its cruel fangs, its opposition to the long-overdue necessities for workers, the elderly, consumers, the environment and equal rights** for women. Many House bills passed bipartisanly, meaning they had more than nominal numbers of Republican votes.\\n \\n **The filibuster can be turned into a boomerang against the Republicans. It could become a form of public education to strip the GOP of its sugar-coated propaganda** and make Republican Senators explain why they are against fair play, justice and the righting of past wrongs, which are harming all the people, not just Democratic voters.This is really an awesome (and common-sense) suggestion by Ralph Nader.

It's like the more evidence and the guiltier he is, the easier it gets for him to avoid consequences. Trump feels no shame and there's no depths too depraved for him. That's why no one else could ever lead MAGA and anyone who's tried has miserably failed. His followers utterly admire his ability to say and do whatever he wants without care.","title":"Trump Isnt Perfect, but Hes the Better Choice"},{"text":"Actually, some were attempting to move Southern Baptism in a more progressive direction.  For example:At the 1971 annual meeting in St. Louis, almost two years before Roe v. Wade was decided, the messengers passed the SBC's first resolution on the topic of abortion. The resolution was by no means conservative: in addition to supporting abortion in cases of rape or incesta position supported by some conservativesit also supported it in such cases as \\"clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother\\".The messengers at the 1974 meeting in Dallas (the year after Roe was decided) reaffirmed the 1971 resolution, saying that it \\"dealt responsibly from a Christian perspective with complexities of abortion problems in contemporary society\\" while also in the same resolution saying that the SBC \\"historically held a high view of the sanctity of human life\\".In 1971 *and* 1974, the SBC officially supported abortion.Broadly, conservatives started realizing that their positions weren't as popular as liberals, so they planned and staged a takeover of the SBC, resulting in one of the largest denominational splits US Protestantism has seen.Beginning in 1979, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) experienced an intense struggle for control of the organization. Its initiators called it the conservative resurgence while its detractors labeled it the fundamentalist takeover. It was launched with the charge that the seminaries and denominational agencies were dominated by liberals. The movement was primarily aimed at reorienting the denomination away from a liberal trajectory.It was achieved by the systematic election, beginning in 1979, of conservative individuals to lead the SBC. Theologically moderate and liberal leaders were voted out of office. Though some senior employees were fired from their jobs, most were replaced through attrition. Conversely, moderate and liberal presidents, professors, and department heads of Southern Baptist seminaries, mission groups and other convention-owned institutions were replaced with conservatives.The resurgence is said by some to be the most serious controversy ever to occur within the SBC, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. Albert Mohler later described it as a \\"reformation ... achieved at an incredibly high cost.\\" A part of that cost was the departure of 1,900 churches from the convention, which broke away in 1990 to form the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a moderate Baptist group which affirms women in ordained ministry and emphasizes the Baptist principles of the autonomy of the local church, the priesthood of all believers, and soul liberty.[Southern Baptist Convention conservatism resurgence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence?wprov=sfla1)","title":"Across America, Evangelicals Are Told That God Wants Donald Trump"},{"text":"The FBI should be mobilized to arrest those interfering with the election, which is a crime.","title":"Thousands of Trump supporters mobilized to block election certification"},{"text":"I had not heard of this, thanks for sharing.

If they really cared about making Israel do the right thing they would have done something BEFORE Oct 7th, when the Biden administration literally thought that Israel was Annexing the West Bank due to the insane increase of settlement expansion and settler violence in the region in the first 6 months of 2023. But nope, not a single peep, not even news coverage of the state sanctioned Israeli terrorism. So much was not said that people thought October 7th came unprovoked. This admin doesnt give two shits about Palestinians other than saving face during their ethnic cleansing, and having to try and cover for Israel killing them too quickly. Were helping Israel slow-walk their genocide because they know that it would be a world war if they let the IDF off their leash. I mean jfc the Biden admin wont even walk back trumps admin recognition of Israels illegal annexation of the Golan Heights. \\nOn April 23, 2019, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he will bring a resolution for government approval to name a new community in the Golan Heights after Trump.[49] On June 16, 2019, Israel announced the establishment of Trump Heights, a planned settlement in the Golan Heights.[50]\\nIn June 2021, Biden administration in the US affirmed that it would continue to maintain the previous administrations policy of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[51] However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has signalled openness to an eventual policy review.\\n[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_recognition_of_the_Golan_Heights_as_part_of_Israel#:~:text=In%20June%202021%2C%20Biden%20administration,to%20an%20eventual%20policy%20review%22)\\nThe Biden admin also never walked back Trumps declaration of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital (forbidden by the very doctrine that made Israel a state), Biden has also moved forward with the US embassy for Israel being built on stolen Palestinian land in Jerusalem. He also has not opened up the US consulate for Palestinians that was shut down by Trump. \\nIm voting for Harris, but lets not pretend its because theyre on the moral side of Israels genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. They talk about getting rid of Hamas meanwhile settler violence and expansion has only increased since the genocide began where Israel just approved a 5 square mile piece of Palestinian land to be the grounds for a new settlement the [biggest land theft since 1993.](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/03/israel-turbocharges-west-bank-settlement-expansion-00166584). I dont need books to nuance this conflict because its plain as day.

Even if Trump had had the worst FP ever, this does not make Biden garbage FP worth defending with the amount of partisanship that has been seen here. It especially does not warrant lying about the article by claiming that they're advocating for appeasement with Russia, when they are in fact complaining about the weakness and lack of direction with which Biden has conducted his FP and the terrible consequences it has had for Ukrainians (among others).Yet both outright lies about the content of the article and bad faith argument to defend Biden's inaction are at the top of the page, because this sub has turned insanely partisan and would rather upvote lies than pop their own bubble.Now if I were to strongman the article, their entire point was that Trump willingness to strike is what avoided greater escalation. His measured and tactical use of US military might to intimidate and bully countries into submission, as well as his otherwise completely unhinged and very thin-skinned character, made the usual suspects wary of stirring shit with the US that Trump could take personally.  \\n \\\\- Had the US struck Iran's allies or top generals in retaliation for their sending weapons to Russia, they might have thought twice.   \\n \\\\- Had Biden deployed troops in Ukraine before the war, or authorized the sending of additional military equipment this could have deterred Russia.   \\n \\\\- Had Biden authorized Ukraine to strike into Russia with allied weapons, this would have made Putin reconsider his position.   \\n \\\\- Had he allowed the sending of F16 and AAM, Ukrainian troops might have been able to hold against the recent attacks against a Russian army devoid of their FAB's  \\n \\\\- Had he authorized NATO allies to shoot Russian airplanes violating their airspace, or allowed neighbouring countries to ensure air-defence over the Ukrainian border, we would also have seen a shift in Moscow attitude towards negotiations.  \\n \\\\- Had he unlocked the range of the provided Ballistic missiles when N.Korea provided ICBM in violations of international treaties, Russia might have reconsidered trading garbage N.Korean ICBM against full-range HIMARS.Biden's attitude has shown the Kremlin that the White House did not intend to get involved in Ukraine, this in turn emboldened Russians to continue the war because they knew that no big move from the US would change their prospects of victory. If Biden had used his considerable powers to either directly respond, or allow NATO or allies to respond to Russia's repeated escalations, Putin would already be trying to negotiate. Instead he let Russia get ahead, every transgression or escalation from Russia was tolerated, allowing Russia to slowly strengthen their positions as Ukrainian were begging for the US to allow them to respond in kind.  \\nThe article argues that this unwillingness to set out clear geopolitical objectives and use the considerable powers at his disposal to ensure world peace, is what allowed war to foster.Speak softly and carry a big stick, only works if one is willing to use it, and Biden showed the world that he wouldn't, as a result the world simply stopped listening.","title":"The biggest winner from the Biden administrations foreign policy has been China, say Michael Waltz and Matthew Kroenig"},{"text":"All of our data has been sold for decades under the guise of \\"free\\".

The 2020 plan of pressuring Congress not to certify on 1/6 didnt work then, and definitely wouldnt work now.But what was workshopped and test flown in 2020 and 2022 were various other ways of preempting the election.Between the start of vote counting around 11/5 and receipt of state electoral certificates on 12/25, the plan is openly to intercept and prevent the transmission and receipt of the certificates in DCThat means three options1. Certificate Transmission/Receipt: Simply preventing the certificate from being sent, therefore taking a blue states electors out of the mix, thus reducing the 270 threshold.2. Certification: Convincing local/regional election judges to declare some part of the process invalid.  This will involve threats and acts of violence against them and their families, direct attacks on or bombing of storage locations, burning ballot drop boxes, etc.3. Legislative Preemption: Convincing the state legislatures that they have a constitutional right to appoint the states electors in the manor of their choosing, and nowhere in federal law or the constitution does it say they cant simply disregard the vote.  This has sort of been tested before SCOTUS on related topics like gerrymandering.All three of these approaches have been tested, all three are *openly* talked about.  I think our next 1/6 is now just a few days away from starting, not two months.The coming investigation and the number of trials and convictions that will flow from 11/5 through 12/25 will likely dwarf 1/6/20 by an order of magnitude.  Instead of 2,000 prosecutions that have taken 4 years, well be facing 20,000 or more prosecutions.  Well have to come up with a way to have 10x or more prosecutors, more judges, more investigators, etc or the cases will all just time out under statutes of limitations.Or, Trump wins and the prosecution of political enemies begins instead.","title":"Thousands of Trump supporters mobilized to block election certification"},{"text":"Trump has been in regular contact with Netanyahu and Putin since leaving office but, yes, Kamalas 5 minute spot on SNL is what we should all be concerned about.","title":"FCC commissioner (Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee) claims Harris on SNL violates equal time rule.

It is advertised as \\"predicting\\" every election because it was synthesised from the outcomes of all of the ones that occurred prior to the model, but has only actually succeeded in 9 out of the 10 it was actually used to predict since the fact. That's not a bad record by any means, but it's not perfect. It's not like the laws of physics, which are predictive because they mechanically cause the outcomes of events; systems like this, which try to predict something as unstable and random as an election, will only ever be right until they aren't.The model is also demonstrably incoherent when applied in some contexts, so for example the existence of a strong third party candidate is taken to provide an advantage to the challenger party regardless of what platform the third party stands on. Imagine if Trump lost the primary this year, and then ran as a third  party candidate with a \\"MAGA party\\", splitting the conservative vote. According to the keys, this would help the Republicans to win, but this obviously could not be further from the truth when examined practically.

When we heard messaging at the MSG rally last week, there was a really easy ability to then connect that to how he handled certain situations when he was president. Its not just a flippant joke but a representation of how he actually acted. For example, were running an ad right now targeting Puerto Rican voters in partnership with Somos Votantes across the battleground, particularly in Pennsylvania, that really ties together the joke about Puerto Rico being an island of trash up against how Trump handled Hurricane Maria. That ad is testing really well amongst Latino voters, in particular Puerto Rican voters, because it reminds them, and it really contextualizes, that this isnt just words, its his actions. Thats a really big shift that were seeing this year in terms of our ability to show Trumps impact. One other thing that we are seeing is that young voters are hearing audio from Trumps Billy Bush interview where he said grab them by the p-wordtheyre hearing that for the first time this year, even though it leaked originally in the 2016 cycle. This is really important because these voters who are voting for the first time in 2024 were 10, 11 years old when Trump was first elected in 2016. So when these voters are hearing this horrible sound and this horrible audio interview from Trump with his graphic depiction of how he views women, theyre hearing it in the context of him being proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. The context of how his words have actually had a disastrous impact, its just landing a lot differently in this cycle.It certainly felt good to see that Iowa polls, particularly her numbers with white suburban women and older voters. Even if we dont win in Iowa, its a signal that were going to do well in the upper Midwest. Its a great sign of whats to come for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. But it doesnt change our strategy. Neither of these polls change our strategy at this point, which is that we need to continue to persuade and mobilize these voters in the final stretch. The thing that doesnt necessarily get reported as much is that were doing it with such joy. Seeing all these Harris volunteers out on the doors with their rogue merch that they made at home and their friendship bracelets and having just an amazing back and forth on SNL last night about Harriss ability to drive joy in this final stretch.

Who in the hell is \\"undecided\\" at this point and HOW could they be? I feel like every interview with an \\"undecided\\" voter that you see on the news is someone who knows damn well who they are voting for, and has for a long time, they just want their 5 minutes of fame on CNN.Overall I feel like this is an aspect of the election that is driving the very bad polling and herding phenomena we're seeing. Polling models make some big assumptions about undecideds and their propensity to vote. In this election cycle though, I think that in reality very very very little of America is or has been undecided for a long time. As soon as Trump made it official that he was running again I think that close to 100% of the public that was ever going to vote was decided. Maybe a chunk of Biden voters waffled a bit when they saw him visibly deteriorating in the first debate, but that was completely cured by him dropping out and being replaced by Harris.It just doesn't make logical sense. Show me a person who honestly voted for Biden in 2020 but now wants to vote for Trump. Maybe you can find a handful of people but I think that it's very obvious that the opposite scenario is more likely. So I don't buy any of these polls showing \\"a dead heat.\\" Trump is a known quantity and the majority of Americans despise hearing his name at this point and want him to go away. More than anything, this election is going to come down to that. I believe Harris is going to win very soundly and we wont have to wait days for the results.","title":"Trump Visibly Rattled as Surprise Polls Show Undecideds Move to Harris"},{"text":"Ukrainian oil and gas fields.

Look no further than his post on Truth Social around the events of January 6th to get an idea of the type of person he is: Do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.But to say SCOTUS justices want this to happen is to imply that they are completely subservient to the president or would follow ideology over sacrosanct law. Conservative or not, thats a bit of a stretch. The president may nominate justices but the Senate confirmation process allows for some checks and balances.I think there will be some erosion of normative democracy under a second Trump term, and I dont want to understate the danger of this because as the saying goes democracy dies by 1,000 cuts. But to suggest there is any imminent risk to Constitutional democracy is a far more radical idea. Youre talking something like overturning the 22nd Amendment, which would only be practically possible through the legislature. I will admit there is a novel, untested concept of an unconstitutional constitutional amendment which could allow SCOTUS to act on their own, but thats an extreme hypothetical.Now if you believe that a solid majority of Republicans in the legislature are extreme MAGA sycophants who will follow Trump over the founding principles of our country, I dont know what to tell you because thats an unfalsifiable argument. But there are plenty of credible historians and political scientists who have carefully considered this idea of a third Trump term, and as far as I know, precisely zero of them have suggested it as a likely possibility. Even the most extreme conjectures on the risk to democracy from people like Bruce Bueno de Mesquita dont even come close.And here you have someone telling people *0% chance* Trump will leave office. This is conclusively and definitively wrong and alarmist to an extreme degree. You can tell people that democracy is at risk without making it sound like the world is ending.","title":"Trump says I shouldnt have left White House, despite losing 2020 election"},{"text":"Here is my take: I know the Israel/Hamas war is a difficult subject for a lot of voters (both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine alike) and many view it as a make or break deal for who they vote for. I am asking all voters that feel deeply about this war to examine the other issues in this upcoming election. If you can truly look at both parties'positions on the economy, healthcare, equal rights, the environment, LGBTQ+ support, abortion rights, religious freedoms, and stability and still feel there is no difference on who you vote for, then I truly have nothing left to say to you. However, if you truly care about the future of our country, Middle Eastern relations, and the future we leave for the next generation, then I urge you to not throw your vote away on a protest vote, or abstain, or vote Trump to teach the Dems a \\"lesson\\". More than just the Middle East is on the line tomorrow and I fear that if we don't stop Project 2025 now, we may never get another chance. I say this as a father of two girls, a husband, a veteran, and an Atheist Jew. Please do not let Trump snatch victory from the clutches of defeat. Show the world we are better than that. Show your LGBTQ+ friends their safety matters. Show corporations we want regulations and cleaner air. Show the for profit healthcare system that keeping us sick and bankrupting us when we need help will only lead to a disastrous end for so many that would rather stay sick than incur the bills. Show the teachers and students that we care about the future of this country and that we value intellect and deep thinking over memorization and regurgitation. Good luck tomorrow, everyone.

Mr. Trump is so hungry for this content that he appears to be willing to share outlandish information from anyone, including both well-known conspiracists and anonymous accounts that tag him.  \\nThe Times analyzed thousands of Mr. Trumps posts and reposts over a six-month period in 2024 and found that at least 330 of them met two tightly defined and striking criteria: They each described both a false, secretive plot against Mr. Trump or the American people and a specific entity supposedly responsible for it.

There are better ways to discourage divorces and encourage marriages than using law to do it. Like maybe make therapy cheaper and more easily accessible for the poorest, make education cheaper and just better quality and available to a larger section of people, make home ownership more attainable, put into policies that ensure more work-life balance, labor law/labor policy reforms.Couples divorce for so many reasons but I think financial pressures is a big one. Money is the root of all strife-if that issue is resolved, perhaps couples will find it easier to co-exist. And if people are happier, it is easier to see the silver lining of remaining in a marriage.But Trump/Vance's policies will lead to financial hardship for millions of Americans-likely prolonged hardship which will make life even harder-and in turn marriages harder. Happy couples don't divorce, couples who are struggling at work/in life are likely to have more discord and thereby will choose the option of divorce.If work or business is thriving, you are making good money, you are able to provide for yourself and your children with ease, enjoy a good standard of life, are able to take breaks/holidays to decompress/have affordable healthcare at your fingertips, what reason would you have to breakup.
