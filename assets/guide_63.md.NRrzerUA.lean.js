If the patient requests it from a doctor who does not agree with the practice, that doctor will be obliged to refer them to a colleague who does. Here we see the dynamic established: this is presented as a plausible, even a good choice for patients to make, and the system will help them to make it. The echoes of the Liverpool Care Pathway, a notorious scheme of ten years ago by which patients were essentially assigned by the National Health Service to die, should sound in our ears.  \\n  \\nThe laws very existence would put pressure on each patient and their family to have the conversation, whether openly at the bedside or whispered outside the room: is it time for Mum or Dad to die? Patients would bear the awful responsibility of deciding whether to go nowsparing their loved ones the cost and distress of caring for themor to hold on selfishly, messily, expensively.  \\n  \\nThis is not freedom.

Ill take some of these moderately popular topics one by one to try and give you some hope.* Pollution and fossil fuel extraction: Were not eliminating either of these off the face of the planet. But, polluting the Earth as we do now and using fossil fuels is not sustainable. Its really shitty that my generation and future ones are stuck with the burden of reversing course but thats the way of the world. Technology has allowed for enormous gains in efficiency and effectiveness of current energy generating infrastructure; like iron-based batteries for energy storage and high efficiency wind turbines. Both are very sustainable to produce and create entirely new economies of scale. Theres also many transferable skills that people in the fossil fuel extraction industry possess that lend themselves to things likesolar panel installation. What a surprise! All that aside, we have absolutely no idea what tech will be invented in the future to help this problem.* Animal cruelty: This one I think has a very easy solution. Stop eating meat, ho. Ive done quit meat for months at a time(caveat that I am Mexican so my family doesnt really understand) and thankfully theres enough activists who publicize their findings to get more support to at least keep the most damaging and dangerous factory farms in check. Also lab grown meat is a thing! Theres so many unexplored facets of genetics we have yet to uncover, I have no doubt we will get to a Star Trek diet sooner than later(hopefully).* Political polarization: This is not whataboutism because we live in the present and the potential for outright Nxzis or f@rcist right wing governments exist in several countries. But, we should remind ourselves that this point is very much true of the past. The Spanish Inquisition did really happen, Taiwan has probably always been a Chinese resistance state since the late 18th century, and in my lifetime the U.S. invaded two more countries. The fact is, the U.S. is too big and has too big of a target on its back for us to just all get along at an antinatalist New Age alien mass wedding ceremony every decade(i want your funds). But, things are better than theyve been in the past! Im copped up in a lab making a stem cell cow testicle source for hot dogs, which can clearly only be a product of the radicals of a bygone era who fought, marched, and created the infrastructure necessary to continue their vision of a more just world. The only thing that can heal us is to cope through comedy and continue the work. Andddd we have no idea what aliens will bring us so lets see!* Technology: Anything can be weaponized by someone with ill intent and surely the weapon developers and blacksite cia op communicator have the best samurai powers for the job. But, anything can be friendshipdised too! Children are born everyday and they love their parents regardless of where they were born and what OPSEC book you have in your shelf. Why computers and phones are in the latest period of technological development is anyones guess but we are certainly overdue for the death of at least one of the big boys and a bottled genie or alien encounter. Anything we can do to literally evolve our reality through tech, like lab grown burgers and injectable wings, we should do. ANDDDDD there just so happens to be all of the aforementioned knowledge waiting for us to discover on technologies that are too new to not explore Hope you find a big ass cup of water in your mirage!","title":"CMV: Our global society is turning to a dumpster-fire due to pollution, animal cruelty, fossil fuel extraction, political/social polarization, new technologies being used to commit unspeakable injustices, and other harms."},{"text":"\\"Catturd\\" pretty much sums it up","title":"Just so you know... a jury unanimously found Trump guilty, and this is a lie."},{"text":"Only when it seves their purpose as always.

People who disagree with this are simply in a state of coping, where they use sources that justify humanity to comfort themselves. Big corporations obviously also play a large part in the environmental crisis. Here is a paragraph from an essay I wrote:6. The term *Carbon Footprint* was invented as way for big oil companys to pass the pollution blame from themselves onto the common people. The term was originally popularized by the advertising firm Ogilvy &amp; Mather in the early 2000s as part of a?campaign for British Petroleum (BP).7.?British retroleum?is a multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London, England and one of the worlds largest companies measured by revenues and profits.8. Blaming the common people for pollution is what the huge oil companies?want?us to do. By making the general public focus on individual responsibility, BP and other industry giants like ExxonMobil have?avoided taking full accountability?for their role as some of the largest polluters on Earth. While individuals certainly contribute to pollution, the environmental damage caused by these corporations vastly outweighs that of the common person.","title":"CMV: Our global society is turning to a dumpster-fire due to pollution, animal cruelty, fossil fuel extraction, political/social polarization, new technologies being used to commit unspeakable injustices, and other harms."},{"text":"* Submitted article mirror: https://archive.is/uICUh* \\"Kremlin says Trump threat to BRICS nations over US dollar will backfire\\" by Reuters (December 2, 2024): https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-trump-threat-brics-nations-against-replacing-us-dollar-will-2024-12-02/ , https://archive.is/fJGOM\\n* \\"South Africa Says No Plans to Develop a Common BRICS Currency\\" by Colleen Goko-Petzer and Paul Vecchiatto (December 2, 2024): https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/south-africa-rejects-trump-s-claims-over-brics-currency-plans , https://archive.is/cD1Eo* \\"BRICS currency: Is Trump's tariff threat justified?\\" by Nik Martin (December 2, 2024): https://www.dw.com/en/brics-currency-is-trumps-tariff-threat-justified/a-70934600 , https://archive.is/xmCHx* \\"Trump Weaponizing Dollar Seen as Needless BRICS Provocation\\" by Ruth Carson and Matthew Burgess (December 2, 2024): https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/trump-weaponizing-dollar-seen-as-a-needless-brics-provocation , https://archive.is/wip/CNmp4* \\"Trump vows to defend US dollar hegemony, but is it under threat?\\" by AFP (December 3, 2024): https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241203-trump-vows-to-defend-us-dollar-hegemony-but-is-it-under-threat , https://archive.is/1vQgt* \\"Nigeria seeks South Africa's help to join G20, BRICS\\" \\"At a joint summit, Nigeria officially asked for South African endorsement to join the important economic blocs.

But President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench, temporarily whittling the GOP majority down further as Trump takes office in January. Just one House race remains to be decided nearly four weeks after Election Day, with 99% of the vote counted in California's 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is leading GOP Rep. John Duarte. Last week, victories in another California district, along with one in Iowa brought the balance of power in the chamber to 220-214. Meanwhile, Trump has tapped a handful of House Republicans for top positions in his administration. In the week following the election, the president-elect made two selections from the House, with GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York as ambassador to the U.N., and Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida as national security adviser. **Read more:** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republican-majority-squeezed-by-trump-nominees/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republican-majority-squeezed-by-trump-nominees/)","title":"Incoming House majority squeezed by Trump's planned appointments"},{"text":"Does anyone seriously still think the hostages are alive?

Nothing else matters.Laugh all we want at the failed casinos, the failed vodka, the failed steaks, NFTs, sneakers, etc. he doesn't care about whether any of those operations make a dime or not. What he cares about is that with every new direction, he meets and rubs elbows with new people and, simply by associating with him, those people have been touched with his stain. He knows it.

I reject it utterly. \\\\[Clement\\\\] Attlee did not choose between allies. \\\\[Winston\\\\]?Churchill did not choose.

Even with American wages, they would still be considerably cheaper than American cars. I.e. they have superior manufacturing and management techniques.Their cars are also better suited for the market. Households with an EV usually have two cars. One EV and one gas.

Concerns about state pressure to die are totally unfounded. Most assisted dying legislation is very restrictive (the recent UK bill only is limited to adults with under 6 months to live, and their request needs to be approved by a judge and 2 doctors), and even in countries where legislation is more relaxed and longstanding assisted dying remains popular and uncontroversialIn Switzerland, assisted dying has been practiced since 1982 from what I can tell, with the only restriction being that the assisting person cannot have a selfish motive. Despite their comparatively lax regulation, assisted dying remains almost universally popular in Switzerland - the most recent referendum on it was in 2011, where **85%** voted to keep assisted dying legal in Zurich. My point is that if assisted dying was the slippery slope people here are saying it is, people in Switzerland, where regulations are more permissive, would probably have turned against in over the last 40 years.

By definition, aren't they unable?","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"Trump pardoned many more criminals, some of his very best corrupt, treasonous pals who should still be in prison.

In 2023, he published his book titled, \\"Deep State Gangsters,\\" which Trump praised as a \\"roadmap to end the Deep State's Reign\\". He has also promoted election denying, COVID-19 and anti-vax conspiracy theories.Patel also has a history of supporting Qanon conspiracy theories.. On Truth Social, Patel boosted a prominent Qanon account. According to Media Matters, Patel has shared an image featuring a flaming Q on it and has gone on multiple Qanon shows in order to urge members to join Truth Social. Patel said in 2022 that Truth Social was trying to adopt Qanon \\"into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences\\", and that the figurehead of the Qanon movement \\"should get credit for all the things he has accomplished\\".Patel once proposed closing the FBI headquarters and reopening it as a \\"museum of the deep state.\\" Let's see if he follows through on his proposal.When Trump first proposed appointing Patel to lead the FBI or CIA, it faced significant backlash. Bill Barr even chimed in, writing that, \\"Patel would become FBI director \\"over his dead body.\\"Patel has also proposed making it easier to sue journalists.This next one is pretty relevant considering all of the right wing hysteria around Hunter Biden's pardon at the moment, because as a public defender, Patel often represented clients with firearm violations, not to mention drug traffickers and murderers. He was aide to Devin Nunes of all people and authored the \\"Nunes Memo\\" which tried to discredit the FBI and the Russian investigation. Even though it was regarded as deeply biased, inherently flawed and contained \\"cherry picked facts,\\" it became widely accepted by the MAGA community.Patel claims that the Steele dossier was used to initiate the Russia investigation, it wasn't. In fact, the dossier appeared after the FBI first began its Russia probe. The investigations and findings of both Mueller and the FBI did *not* hinge on the Steele dossier. Patel still wrote a book about it titled *The Plot Against the King*.He was formerly appointed to the NSC, and it was noted by his colleagues that he was severely under qualified. Patel was accused of being a Ukraine policy back channel for Trump, even though he was assigned to counterterrorism. Fiona Hill told investigators that it seems \\"Patel was improperly becoming involved in Ukraine policy and was sending information to Mr. Trump.\\"Patel once argued that former Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, was \\"disloyal to Trump\\" because he refused to send military troops to quell protestors. After the November 2020 election, Patel reportedly blocked some Department of Defense officials from helping the Biden administration transition.In 2022, when Patel had to testify before a federal grand jury that was investigating the Trump classified documents scandal, he declined to answer every question by invoking the fifth amendment. He was also one of the proponents of the idea that Trump had unilateral powers to declassify all materials.That same year: Patel created Fight With Kash, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charity, to raise donations for \\"helping other people\\" in need, though more specifically to bring \\"America First patriots\\" together and \\"helping fight the Deep State.\\" Patel has also supported the idea that Trump should seek vengeance against his political enemies.During an appearance on Steve Bannon's podcast, he said the following: We will go out and find the conspirators  not just in government, but in the media ... we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections ...

The massive amount of government subsidy China is supplying toward battery technology and solar panels is hugely market distorting. It isn't because they can make these cars cheaper, have cheaper labour, or better processes. The price of BYD etc is manipulated massively by the Chinese state as part of a trade strategy to decimate renewable energy production in the US/EU. If there is a trade war over this category, it is China who is starting it and the EU/US who is responding.That's not necessarily true for all tariffs, but when it comes to solar, solar batteries, EV batteries, and EVs, China is beyond \\"taking the piss\\" as they say in Britain.

In addition, you can register to vote without ID, and you can legally obtain acceptable forms of ID without being a US citizen.Want to change the rules?

And in the resulting discussions, one major culprit has come up over and over: the 'manosphere'.  The network of podcasters, celebrities, and media influencers that spread sexist ideas, particularly to young men, and who overwhelmingly support Trump and the GOP.  We all agree that it's an enormous problem.Much of the discussion has focused on the need for an equivalent left-wing sphere that spreads a more positive message for men, and the need for better role models of masculinity from within the Democratic Party.  Maybe even draw in better examples from the larger culture.If folks want to do this, they're certainly welcome to, but I'm not sold.  I don't think this would be an effective counter to the manosphere, or change a lot of men's hearts and minds.Let's get into why, and what we can do instead.**\\"Where have the good men gone?\\"**Within the Democratic Party, we've got plenty of good men who pass the vibe check.  Maybe guys would want to hear from [the all-conference linebacker?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Allred)  Maybe the [Marine Corporal who saw combat action?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Golden)  What about [the rural farmer with the missing fingers to show his authenticity?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester)  Or the [master troll who never backs down from a fight with Republicans?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lieu)  Or maybe [just go with the big dude?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetterman)And hey, why only embrace one version of masculinity?  Maybe men would look up to [a loving husband and father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz), or [a nerd who serves others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kim_(politician)), or [a brilliant legislative leader who absolutely pantsed McConnell to pass a huge climate bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer), or [someone who constantly wins in an unwinnable state and helps people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear)  Point is, there is *no* shortage of good men from every definition of 'masculine' in our party.By the way, who decided Republicans were the manly-man club, anyway?  Apologies for some mean words, but...Donald Trump is a soft, pudgy New Yorker who's never lifted a shovel in his life.  JD Vance is a venture capitalist who won't stick up for his own wife, and can't order a donut.  Mitch McConnell is a geezer who made a career out of saying 'no' a lot.  Mike Johnson is Ned Flanders without the mustache and shares his porn habits with his son.  Ron DeSantis needs no introduction.So...why did the manosphere idiots decide to roll with those guys if 'being a man' is so important?  The answer, sadly, is the same reason a left-wing manosphere is doomed to fail.**Men have good role models.  They just want shitty ones.**Yep, that's the long and the short of it.  #NotAllMen, of course, but the numbers aren't pretty.I know we started this chat with the manosphere, so let's get back to that.  Because a lot of the 'we need a left-wing manosphere' discussion seems to assume that people haven't tried to present a better vision of masculinity in the media.  There are podcasts out there that try to present healthier views of masculinity.  Sometimes that's the explicit focus, like Andy Grant's *Real Men Feel* or the *Art of Manliness* series.  (Neither of these are perfect but they're a hell of a lot better than Andrew Tate).  Other times, it's more incidental, like the McElroy Brothers' *My Brother, My Brother And Me*.  But these shows are completely dwarfed by the manosphere guys.  We didn't have anyone asking if Kamala Harris should go on MBMBAM, after all.[A quick glance at the most popular US podcasts makes the point for me.](https://podcastcharts.byspotify.com/)  Just count the number of toxic masculinity salesmen you see before you get to anything positive for men.  There are some neutral and woman-focused podcasts mixed in, but it looks like a more positive view of masculinity *just isn't popular.*  The podcasts I mentioned have all been around for hundreds of episodes and have their own cult followings.  Problem is, that's not what most men want.  You can try a different spin, but I have a feeling it'll go the same way.The manosphere guys care about making money and taking power from women.  It has nothing to do with 'being a man'.  That's why they photoshop muscles onto Trump instead of embracing the realistic view of masculinity Democrats offer.  But sadly, the toxic shit is what the people want.  And there's a reason why.**It's time to say the P word**Why is it so difficult to expand the definition of what it means to be a man?  And why is putting down women so central to the dominant definition of masculinity?  Women figured this one out a while ago, so it's time to listen, boys, because this probably hurts you too.This problem is explained by [patriarchy.](https://www.thoughtco.com/patriarchal-society-feminism-definition-3528978)  Lots of people get turned off by this idea, associating it with feminist lectures.  Well, it's an important idea, because it's why we're in the situation we're in.Patriarchy is the idea that our society is set up to give men power over women (and, within that, white men power over people of color, rich men power over poor men, etc.)  Things have improved for women since the theory was first advanced in the 1960s.  But every advancement in women's rights came with pushback, and the anger hasn't died down.  In fact, the idea of a woman becoming President has just made that rage even stronger.And patriarchy isn't just laws, it's attitudes and language that put men first.  Re-read Episodes 5 and 6 if you want to see how this works.  Men are implicitly taught that they come first, and women come second.  So they recoil at any attempt to challenge this assumption.  Guys who have been taught to question society's rules sometimes break free of this, but lots get mad about it.  And they seek out others to confirm their biases, whether it's podcasters or politicians.To sum it up: Guys get mad about 'their' position being challenged, and instead of questioning those feelings, they seek out people who'll validate them, and lash out at the people doing the challenging.  Until you solve that, no snappy podcast or awesome figurehead is going to break through.**How do we solve it, then?**This one can't be done by a podcast (though they can be excellent support tools, which is why I'm not opposed to the main idea).  Relationships set the stage for these ideas to break through.When you see a character you have no connection to, they don't make you change your mind.  But when you care about someone, you might allow your assumptions to be challenged.  Sexists have an advantage because they explain why isolated people are sad and lonely.  They do so through harmful lies, but they also use patriarchy, the assumption that men should have it all - and that someone must be taking it from them.Of course, as long as Joe Rogan is playing 24/7 in someone's ears, our counter-arguments are going to be challenged.  This one I haven't solved yet, and I'm hoping all of you have some ideas.  Maybe this is the real value in an alternative manosphere - something else to put on in the car or the office.  But it's going to take individual efforts from all of us to break through.  And I'd love to hear your ideas on that.**Questions to consider**1. How else can we challenge the assumption that men should be privileged over women - without causing a backlash that shuts down the discussion?2. Do you think you harbor any personal beliefs like this?  If not, why not?  (And if so, remember that society is set up to make you think this way, so it doesn't make you a bad person...unless you stay there).3.

The unfounded, pro-Trump conspiracy theory holds that the United States is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles, and that Trump is a messianic figure who will eradicate this evil from the government.Media Matters Senior Researcher Alex Kaplan identified social media posts by Patel in which he uses QAnon imagery, and bragged about his supposed meetings with @Q, a Truth Social account created shortly after the platforms launch that has suspected links to Truth Socials developers. In 2022, Patel even signed copies of his pro-Trump childrens book The Plot Against The King 2,000 Mules, with the phrase WWG1WGA, a QAnon slogan meaning where we go one, we go all.

Trump himself cracks about how his kids disappoint him. Jill continued her teaching while Melania lives whatever life she lives.The Bidens are pretty much the opposite. Joe talks about how his parents influenced him growing up, how much he loves his sons, how he stands by and believes in Hunter, etc. Public service and family vs. self-service and transactional relationships.A fascinating study in contrasts. The idea that the head of a family can be loving, caring and supportive of even the most wayward son runs completely counter to Trump's (real or projected) view of family. Factor in that Joe supports Hunter even with the prior drug use, and that Trump's beloved older brother Fred Jr. died from a heart attack brought on by alcoholism, and that just amps the feelings up even more.I'd *love* to imagine that, deep deep down, in his three-sizes-too-small heart, there lies a certain envy that Fred Sr. might have been just a little more like Joe and less than mid-century American Snidely Whiplash.","title":"White House says Trump wouldnt let go of Hunter Biden in defending pardon"},{"text":"Geraldo is an odd person.

In 2023, he published his book titled, \\"Deep State Gangsters,\\" which Trump praised as a \\"roadmap to end the Deep State's Reign\\". He has also promoted election denying, COVID-19 and anti-vax conspiracy theories.Patel also has a history of supporting Qanon conspiracy theories.. On Truth Social, Patel boosted a prominent Qanon account. According to Media Matters, Patel has shared an image featuring a flaming Q on it and has gone on multiple Qanon shows in order to urge members to join Truth Social. Patel said in 2022 that Truth Social was trying to adopt Qanon \\"into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences\\", and that the figurehead of the Qanon movement \\"should get credit for all the things he has accomplished\\".Patel once proposed closing the FBI headquarters and reopening it as a \\"museum of the deep state.\\" Let's see if he follows through on his proposal.When Trump first proposed appointing Patel to lead the FBI or CIA, it faced significant backlash. Bill Barr even chimed in, writing that, \\"Patel would become FBI director \\"over his dead body.\\"Patel has also proposed making it easier to sue journalists.This next one is pretty relevant considering all of the right wing hysteria around Hunter Biden's pardon at the moment, because as a public defender, Patel often represented clients with firearm violations, not to mention drug traffickers and murderers. He was aide to Devin Nunes of all people and authored the \\"Nunes Memo\\" which tried to discredit the FBI and the Russian investigation. Even though it was regarded as deeply biased, inherently flawed and contained \\"cherry picked facts,\\" it became widely accepted by the MAGA community.Patel claims that the Steele dossier was used to initiate the Russia investigation, it wasn't. In fact, the dossier appeared after the FBI first began its Russia probe. The investigations and findings of both Mueller and the FBI did *not* hinge on the Steele dossier. Patel still wrote a book about it titled *The Plot Against the King*.He was formerly appointed to the NSC, and it was noted by his colleagues that he was severely under qualified. Patel was accused of being a Ukraine policy back channel for Trump, even though he was assigned to counterterrorism. Fiona Hill told investigators that it seems \\"Patel was improperly becoming involved in Ukraine policy and was sending information to Mr. Trump.\\"Patel once argued that former Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, was \\"disloyal to Trump\\" because he refused to send military troops to quell protestors. After the November 2020 election, Patel reportedly blocked some Department of Defense officials from helping the Biden administration transition.In 2022, when Patel had to testify before a federal grand jury that was investigating the Trump classified documents scandal, he declined to answer every question by invoking the fifth amendment. He was also one of the proponents of the idea that Trump had unilateral powers to declassify all materials.That same year: Patel created Fight With Kash, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charity, to raise donations for \\"helping other people\\" in need, though more specifically to bring \\"America First patriots\\" together and \\"helping fight the Deep State.\\" Patel has also supported the idea that Trump should seek vengeance against his political enemies.During an appearance on Steve Bannon's podcast, he said the following: We will go out and find the conspirators  not just in government, but in the media ... we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections ... We're going to come after you. Whether it's criminally or civilly, we'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice, and Steve, this is why they hate us. This is why we're tyrannical.

The kind of egalitarianism where \\"we are all equal before god, but we are all equal differently\\", where certain groups of people are subhuman or need guardianship, or are simply not fit for certain things for arbitrary reasons.Forgive me for a personal example, my father believes we should have equal rights to vote, but he says that he's against feminism and, unlike the OP, he really is against feminism! In particular, he is against equal pay for equal work, he thinks that women should have an incentive to start a family with a man and raise children. He will vehemently defend that he *is* for equality but, according to some studies he read, women are always happier with a man and children. It's all basic biology to him. He doesn't think that women are 'lesser' than men but he still believes that women are significantly less intelligent and shouldn't participate in political life beyond voting. In my country he is far from minority with those opinions. I suppose, this is why I'm kind of miffed when people call themselves anti-feminist while being clearly against the discrimination of women.

Populism:\\na political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.Populist rhetoric:\\nPopulist rhetoric refers to a style of communication that appeals to the common people, often positioning them against a perceived elite or establishment.

The state not agreeing to kill someone =/= state paternalism.Bodily autonomy was never the primary argument in favor of MAID. It was the argument to stop needlessly prolonging suffering from terminal illness. The prolonged suffering AND the clear terminality were key. Expanding MAID beyond terminal physical illnesses by adopting the \\"bodily autonomy\\" argument quickly gets us into territory where we are at very serious risk of needlessly and prematurely ending lives. Its probably one of the most clear and defined examples of a slippery slope I can imagine. Suicidal thoughts or deep depressions are often, if not usually, non-fatal many if not most recover. People also often attempt and fail to commit suicide and go on to live happy lives. MAID in those cases assigns a deterministic and 100% fatal end to lives where recovery was a real possibility. Bodily autonomy as the basis alone rapidly gets us to a point where we're just killing people who had real chances of recovery and when we're at that point, bodily autonomy, quite frankly, is a dogshit argument. To be honest with you, this attempt to adopt bodily autonomy as \\"the reason\\" for MAID feels more like a cynical attempt at appropriating successful and popular pro-choice arguments as a way to link the two positions into a sort of monocause -- to hijack that part of a well meaning but credulous liberals brain that only associates good things with the phrase.

The finding is based on false assumptions about the precision of cellphone tracking data and the reasons that someone might drop off multiple ballots, experts said at the time.DSouza admitted as much on Monday.As those who have seen the film or read the book know, 2000 Mules was based on cell phone geolocation data collected and reviewed by True the Vote, DSouza wrote in the statement on his website. An analysis of this data revealed highly suspicious patterns of certain cell phones, which were recorded in the location of 10 or more dropboxes. This data was the premise of the film.He added: We recently learned that surveillance videos used in the film may not have actually been correlated with the geolocation data. ... I now understand that the surveillance videos used in the film were characterized on the basis of inaccurate information provided to me and my team. If I had known then that the videos were not linked to geolocation data, I would have clarified this and produced and edited the film differently.Ballot harvesting is a pejorative term for dropping off completed ballots for people besides yourself. The practice is legal in several states but largely illegal in the states True the Vote focused on, with some exceptions for family, household members and people with disabilities.True the Vote has said it found some 2,000 ballot harvesters by purchasing $2 million worth of anonymized cellphone geolocation data  the pings that track a persons location based on app activity  in various swing counties across five states. Then, by drawing a virtual boundary around a countys ballot drop boxes and various unnamed nonprofits, it identified cellphones that repeatedly went near both ahead of the 2020 election.","title":"Trumps stolen election movie producer quietly admits: We screwed up big time"},{"text":"Though I wonder if the far right who voted on rounding up brown skins will feel betrayed when it falls thru?

When Military Intelligence identifies the potential drone strike Mission, they are potentially going to the Secretary of Defense asking him to approve it.    I believe John Tower was nominated for secretary of defense and specifically rejected because of concerns that he was an alcoholic and could very well be shitfaced and unable to make a decision if they called him at 10:00 p.m. The fact that he was previously fired for being drunk on the job to the point where he was unable to control himself in public is an issue where even people who agree with him politically might start to think that he's not a great choice.","title":"Drunken Trump nominee caught on stage with strippers"},{"text":"America got what they voted for.

Not to mention [Title 10 Chapter 15 of the USC](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-15). In American jurisprudence, there are a couple of factors that govern seemingly conflicting laws. First, determine if there is an actual conflict. The exact text of the Posse Comitatus Act isWhoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.So then we move to Title 10 Chapter 15. That would be Act(s) of Congress that authorize the use of the armed forces to support law enforcement or directly enforce laws. So there is no conflict. Case closed. In addition to this, there are furthermore laws under Title 32 that authorize the use of National Guard troops for direct law enforcement under both state and federal control and the lack of the mention of the U.S. Coast Guard in the PCA plus Title 14 authorization allows that branch of the armed services to be used for law enforcement purposes.Even if there wasnt that, in addition there are the general overarching principles of specific beats general and newer beats older in terms of which law has priority if there are any conflicts. Given a general prohibition on the use of military for law enforcement would be beaten by the specific cases listed in Title 10 Chapter 15 and that Title 10 Chapter 15 was passed more recently than the PCA, there is utterly no basis for the claim that it is wholly illegal to use military force for law enforcement in the country.Also the PCA had nothing to do with union busting. Rutherford Hayes *himself* used troops for union busting. It was passed because [Democratic states in the confederate south after reconstruction were pissed off that Republican governments kept using military troops to enforce their governments and policies to the detriment of the democrats](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R42659.pdf).","title":"Democratic senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the U.S. military domestically"},{"text":"Yeah and?

You're literally standing on the doorstep of WWIII with Biden's authorization of US missiles used against a hostile nation, and yet somehow that's better than 2016-2020. Do you see the flaw here? Also, the tariffs are meant to keep other countries in check and its working. They're economic tools. They're not permanent policies. It encourages the US to produce more of its own goods and bring back jobs/production. The deportations means people will have to come through legal ports of entry. This is the classic \\"who will pick the crops?\\" argument. There are loads of people in the US who are jobless, and willing to pick crops. The farmers who depend on illegals are taking advantage of their situation, not to mention, those people also are deprived of health benefits and insurance. It's modern day slavery. That's what is being argued for here. Deportations reduce/prevent that. This is what makes more jobs for Americans who need the work. Trump's policies are literally putting America first. Democrats are known for putting America last, and survive on hoaxes and lies. This election, over half the country voted against Democrats because they're simply tired of the gaslighting, the lies, the hoaxes, and fear mongering.

Control of the courts is also essential to the accomplishment of the objectives.The second phase of the plan is to destroy many federal agencies and to transfer their power to the States where it will be easier and less costly for the moneyed elite to control the type and scale of regulation.In fewer words : To get rid of progressive policies and give America back to the industrialists, to corporatism, to the oligarchs at the expense of the people.It all started in 1971 with the [**Powell Memorandum**](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/1/) when future Justice [**Lewis Powell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_F._Powell_Jr.#Powell_Memorandum,_1971) claimed that the American system of \\"Free entreprise\\" was under attack by the Left (read the progressive). That memorandum became gospel in the Conservative circles and constitutes the basis for the current conservative movement.This is a corporate takeover of America and do not kid yourselves, the point is to lower cost on the corporations, eliminate regulation, eliminate workers protections and social programs.Because China is struggling with its birthrate, soon, within 10 years, China will stop being the \\"factory of the world\\" due to its rapidly aging population. America will re-industrialize rapidly to replace China but the corporations want cheap labor, not union wages but much lower wages.We are witnessing a plan that has been in the works since 1971 coming to life and the American people will be the victims.The prosperity that was brought to the American workers under the New Deal is about to vanish...

After the initial pause, I think he's *not* justified in doing so.The power of pardon should *always* give pause, imo, because of its potential to subvert justice.

The police were not allowed in during this time, and crime against the citizens in the neighborhood who were stuck living in that area went up. The city allowed this to go on for 3 weeks, saying they recognized the people's right to \\"protest.\\"Several shootings took place in the occupied territory, and the government only finally broke it all up after a 16-year-old boy was shot and killed and a 14-year-old critically injured.

The idea of hundreds or thousands of people being prosecuted for engaging in a protest, when the majority of them are not even being accused of violence, is fundamentally un-American. The prosecution of the January 6th protestors is malicious, excessive, vindictive, draconian, politically prejudiced and unconstitutional. The prosecutors are so rabid that they even had an appeals court strike down them trying to give the protestors \\"enhanced sentences\\" that went beyond what the law allows.These prosecutors need to be taught a lesson that what they're doing has no place in this country.

I don't know if they will do anything re: enforcement and fining but I wouldn't be shocked if that stuff wasn't done as strictly.   I don't know if anything will be repealed but I doubt there will be any new regs.  Which is a problem - right now we only have federal water quality standards for 5-6 PFAS and there are like 13,000 different PFAS out there (and dozens of those are very common and very bad for us).The complaints they have are that upgrading water treatment to comply with new MCLs is expensive (true, but that doesn't mean it's not necessary) and that listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA is problematic.And it is - for corporations.  Superfund cleanup is expensive, some sites can literally be a billion dollars.  Listing PFOA/PFOS under CERCLA means that many new sites could end up being added to the EPA's National Priority List (aka Superfund) and existing sites could be subject to new, expensive remedial studies and cleanup.  Closed sites could be reopened.It's good for the public because it will result in addressing and eliminating sources of PFAS pollution, thus making the environment safer and protecting humans and wildlife.  But it opens up a whole can of worms for corporations that may include billions of dollars in liability, which is why Republicans and the wealthy want to eliminate it.The drinking water treatment upgrades right now are also affecting corporations - they are indeed super expensive, I've seen studies on cost estimation.  There simply isn't enough funding at the moment and the costs would be a burden on the average taxpayer (I mean, we *could* just tax billionaires more heavily, but I doubt that will happen any time soon).  So what various drinking water districts are doing to cover the costs are lawsuits.  They are basically suing any corporation that is a potential producer or user of PFAS in the watersheds the treatment plants are in and hoping to use the awarded damages to cover the costs of upgrades to water treatment systems.  It's non-ideal and inefficient (big corporations can afford to throw money at these things and drag them out for years) but it's one of the only feasible options for funding right now.Basically, Republicans want to stop the government from being able to make corporations pay to clean up the messes they made.  Whether that means stopping enforcement (mess continues with no penalties) or rolling back regulations (pretending the mess no longer exists by eliminating laws that designate the mess as a problem) remains to be seen.I have a lot of ideas on how we could easily fund these things, but I imagine they'd be disparaged by conservatives as \\"anti-American\\" or \\"unpatriotic\\" or \\"literal communism\\".","title":"Trump allies begin attack on EPA and rules protecting US drinking water"},{"text":"Recently looked up some drug trade facts.Interestingly 99% of the funding for fentanyl and synthetic drugs comes from the US.85% of traffickers are US citizens.This leaves the cold fact that most Americans dont want pot.

The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.This was 100% the correct, moral, and just use of the pardon power.

There's no dignity given to a person who is disabled and can't access their benefits meeting. Etc etc.The entire point of euthanasia is supposed to be issues that can't meaningfully be solved right now. A person who has Extreme Pain Disorder would *rather* have the extreme pain cured than seek out death, it's just accepting that we don't have a cure right now and letting them make their own choice.And what scares me is what we seen in Canada, where people can \\"slip through\\" the safeguards by technically qualifying for it with a certain condition and being able to apply, even when they are blatantly doing so because of societal failures of no homes and no benefits. The Canadian government doesn't have a financial incentive to fix that.To me it's a lot like gene editing.

So if the Trump DOJ does want to go after Biden, not just Hunter, he's the streetlevel guy.You want to go after the actual Biden family, the people who were ostensibly sellingstate secrets, who were benefiting, who were getting that 10% to 50% off the top. If thereis appetite there to prosecute, I think you probably still could. I think Joe Biden is clearly?overstepping his authority here.But this brings us back to the political reality as I spill mydrink all over my studio. I'm just so fired up about this. This brings us back to the politicalreality, which is, this was going to happen.There was no appetite to prosecute Hunter,even if, even if Joe Biden had not done this. There's really no appetite to go after Joe Biden.Trump is saying, let's let bygones be bygones.Let's move on. Let's let the dead pass andbury the dead. Joe Biden probably voted for Donald Trump at this point.So I just don't think it was going to happen anyway. It's unsatisfying to people who view politics primarilyas an ideal, idealist project with all sorts of purity, but that's not how it works.Yeah. Duh. Okay.","title":"CMV: The statement about Hunter Biden's pardon will be a stain on Biden's legacy, deservedly so."},{"text":"Obama got elected, then re-elected, and the GOP doubled the efforts to make sure no one but a white, wealthy, man could ever win an election again.

Democrats and politicians in general are great at not answering questions when asked. They push out a neoliberal talking point. They pretend like they can't get things done.

They see them obfuscating, talking in elitists ways while non-answer answering questions. The way most politicians talk to us is condescending. People want to know how democrats will directly make their lives better and we get non-answers. You don't pass a chips act and then just run victory laps like you helped people. Its important, it didn't do anything for people today. You can forgive college debt* if you went to college, still have the debt, and your loans are the kind thay can be forgiven. Most people look at that and it didn't help them. It's not a universal help. They gave up on minimum wage. They gave up on family leave-which would have affected the material conditions of most workers. They said- we will get you lower drug prices! In the most neoloberal way: a couple of drugs a year and they might not be drugs thay affect you at all-again- most people saw no gain from this. Its just bad policy- pretending like it's good policy, while talking to us like we should understand it's good policy and this is life changing why aren't you excited for these tepid neoliberal solutions? You see the problem? Democrats are the better party, they still suck, they say they are going to deliver and then only attempt to deliver 20% and maybe get 5-10% of what they initially said they were going to do. I know the Republicans are in the way: democrats act like this is normal instead of standing firmly on positions with strong support and then making a propaganda fuss over the fact that these sons a bitches Republicans are trying to take away YOUR money, they are trying to keep you from your cheap drugs.

In any case, all my points still stand.I won't deny that assisted suicide probably does create some perverse incentives, but I'd encourage you to really think about what the alternative (the status quo) really is.1. It creates its own perverse incentives. Namely, medical providers can keep getting paid so long as they keep the person alive, regardless of their quality of life. This creates a nightmare scenario for someone living with high levels of chronic pain that can't be managed by medication.2. *Really* think about how awful some ways to die can be. In my mind, probably the worst way to die would be being tortured to death. A very close second would be living in excruciating pain for months on end with no escape. It's basically being tortured to death but by your own body. If the worst-case scenario for assisted suicide is that occasionally a person in pain who might still be helped is inadvertently coerced into dying, I think that's a reasonable cost to also alleviate the very real and unfortunately common scenario of folks dying the second worst possible death I can imagine.I will admit to a bias here; I saw that nightmare scenario happen with my father. His cancer ate away at his spine and collapsed a number of his vertebra, causing him to experience white-hot pain any time he did anything other than lay perfectly still. He couldn't even adjust to get his ass on a bedpan without crying. Over 8 months, his condition progressed to the point that he was in basically absurd pain round-the-clock, even with massive amounts of morphine. He was getting so much pain medication that he was barely lucid and the only thing he was really aware of was the pain. In a brief moment of semi-lucidity, he begged me to *let* him die, but he was already on palliative care and that's basically what we were doing. Ultimately, the doctor just bumped up his morphine dosage to the point where it just kept him passed out. That was still effectively assisted suicide, but it just took four days of dehydration and malnutrition from sleeping constantly before his body finally gave up.That scenario and worse plays out every year for thousands of Americans. If we have the means to alleviate that, it seems insane to dither about the possibility of perverse incentives with respect to edge cases.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"\\\\[The NY Times asks\\\\] Shouldnt Trump Voters Be Viewed as Traitors?No. What the fuck is wrong with these people?

It's not \\"unknown quality\\" if you're getting it from a municipal source.  Fortunately some water sources are pretty clean naturally - and in those cases, your treatment system is just an expensive tool which might slightly alter how much bicarbonate you are drinking.  Other water sources contain contaminants which may only partially be mitigated with reverse osmosis.  Most states also test well water so if you are getting your tap water from a local aquifer you should still be able to get a reasonable estimate from looking at results in your region.The only way to actually know what's in your water and how to treat it is to have it analyzed in an accredited commercial lab and to have a water quality chemist (people like me) look at the results to determine which contaminants, if any, are problematic and how they can be removed (if at all).  Environmental agencies at the city, state, and federal level do all that for us right now.  In the future, if testing and reporting requirements are reduced, the best way to figure out treatment is to look at past water quality data to figure out what might be problematic.  And, if you're really worried, you can send a sample to a lab.  The cost for testing varies depending on the analytes.

The founders knew that no justice system was perfect and saw the pardon as one more protection against that imperfection. The theory being that elected officials being beholden to the voting public (and social decorum) would only use it in times when there was broad consensus that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.But as is the case for most things it slowly eroded over time and the nature of the modern age has radically changed how and when it is applied.","title":"Who Has Donald Trump Pardoned?

She spent about $1.3 billion dollars in 15 weeks, with ads that turned off a huge swath of Americans. When Bill Clinton directly confronted Robby Mook during the '16 election he warned that Dems were losing white, middle class voters. No lesson learned. I'm sorry but we don't need the Washington Post looking for answers in Connecticut. The answers were given to us in '16 by Hillary and she hasn't changed her tune.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both members of the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter dated Nov. 26 to President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that urged them to issue a policy directive that would ensure that U.S. troops can be used only when local or state authorities ask for federal help or are unable or unwilling to protect the public. We write to urge you to issue a policy directive that prohibits the mobilization of active duty military or federalizing National Guard personnel to be deployed against their fellow Americans unless specifically authorized, they wrote. As the article points out After he takes office on Jan. 20, Trump could issue his own policy directive that would reverse the directive issued by Biden.This is just political grandstanding. Even if you agree with it, its a waste of air.Warren and Blumenthal, whose offices said the letter speaks for itself, apparently hope that publicly highlighting the issue might deter Trump.Im sorry, how many drugs do you need to be taking to think that whatsoever? Trump *ran on this issue*. He is already shedding light on it with himself and Tom Homan saying they will use the military to carry out deportation support. How is their public highlighting somehow magically going to change any discourse?I mean, beyond that, their proposed policy directive is self-defeating. The Trump admin could simply state this is not being used against Americans; it is being used against unlawfully present people. Then beyond that, unless specifically authorized means nothing as **Trump would be fucking authorizing it**. Not to mention there are several laws that provide an exemption to the posse comitatus act which would be used as the authority to *authorize* the use of military support.What an utter waste of fucking time.

Before, I would only approve of it near end of life for those beyond a certain age.

From what she had told me, she had tried every therapeutic and medicinal treatment available, none of which allowed her to feel \\"normal.\\" My one reservation is that I don't know how honest she was about that, and I imagine many interested in MAID for mental health reasons either refuse alternative treatment or are not aware of it (my ex had never done inpatient or hybrid out- and inpatient programs). It's the same problem problem for mental illness treatment in general: if the individual isn't actively harming themselves or others, it's difficult to obligate them to get treated, and stigma dissuades voluntary enrollment for the more thorough programs.Politically, MAID seems like an anodyne policy change for those who are older and may have cancer or other disease but don't want to subject themselves or loved ones to the sight of their decline with palliative care. For individuals like my ex, however, it is a \\"damned if you do...\\" situation. I think many believe mental health and addiction are issues, but they don't like most of the solutions.

Does it apply in this case? These are not easy to answer questionsI think it hard to argue that this is unjust since it is voluntary. It would be extremely problematic when this decision was made by someone else (which is by the way regularly done in hospitals when the \\"pull the plug\\").If I'm feeling depressed and say \\"I wish I was dead, someone please kill me,\\" are you a murderer if you do just that? Most people would say yes, regardless of how depressed I was in the moment. These laws add safeguards to make sure the person is making a deliberate choice intentionally, but are those safeguards enough?Yes it would be murder in my opinion. But:First, we should make a difference between killing someone else and killing yourself. This law is about killing yourself. So the question should be, is it morally wrong to let someone kill themselves because the felt depressed.  \\nSecond, we should make a difference between knee-jerk reactions to a bad phase and a deliberate and persistent will to not continue living.  \\nThere is also the inter-temporal aspect of it. Should I let someone sell himself into permanent slavery? Liberals usually say no. Selling oneself into slavery is less restrictive of one's liberty than ending one's life, why do we permit one but not the other?I do not see a problem with someone selling themselves into slavery. The problem would in my opinion be when they change their mind and want to leave it. The question would then be whether we should enforce the contract and my opinion would be no, similarly like i would also not want to enforce a assisted suicide that someone has applied for but changed their mind.Liberalism isn't a utopian ideology with the end of maximizing freedom. It's a rough framework for letting people free people flourish in the societies they build for themselves. It has useful and consistent answers in a lot of places, but it can't guide government policy in all cases.I completely agree that there are some paradoxes in liberalism and you cannot answer every question with this framework, but I really think this is not the case here. The choice to continue ones own life or not falls perfectly into the realm of liberalism. This is also not a very outlandish claim, for example, Switzerlands highest court has even ruled that the right to life in the constitution implies the right to suicide.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"Right?

That language mirrors the language in Fords pardon of Nixon, which did not merely cover the Watergate scandal but extended to all offenses against the United States that Nixon has committed or may have committed between Jan. 20, 1969, and Aug. 9, 1974  the exact span of Nixons presidency.Apart from the Nixon pardon, this is setting up a new and bad precedent for future pardons.
