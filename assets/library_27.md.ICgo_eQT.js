If the House majority were a little bigger, Trump would have a much easier time convincing the Senate GOP to nuke the filibuster and start passing all kinds of dangerous legislation.

The president-elect didnt tell Gaetz to drop out, this source said. He didnt have to. Early Thursday afternoon, Gaetz  who quit his seat in the House the day Trump announced hed selected him to helm the Justice Department  wrote on social media that he was withdrawing and that his nomination was unfairly becoming a distraction. (...)  \\n  \\nGaetzs move came in the face of bipartisan pressure, especially as Democrats were pressing for the release of a House Ethics Committee report into him. In his four terms in the House, Gaetzs fire-bombing political tactics had also alienated many people within his own party, including senators who greeted his selection for attorney general with skepticism. (...)  \\n  \\nTrump and members of his transition team were notified that Gaetz would be withdrawing before he made the announcement, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Gaetz called Trump and Vance separately to inform them of his decision to withdraw, per one source familiar with the calls. There was a belief that more damning information would be coming out from the ethics report, and that members of Gaetzs orbit learned there might be witnesses who had been interviewed by the committee who had been previously unknown, one source familiar said. (...)  \\n  \\nIn the wake of Gaetzs decision to withdraw, several Republicans applauded the move  making public the backlash that the former Florida congressman, best known on Capitol Hill for his role in ousting former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, faced within his own party.","title":"Gaetz withdraws from attorney general consideration after Trump told him he didnt have the votes in the Senate"},{"text":"It's a real sliding doors moment in politics what happened in Florida in 2018 losing both the Senate and Governors race by a whisker, even more painful to see now that Florida has become a solid Republican state for the time being, if Graham had won the democratic primary she probably would have defeated DeSantis in the general, it's hard to tell if this would have lessened the seismic shift in Florida's voting pattern over the past six years though.","title":"Sen.

I will even grant you 2X strength and speed and 10x numbers for these imaginary rebels, they are getting crushed by 2 jets and a tank.

So...what? Biden did what every President but one since ever had done. Gracefully welcome the next President to the job and hand them the keys to the White House without protest.Not sure what the complaint is. They said he's a dictator and a tyrant, but he's now *America's* dictator and tyrant.As to resistance, what resistance is there to mount? The man isn't President yet, any resistance would be token and all words and bluster. At the state level, some states have been very clear they're fortifying themselves against what the project will be Trump craziness, and resignations at every government level are flying from people who will refuse to serve, others will remain to perform their last duty of transfer of power, because it is still their duty, knowing they're likely going to be purged.The lack of disorderly rebellion at this point doesn't mean anyone was lying about anything. But the future has not come to pass yet and nothing has been proven true or false. We don't know who will be around to temper Trump's worst impulses and who will cave, will the Supreme Court be loyal to democracy or the majority rubber stamp Trump's desires? Are the Republicans really so enamored with Trump that they'll allow his takeover of the government and attempted dissolution of the current system?At least in the beginning these things have to happen, and they haven't...yet. Last Trump term was rife with stories of how responsible human beings despite having really conservative views, simply refused some of Trump's wilder ideas, literally saving themselves from prison and us from his insanity on more than one occasion. Even his own Vice President had to defy him to administer actual democracy, despite him being as right-wing as they come.Trump is going to try to install the weirdest most sycophantic people to surround him this time, and that means there will be no adults in the room to say no. All it takes is for Congress to go along with the MAGA line and his Supreme Court to sit on its hands despite the cries of its minority, and his road to dictatorship will be paved. That's it. We could be living in 1930's Germany right now, as all the pieces are set. Trump has made it clear what he'll do with that power as well. Or not. 4 chaotic years could pass and though it won't be what the left wants, but it won't be apocalyptic as predicted. That doesn't make Democrats liars, that just makes them wrong. Everybody is hoping to be wrong, actually. The alternative is scary, dangerous and will require actions that no democracy wants to have to take.Anyways, I think this columnist is just stoking fires and throwing mud, and advancing that tired, crappy 'both sides suck' narrative that to this day still damages our ability to get our electorate to participate, even when the ability to do that in the future could be compromised.

The basic reactionary idea is that there exists an unchanging social and moral hierarchy based on identity, i.e. your social status and morality depends on who you are or what you identify with, not what you say or do. This is entirely an emotional thing: they believe they are special and better; all the ideology (religious or secular) exists merely to justify and rationalize it (i.e. to explain away the rejection of equality). These feelings don't even have to be prevalent, consistent or extreme; the existence of emotional biases against other groups is often enough to push people to seemingly inexplicably \\"like\\" reactionary movements and politicians.This explains why people prone to these views think the bad things surely won't happen to them. The exceptionalism is baked into their world view. They follow these movements because they feel they are special, and through that same feeling all of them believe they are more central to the in-group than everyone else. It also means that, when the inevitable betrayal happens, it will seem to them to come out of nowhere and there will be no organized response to it. Solidarity and exceptionalism do not mix. In fact, the more people are purged from such a movement, the more those left within it will feel justified in their belief of their own worth and status.In short, the same feelings that make them look down on other people make them blind to the danger posed to them by the group they identify with.","title":"There are no Black jobs in Trumps administration despite cadre of Black Republicans who campaigned for him"},{"text":"I think they also found LGBT to be obsessed with trying to find every opportunity to read to children.","title":"You Dont Have the Votes: How Trump Barred the Gaetz - The scandal-plagued, widely hated pick for attorney general was a waste of time and energy."},{"text":"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\\\\\\\\\\\\_()_/","title":"There are no Black jobs in Trumps administration despite cadre of Black Republicans who campaigned for him"},{"text":"His fiscal mismanagement and self-aggrandizement is reaching Biblical levels.Remember, with him, it is \\"For Thee, not for me...\\" when it comes to regulations.

On the other hand, it is possible that Trump by obstructing Trump, American society is not as harmed, and therefore American society does not dissemble to a state that enough of the electorate finds the Trump admin sufficiently unappealing to vote for Democrats - that is a philosophical question to the extent that it implicates a moral choice.","title":"Democrats welcome Trump the fascist with open arms"},{"text":"Who hasn't","title":"RFK Jr. Once Compared Trump To Hitler"},{"text":"Thanks, yeah I was feeling like that","title":"John Fetterman offers his office bathroom to Sarah McBride as she says shell follow GOP rules on restroom usage"},{"text":"Dead is an option to them but they mainly want to force compliance.

China imports 40% of its grain from (in order) the U.S., Brazil and Ukraine.Obviously the second China tried to invade Taiwan the U.S. would sanction exports and remove U.S. grain from that equation. And without Bolsonaro in office in Brazil willing to slash and burn the Amazon rainforest to turn it into Chinas farmland, and without Ukraine in the bag in 3 days, the CCP is unable to invade Taiwan and take over microprocessor production without putting 300-500M of its poorest people into famine.Donbas Ukraine, specifically the 4 regions of the donbas that Putin insists he is saving from what he calls Jewish Nazis also happens to produce the worlds supply of high grade neon used for DUV lithography.  Had Putin delivered ukraine in 3 days as promised, Xi would have been able to cap his Olympics with a blockade or political takeover of Taiwan that would have forced the world to ask the CCP for the microprocessors it needs to make everything from Ford trucks to laptops.

It only becomes problematic when the requirement for purity is understood in a metaphysical sense and that's when you get forced segregation, miscegenation laws, binary thinking etc. It's all an effort to keep things -- and thoughts -- separate because not having them separate induces a sense of discomfort in these individuals.

The point isn't that Allred wasn't perfect, or that his campaign made mistakes, its that it wasn't really designed to win.

Most of these red state campaigns work the same way. Donors are wined and dined and convinced their money could be what flips an important state or gets rid of a particularly vile Republican. The money is promptly wasted on boring Dem ads and mailers and phone calls, stuff that doesn't really work or matter because it changes nothing and offers nothing new. The campaign fails, because again, it did nothing new, promised nothing new, and probably relied on the charisma of yet another worthless neoliberal Dem technocrat. Consultants, ad agencies, TV stations, etc. all go home with a bag of money, the politician who lost gets name recognition, maybe a sweet job down the line. Rinse and repeat. Honestly, Dems mostly win by relying heavily on self-motivated, self-organizing progressives doing the ground work and by the general political winds falling in their favor. They do not actively change narratives. They do not name enemies. They do not try to change minds. They rely on the low racist notion that demographics are destiny and people should vote for them because the other guy is worse. They do not actively do the populist work of organizing ground operations much any more and when they do attempt to the ground work, its extremely lame, with uninspiring messages that are deeply undercut by feckless congressional compromises or blockages and the constant cozying up to conservatives by Dem leadership.","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"How do you know those of us who know don't care?

He has neither the desire, nor capacity to do so.  Try, for a moment to consider the situation from Russia's perspective instead of just taking everything the consent manufacturers say at face value.  The US violated its agreement's not to expand NATO.  They'd been supporting fascism in Ukraine since the 1950's (you can read the declassified documents on Operation Aerodynamic at cia . gov).  We installed an explicitly pro-NATO puppet following [the false flag sniper attacks carried out by the Ukrainian fascist militia Svoboda](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/buried-trial-verdict-confirms-false-flag-maidan-massacre-in-ukraine-2024) as a means to oust Yanukovich.

That the reason why the US finances this war is not to help Ukrainians, but to hurt Russia.It is important to take the time to understand geopolitics from multiple perspectives, not as a means to \\"justify\\" the actions of a \\"bad guy\\" but to understand actually why they do the things they do, and to have a better idea of what actual possibilities are on the table and what the most favorable outcomes are among them.","title":"cmv: Trump is going to start ww3"},{"text":"lets be clear, Trump/Maga doesn't like the ED because it promotes fairness.

I expect a lot infighting on this subject.The **U.S. Department of Education** (ED) is a federal agency responsible for overseeing and supporting education in the United States. Its primary responsibilities include:1. **Administering Federal Financial Aid**: The Department manages federal student aid programs, including Pell Grants, student loans, and work-study opportunities.?\\n2. **Enforcing Federal Education Laws**: The Department enforces laws that prohibit discrimination in education and promote equal access to education for all students.?\\n3. **Distributing Grants and Funding**: The Department provides grants and funding to states, schools, and other organizations to support various educational initiatives.?\\n4. **Guiding Education Policy**: The Department helps shape national education policy by working with Congress, states, and education professionals to create frameworks that address key issues like curriculum standards, teacher quality, and early childhood education.\\n5. **Promoting Equity**: One of its key goals is to ensure that all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or disability, have an equal opportunity to succeed academically. The Department works to close achievement gaps and reduce disparities in education.In short, the U.S. Department of Education is responsible for ensuring the quality, accessibility, and fairness of education across the country, as well as providing financial support to students and institutions.","title":"GOP senator introduces bill to eliminate US Department of Education"},{"text":"The enormous threat to the integrity of US intelligence is compounded by her ability to turn intelligence and security agencies against US citizens for political purposes.\\nLol you mean the integrity of the US intelligence agencies that fabricated evidence of Saddam's WMDs to start the Iraq War, then oversaw torture, black sites, extraordinary renditions, Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, meanwhile building an Orwellian mass surveillance apparatus and lying that it wasn't being used to spy on Americans for years, until Edward Snowden revealed the truth??\\nYou mean the integrity of those US intelligence agencies?","title":"Gleeful: Russia and Putin reportedly thrilled about Trumps choice of Tulsi Gabbard for DNI job"},{"text":"I put it all on black.","title":"What's a risky decision you made that turned out to be the right one?"},{"text":"Thats why she was given the job!

Fields like critical race theory and intersectionality, for example, were directly built on leftist frameworks and tend to emphasize identity issues over alternatives like class.Conservatives critique this dominance because it creates an imbalance where alternative perspectives are marginalized. When conservatives call this targeting, theyre pointing out how the left has systematically shaped these disciplines to align with its ideology, leaving little space for dissenting views. This critique isnt baseless; its a call for genuine diversity of thought to ensure these fields remain open to all perspectives.","title":"Republicans Target Social Sciences to Curb Ideas They Dont Like"},{"text":"Isnt everybody?Really though, people use Google to search for porn?

But obviously intent is not the same thing as how people will read that. No one writes perfectly in that way, but I did try. 2. My comment about a teenage boy isn't meant to be discriminatory (the way that 'ageist' implies), it was just meant to describe a thought pattern which is genuinely common among that demographic. I'm not trying to imply that all teenage boys think this way or that only teenage boys think this way. Just that it is a pattern of thinking common in that group. Beyond that different gender, race, and age groups do have genuinely (on average) different ways of talking and writing. Obviously not everyone matches that, but there are trends. Based on the way OP writes, I do suspect they are approximately a teenage boy. I may very well be wrong because not everyone in one group is the same, but there are genuine patterns that can be picked up on 3. Personally, I think all discussions starting from a place of disagreement should be working towards trying to reach a common understanding, regardless of who (or neither) was right to begin with.

The other possibility is that those in power who think they have the means to oppress others actually don't have power or enough power to oppress others, so they don't try, or they try and fail in their campaign.

The simple fact of the matter is the Democrats had veered so far away from the American mainstream, especially on cultural and identity issues, they simply became on appetizing for the vast majority of the country. No, it is not simply inflation. The US had the best economic recovery after the pandemic, than almost any other country. Unemployment is at a record lows and real wages have been rising under the Dems. Democrats and Harris in particular squandered all this by not appealing to the center. The election was all about culture, and immigration. Donald Trump made record in inroads with black men and Hispanics. He was the first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004 and only the second in 36 years. Eight million people who voted for Biden last time around, simply stayed home, while Trump got roughly the same amount of votes. Make a mistake, people were sick of the Democratic agenda.

How many of those women have actual or simulated combat experience? Bricks dont hit back and all that. Again, in this hypothetical, *all men* have decided women dont deserve rights.

We as a community almost all agree that the United States stance of appeasement allows for countries of any kind to wage and engage in war with their only reprimand being 'strong words', trade restrictions, and maybe funding for the nation the US sees as correct. This allows conflicts to boil slowly, over years and years and years, arguably making more money for war companies such as General Dynmics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. These companies thrive not in fast, short, and aggressive wars, but instead in long drawn out wars. Just google Himars Sales and scroll through some of the countries that have been buying them. The military community also agrees that because Trump is so terrifying, nations are less likely to step out of line. Russia has blown their entire bluff on Military Capabilities with their invasion of Ukraine. This also pulls back the curtain on the fact that China is wholly uncapable of waging a land-war. This is why China will not invade Taiwan. Trump is 'more likely' (not guaranteed) to create peace through terror.

Each idea deserves to be thought through and given a chanceI stand by the arguments I've made. Hobbes is the single philosopher who is the most influential on my own thinking. And collective action is the single area of philosophy I'm most familiar with.That being said, I do want to flag that feminism is another area of philosophy I'm relatively well versed in. And I agree with the other comments that suggest (or say) that the premise of your question betrays sexist assumptions. It seems like there are some subtle sexist attitudes baked into your way of thinking about this. This isn't an immoral thing, or likely even your fault. Our society also has underlying sexism that will leech into people's minds, even if they try to avoid it or excise it. I can't tell you what to do, but I would encourage you to think about that. Sometimes people come along and invite us to analyze and evaluate ourselves and find ways to do better. We all can stand to be better. If you do decide to reflect on this, here is where I would start: whenever there is a thought or discussion about men or women or gender, remember that women are human too. They have all the things that make men human. They have the same emotions, the same emotional capacity, the same intelligence, the same ability to make choices, the same ability to think through options and arrive at the best one, etc etc etc. While men and women can be different in some ways (mostly in the ways that they interact with society and society interacts with them), foundationally they have the same core. Ultimately, women are just people, just like men. I'm not making any assumptions about what is actually underlying your post here, what beliefs you have (conscious or not) but the way you have framed this sounds like the way a teenage boy with some subconscious sexism (picked up from society) would frame it. Because these beliefs may be subconscious, you may not realize you have them and you may be slightly offended that I would even suggest you do. That's ok and very normal. Those kinds of beliefs infect us all and it's uncomfortable to be confronted with that. But all of that makes them hard to access directly. That's why I suggested just adding something to your thinking whenever possible: women are human too, with all the things that come with that. If you take that seriously, over time, some of the deeply embedded beliefs might soften and change. But trying to find and pick at them directly won't work. Again, I can't tell you what to do and I wouldn't try. But please seriously consider what I'm saying here.

He attacks Iran/ backs the IDF starting a major regional war that drags in the rest of the world \\n2. He provokes China in the SCS or ROC ( Taiwan) start a conflict \\n3. He doesn't change any Biden policies on Ukraine and the escalation continues. Or the EU/NATO drag the US into the conflict \\n4. He provokes the DPRK via major support for the ROK\\nAs you can see while his actions will play some role in starting a war.

Rights are innate. People take rights away from others. I believe you are phrasing it the way you are, as if men bestow rights to women out of generosity as if they are gifts to be given because you don't want to face the reality that all people of all genders and races are born with innate rights, and if they lack rights, it is because others have taken their rights away. Why not phrase it like that? What you are saying is like saying white people gave black people the right to vote as a gift. \\"Blacks only have rights if white people agree to grant them rights.\\" Regardless of the truth of such a statement, it doesn't sound good to say white people are granting black people rights, as if they are gifts to bestow. It is more accurate to say white people stopped restricting the rights of blacks. Look at how the 15th Amendment is written:**Prohibits the denial** of?the right to vote?based on race, color or previous condition of servitude.Men prohibit the rights of women. Men don't grant women rights. If society so chooses, it would be not to prohibit the rights of women. I think it is a distinction you should reconsider.\\\\To the point of what power men have: that is only the status quo. Things change. Women could select for feminine traits in men, and men could evolve to be like women, and women could evolve to be like men in stature. This was presented in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation \\"Angle One\\" S1E14. Women are graduating college more and are holding higher positions. Men have a higher unemployment rate. These trends will likely continue, so things can flip someday. Money and stature are far more influential than brawn. It is an antiquated concept that really has little bearing on today's rights.

The hypocrisy of these people whining about giving money to Ukraine while they leech on the rest of the nation is astounding. These people add nothing.

It just happens that there are more ideologies that require the subjugation of women. Like I said, only the creation of government and its initial structure requires broad consensus. Once formed, it will be relatively stable (for all the reasons described above). So, if society is created as a monarchy, it might change to a democracy or theocracy or whatever later, but the structure of government will persevere. So, to use Hobbes' own example, he thinks that a total, dictatorial monarchy is good (for reasons we won't get into) and so should be chosen. If there is a woman monarch, she should be able to remove rights from a large portion of the population, including men, and as long as she keeps the structures of law in place. In fact, the longest reigning monarch in world history was a woman and only recently diedAnd as a historical example, any feudal monarch who was a woman subjugated a ton of men (and women). But because the structures of law were in place, this subjugation largely continued and only changed slowly Even your Taliban example is some ~~been~~ men subjugating a lot of both men and women. Ultimately the world is complicated and very rarely breaks down on gendered lines as clearly as people might expect. Women have lead groups that take away rights, and men have done the same. The bonds that hold a group together in order to control another are law and the fear of devolution to violence and betrayalnot gender.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"We had also never had a convicted felon elected president either, but here we are.","title":"Shocking New Details on Matt Gaetz Sexual Misconduct Probe Released Minutes Before He Withdrew From Nomination"},{"text":"If that's true what is to be done","title":"The 15 Democrats Who Voted to Give Trump Insane New Powers"},{"text":"It was misidentified as an ICBM because it carried a MIRV, which until now was only found on ICBMs. Which is why this is still a big deal.

Which basically means they can completely bypass all of Europe's air defenses and destroy them completely without wasting any ICBMs, so all 300+ of those can be directed solely against the US in the event of nuclear war.

Previous work has found that interpersonal relationships among lawmakers are a key predictor of legislative collaborationparticularly among members from opposing parties. In the wake of the events of January 6, 2021, many Democratic lawmakers claimed that their relationships with some of their Republican colleagues were irretrievably broken and they would be unable to continue collaborating with members who voted against certifying electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election. Using data on original cosponsorship and legislative effectiveness from the 115th to 117th Congresses (2017C22) we find that Republican lawmakers who voted against the certification of electoral votes lost bipartisan collaborators and saw a drastic decrease in their legislative effectiveness in the 117th Congress.How does bipartisanship survive in the cutthroat political environment that exists today? One way is through interpersonal relationships between lawmakers. Both member accounts and contemporary scholarship support the notion that positive relationships across the aisle are a key factor that explains how lawmakers are able to work with members of the opposing party The events of January 6 allow us to assess what happens when these interpersonal relationships are suddenly and severely damaged. Our analyses find that bipartisan collaboration declined overall in the 117th Congress (2021C22). However, the certification objectors experienced the greatest decline. Moreover, these same members also saw a sharper reduction in their legislative effectiveness when compared to other House members. Our results provide compelling evidence that the relationships between and among members of Congress meaningfully influence their abilities to work across the aisle and be productive lawmakers. They also demonstrate that the effects of the January 6 riot may permeate Congress for the foreseeable future.Most legislation that passes Congress does so with considerable support from members of both parties. These bills range from trivial measures to significant legislation such as the CARES Act or the Respect for Marriage Act. [...] The proportion of bills that receive bipartisan support at passage has remained relatively constant over the past few decades, even as our measures of polarization between the two major parties has shown an unabated increase. Similarly, Harbridge (Reference Harbridge2015) finds a constant rate of cross-party cosponsorship of legislation across the past three decades, Craig (Reference Craig2023) finds that bipartisan collaboration persists, and Fong (Reference Fong2023) finds that legislators prefer to be cooperative with one another. Legislation that cleanly divides the two parties definitely exists, but purely partisan lawmaking is the exception rather than the rule.That bipartisan lawmaking persists in the current political environment is a puzzle. Today, both parties are engaged in a never ending battle for majority control of each chamber of Congress as neither party has been able to secure a large or durable majority. This battle has produced a rise in messaging bills intended solely to highlight parties differences (Gelman Reference Gelman2017; Lee Reference Lee2016). Todays constant competition, partisan rancor, and focus on messaging has become self-reinforcing. Many ideological moderates have chosen either to retire from Congress or not seek the office at all (Thomsen Reference Thomsen2017), and long-standing norms against campaigning against state delegation members have eroded (Treul Reference Treul2017). Moreover, the centralized nature of modern lawmaking has limited the ability of most rank-and-file members to play an active role in legislating (Chergosky and Roberts Reference Chergosky and Roberts2018; Curry Reference Curry2015), furthering the influence of partisan leaders on Capitol Hill.One reason for continued bipartisanship are the rules. The lawmaking process requires the building of concurrent majorities across the House and Senate, while also requiring the support of the White House. In periods of divided government, this necessitates bipartisan support to move legislation. But even under unified government, intraparty disagreements and differences in House and Senate apportionment typically produce large, bipartisan winning coalitions (Curry and Lee Reference Curry and Lee2020; Krehbiel Reference Krehbiel2010; Mayhew Reference Mayhew2005). The Senates debate rules further reinforce the need for bipartisanship, as support in both parties is typically needed to secure the 60 vote cloture threshold.\\nWhile the rules necessitate bipartisanship to legislate, members of Congress still must overcome partisan divides to forge legislative agreements. As shocking and frightening as the storming of the U.S. Capitol was to congressional observers, it was unimaginably worse for those who work inside the chambers. Members and staffs saw their workspaces invaded and ransacked, and some members literally ran for safety as rioters fought their way into the nations Capitol. Many members spent hours either hiding in their offices or in a secure area while police and eventually the National Guard subdued the rioters. This occurred on a day when many members brought their families to the Capitol to observe the ceremonial counting of electoral votes. Few, if any, thought they would find their physical well-being at risk on this day.As we noted above, the certification objectors faced outrage from many of their colleagues. It was reported that many Democrats were going to refuse to collaborate legislatively with objectors moving forward.\\nRep. Connor Lamb (DCPA), a moderate known for his willingness to work across the aisle conceded that, There are personal relationships at stake and that he would find it hard to work with morally blind Republicans following the attacks (Calefati Reference Calefati2021). Other Democratic lawmakers were even more specific. For example, Rep. Brad Schneider (DCIL), a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said he had to cut off relationships with Republicans who had supported de-certification, and reportedly ended legislative efforts he had ongoing with Reps. Jody Hice (RCGA) and Paul Gosar (RCAZ) (see Ann Caldwell Reference Ann Caldwell2021). Rep. Cindy Axne (DCIA), who had previously cosponsored legislation with Rep. Jason Smith (RCMO) expanding kidney disease insurance eligibility, found a new Republican cosponsorRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA)who had voted to certify the election results.\\nMembers who opposed certification saw a 15 percentage point drop in their bipartisan cosponsorship rate for all bills and resolutions after January 6. This effect was approximately 7 percentage points, if we focus only on bills, which is still statistically and substantively significant. We find a similar effect in count models predicting the number of bills introduced by members with opposite party original cosponsors. Taken together, the results in Table 1 provide strong evidence that certification opponents were punished by their Democratic colleagues as both the rate and number of bills they sponsored with Democratic collaborators fell sharply compared to previous congresses.Extremely interesting study. I didn't post the analysis, so whoever is interested should check it out.","title":"APSR study: Historically, interpersonal relationships were a key factor in bipartisan collaboration in the US Congress.

For too long, power and wealth have been concentrated in the hands of conglomerates, special interest groups, and the ultra-wealthy, who control our government, our economy, and even our future. But we, the people, hold a power they cannot ignore: our dollars and our unity. United Stand 2025 is our plana bold, coordinated movement to reclaim our country from corporate dominance and demand the reforms we deserve. In most cases, this plan can be done from your phone in just an hour or less. Together, we can make history.Step 1: Healthcare Opt-Out for the HealthyIf you are healthy and can take the risk, cancel your private healthcare coverage. Insurance companies rely on premiums from healthy clients to cover their profits. If enough people step away, these companies will face unprecedented pressure, serving only high-cost clients. This could collapse the current system and drive the government to finally step in and consider a socialized healthcare system, like those in other developed nations.Step 2: Set Your Tax Withholding to ZeroSet your tax withholding to zero on your paycheck, and save that money in a personal account. At tax time, youll owe the same amount, but throughout the year, youll have had control over your own earnings. If millions of Americans hold onto their tax dollars, the government will feel a shortfall and recognize that taxpayers are demanding reform. This step doesnt avoid your responsibility; its a call for accountability. Just remember to set that money aside to pay whats owed when the time comes.Step 3: Move Money from Banks to Brokerages or other accounts acting as stewards.Transfer your funds out of traditional banks and into brokerage accounts. This takes your money out of the reach of banks that profit by using your deposits to make loans and investments, providing gains for them and a small amount of interest for the account holder. With brokerage accounts and alike, your money remains secure and insured but untouched by the banking system. As banks struggle to meet reserve requirements, they may have to sell assets to meet requirements, causing ripple effects through the markets, and noticeable effects on quarterly statements for all banks and investment firms.Optional Step 4: Rent Moratorium for Corporate-Owned PropertiesIf steps 1-3 dont bring about reform discussions, we hold the next card. We pause rent payments to properties owned by conglomerates and real estate investment groups. This step is reserved for later, as a strategic escalation if reforms arent addressed. Its bold, but it has the power to push corporate landlords into action and to bring attention to the housing issues affecting millions of Americans.Why United Stand 2025 Will WorkWeve seen that the powerful respond to dollars, not just to votes. United Stand 2025 harnesses our collective financial power and directs it toward a common cause. By standing together in economic protest, we send a message that cant be ignored. This is a coordinated, strategic action to bring about real changeby the people, for the people.Join us in United Stand 2025 and be part of a historic movement to reclaim America.","title":"Trump Goes Full Dictator in Latest Threat to GOP Senators"},{"text":"But whyThey have no need or reason to nuke anyone","title":"cmv: Trump is going to start ww3"},{"text":"Their comment was detrimental to the shareholders.You know, people that own stock in a company.","title":"Social issues drove some Teamsters to take that risk and vote for anti-union candidate Trump"},{"text":"Are there no unisex bathrooms there?

Brazil doesn't have mutual interests with Russia or China, India is outright hostile to China, and Russia and South Africa have lost so much economic power in the past decade it's unbelievable. BRICS is literally dependant on the U.S. dollar. It's absolutely reliant on the West. Ironically enough, BRICS originally was far more open to the West when it started out, because back then the political agendas of the countries involved seemed to align themselves, however, BRICS in it's current situation is an uneven, scuffed, weird hybrid of an economic treaty and geopolitical unspoken rules at best.Even if demographically, MORE people dislike the west, it doesn't translate to actual Political or Economic influence. Egypt's population is nearly 3 times larger than Canada's for instance. Does that translate to actual global influence? No. Same with Israel only being the size of Montenegro roughly, and having the population of Azerbaijan. Israel is also not going to expand further into the Middle East, as it's already struggling with the Palestinian Territories and Lebanon, and already has no plans to annex Lebanon. Russia can't even supply arms to it's own war currently.There's also not going to be another Scramble for Africa lol. The only reason why China even cares about Africa is due to the large amount of natural resources, and how African dictatorships bend over for China. Alternatively, you can make the point that Trump wouldn't start WW3 just like how Churchill didn't start WW2: The global situation was already tense enough for it to develop naturally. Nothing short of a direct U.S. attack on deep Russian soil explicitly authorized by Trump would cause your question to be true, and even then, a proxy war still wouldn't cause it.

Putin on the other hand is absolutely embarrassing himself. Hitler beat Poland in 35 days. Putin has been at it for nearly 3 years, and has little to show. The negotiating would be more like a face saving measure for him, so he can go back to his people and say \\"look everyone, we won, we got Crimea and it's recognized by the world\\". The reality is that he's barely winning against Ukraine alone. You think he's got the US quaking in its boots watching him flounder against a second rate military like Ukraine?

Because what you're talking about physical strength, but it's really a question of social norms and structure.?\\nFor instance, let's take the Inuits. Men would find it hard to suppress women's rights, because they were rarely around - famously, the men would go on months-long fishing expeditions.?\\nOr let's take the modern United States. Men can suppress some rights, but largely only those available to them based on the governmental structure. It would be extraordinarily hard, basically impossible, for men to suppress a right from all women but no men. It's happened - most recently with abortion, then with for instance owning a credit card until the 1970s (not getting into whether either of those is necessarily a fundamental human right on the level of speech, which is what we should really be talking about).?\\nIn the latter case, we changed the structure of the law so that credit card ownership couldn't be based on gender. In the former, I mean, I disagree with the Court's decision but they certainly wouldn't say they were stripping women of their rights.?\\nSo the big buffer the United States has - assuming you're correct and that guns aren't a corrective for physical strength - is diversity. It's not only unlikely, but functionally impossible for all men to agree on a concerted effort to strip all women of a given right, and to protect that through force. For one thing, men just won't agree as a consequence of partisanship. For another, women are too deeply ingrained in our society, their social roles too well-defined for all men, or even a quorum, to agree that women just don't have the right to peaceably assemble anymore.?\\nAfghanistan didn't have either of those.?\\nIs it theoretically possible for a supervillain to brainwash one gender in order to suppress the rights of the other? I guess so. And in that case, sure, I think it would be wiser for the supervillain to choose men for a bunch of reasons. But we're pretty deeply into the realm of science fiction rather than either philosophy or sociology at that point.?","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"Just another colored person conned by Traitor Trump ??","title":"Not surprised: Byron Donalds reacts to snub from Trumps nearly-all white administration"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.

E.g. \\"I identify as,\\" \\"my pronouns are,\\" \\"I must be racist because...\\" They beat a dead horse. And unoriginal jokes lose their humor quickly.In the same way, they'll also repeatedly punch down, or tell some variation of the same insult or cruel \\"joke\\" again and again. Cruelty is often funny for these people. Also, some conservatives just try to disguise crude, stereotyping and racist remarks as \\"jokes.\\" Which are very lazy.Then there's the so called humor that's just an effort to \\"own the libs.\\" In other words, it's just trolling. And the worst kind that appeals to the lowest common denominator of feelings. Ironically however, theyre really just trolling themselves.The most disingenuous attempts are when conservatives use \\"satire\\" to push a narrative, conspiracy theory, or talking point. It's partisan, political messaging meant to validate right wing narratives that often aren't even based in reality. And when you call it out, conservative defenders say something like \\"stupid libs can't even recognize satire!\\"But it's not satire, it's just another lame headline. it's just a round about way of promoting an outlandish narrative, unsubstantiated rumor, or straight up propaganda. These same people who say \\"it's just satire,\\" don't actually see it that way. It's real to them. And moreso to them than those who call it out for what it is. Because it often reinforces conservative's backwards political views, their prejudices and preconceptions, their *feelings*Jokes should be rooted in some truth or reality, or at least have an inkling of truth to them, whether it's abstract or not. But conservative jokes are often rooted in fantasies. They're drawn from delusions or entirely imagined scenarios, and they're often steeped in right wing politics and culture wars.That's another problem. They can't separate politics from their identity. They're not comedians, they're \\"conservative comedians.\\" They can't separate those two things. It's more about projecting their identity than anything else.The thing is, comedians are funny when you take them seriously, however backwards that may sound. But think about it, you're less likely to find someone's jokes funny if you think they're dishonest and insincere. If you think they're unreliable, petty, fake... And it's very hardto take these conservative comedians seriously...","title":"Was it all a joke? How stand-up comedy helped reelect Trump"},{"text":"Hold press conferences.

Rights only exist in actuality insofar as a government grants AND enforces them through laws. All laws are compelled by physical force.Well, not exactly. Rights are necessary to enforce for man to live based on biological facts about man. You saw what happened in Venezuela? Or you see whats happening in Haiti? Or you seen the how the world population has changed historically? Thats what happens when you dont have a government to enforce rights. Murder and theft are still wrong (harmful to your life) regardless of whether the government enforces laws against murder and theft. A simple way to think of this view is, if the President convinced all men to kill all women, the women would be killed fairly quickly.So, I dont think this is the case. Because if men were that irrational or in denial of reality, then women would win. Rationality is more important to war and production than physical force. Though, what youre proposing is impossible because the more rational men would join the women and then trounce the male losers who decided to go through with it. And unrealistic scenarios arent helpful for learning about reality.And, if men want their rights secured, they need to secure the rights of all individuals. Your Middle East example is a good illustration. Yes, women have less rights than men there. But men also have less rights there than in a Western country. You wouldnt want to be there as a man or a woman.Women will always have rights as long as men decide to secure their own rights. The only way women will lose rights or not have their rights secured is enough men and women turn against their own rights or dont support their own rights.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"Women also work in positions that operate guns, and if a war is starting, people will arm up.

He considers a situation where everyone is completely self interested, and there is no government to enforce rights and no one has any interest in helping anyone else or giving them rights.  \\nHobbes thinks that this will lead to a situation where everyone is against everyone else (there are interesting game theory things here, but that is a different discussion). There is no reason for men to band together or for women to band together, it is just everyone against everyone else. In this situation, Hobbes argues that there is a rough equality among humans. No one person is so smart and so strong and so careful that any other person couldn't kill them if they tried hard enough. This seems true to me. Even the strongest smartest person ever has to sleep, and in an environment where there is no reason to work together, such a person is on their own. Even if you could get some people on your side, you would be susceptible to them turning against you in the same way. Ultimately, no person could guarantee their own safety in such a situation, even if they were the smartest and strongest and most careful person around.  \\nFor Hobbes, this state of affairs would make human life \\"nasty, brutish and short.\\"  \\nThus, the only solution is to come together, set some ground rules, and have a way to enforce them and punish those who break them. This is the only way, in his view, that we can have things like cooperation, trade, business, safety, society, or rights at all. But, because of the rough equality of humanity, the rules (or at least the structure for creating the rulesHobbes likes a monarchy, but that's beyond the point) need to be set in a way that is broadly consented to by most people. There is really no way for some subset to simply dictate the form of government, thus men and women, broadly, have to be involved in the creation of society, trade, business and rights.   \\nI say all of this not to suggest that societies have always valued women or that shall minorities have not run governments in various societies. I say all of this to argue that it is US as a collective that grants and takes rights to and from each other. Could any large group come together and deprive rights from others? sure, but the point is that, ultimately, rights aren't men's to give. They are the expression of the collective, at least originally.  \\nAnd keep in mind that there is no natural way to have \\"men\\" as a unit coalesce in this way to directly physically fight against women in the way you seem to imagine. Now that society does exist, there are rules in place. And systems in place to punish those who break the rules, including, physical attack. Sure, \\"men\\" as a collective could dismantle this, but doing so risks putting them back in a place where there are no rules, and it is every man for himself. This is one reason I think we find crime movies so exciting. When a group is operating outside the law already, there is nothing stopping them from cheating and stealing from each other, except, maybe, the collectively recognized power.  \\nUltimately, (1) men and women are more equal than you suppose because there is a rough equality for the purposes you care about; (2) rights arise from the collective, not some group of men alone that have graciously bestowed them on women; (3) even if men were to act in the way you describe (which, because of (1) and (2), is unlikely), there would be no force controlling them and preventing cheating, violence, and disloyalty (again, because of the rough equality of humanity), meaning that such a collective would dissolve into in-fighting.  \\nBasically, we are all in this together, whether we like it or not, and we ought to act like it.","title":"CMV: Patriarchy Hot Take: Women only have rights if men agree to grant them rights."},{"text":"Already done.

When talking about men who could physically impose their will, you'd have to first eliminate old men, young boys, the disabled, the men who are weak, and those who have mental illness (at least insofar as it might get in the way of them forcing their views). You then have to take the remaining pool and  imagine they all think the same on the issue. In other words, that of the men strong enough to either take or grant rights, all of them (or enough to enforce whatever decision was made) would have to all agree. This is further unlikelythe decision would be far from unanimous. So much smaller pool of men who are strong enough to impose their will on women, would not only have to be large enough to take on women, but would also have to be large enough to take on those women PLUS all the men who'd be standing on their side and ready to fight with them.

He couldn't form a coalition because the other parties wouldn't join with him. He was picked by two literal aristocrats for Chancellor, not because they thought he represented the will of the German people, but because they thought they could sideline his party and keep the other Nazis out of cabinet. Hitler went from Chancellor to dictator not by persuading the electorate to support him, but by capitalizing on an opportunity and using violent repression in subsequent elections.\\n?Notably, this is all very different from Trump, who won a fair election without voter suppression or violence because people apparently thought (misguidedly, in my view) that he was a better option than Harris.

This brief remark encapsulates the Republican party's platform. Only *they* are entitled to \\"a say.\\" Only *they* are entitled to the god given rights afforded to them in the Constitution. *They* get to dictate your rights, and God have mercy if you have any \\"say\\" in the matter. This is a biological man trying to force himself into womens spaces, and Im not going to tolerate it. Im the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. If some guy in a skirt came by and said, No, thats my achievement. Im going to be there and standing in the way and saying, Hell no. Im not going to allow men to erase women or womens rights.First of all, trans people statistically do not pose any risk to people in bathrooms and are instead far more at risk of being abused or harassed while trying to use facilities. Yet Republicans, and in typical fashion mind you, pretend like this issue is some widespread, inescapable epidemic.Think about how ego centric this is too. They're the victims at the center of a trans agenda thats oppressing *them,* \\"erasing their rights.\\" This isn't about the rights of trans persons, it's not even an effort to address which bathrooms should be reserved for the trans community, It's about *their* feelings, no one else's. It's about what kind of experience they're entitled to while using a public bathroom, and f*ck the feelings of the trans woman, this is about me me me.Someone should ask Mace, or any Republican congressman for that matter, to identify any cases of trans people harassing someone in a public bathroom. And you know what, for the sake of argument, let's say they do identify a case, It still doesn't mean that one incident is broadly representative of how all trans persons behave.What's particularly unnerving here is that Republicans like Mace just presume they will be tormented in public bathrooms by trans people, that they are under attack, that they are the victims here, when in reality, it's not only a presumption attempting to justify discriminatory policy, but it's people like McBride who are the actual victims of harassment in these scenarios.So Mace and her fearmongering coalition of bigots ignore or outright dismiss the fact that it's trans individuals who are much more likely to be hassled in public bathrooms, while Republicans like Nancy are the actual enablers of that harassment, and they're basically resorting to a form of victim blaming.These Republicans just suspect that trans people prioritize using bathrooms to make others feel uncomfortable, that whenever a trans individual uses a public bathroom, it's, first and foremost, for the purpose of provoking others. Instead of the fact that, you know, they're just there to do their own business, and mind their own business for that matter, just like most people who use the public restroom.Republicans presume a whole lot about the LGBTQ community. And most of it is rooted in their own insecurities, their prejudices, their hate. So they pass laws to validate these feelings. If it's written into law, it becomes an official acknowledgement. If there's a law prohibiting Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom, it must be for a reason. And now that reason becomes a reality for them.While make no mistake, this is only one step away from Republican men refusing to share a bathroom with people like McBride. Which is one step away from either banning her from using public bathrooms altogether, or designating a bathroom strictly for people like McBride. You know, just like how bathrooms were segregated a century ago.This is what Republicans do, they incessantly vilify out-groups, foreigners, gay and trans people, \\"the other,\\" so that they can create scapegoats and boogeymen. Then these scapegoats and boogeymen become the targets of their outrage, their hate, their blame, their grievances, their discrimination and ultimately, their legislative efforts. And all of these things are part of a kind of feedback loop.Their fears, their hate, their hostility towards these groups, and the misinformation and propaganda they generate, help them justify the legislation they pass, and that legislation helps reinforce their fears and contempt for those groups even more, which then strengthens their case for more discriminatory and suppressive measures, and around and around it goes.","title":"John Fetterman offers his office bathroom to Sarah McBride as she says shell follow GOP rules on restroom usage"},{"text":"Right.

Most voters don't care to research different platforms at all, let alone which ones are reasonable and who's lying.  So they default to their 'gut feeling' or 'the vibes'.  And when their gut feelings include a lot of unchecked assumptions about the role of women, that's a recipe for disaster.  It's also why I maintain that we can't beat this by shying away from inclusion, but by challenging those ideas head-on.I think the most important thing is being willing to confront friends and family.Yep.  While everyone knows their own friends and family best, and know the best way to talk to them, it's almost certain to be a tough conversation.

Because nations and countries?consist of people, they also have changeability as their nature. When they begin to lose it, or when it begins to produce too defective changes (\\\\~not energy efficient) they begin to die/reborn.USA, melting pot of humanity, was created by record-breaking?changeability. During history there were no times/places when generations had been more different from each other than in the USA of 1900-2020s.&amp;#x200B;But because of a chain of events, USA changeability became defective (producing contradictions).Foremost by biggest USA blunder in its history, second only to industrialization of USSR, by ban of soviet?criticism?during Nuremberg?Trials.In 1945 year USA had enormous?chance to reaffirm own commitment to truth and publicity by sharing enormous weight of USSR-related risks with World by full disclosure of all trues about?USSR.But by absolute shortsightedness, USA politicians took the first step towards USA fall?- they start to copy USSR censorship, paternalism, and sociopathic utilitarianism.In the 1960s all of this evolved into the main USA poison - Political Realism, separation of morality from politics (main reason of cultural problems), and politics from economics (main reason of economic problems as result of trade with autocratic regimes).&amp;#x200B;Remember when I said that USA was created by enormous changeability of melting pot of humanity? This melting pot function by the most long-term strategies/goals which could exist, Western values: Rational Humanism, Secularism, Rule of Law, Democracy, Freedoms, foremost Freedom of Speech (low information transaction costs. Which at the same rise variety and reduce fear of unknown.When USA separated morality from politics, and politics from economics, it also suppressed Western values and own changeability. Creating such disharmonious waves as Kissinger, NeoCon, Reagan, George Bush and so on, which made nature of USA changeability more chaotic, xenophobic, past-centric. Contradictory (including by social decisions).Up to recent... Let's name it phase transition.&amp;#x200B;Modern USA reached a critical point when its changeability became too different from the USA/West fundamental?values to bear useful fruit.\\"Old USA\\" is dying (on most level except monetary, but as I already?said, countries consist of people, and people not consist from money, people use money as tools for more important?for them sociocultural?goals, but no more).Which good (in same historical sense as it was with Rome Empire or \\"Old Order\\") because it is a chance for the USA to be reforged to something more actual. Without issues that gradually oversaturate USA by contradictions.And due to Trump \\"Old USA\\" is dying?very fast.Which also very good because USA received chance to be reforging before times with much more dangerous technologies, more nukes among totalitarian regimes, and much older/conservative/conformist population.&amp;#x200B;What if USA won't be able to be reforged into something?new?In long-term perspective it also not very bad for the World because USA will be replaced by something completely new, as the USA in its own time replaced the British Empire.In 1920-1990s USA melting pot mixed almost everything that could be mixed and spread it through globalization (which also attracted into USA melting pot the World's worst) to everyone else.Right now most World's countries, at least socioculturally, essentially?USA children.And if USA will not be able to cope with its Political Realism (alienation of the USA fundamental values) illness - most likely USA children, by \\"necessity is a very good teacher\\" principle, will be able partly or fully replace USA. As the USA in the 20th century partly replaced \\"Old Europe.\\"","title":"Why Donald Trump's Victory is Bad for the US and the World"},{"text":"So who the hell is this woman and how scared should we be","title":"Trump announces Pam Bondi as new attorney general pick hours after Matt Gaetz withdraws"},{"text":"Literally all the special ed funding goes through the DOE.

More than anything what stands out to me is how many people's perception is simply off, and has to be corrected even before we ask them to make difficult political sacrifices for the long-term benefit of the country and the world.I think part of the issue here is that people's views on the world are calibrated poorly. Not *their fault*, but human nature. The average American was born in a world post WW2, where a lot of the Great Issues have been (relatively) solved. Sure there's still scary threats of war and disease and other issues but it's *nothing* like the past. The Spanish Flu despite occuring in a world with a much smaller population killed more than 5 times (maybe even more than 10 times!) the amount Covid did. Overall there's less wars and what does remain seems to be less deadly. But we don't calibrate off the lives of those times we never lived, we calibrate off the world *we grow up with* now. They don't understand the insane progress humanity and the US has made because when they look back they don't see the 100 years ago. We live in the most prosperous era ever (at least, so far). People will complain about food prices when (relative to income) it's cheaper than ever. And when was the last time a major famine happened in a first world nation? Even the poorest of the poor families can get food pretty easily from SNAP or food banks. I've met poor rural families who have *virtual reality systems* like PSVR or the Quest, literal sci fi devices unimaginable 50 years ago. Van Gogh was given multiple times the average pay of a factory worker in his era for free by his brother and he still drove himself poor because of how expensive art supplies were. Now they're so cheap that little kids all around the world have art classes and finger drawing.When you exclude the housing crisis, a largely artificial problem caused by zoning and restrictions then even many of the poorest Americans live a better life than many kings and queens of the past. Abundant food from all around the world even out of season, entertainment on demand (why have one royal jester when there's millions on your TV and phone?), personal high speed travel, air conditioning, all sorts of science fiction technologies and healthcare far more advanced than any of their shamans or spiritual healers could do.","title":"Why Donald Trump's Victory is Bad for the US and the World"},{"text":"You all said the same thing about tRump McDonald, but I saw the popular vote.","title":"No Trump administration pick is viewed positively by most Americans"},{"text":"#Trump won the Electoral *and* the Popular Vote?\\nFTFY?","title":"Trump Has Lost His Popular-Vote Majority"},{"text":"Oz killed a bunch of dogs instead, so hes got the cruelty part covered","title":"Linda McMahon, Trumps Education pick, was sued for allegedly enabling sexual abuse of children"},{"text":"I mean, at least the ped's gone.","title":"Trump announces Pam Bondi as new attorney general pick hours after Matt Gaetz withdraws"},{"text":"Ok, but she's a woman!

Its designed to target anyone who dares to challenge the greed lords and their grip on power. This isnt just about the mediaits about silencing every organization and movement that threatens their control. If passed, this law will be a cudgel used to dismantle non-profits and advocacy groups under the guise of national security or public order.Think about the consequences: watchdog organizations like CREW, which call out corruption in government, could suddenly find themselves accused of supporting domestic threats. Planned Parenthood could be branded for supposedly aiding abortion terrorists. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights for online privacy and freedom, might be silenced for defending journalists or activists. LGBTQ+ organizations like GLAAD could face shutdowns for promoting destabilizing agendas. And this is just the startany group that fights for justice, equity, or accountability will be at risk.This isnt just theoreticalits straight out of the authoritarian playbook. Target non-profits, cut off their funding, label them enemies, and watch as the resistance crumbles. These tactics have been used by dictatorships around the world, and now Trump and the billionaires backing him want to bring it here. Why? Because a free press and empowered civil society are the last lines of defense against their greed and corruption.Weve seen this strategy in motion before: attack Antifa and protesters to justify militarized crackdowns. Label Black Lives Matter terrorists to discredit their fight for racial justice. Now, under the Press Act, theyre looking to expand their targets to include anyone who speaks up or organizes against the greed lords.This isnt about law and order or fairness. Its about consolidating power for the rich while stripping the rest of us of our ability to fight back. Once groups like the ACLU, EFF, Planned Parenthood, CREW, and GLAAD are silenced, whos left to stand up for ordinary people? The First Amendment was meant to protect us from this exact kind of overreach, but Trump and his enablers are gutting it to serve their own ends.We cant let this happen.

Blue states picking up services and regulatory regimes would do so at a higher cost than they currently spend and since most are bound to balance budgets by statute, they would have to raise taxes.
