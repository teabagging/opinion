There are 2 audiences, imo, whom the nuclear threats are aimed at in the West, and it isn't the governments or militaries of NATO countries. It is the civilian voter populations in those countries, and the Russian sympathizers in those countries.To the civilian populations in Europe and the US, the message is simple. If your governments keep supporting Ukraine, we might use nuclear weapons. That is bad, so be afraid, and maybe be more eager to support a short term peace plan that might freeze the conflict but allow Russia to recover and try again.To the propaganda purveyors in the West, the nuclear threats are always couched in language like \\"to prevent defeat of Russian forces\\", or \\"in response to X escalation by the West\\", which allows the propagandists to cast Russia as the aggrieved party in the situation, only resorting to nuclear weapons as a last resort after being pushed there by Western provocations. This ignores the actual reality where Russia is threatening to use nuclear weapons to support an invasion they started of a peaceful neighbor, and it does so by design.So I'd argue that, while the military analysis of what Russian nuclear escalation might look like and how likely it is are valuable to do, they also miss the main point of the threats in a lot of ways. Russia dropping a nuke on Europe doesn't make military sense. Russia's nuclear threats are primarily for the information war, and in that context they are rational and make a lot of sense.","title":"CMV: Using threats of nuclear strike to achieve land acquisition is fallacy (in regards of UA vs. RF war)"},{"text":"He probably met him right after dropping out of Ohio State Univeirty.

Without enough workers, production can fall behind demand, causing prices to rise even more sharply.Additionally, legal immigrants contribute to government revenue by paying taxes.

In fact, economic growth has been stronger in the United States during times of less inequality and more fairness to workers. As economist Heather Boushey has argued in Unbound, How Inequality Constricts Our Economy and What We Can Do About It, when people dont have opportunity, the entire economy loses out on talent and ideas, which weakens our markets and drags down economic growth. Between 1980 and 2023, the U.S. economy grew only 2.6% annually on average (slowing down to just 1.6% in the 2006-16 decade). This low growth era was marked by increasing inequality and a shrinking middle class. Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez have found that that from 1980 to 2014 the average income of the top 1% of Americans increased from $420,000 to $1.3 million, while the bottom half of Americans experienced stagnating incomes during the same period.This was a reversal of the economic conditions that prevailed in America in the three decades following World War II when both wages and productivity grew alongside economic expansion. The economy grew around 4% annually on average during this period when the nation experienced much lower income inequality.

What Vance is promoting for the young and healthy to have junk \\"insurance\\" (which is equivalent to \\"short term plans\\") and for the older and/or those with pre-existing conditions is to pay high premiums.Sure, they \\"won't eliminate\\" coverage altogether for those with pre-existing conditions (since Vance wants to deregulate the insurance market they wouldn't even be able to make sure insurance companies won't refuse to cover people with pre-existing conditions), but, they'll make them pay FAR more than with the ACA. Also, in addition to deregulating the health insurance market (Vance wants the ACA gone), that would mean federal subsides are gone, Medicaid Expansion is gone, and, nineTEEN year old children would be kicked off their parents' insurance (under the ACA, the cut off age is 26, which is obviously more reasonable than 19) and would have to settle for junk \\"insurance\\" (and that's assuming they're healthy and if not, they'll be paying a steep price just to get the care they need).This kid is a couch fucking joke and I don't even think he's doing this intentionally, I legitimately believe he's just an impulsive idiot who speaks/acts without thinking.","title":"JD Vance just gave Kamala Harris another huge opportunity"},{"text":"A funny TikTok video that already enforces their views.*","title":"Trump branded 'unfit' as 700 security officials back Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Agreed.

By the late 1950s, in large swaths of the country, Cohn writes, people at high risk of medical expenses had no realistic way to get comprehensive insurance.

A young American doesnt have the same health care needs as a 65-year-old American,?[he told Welker](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-september-15-2024-n1310615). We want to make sure everybody is covered. But the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a one size fits all approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.It wasnt clear in the moment whether Vances views matched Trumps. As is often the case, the former president didnt?[mention any specifics](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-campaign-proposals-tax-cuts-rcna171853)?in his nonanswer at the debate, and Vance has run ahead of Trump before. When asked at the debate about Vances claim that Trump would veto a national abortion ban, the latter responded, Well, I didnt discuss it with JD.But it soon became clear that Trump and Vance?*are*?singing from the same hymnal. In?[a story from Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/17/2024/jd-vance-cracks-open-the-pre-existing-condition-debates)?published Wednesday, a Trump spokesman refused to provide specific details but did tell Semafor that the president and Vance were broadly aligned on health care policy. That afternoon at a campaign stop in North Carolina, Vance reiterated the proposed overhaul. If you only go to the doctor once a year, youre going to need a different health care plan than somebody who goes to the doctor 14 times a year, he argued, because theyve got chronic pain, or theyve got some other chronic condition. Thats the biggest and most important thing that we have to change.In other words, Vance confirmed that Trump wants to revive one of the worst aspects of American health care before the Affordable Care Act.Read more: [https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-vance-health-care-rcna171735](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-vance-health-care-rcna171735)","title":"JD Vance just gave Kamala Harris another huge opportunity"},{"text":"Follow the averages not a single poll","title":"Kamala Harris has largest post-debate lead yet over Donald Trump in new Wisconsin Watch poll: The MassINC Polling Group survey found Harris with 53% support to Trumps 46% among likely voters, nearly outside the polls margin of error."},{"text":"As long as Trump can still sign bills that give further tax cuts to the wealthy, his cognitive decline doesn't matter to the people who run the MSM.","title":"Trump is 78 and barely coherent.

But a Polish publishers association accuses the social media giant of exploiting its dominant position to censor content.As of Friday, when links to Polish media outlets are posted on Facebook, only their title appears, without the image and text summary that was previously also visible.In a?statement, Facebook said that it had done this because a new Polish copyright law, which went into force on Friday, is not consistent with the scope or terms of the European Union copyright directive that it is supposed to implement.In particular, it says that Polands law has created a lack of clarity around article 15 of the EU directive, which relates to so-called neighbouring rights (also known as related rights) for those associated with a creative work but who are not its actual creators.Facebook did not say what specific legal concerns it has. It added, however, that its decision is an interim approach pending guidance on the scope of Article 15 from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in relation to a similar implementing law in Italy.The social media giants decision has been condemned by prominent voices in Polands media industry, who note that the way articles now appear on Facebook makes them much less noticeable and attractive to users.Facebook has gone to war with the Polish media, Bartosz W?glarczyk, the editor-in-chief of Onet, a leading news website, wrote in a Facebook post. We are being punished for changes in the copyright law that Big Tech doesnt like.Polands implementation of the EUs copyright directive has provoked controversy. In July this year,?hundreds of media outlets jointly protested?against the proposed legislation, arguing that it favoured tech giants and threatened Polish businesses.That eventually led parliament to?amend the legislation, introducing a mechanism that would allow media firms to seek help from a state agency when negotiating with tech giants such as Google and Facebook over payments for their content.In a statement published on Friday, however, Polands Chamber of Press Publishers (IWP) argued that Polands implementation of article 15 does not differ substantially from the solutions adopted in several other European countries.It accused Meta C the group that owns Facebook as well as Instagram and WhatsApp C of becoming a censor of content and exploiting its dominant position. The companys actions will have negative consequences for the entire sector, warned the IWP.This may constitute grounds for publishers to take appropriate legal action, they added.","title":"Polish publishers condemn Facebook after it limits post visibility following change to copyright law"},{"text":"Based","title":"A video from 2018 of Kamala Harris at an open borders protest has surfaced, showing her alongside her husband and disgraced actor Jussie Smollett.

Or choose not to respect the countries culture or laws that have taken them in and proceed to act as they would in their own country.

Equally, what also adds to the fire is when poorer citizens of said country have it a lot worse off despite all these great benefits being thrown to people not of that country.

This time around its Trump who is the overestimated entrenched establishment candidate taking his support for granted. In 2016, Hillary, a deeply unpopular candidate from go, did a half-assed tour of swing states and took for granted her support in long-held democratic constituencies, and the election models reflected her arrogance with a 75% chance of winning the election. While she was patting herself on the back, Trump hit the road and did like 75 rallies in September and October.  (Hes not doing that this time.) In 2016 Trump was the change candidate and an unknown quantity. (Hes not and he isnt this time.) In 2016, the democratic candidate was 14 points underwater on favorability polls. (Harris has a positive favorability score after a historically impressive 16 point swing.) I truly believe that this time around, Trump is the one being overestimated, and Harris, the underdog candidate, will outperform expectations. The invisible support that delivered Trump a victory in 16 was not invisible. It was all there in the tea leaves. The establishment just chose to ignore it. In 2020, the final tally showed what appeared to be a 5-7 point invisible support swing between polls and outcome, but we were also in the midst of an enormous public health crisis that depressed Democratic Party turnout while the its a Chinese hoax Republicans turned out in droves to vote and *they still lost*. At the end of the day, polls are only snapshots in time, and the extrapolation of data based on those snapshots is not a perfect science and frequently gets it wrong. What were seeingthe momentum, the enthusiasm, the groundswell of grassroots engagement, the bipartisan swing, the big tent outreach, the surge in voter registration among the youthis all *real*. Its happening. We felt it in July, and August, and we can feel it now. They want us to think its all an illusion, and they know we all have 2016 PTSD, but fuck all that noise. Get out and vote in November. Until then, dont go looking for doom around every corner.

They often argue that its because Trump says the quiet part out loud, but thats addressing the symptom not the cause. A more encompassing explanation is how Trump is able to address and channel white grievance. To understand white grievance in America you have to understand that many white Americans, and especially older ones, were taught to think of America as a place where your worth in society is based on your economic status. And that you live on a figurative ladder, with the belief that work equates to climbing higher, or upward mobility. America uses this status system to reinforce a productive and rewards based society. But the ability to work up the ladder has shifted to the idea that you now have to fight to climb up the ladder. And that the entire system has been rigged against you. Keeping you forever in the same place, or actively pushing you down. This creates HUGE anxieties within the white population, because it has a dual effect. The first anxiety within the ladder is that theres a constant fear that those who are less deserving (immigrants/minorities) are being advantaged so as to propel them above you on the ladder. The second anxiety is that the prior safeguards to maintain status are eroding away, making it easier for you to slip down the ladder, again with (immigrants/minorities) then being seated above you. White people understand that the status system is failing them, but theyve been conditioned to see the system as innately American. Therefore directly challenging it is challenging the ideals of an American society. So feeling powerless, their anxieties get harnessed like electricity by those willing to cultivate and direct it (right wing media). This is where the wealthy buy politicians and media to enact favorable policies that benefit themselves, and direct white grievance toward minorities/immigrants. This strategy gives some satisfaction to white people, as it addresses and acknowledges the anxiety of being replaced on the status ladder, but it also causes blindness to how the system has been altered to fail most who are not already at the top. America has often relied on the idea that equality will lead to more prosperity for all people, but Republicans have been manipulated to abandon this belief, for they believe that to maintain their status on the ladder, they must cultivate a society that actively keeps others down.","title":"Is Trumpism a Supply or Demand Problem?

First and foremost nuclear war does or does not happen and it is on Russia decision solely and no comprehensible action of NATO would change that (comprehensible means that we are not talking about total war or NATO strike first with nuclear weapons). That means that NATO should not take it into account during negotiations at all. However you raise interesting points let me respond to them too.1.) Minsk agreement was breached by Russia first and anyway your whole paragraph is not justification for war. I think we can agree that Geneva and Hague conventions and UN Charter are quite stronger international treaties. No nation can't attack nations just because they feel that they are loosing influence which is again just their fault. 2.) This is absolutely wrong presumption. I never said that and never even suggested that. Yes Russia should feel pain until it stops with illegal invasion but that is not why I consider nuclear threats fallacy. I say NATO should not be afraid to escalate since nuclear war would happen anyway. (unless we agree with total Ukrainian capitulation which is not an option for already stated reasons)Your last paragraph is basically entirely wrong. First of all one suggestion does not make policy. Second of all if offensive action from defender is reason to stop negotiations then there were not negotiations at all. Again liability for ending negotiations is solely on Russian side. Third of all it even consist of misinformation about Ukrainians attacking Kurchata nuclear power plant. That never happened. just Russian propaganda tried to frame that on Ukrainians.","title":"CMV: Using threats of nuclear strike to achieve land acquisition is fallacy (in regards of UA vs. RF war)"},{"text":"But he won so bigly in the last debate, he'll never have the debate ever again for the rest of his life. ??","title":"Democrats to dub Trump a 'chicken' to pressure him to debate Harris"},{"text":"What I hate is when the conservative dimwits then try to shriek that were racists because we call people like Mark Robinson, Clarence Thomas, Candace Owens, and Tim Scott exactly what they are.I will say they represent that purest of Republican virtues, though: I got mine, fuck everyone else","title":"Sen.

Pollsters have been oversampling GOP voters, and their model adjustments have been weighted to favor Trump (GOP). Post-2016 elections provide evidence that they are over-adjusting and oversampling; in every election since 2016, the Democrats have over-performed.Edit: The problem with polling is that mainstream media (MSM) often portrays it as a straightforward process: Candidate A is up by X, so they should win by X. However, there are many additional factors that go into interpreting a poll. When was the poll conducted? What is the margin of error (MOE)? Who was polled? What percentage of respondents are undecided?Moreover, every poll is adjusted using methodologies that are often not fully transparent, making it difficult to assess their accuracy. The old data adage \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" applies here; with polling, you don't know what is garbage until after the election. This is why aggregate predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight and Nate Silver are so popularthey attempt to adjust for noise and provide a more reliable forecast. Some aggregators do this better than others, but the goal is to account for the various uncertainties and biases inherent in individual polls. Many experts are saying that the polls are over-weighting the GOP, and recent election results generally support that assertion.","title":"Democrats fear pollsters are undercounting Trump"},{"text":"Either theyre doing a really good job of capturing Trump vote + maybe inflating it or were completely screwedNo in between and no way to find out until november","title":"Democrats fear pollsters are undercounting Trump"},{"text":"Of all of them, I doubt you'll find him to be a bad guy.","title":"Is Keanu Reeves going to be the next \\"nice guy\\" celebrity to be exposed as a phony?"},{"text":"Tragedy, thoughts and prayers, nothing we can do about it, etc","title":"Democrats really need to tone down their rhetoric"},{"text":"Thats true.

The proposed ban could also include cars that use Chinese technology for keyless unlocking, Reuters reported.In February, the US ordered an investigation into connected cars, claiming they could be used to collect large amounts of sensitive data on their drivers and passengers and that they regularly use their cameras and sensors to record detailed information on US infrastructure.The government added at the time the cars could be piloted or disabled remotely. President Biden said it was Chinas policy to flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security.But carmakers have warned swapping out Chinese-made software and parts would be challenging. It is also likely to prompt fears of retaliatory action from Beijing.It is part of a wider spat with China, with the White House last week imposing 100pc tariffs on?[Chinese electric car imports](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/08/16/evs/)?as well as hikes on batteries and critical materials.There are currently relatively few popular Chinese car brands that export to the US, although carmakers such as BYD are targeting dramatic expansion in Europe.However, around a dozen Chinese companies hold a licence to test autonomous vehicle software in the US and have racked up tens of thousands of miles driving on Californias roads.Connected vehicles have already been manipulated during periods of conflict.In 2022, John Deere, the US agriculture giant, reportedly remotely locked millions of dollars worth of tractors and combine harvesters that had been stolen by Russian troops following the invasion of Ukraine.  \\n**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/23/biden-plots-ban-on-chinese-self-driving-car-software/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/23/biden-plots-ban-on-chinese-self-driving-car-software/)","title":"Biden plots ban on Chinese self-driving car software"},{"text":"This is an excellent question and I will probably read American Psychosis now for more perspective.

The core issue is lies and people unwilling or unable to evaluate the things they are told.  Some use lies, hate, and fear to promote their own greedy ends (power and/or money).  Trump is all of these things and some followers are simply in the game to satisfy greed and not because they don't recognize the lies.  As a child of maybe 8-years I can remember returning to a grocery store to return some change (on the order of 30 cents) because the clerk had given my grandfather too much change.  As cheating at sports, running from the scene of an accident (hit &amp; run), lying when caught breaking simple laws like speeding, etc. have become accepted and normal in our society we end up with MAGA and false heroes like Trump.  The quest to be entertained is more important than being informed.  It is a form of laziness and a good indicator of decay in society.  I would tend to suggest that depravity and it's growth in ancient Rome may have been part of the fall of Rome.","title":"Is Trumpism a Supply or Demand Problem?

Its as unlikely Kamala has a 4 point blowout in PA that Trump has a 4 point blowout in Georgia, or that Trump is in spitting distance of a national vote tie when every indication is hes been stuck at 46% (47-48% in H2H) for a decade now.I think they straight up cant poll Arizona. To go from Kamala +5 to Trump +5 requires significant playing with MoE and whatever shift there may actually be to the point of being farcical.Overall NYTs polling this cycle has been pretty weird honestly, and I think Cohn knows that because like every other poll thats released he more or less says the top line numbers probably arent correct but lets analyze anyways. I suspect their new methodology is having some growing pains, but I appreciate them nonetheless.If they are on the mark though then were gonna see some crazy shit","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Nope.

You can try to depress &amp; supress turnout, which the GOP does, but that's counterable by enthusiam... Which she's picking up in spades.Second, gerrymandering is a double edge sword since you're spreading your forces out thereby weakening your strongholds to try to further weaken your opponent but if their turnout is higher or if your turnout is lower you potentially stand to lose far more than you would have had you not tried to rig things. She has both accelerating support while he simultaneously got rid of his most loyal voters. He's additionally failed to pick up many new voters to replace his old ones.So much is in play at the moment it's not even funny. Every single voter has to power to flip all sorts of places that may not have previously been flippable.The GOP's only counter to this is to lie &amp; say it can NEVER happen while trying to suppress as many voters as possible but they're financially weak with a collapsing infrastructure &amp; no plan to offer to people.

OP is trying to make a claim about the nature of the world -- that if \\"Death of the Author\\" applies (let's set aside the nuance of what this means, and consider it a single predicate), then AI art cannot be dismissed from being art on the basis of being made by AI. A person who argues that \\"Even if the author says X, Y is probably true\\" (as in death of the author) is not only stating their opinion, but is making a claim about the world: that the text of a work says something not intended by a work's creator.Here's another example. Let's say I want to argue that \\"If soy sauce tastes good, then stir fry tastes good.\\" This is obviously based on opinions (though presumably I believe how something tastes is based on world facts and isn't arbitrary). But the claim I'm making is in fact a claim about the nature of the world. I'm stating that, if soy sauce tastes good (whatever soy sauce tasting good means), then stir fry tastes good (and whatever that means). We can argue about what defines \\"tasting good\\" but it has little relevance to the conditional.Back to OP's argument. OP is saying that, if a person believes both in death of the author AND in ai not being art, then that person has an incorrect belief about the world. OP isn't saying that people can't hold this false belief, obviously they do. But just because it's a belief that exists, and a belief based apparently on something subjective, doesn't mean that that subjective view *isn't* based on some objective part of reality. Someone who makes any claim about \\"art\\" presumably believes that \\"art\\" is an objective thing that actually exists (unless they don't, but then why form such a strong belief about it), and that the nature of what is and isn't \\"art\\" is based on real-world facts.","title":"CMV: \\"AI Art isn't Art\\" and \\"Death of the Author\\" are mutually exclusive positions."},{"text":"Have to convince young men to vote for Harris Walz or give up on Trump.","title":"What can we do to help Kamala get elected?"},{"text":"Is this a world where Wi-Fi jammers and the ability to disrupt the internet doesnt exist?","title":"If I lose its because the Democrats rigged the elections."},{"text":"Jan 6 was a terrorist attack","title":"Kamala Harriss favorability surge is the biggest for any candidate since Bush after 9/11"},{"text":"https://www.ft.com/content/d304a182-997d-4dae-98a1-aa7c691526dbI reccomend reading this article, its fairly nuances and explains the concept of the war economy and its consequences.

The whole idea of our federal system is a response to the idea of centralized power. We were fighting/had just fought a war to throw off the yoke of a parliament located far away with no first hand understanding of the local situation. That sentiment extended within the continent as well. The people in Boston were no more eager to recognize New York as their master than they were for London.The early union was all about balancing power between the states. We take for granted now that we are one united country, but it was far from a certainty back then. If the small states thought they would be totally overshadowed by the big states, then they wouldnt have been as eager to join the union. The senate and the electoral college are two of the compromises that came from this potential power imbalance. The small states were given an outsized voice when compared to population in the senate which flowed down to the electoral college.Another big shift from what we have now is that the original system was for each state to choose their electors and then let the electors decide who they wanted to vote for without an official vote from the population of their state, much like how the senate works now. -as an aside to the EC but still very relevant to this discussion, we originally did not elect our senators, the state legislatures would appoint senators to send to Washington. We started directly electing senators in 1913.-The idea was to have fairly direct democracy at the state level, but an indirect model at the federal level to balance between the states. The constitution was adopted and ratified.Very quickly, things changed. States did not want to trust their votes someone without a guarantee of who that person would vote for. The idea of un pledged electors that Hamilton had wanted so desperately was replaced by electors pledging their vote before being selected. Once one state started working this way, the others had to follow suite or give up electoral advantage. Hamilton tried to change this with an amendment, though it was much harder to change things by then, and he died while advocating for it. The states also realized quickly there was an inherent advantage in ensuring all of their electors voted the same way. This led to a more direct popular vote within each state and theyve been doing it that way since the 1830s.Over time, the union grew stronger and national identity began to outweigh state identity. The ramifications of this change were a huge contributing factor in the civil war.Were in a much different place now where its totally reasonable to ask why one vote should count for more than another. Its a conversation worth having, but its also important to know how we got here when discussing that. Our system is complicated with a lot of complicated history attached to it.I spent way too much time on this.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"Can we stop with this bs gotcha stuff please ?","title":"Kamala Harris tweet thanking Sean Diddy Combs resurfaces after his arrest in sex-trafficking case: Didnt age well"},{"text":"Thanks for reminding me I need to use my Republican congressmans email address on Pornhub.","title":"Kamala Harris Personal Popularity Is Surging.

To the extent anyone owns the country you have citizenship in, it is a handful of rich people and the government that serves them. *They* are the only ones who have the ability to arrange the country anywhere near the way you arrange your house.So the proper analogy isn't like someone moving into your house and planning to stay.

Moreover, it is known that Hezbollah was involved in the explosion  just like they were involved in the killing of Lebanons prime minister in 05  and the state of Lebanon cannot bring the Hezb perpetrators to justice. France knows all of this, and yet they continue on with the song and dance with Lebanon. Lebanon is in their third period without a president in the past twenty years. With the recent developments, they are sure to go 2+ years without a president. Macron did not even mention Hezbollah in his address. He did the #bothsides thing.

I think the truth is that he's still red hot and cannot bring himself to vote for children being maimed and mutilated. This is a dangerous thing to do because we need these votes so before the election I'm going to remind him what my grandma always used to say....voting isn't just a privilege, but an obligation, a duty. And I'm going to remind him that everything still stands when he voted for Trump in 2016 except we need his vote now more than ever....Trump is for the people and represents everything he stands for regardless of how he feels now!If this brings on an argument then I'll just consider it my patriotic duty!","title":"How Do You Deal With Trump Hating Family Members?"},{"text":"I think it's much cheaper to have a few security guys with her than to charter a private get with a few security guards.I'm a Trump supporter btw, and it seemed entirely reasonable.","title":"Nancy Pelosi spotted on UA5224"},{"text":"moo deng is a state of mind","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Hope is better than fear.

Lets break this down logically.On one hand, religious teachingswhether Christianity, Judaism, or othershave been part of cultural traditions for millennia, teaching values, ethics, and community. Parents have always had the right to pass down their faith, their worldview, to their children. Thats part of their freedom as parents.On the other hand, gender studies and intersectionalityconcepts far newer than most world religionsare being pushed aggressively in public schools. Kids are being taught that gender is fluid, that biological sex and gender are separate, and that identity is based on a complex web of power and oppression dynamics. In essence, its its own belief system, shaping how children view themselves and the world.If you support indoctrinating kids with gender theory but want to ban religion, youre not advocating for neutralityyoure promoting one ideology over another. Its selective moralizing. Youre comfortable with one type of belief but not the other, and thats the definition of hypocrisy.Freedom should work both ways. If parents can choose to introduce their kids to one set of values, they should be able to do the same with religion. To say otherwise is to admit that youre only interested in controlling what children are taught when it suits your ideology.","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for children to attend (and join) religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues etc."},{"text":"Its gaslighting.

My mom actually mentioned synchronicity as something very significant, and after reflecting on my experiences, it felt like this octopus of thought was reaching into multiple aspects of my life, almost as if my mind was trying to control or manipulate reality, but in a way that felt natural and interconnected, not forced.On psychedelics, the feeling was amplifiedmoments, thoughts, and coincidences seemed to align in a way that felt guided or influenced by something bigger. The octopus, with its many limbs, represents how these different threads of synchronicity reach out and connect disparate events, tying them together in ways that feel like they were meant to happen. It was a moment of realizing how thoughts, reality, and consciousness all loop back into each other, which is what the Inquiry is trying to explore.This way, youre tying in your personal experience with the symbolism behind the Purple Octopus, which goes beyond mind control and into the realm of synchronicity and deeper connections.","title":"The Purple Octopus Inquiry: A Self-Evolving Path to Bridging Human Consciousness and AI Through Dynamic Learning and Coding Feats"},{"text":"Translation: \\"Please click on my shitty product!\\"","title":"Kamala Harris vs. Donald Trump is the closest presidential race of the century\\n"},{"text":"Imagine going back in time and telling people that antisemitism still exists.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Amazing he stopped in at one of the plants making ammo for Ukraine to thank the workers.Hes so classy.

If fully developed, these areas have a potential capacity of approximately 13 gigawatts of clean offshore wind energy, which could power more than 4.5 million homes. The announcement follows the Departments recent announcement that it has approved more than 15 gigawatts of clean energy from offshore wind projects since the start of the Biden-Harris administration equivalent to half of the capacity needed to achieve President Bidens goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030.   Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the Department has held five offshore wind lease sales, including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and sales offshore the Pacific, Central Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico, and approved 10 commercial-scale offshore wind projects. Earlier this year, Secretary Haaland announced a schedule of potential additional lease sales through 2028.  \\n...  \\nThe Presidents Investing in America agenda is growing the American economy from the middle out and bottom up C from rebuilding our nations infrastructure, to driving over half a trillion dollars in new private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States, to creating good-paying jobs and building a clean energy economy that will combat the climate crisis and make our communities more resilient. Todays [September 16th] announcement is built upon the best available science, including the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Sciences ecosystem-based spatial suitability model, as well as over two years of extensive engagement with Tribes, fishing interests, and stakeholders across the region. Information gained through this engagement, including public comments, was instrumental in determining the final location, size and shape of the eight lease areas.  The area included in the Final Sale Notice (FSN) is approximately 120,000 acres less than what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) included in its Proposed Sale Notice, which was announced earlier this year. BOEM prioritized the avoidance of offshore fishing grounds, sensitive habitats, and existing and future vessel transit routes, while still retaining sufficient acreage to support the regions offshore wind energy goals.  The FSN for the Gulf of Maine auction includes details regarding the auction, provisions, and conditions of the leases, the lease form, information on bidding credits, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution. The FSN includes several lease stipulations designed to promote the development of a robust domestic U.S. supply chain for floating wind and create good-paying union jobs, advance flexibility in transmission planning, minimize habitat impacts, and collect data on protected marine mammals. The FSN will publish in the Federal Register on September 17, 2024.  \\n...Statement from Secretary Deb Haaland:The growing enthusiasm for the clean energy future is infectious. Todays announcement C which builds on the execution of the nations first floating offshore wind energy research lease in Maine last month C is the result of years of thoughtful coordination between our team, the Gulf of Maine states, industry and the Tribes and ocean users who share our interest in the health and longevity of our ocean, said Secretary Deb Haaland. The Biden-Harris administrations unwavering commitment to building a vibrant and sustainable offshore clean energy sector is strengthening our fight against the climate crisis and building a healthier, more resilient planet for generations to come.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces First Offshore Wind Lease Sale in the Gulf of Maine | Lease areas have potential to power over 4.5 million homes"},{"text":"I am literally amazed that Hillary is still walking around free, a textbook example of the Deep State","title":"Harris lies about Trump"},{"text":"Clearly the conspiracy is that she's on her way to deliver the anal beads around her neck to P Diddy","title":"Nancy Pelosi spotted on UA5224"},{"text":"Good job.

Actually, I cant speak for you. Im a persuasive and informed Democrat who is respected in my circle of friends, professional acquaintances, and families.

So I have to kind of poke around looking for my moments and basically I do this because I dont want to annoy people. Its kind of cowardly. I imagine transforming into someone who actively talks politics and campaigns. It wouldnt ruin my life at all. But I also think maybe I can get my 10% of one vote up to something like 1 vote. The answer to your question is simply go after the low hanging fruit. 1) get out and vote, durrr. Make your siblings and parents vote for Kamala or tell them not to vote if they like Trump. If you have little kids-ass cousins or old friends who do what you say, tell them to go vote, and really get up their butt about it, since these kiss-asses are probably lazy asses who will say they will vote but wont.When I was saying we can get 10% of a vote, I wasnt including the low hanging fruit. You can probably shake out 2-5 votes that way. Also if you live in Texas or a state that you think doesnt matter, dont use it as an excuse.

Moral?Foundations Theory generally holds that liberals view the individualizing foundations as more relevant to their understanding of morality as compared to conservatives, whereas conservatives view the binding foundations as more important than liberals do [14]. Substantial evidence supports these patterns. For example, Graham et al. [14] asked participants to indicate which particular moral concerns were most relevant to their sense of right and wrong. Stronger political conservatism was associated with stronger reported relevance of the binding foundations and with weaker reported relevance of the individualizing foundations. Similar patterns emerged in peoples reported (un)willingness to violate particular moral foundations for money: stronger political conservatism predicted decreased willingness to violate binding foundations and increased willingness to violate individualizing foundations. Subsequent studies have replicated the association between political identity and moral foundation preferences across large, geographically diverse samples [15]. Thus, the link between political identity and moral foundation preferences is generalizable across cultural contexts, rather than specific to any particular nation or culture.","title":"Liberals tend to show higher levels of empathy compared to conservatives ."},{"text":"Go read Civil Disobedience and come back with a mature comment.

It's not trying to convey anything, it's trying to simulate a hodgepodge of things various artists have previously tried to convey.  But this does not conflict with the idea of 'death of the author' which says that the artist's intentions shouldn't be the *ultimate* guide to meaning, not that it shouldn't be considered at all.  Obviously what an artist is attempting to convey with a work shapes the choices they make in how they create that work which influences the result and must necessarily have some influence on what people get from it.  What people get from AI art is mostly 'that's fucking weird because it's a Frankenstein's monster of parts glued together in unexpected ways' because there is no intentionality or logic behind how the parts are assembled.  I don't argue that AI art can never be art because I know better than to bet against technological progress, but today it is not, and that has nothing to do with 'death of the author'; the author isn't 'dead', they never existed in the first place.  If the Mona Lisa was 'accidentally' recreated by a computer that just randomized the color value for every pixel on a screen what that image be about?  Nothing, because it was not intentional.

Especially if the results either don't turn out the way they like, or the count takes longer than these fools now expect it to take...It reminds me of the last election when groups of unruly Trump supporters were congregating outside of one polling place chanting, \\"STOP THE COUNT,\\" and outside of a separate polling place in another county shouting, \\"COUNT THE VOTES.\\"What they really meant to say was \\"stop the count while Trump is ahead, and count the votes while he's behind.\\"In the words of a pretentious, hypocritical shitheel named Ben Shapiro, \\"facts don't care about your feelings\\" Trump supporters.These people feel so entitled, and so certain of the fact that if Donald Trump loses, the game must be rigged.

This irrational line of thinking is just fucking mind blowing.And the hypocrisy of it is baffling too. Like, imagine if Democrats decided unilaterally to change the rules of the game so close to the election. Imagine if Democrats had been implementing legislation and measures across the country for the part four years that amount to voter suppression and disenfranchisement.Imagine if the Democratic candidate has facilitated an attack on our Capitol. I mean, come the fuck on.Donald Trump is literally being indicted for conspiring to overturn an election, intimidate election officials, defraud the United States, disenfranchise 81 million Americans, and install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ to help him *steal* the election.While he's also just claimed that if he wins the presidency, he will jail, not investigate, but JAIL anyone who he has ever accused of \\"cheating.\\" Talk about persecuting your political opponents.The Republican party has exploited Trump's \\"big lie\\" to sow distrust in our election system, and enact Nation wide measures that amount to election subversion and interference.They're fighting their own made up claims of election fraud, with fucking election fraud!And in states like GA, they're also preparing to mount a formidable legal battle against Democrats if the results don't turn out the way they'd like.They're also giving conservative majority election boards the authority to contest the results if at any point, they believe that some discrepancy has occurred. In other words, if anything happens to conveniently arouse their suspicions, or seems \\"fishy\\", they can call into question the results.It's ass backwards... The fact is, Republicans have been setting up massive voter suppression and election subversion efforts in battleground states.

Collins wants Stefanik to have to own all of Trumps baggage since shes one of his most ardent supporters. And I think thats a good strategy.

There's a lot of misinformation going around right now about crime and migrants, and it's mostly bullshit. It's politically motivated and purposefully twisting the facts. Should a country be able to protect itself from foreign threats? Obviously the answer is yes. And we do. But are we just going to classify all migrants as threats? That's extreme. Are we going to gun down unarmed people? Are we going to threaten people at gunpoint with families who are refugees? Are we going to try and kill asylum seekers?Consider this. Tomorrow a war breaks out in your country and your entire neighborhood gets shelled. Your house is gone. You have nowhere to live. And your only choice is leave your home and go someplace else, or sit in an active war zone. But when you cross the border, either to another state, or another country, the people there are extremely hostile and tell you, \\"go back where you came from.\\" But you can't take your family back into an active war zone. What can you do? Where can you go? People are so up in arms about people coming from another place. But do you know their story? Do you know why they had to leave their homes? I think we all need a little more compassion and good will to our fellow humans. The facts are, migrants don't commit more crime than citizens. Migrants typically want to avoid trouble and don't break the law to avoid unwanted attention. I would be extremely wary of news stories getting angry about migrants and saying they are criminals. Because it's politically motivated. Every country has their own issues, and unique demographics and whatnot. But just speaking generally, anti-migrant propaganda is meant to divide people and create an easy enemy to use as a scapegoat. So I'm not saying to just ignore real issues. But I am saying we should 1) have more compassion for others and their plight. And 2) be extremely wary of anti-migrant propaganda and motivations for spreading it by political groups.","title":"CMV: Countries should use deadly force against illegal migrants much more frequently"},{"text":"Why anyone would post this to a public forum is beyond me.

Instead, Trump's administration was a hodgepodge of right-wingers and old-style Republicans.That has changed.  The personal cult of Trump still exists, but there is now a semi-independent MAGA structure along with it, solidified in \\"Project 2025.\\"  Its goal is far more ambitious than anything Trump's addled brain could conceive:\\"Purge or break the federal bureaucracy. Fill it with vetted loyalists. Then use its power to pass policy, yes, but also to break or conquer the other institutions in American life that so vex Trump and his supporters.\\"Trump and his supporters are furious that the surfacing of this agenda, due to Democratic efforts, has become such a drag on his campaign.  But he is inextricably tied to it, not least because Vance is deeply committed to it (as, in their own way, are the hard-right Catholic \\"post-liberals\\" of whom Vance is a member). This is what Republicanism post-Trump will look like.Although Klein doesn't discuss it, this situation outlines the future battlefield.  Once Trump himself is defeated, Democrats will have to focus on overcoming the institutionalized MAGA represented in \\"Project 2025\\" and its scores of supporting institutions.

There's already a Supreme-Court-approved policy this time around, all he has to do is reinstate it, rather than having his first and second attempts struck down like the last time.Weve already had Trumps America for four years. I didnt notice a difference in the reality of my life, nor in foreign policy. Vague threats of alternative conflicts dont really mean much to me.To the extent that's true, it's because he was incompetent, had no plans, and there were civil servants, foreign servants, and military service members, who put the Constitution and the law over Trump. Trump has learned that lesson, and already tried Schedule F at the end of his prior term so that he could fire those who stood in his way. He's not going to wait like 45 out of the 48 months he has in office this time around. The GOP has also been keeping military positions vacant and denying promotions, so that, conveniently for Trump if/when he takes office, they can be immediatel filled by loyalists in the military.Project 2025 is a roadmap for him, written by people who are smarter than he is. They're drafting Executive Orders for him to sign on Day One. They're drafting model legislation so it can be introduced in Congress on Day One. They're drafting lawsuits challenging laws they don't like so they can be challenged on Day One. They're taking applications and screening applicants for him so he can fire tens of thousand of federal employees and replace them with loyalists. He's been given immunity for official acts by the captured and corrupt majority on the Supreme Court.If you're looking at how Trump's first term went as justification to allow him a second term, then you simply haven't been paying attention.

The UN Charter of Human Rights (to which the US is a signatory) outlines that claiming refugee status or asylum from within national borders, without typical papers, is legal. It doesnt matter how often politicians use the terms illegals to broadly describe any person who has entered the country without normal papers and permissions. In at least some circumstances, that is a perfectly legal thing to do. The use of the term illegals is largely a propaganda tool grounded in a proven political tactic: an appeal to xenophobia. If you make someone scared of losing something they will vote for you due to [loss aversion](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/loss-aversion) (real or imaginary). [Every person has unconscious biases](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatouchtest.html) that require effort to modulate. We like ourselves best, want to hold our resources close, and we dont enjoy handing any of that to someone else (especially someone who is apparently not part of our immediate circle). Our evolutionary psychology tells us to distrust and dislike anyone different to us, but our more evolved and deliberate thinking tells us that it is fair and reasonable to sometimes share things to others. Thats why our mothers trained us to share toys when we were toddlers when our lizard brains just want to keep it to our selves. When it comes to our place inside the border of a wealthy nation, and a migrants place outside it, what virtue did you or I demonstrate in order to have that citizenship? In what way is it meritocratic for someone to claim ownership of a piece of a country by virtue of the place they were born? If, instead, we can view all human beings as being equally worthy of existence, we can begin to view borders with more nuance and pragmatism. In some cases we might need to be strict, in some cases more relaxed, but in no case (aside from military invasion) does it rise to the level of killing another person.","title":"CMV: Countries should use deadly force against illegal migrants much more frequently"},{"text":"Every state needs to be audited.

In most places, vigilantism is not broadly viewed as morally justified where a functioning state exists. Even if it were, theres a reasonably moral framework for proportionality, in that taking a human life for petty theft would be described as too heavy-handed. In the US, a cultural focus on individualism has helped propagate the idea that the only life that matters is my own, or those that I care about. In that light, if your actions give me permission to kill you to prevent any perceived disadvantage, Ill do so (if its legal). Just because that notion has been socialized across a whole culture doesnt make it inherently morally right. Especially if the same culture largely purports to hold the preservation of human life as sacrosanct (eg abortion access).
