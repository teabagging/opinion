And I agree that everyone that is capable of casting a ballot should take it seriously. But some people are single issue voters, that's okay. Some people vote party lines, and that is okay too. It's there vote they get to cast it how they want. That is how democracy works, to let everyone's voice be heard. That said, at least here in the US, there is one party that actively tries to reduce the number of people that vote through various means. Whether it is reducing the number of polling locations overall or in a given area. Or by scrubbing the voter registries of people that havent voted in previous elections, or by just making the process of registering overly difficult. For many people, you register to vote when you get your driver's license or renew your license from say a junior license for those under 18 to a standard license. This is also when young men submit their information for the Selective Service. But what happens to those who dont or cant drive? What about those that are exempt from selective service? What if you have moved and need to register in a new state or district and arent familiar with the voting registration in that area? What if you are a new citizen and need someone to explain the registration process in your native language? What about the single parent raising multiple children while working full time maybe even a part time job. And doesnt have the time in their day to pick up and submit their registration during business hours. The law says you have to be given time to cast your votes, but it doesnt say you need to be given time to actually register. Many voter drives are run by volunteer organizations that not only help people become registered, but also offer services to help people get to the polls, explain the voting process for their area and show them what a sample ballot looks like so they know how to cast their vote. Additionally, once someone has taken the time to register to vote, they are more likely to take the time to research the candidates and measures that may be on their ballots. By registering they have a reason and purpose to actively participate in the democratic process now that wasnt present prior. That being said, this county is filled with morons and unserious people. If theyre not voting on their own, why would I want them to vote just because someone on the street or at their door persuaded them to register.Why, because Democracy works best when everyone participates. And your thoughts towards people being less intelligent or unserious can lead to a slippery slope. Do we start requiring intelligence testing in order to vote? Do those people have less value? What other qualifiers should be placed on access to democracy? We have been down that road before. When one group of people was considered less than another group and their voice wasnt counted at all or minimized. No, everyone gets a vote, because everyone's vote matters with you agree with it or not.","title":"CMV: Voter turnout drives in the US are a bad idea."},{"text":"You suggest that this happening and that people are being practically forced to vote not just voting at all but to be told what to do.

He hasnt. ?\\nDuring the 2019 Election, he became the only PM since RB Bennett to win a first-term majority and then lose the popular vote in the subsequent election. Bennett earned that loss by failing to intervene in the Great Depression for 5 years. Trudeau had governed over a period of 4 years with global healthy economic growth. And he was up against Andrew Scheer, who isnt really that formidable of a politician.?The Liberals were polling in majority territory when they triggered a snap election in 2021. Within ~6 weeks they had lost tremendous support. The result of the 2021 election was once again historical, but for the wrong reasons. The Liberals formed a minority government with the lowest share of the popular vote in history.?Some other factors you need to consider are Canadian perceptions on the parties abilities to handle various subjects. Traditionally, the Liberals have been most trusted to handle healthcare issues, while the Conservatives were not. If you flip the parties then the same is true for matters on the economy and fiscal responsibility.So the Liberals got a bump during the Pandemic. They took on enormous debt and ballooned the deficit (they had done this before the pandemic as well, which hurt them). As the health crisis subsided, inflation hiked, the economy staggered, and debt charges went up. This is a scenario that traditionally favours the Conservatives and hurts the Liberals.Another factor to bring up is the creation of the first ever federal confidence and supply agreement (CASA) between the Liberals and NDP. This gives the former a *de facto* majority government. Minority governments last on average for 2 years. Were essentially 3 years into this one. Contextually, the Parliamentary sessions since 21 have been noticeably hostile and dysfunctional. Without a CASA, this government would have collapsed years ago.The truth is that Justin Trudeau post ~2018 has been an immensely controversial PM on a personal level. Canadians really do not like him that much, though diehard Liberals love him. His personal approval rating from the latest polls is -33. By comparison, Jagmeet Singh is at -3 and Pierre Poilievre is at +7.?","title":"Im not going anywhere: Justin Trudeau says he wont resign if Liberals lose Montreal byelection"},{"text":"And a lot of dumb Clinton voters still stayed home while a lot of dumb trump voters showed up","title":"CMV: Voter turnout drives in the US are a bad idea."},{"text":"None of this is true","title":"Joe Biden Wore Trump Hat in Shanksville as Show of 9/11 Unity, White House Says"},{"text":"Everything I see about her makes me love her all the more.","title":"Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Yes thank you this is worded better than my argument but perfectly in line with it.","title":"CMV: Voter turnout drives in the US are a bad idea."},{"text":"I agree.

The media focused on messaging that the mask protects the wearer, but that's not really the case as much, as people struggled to debate this back &amp; forth. What studies and the history of mask wearing in medical industries has more clearly shown, is that basic masks are most effective at preventing the infected from spreading the virus through spit, sneezing &amp; coughing.The push for mask use by everyone was supposed to prevent asymptomatic, or early stage carriers from unknowingly spreading the virus. The evidence that masks helped the healthy wearer stay healthy was always more specious and effect was more minor. It's just a muuuuuch harder sell to Americans to tell them \\"All you people who think you're healthy must wear a mask to protect others in case you don't know you're sick\\", which is sound practice, but asks a lot of people who simply couldn't be arsed and are convinced they'd know if they're sick or not. I honestly don't think the prominant \\"masks protect the wearer\\" message was a lie being intentionally spread, but just what happened when a lot of laymen in the media didn't understand things that they were reporting on.

MAGAs politics are reactionary grievance politics driven by fear mongering and resentment for others. People who want to transition arent a political issue, gay people arent a political issue, migrants themselves arent the issue. MAGA cant see through the hatred and anger they have in order to assemble any coherent policy ideas, hence why Trump ever only has concepts of a plan and couldnt get any major legislation passed while in office. The political ideology behind MAGA is so fluid that its constantly changing from day to day to keep up with what essentially end up being internet trends within the right wing echo chamber.The Republican Party as it has been known is dead. Id love to see MAGA create their own party and let the level headed conservatives still left get to revamp and re-launch the Republican Party so to speak. Ive voted Republican in the past as I do share some conservative viewpoints but tend to lean a bit left from center. MAGA is an entirely different thing and I dont view them as a serious political party. I think its more of a cult of personality born out of disenfranchisement and resentment.

If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.Recently I was made aware that AI of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades.Ive done my research, and Ive made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!

The announcement comes as the Administration has released new data to demonstrate how the historic steps it has taken to accelerate and improve federal permitting processes are helping deliver more projects, more efficiently, across the United States.The Departments Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is finalizing two projects and moving forward two more that will advance new transmission lines and solar facilities across the state, helping deliver clean, reliable energy from the Nevada desert to the Western electric grid and creating jobs for union workers. The two projects receiving approval C the Greenlink West Transmission Project and Libra Solar Project C will unlock up to 4.7 gigawatts of clean energy, enough to power nearly 5 million homes.  \\n...  \\nSince the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the BLM has approved 41 renewable energy projects on public lands (10 solar, 13 geothermal, and 18 gen-ties), allowing for early achievement of the goal to permit 25 gigawatts by 2025. Leaders have also celebrated the groundbreakings of the TransWest Express Transmission Project, Ten West Link, and the SunZia Transmission Project, with Greenlink West becoming the fourth approval during this Administration. With todays announced progress, the BLM has now permitted enough clean energy projects on public lands to power over 12.5 million homes and is currently processing another 55 utility-scale project proposals across the West.  \\n...  \\nEarlier this year, the Department issued a final Renewable Energy Rule that will lower consumer energy prices and the cost of developing solar and wind projects, improve project application processes, and incentivize developers to continue responsibly developing solar and wind projects on public lands. The BLM also released a proposed updated Western Solar Plan last month, which offers a roadmap for solar energy development on public lands and expansion of efficient and environmentally responsible solar project permitting across the West.President Bidens Investing in America agenda is growing the American economy from the middle out and bottom up C from rebuilding our nations infrastructure, to driving over half a trillion dollars in new private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States, to creating good-paying jobs and building a clean energy economy that will combat the climate crisis and make our communities more resilient.  \\n...  Quick progress overview of each project is in the press release, each also contains a link to the project for more information. Statement from White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi:Under President Biden and Vice President Harriss leadership, we are making critical investments to both strengthen our grid and feed more clean energy to homes and businesses C which will create good-paying union jobs, bolster resiliency, strengthen energy security, and lower Americans utility bills, said White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. In Nevada and across the country, our leaps forward to efficiently permit wind, solar, transmission, and other clean energy projects are part of a broader strategy to lead the world in the global clean energy race and the fight against pollution C all while protecting our communities and investing in local economies.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Leaders Announce New Onshore Renewable Energy Progress in Nevada to Create Jobs and Lower Energy Costs | Greenlink transmission lines, multiple solar facilities move toward completion"},{"text":"the reason is because the vaccine was made with nRNA, and the protection from such wanes over time because your body stops making it after a while. \\n\\"so how do you reconcile this\\" with a basic understanding of science. immunity debt on the other hand, refers to the thought that the immune system is like a muscle and needs to be repeatedly \\"used\\" in order to stay strong. that has been disproven","title":"CMV: Everyone should still be wearing masks"},{"text":"I cant understand an informed person voting for Trump.

At one point, she was banned from Twitter before Elon bought it, and she chained herself to the door. It was 100% just a PR stunt and back then she wasn't popular so left AND right mocked her. I'm sure if some Democrat promised her riches, she would've switched sides too back then.But once you go too deep, and become too racist, you are stuck on that side and the only path is to go nuclear and hope something happens. In her case, she became Trump's bestie/side girl/who knows. It is actually a super successful story for Loomer, I'm sure she's living her dream right now.The saddest part about Loomer is like many grifters, she has this background that's super unstable. I believe she was hospitalized in a psych ward a few times and in general just really had major issues. But the Internet gave her a lot of attention the more \\"pick me\\" she got toward Republicans, going in the center then right then fascist.It's a path many have taken and it almost always starts the same way. They aren't getting attention being liberal or moderate, so they slowly adapt to more and more weird things. Pretty soon they have gone nuclear weird.

[https://theatln.tc/yrS4RNPk](https://theatln.tc/yrS4RNPk)?I cringed, Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of the left-wing group Our Revolution, told me. At the end of the day, Im not sure progressives want Democrats to be that big-tent.The 83-year-old former vice president and his daughter Liz Cheney, the former representative from Wyoming, are now the most prominent of more than 200 former GOP officials to back the Democratic nominee. (Another Bush-era bogeyman of Democrats, former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, joined them on Thursday.) In his statement last week saying he would vote for Harris, Dick Cheney described her opponent in even graver terms than he once used against Democrats. Donald Trump, the elder Cheney said, can never be trusted with power again.On one level, this clearly helps Harris. During the debate, she was able to use the Cheney endorsements as part of a broader effort to rebut Republican attacks that shes too far left for moderate voters. (Her pledges to support fracking and boost small businesses came in the same vein.)

This started with Reagan and Thatcher and culminated under Barack Obama and David Cameron.  \\nNow the middle class seems to feel we went to far and the result has been a period of political instability like we saw in the 1970s while the middle class reassess things.

In that instance it's easy for a Dictatorship to harness all the forces of the country and focus them on copying the rest of the world as fast as possible.   \\nThat's usually the appeal of regimes like China, but that only works when you're far enough behind everyone that you're walking on well-trodden paths, and we're already seeing the Chinese model hit a brick wall.  \\nFurthermore, countries like France, achieved the exact same kind of Great Projects (Nuclear, Hydro, Highways, Housing, ...) after WW2 while maintaining significantly freer institutions than China, so it's not even clear that Dictatorship helps in that regards.Your main issue when comparing Democracy with Dictatorship is that you rightfully point out that politicians only care about the next 5 years and can't plan properly, ... they shouldn't, it's not their job. They exist to be the reflection of the people's will at any given time, not to usher in a new thousand year reign for mankind like Revolutionary Dictatorship love to claim.   \\nIt is not even an issue of planning, it merely is an issue of what people want.  \\nDemocracies are just as capable of planning for something as Dictatorship, probably even more so.

Are we supposed to consider every single public figure perfect. No one can criticize any public figure ever, especially our representatives.  We can only praise them effusively otherwise we are haters. I've spent so many days on this sub and read so many incredible conversations and takes on the different aspects of the elections.  But the fact that one tiny criticism of kamala, more of a suggestion that could potentially win her more voters is met with ummm this much craziness is strange. Crazy way to live where only completely blind worship is allowed. Read this article below: For this interview new york times interviews regular people, working class people, many POC on how they feel about homelessness and increasing migration in the city. These people are potential voters and as late as August they were angry and resentful. I know kamala made that point about Donald trump killing the bipartisan bill but it's not enough as this is an issue that is being consistently pressed upon by the opposite side- giving people more clarity on her exact policy would help build trust. For you and me who are inclined to vote for her, this trust building is not necessary but for many others, it is. Even a line about how she plans to ensure more stringent border checks and criminal background checks or that is she is aware that because of the violence and gang infested regions some of these immigrants are escaping from, it has been impossible for ICE to do proper background checks (cuz the governments are failing and it becomes impossible for the border control agents to get that information from those countries- is this not a valid loophole that should be addressed via policy. I've found just the word immigrant is such a lightning rod on this sub that any kind of reasonable discussion is impossible. It would be in Kamala's favor to adress this because a) it is an issue that is going to be brought up by trump till the very end b) it hurts the immigrant who are innocent like the haitians c) it further boosts Kamala's credibility as a tough on crime person and d) it will address the issues of the independent who feel her policies are vague. I feel her economic policies are well laid out but her immigration policy is non existent. This is not me saying Donald trump is such a great guy. Im saying simply that when this is one of those issues that trump is using to poison voters and paint her as an incompetent and weak, why not lay it all out clearly to ensure she does have a plan and she takes the issue seriously. Really drill it home.Feel free to downvote this too if this makes your day happier. :) peace \\n \\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/migrants-homeless-encampment-nyc.html#:~:text=The%20migrant%20crisis%20has%20persisted,shelter%20system%20since%20early%202022.https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/migrants-homeless-encampment-nyc.html#:~:text=The%20migrant%20crisis%20has%20persisted,shelter%20system%20since%20early%202022.","title":"Buttigieg: Trump and Vance demonizing immigrants to distract from their record"},{"text":"Fatty made ethnicity an issue, hon.

All new hires and transfers to this Department will be screened for loyalty to Trump and be fully at-will. \\n2. Evaluate the backgrounds of every general in the military. If their social media profiles and activities give off a whiff that they are not sympathetic or supportive of Trump, fire them and replace them with people potentially more subservient to Trump. \\n3. If there are protests against the government, put them down with force and have the Department of State Security charge these people with terrorism. Ideally get their cases in front of judges who were appointed by Trump and known to be sympathetic to Trump. Perhaps the juries may not end up convicting these protesters of terrorism but just going through the legal process and being threatened with prison may make most people think twice about partaking. \\n4. Investigate prominent opposition politicians if they talk or act against the administration too much. Use criminal investigations and legal processes to harass said opponents and diminish their potential even if judges toss out such cases. \\n5. When the 2028 election comes up, declare a national emergency and say that federal elections cannot safely be held at this time.

There's a ton of other stuff being learned in college, especially in the first two years (which is why community/junior colleges are often the better choice for gen ed courses).

A college education is supposed to make you a more knowledgable and well rounded person, not just a technician.But IT jobs don't need all of that, they just need competent technicians.

I always thought that was ridiculous. Outside of a relatively marginal sphere of extreme feminists, modern liberal society isn't like that in my experience. Being a young person from a middle class cosmopolitan background who studied in places like London among a very liberal/left-leaning environment of progressive young people including young women, I'd never felt that men or masculinity were broadly attacked. Sure, there's been a turn against things classed as 'toxic masculinity', but there isn't a broad dislike of male-coded things. Nobody's gonna think less of you because you like football or other team sports, or you go to the gym to try to get physically strong, or you're into cars or something. These are all seen either positively or at least neutrally.But maybe the way you frame it makes more sense in my mind now. It's not that liberal society actively attacks men, which I think is very hyperbolic, but perhaps as you say that it doesn't *appear* to offer something *specifically for* men, if I'm understanding you correctly. There isn't a kind of celebration of specifically male-coded attributes. Personally, this doesn't matter to me. I don't really feel like I need my masculinity affirmed by celebrations of it, I'm comfortable being a man but also being into some more stereotypically feminine things, because just from experience I know overally my personality leans more towards that of other guys on average than girls, that's just who I am and I don't feel a tribal affiliation to my gender. But maybe it matters to some people, I don't know.","title":"Exploring Young Women's Leftward Expansion.

Classes are more self-directed, and you have discussions with people from far more diverse walks of life than you could ever experience in your local high school.

The government had to create tons of new money and hand it out to business and even invididual people in the form of PPP loans and stimulus checks so that businesses wouldnt fail and people could survive.The sudden influx of all this new money into the economy, together with production capacity shrinking because of covid restrictions and some would say corporate greed made the prices of things go up (inflation).The fed, in order to combat inflation, raised interest rates in an attempt to keep people from spending money, so that prices could fall. This process can take years to complete.After years of raising rates to combat inflation, they are FINALLY at a point where inflation is slowing down and they can now begin to lower interest rates.This is where we are now. The printing of money was a necessary evil because of the impact of the shutdowns during covid, but now that things are stabilizing, the economy should go back to equilibrium with acceptable levels of inflation.The president does not control the Fed and their decisions to print money, raise or reduce rates.Now as far as cost of living in Florida, that is another can of worms. In my experience that is caused by five main things: 1) People from blue states moving here during the pandemic because they were attracted to Desantis anti-lockdown stance.2) People moving here from all over now that they can work remotely after Zoom meetings became normalized.3) The lack of land that can be developed due to there being ocean in one side and the everglades on the other (at least in so flo).4) Corporations knowing land is in short supply buying up homes as investment vehicles.5) Storm related insurance going through the roof (pun intended) because of climate change and the area becoming more prone to flooding and devastating storms.Just my take on things.

You don't need to tweak the matchmaking process, with all the problems that may cause, especially in higher elo.

Every game they abandon as white increases it by one, abandoning as black decreases it by one. Completing a game does the opposite, but only if it moves you towards zero. The player with the highest bias score gets assigned white. With equal scores, it's assigned randomly as normal. For normal players that don't abandon games, nothing changes. They still get a random color unless matched with someone who abandoned, which probably won't be noticeable if the number of offending players is low enough.For players that do abandon games, it makes it so they can't dodge a color by abandoning, unless they happen to match with a worse offender.

Therefore advocating for masking among the general population now means masking indefinitely.I see two major concerns:If we significantly slow the spread of infectious disease through masking, we change pattern of when and how we get ill. If I get the flu for the first time in my life at 20, is it different than getting it as a toddler? How do the common cold coronaviruses affect a naive adult immune system? Would it look more like Covid?(This is why the chickenpox vaccine isnt recommended in countries who dont have the infrastructure to vaccinate *everyone.* You absolutely dont want to get the disease as an adult.) We havent studied this (because we really cant) and dont know the answer.The second concern is social. When I wore masks from 2020-2022 it absolutely made it harder for me to read expressions and created a feeling of distance between me and those I interacted with. Wearing PPE in social situations gives people the feeling that those around them are a threat. If its unsafe to be around other people, why not just stay home?

Both are against life. I cant decide; **Im not American and wont go to vote there**. But let it be clear: denying migrants the ability to work and receive hospitality is a sin, a grave sin. The Old Testament speaks repeatedly of the orphan, the widow, and the strangermigrants. These are the three that Israel must care for. Failing to care for migrants is a sin, a sin against life and humanity.  \\nI celebrated Mass at the border, near the diocese of El Paso. There were many shoes from migrants, who ended poorly there. Today, there is a flow of migration within Central America, and many times they are treated like slaves because people take advantage of the situation. Migration is a right, and it was already present in Sacred Scripture and in the Old Testament. The stranger, the orphan, and the widowdo not forget this.  \\nThen, abortion. Science says that at one month after conception, all the organs of a human being are present. Everything. Having an abortion is killing a human being. Whether you like the word or not, its murder. The Church is not closed-minded because it forbids abortion; the Church forbids abortion because it kills. It is murder; it is murder!\\nAnd we need to be clear about this: sending migrants away, not allowing them to grow, not letting them have life is something wrong, it is cruelty. Sending a child away from the womb of the mother is murder because there is life.  And we must speak clearly about these things. No, but however... No but however. Both things are clear. The orphan, the stranger, and the widowdo not forget this.   *In your opinion, Your Holiness, are there circumstances in which it is morally permissible to vote for a candidate who is in favor of abortion?*  \\nIn political morality, it is generally said that **not voting is ugly, its not good. One must vote. And one must choose the lesser evil. Which is the lesser evil? That lady or that gentleman? I dont know; each person must think and decide according to their own conscience**.","title":"Pope Francis says Kamala Harris and Donald Trump \\"both against life\\" for stances on abortion, immigration"},{"text":"- Catholicism believes the deliberate killing of an innocent human being has to be illegal.  \\nWe cant say infanticide is immoral but can be legal so we cant also say abortion is immoral but can be legal.\\n- Even if contraception did reduce abortion  which I dont believe  that wouldnt mean we should support it (giving child p0rn to ped0philes isnt correct even if it lowered ped0philia).","title":"Pope Francis says Kamala Harris and Donald Trump \\"both against life\\" for stances on abortion, immigration"},{"text":"I have a friend who reposts those McEntee videos and they are the most disingenuous bullshit I've seen.

Though - such as in the case of the Military, CIA or FBI, often it seems the tail is wagging the dog and the two-party system serves the institutional interests. Their interests are not served by third party challenges.Also, naturally, the parties are fueled by funding and this leads to a great deal of private institutions and industries - like banking and investing or oil companies - that are outside government but have a much greater influence on the form and function of the government. They also like having simply two parties to play off of each other.As a result, third parties often have leaders that are less politically-savvy, less organized and not as administratively competent and more bereft of infrastructure or money than the major parties. Then, if any third party does get traction, it usually is because it was either formed by some wing or powerful members of one of the major parties and is not legitimately a third party or it will eventually be merged into one of the major parties that it most closely resembles on the arbitrary left-right scale.Essentially, United States government seems to fall prey to the same problems that its corporately dominated industries. To be completely honest, many of the major third parties are guilty of the claims of naivet, incompetence and unattractive-to-voters elements of which the major parties accuse them, and they are basically a destructive rather than creative force in American politics. However, much of that is due to the major parties rigging the system so that will be the case.","title":"The \\"Two party dichotomy\\" is the reason we are here today."},{"text":"Why does the CIA want to plunge us into the perverse?","title":"Hollywood is controlled by the CIA with the purpose plunging society into the perverse."},{"text":"No need for them to embrace it.

Kamala should address this and make sure people know that she intends to create more stringent background checks and plans to help ICE. This is the only semi lucid and practical thing that Trump suggested (background checks). And instead of political bullshitting, it would do well for Kamala to adress the elephant in the room. I say this as someone who wants her to win but the violence by some immigrants is sometimes under addressed and minimised by Democrats. They cannot be this cavalier about these crimes..there ARE Venezuelan gangs entering the country- how were they allowed in. Why is ICE struggling to do proper background checks, why is the agency so underfunded and inefficient. It is possible to not be toxic and anti immigrant while suggesting ways to curtail violence perpetuated by some of these criminals and strengthen the border policies. I know the bipartisan bill failed because of trump but since he is the one now raising the immigration issue everywhere, it would be prudent for kamala to address it.

Stability, Civil Service protections and the paid leave and retirement benefits that come with government jobs are worth something.   I work as a government lawyer. I don't think anyone in my office expects to make an equivalent salary to what they could make in the private sector. But the salary has to be close enough for the conditions to make up the difference. Otherwise you can't recruit quality people.   If we are talking about an entry level job being $70k a year versus 75 or 80 that they could make in the private sector, it's easy for me to talk up the benefits. If we're talking about the entry level pay being $70k, and the private sector competition is offering $100k, it's a whole lot harder. ( although it may be worth noting in this context that an appointed federal district judge makes about the same income as a third year biglaw associate)  If we talk about the kind of jobs Harris is probably talking about we are probably talking about basic office jobs. Many of the listings for those jobs ask for a bachelor's degree today.  I'm not necessarily sure that's required. Although it's a case-by-case thing. And I think it's worth noting that someone or many government jobs have no private sector equivalent. What's the private sector equivalent to a park ranger?  The upper level post reference to the \\" you get paid in sunsets\\" line that the park service used to push, but the reality is if the park service is paying $15 an hour for a job, the promise of outdoor work and a pretty setting isn't going to help them recruit if people can make $22 an hour working at home depot.","title":"Kamala Harris says she will cut degree requirements for certain federal jobs"},{"text":"I have heard that a few times.","title":"Anthony Blinkens Connection To Jeffery Epstein."},{"text":"I will defend him because all of you are just agists.

If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.Recently I was made aware that AI of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades.Ive done my research, and Ive made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!

Lengthy anecdote ahead:My Engineering graphics and design (CAD) professor posted the entire course online over the summer and I immediately started working through the material because I didnt want to be caught with my pants down coming into the course with no experience. I did half the homework over the summer and have all the drawings ready to be handed in on my hard drive.Yesterday we were doing one of those early assignments together in class. I started from scratch and went through and did the assignment again with a minimum of difficulty.  Took me about 5 minutes with a little bit of head scratching and a minimum of cursing.  The kid sitting next to me was like hey I thought you already did all these? Cant you just turn the ones in you did over the summer? While he and his friends goofed off changing the landscape and textures of their extruded part instead of actually learning how to use the hideously expensive tools were given. I told him that yeah I probably could but these are foundational things that Id rather do over and over until I master them than do it once as a good enough and move on to the next thing.

He also managed to reorient fossil fuel powers to the US after the start of the Ukraine war while dealing with all of the other issues. The media chose to go from covering covid deaths to the likliness of a recession and inflation numbers without ever covering the actual state of things. I believe Biden accomplishing an economic miracle and only having the effects he couldn't fix immediately covered is one of the greatest media failings ever.

Before Bush-Cheney, Democrats made themselves over in the image of Republicans. Follow the money. Not from Deep Throat, but from the screenplay for *All the President's Men*. But don't forget power, esp. the Presidency.  Money and the Presidency both make politicians drool, it seems.https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1d1sxuu/ockhams_razor_selfinterest_in_increasing_wealth/Here ends the TL; DrEach of Democrats and Republicans have acted in their own respective self-interest all along. We could start with the lucrative slave trade, which Democrats backed, Republicans, who saw an opportunity to defeat Democrats; the  Civil War and the Great Migration.  https://old.reddit.com/r/FakeProgressives/comments/fwfwg9/maybe_the_entire_democratic_party_is/; https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/nrboij/the_great_migration_and_us_politics/All those were massive influences on US politics, esp. the Democrat Party. However, let's skip right over to, say, the 1950s.Us factories are booming post-war, in part because the war knocked out German and Japanese factories; and, in part, because of demand pent up since the Great Depression, when money was scarce, through WWII, when factories were converted to war production. The factory boom, which started during WWII helps unions \\"boom,\\" as well.Unions are the single largest source of money for Democrats, so, surprise! Democrats are pro-union, which makes them seem pro-worker.  Republicans have been cosy with bankers and wealthy folk since Reconstruction ended. Nonetheless, from 1860 until FDR is elected, Republicans have a near lock on the Oval Office. Along come lobbyists. Along comes union busting. Over time, that union money stops looking as good to Democrats as it once did. And it continues to diminish with offshoring.Now, we're in the 1970s. Some Democrat pols are saying publicly that employer money would be nice (too?) Real buying power of wages ceases its growth spurt. Now, it's 1980, and Carter's  administration is ending. The head of the DNC sends a memo to Democrats in the House and Senate, telling them to see if they can't get some of that nice money that Republican pols have been getting. Of course, also in 1980, unabashedly anti-government, pro-big business former Democrat, former show business stalwart, Governor Reagan, wins the Presidential election.  Between Democrats' directive to go after the same money Republicans have been getting and Reagan's arrival in DC, DC lobbyists proliferate \\"exponentially,\\" as one author put it.Money and the Presidency.  I'm sure stuff leading up to incorporation of the Democrat Leadership Council happened before its actual incorporation in 1985, with one William Jefferson Clinton as its first President. Al From, supposedly THE mover and shaker of the DLC, claimed that he wooed Bubba with a promise of the US Presidency.   Later, of course, Clinton becomes the first New Democrat President of the US.  https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/recruiting-bill-clinton/281946/Founding members of the DLC include one Hillary Rodham (or whatever name she was using then) as its only female member. Aside from Hillary and Connecticut's Lieberman, all founding members are white male Southerners with Presidential aspirations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council  Of course, the once Democrat Solid South is by then solidly RepublicanDuring Clinton's presidency, Al From and Hillary and the Clintons make efforts to turn Europe neolib as well.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_From; https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/114l8zp/the_alt_neoliberalcon_world_missionaries/And the rest, as they say, is history.PS Starting with Wilson, at least, Democrats took the initiative with wars and there are no *eyeroll* progressives in office to oust. \\"Harm reduction\\" another *eyeroll*  \\"Pragmatism\\" third \\"eyeroll\\"","title":"How the Republicans Remade the Democratic Party In Their Own Image"},{"text":"acute severe outcomes from SARS-2 is rare, however: long covidedit: spelling","title":"CMV: Everyone should still be wearing masks"},{"text":"When black people were walking streets with guns. ??\\"There's no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons,\\" Ronald 'shitmypants' Reagan","title":"Kamala Harris talks assault-weapons ban and tax relief in Pennsylvania stop"},{"text":"His taste in women seems to be declining, and I legitimately ask... is his eyesight getting worse?

Project 2025 is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President unilateral powers, strip civil rights, worker protections, climate regulation, add religion into policy, outlaw porn and much more. The MFL has been around since 1980, Reagan implemented 60% of its recommendations, Trump 64% - proof. 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge hell likely get past 2/3rds adoption.The Heritage Foundation already writes bills for Republicans to submit. Thats how there have been over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills submitted to states since January 1st, 2024. Theyre the ones writing these bills and getting the GOP to pass them. They were also the ones who wrote Texass pornography ID law that was passed. They have been behind abortion, contraception, and anti-drug laws, too. And Harrison Butker? They were the ones who sponsored him up on stage as Butker works with them frequently. And lets not also forget that The Heritage Foundation has frequent confrences that showers GOP politicians with lavish gifts while teaching them how to create right-wing propaganda and craft bills against LGBTQ+ people, abortion, and everything else.There is no might. It will happen. The Heritage Foundation controls the GOP.Theres always a right-winger trying to make people think Project 2025 is no big deal. No, its not just a think tank, its The Heritage Foundation. They have massive influence over right-wing politicians. Ronald Reagan took direction from them, and Donald Trump let them pick his administration. Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, and Jeff Sessions were some of the people they picked.Back in 2022, The Heritage Foundation completely reversed its position on helping Ukraine. Most Republicans followed suit. They have a lot of power and a lot of Republicans licking their boots.

It actually ended up being the opposite effect and Streisand them. Before the ban, assault weapons were some of the least purchased guns, after it was lifted their sales skyrocketed.I put assault weapon in quotes as that is just a legal term in whatever the current bill is, and each state has slightly different definition for it. All of which are just based on cosmetics of the guns, and not how the actual gun functions. Though some have called out specific gun frames, it is largely meaningless. Like, I can have a pistol, but as soon as you attach a vertical grip to that pistol it is now an assault weapon. Even the federal AWB under Clinton made exceptions where the mini-14 was not considered an assault weapon. It was just as much of a center fire semi-automatic rifle firing similar rounds as an AR-15, but because it looked like a more typical bolt action rifle, it was exempt (no collapsible stock, no vertical handle, etc).Edit: Will also add - due to the proliferation of center fire semi-automatic rifles since the federal AWB was lifted. Any new federal AWB that tries to ban all center fire semi-automatic rifles WILL be struck down by the current Supreme Court. As it would fail the current tests that they have put in place. Starting from the handgun ban in DC was struck down in Heller. If you dont ban all semi-automatic center fire rifles with an AWB, then it becomes pointless as people will just shift to the guns that arnt banned. Not to mention any new law would likely grandfather in all current assault weapons, as the U.S. does not force buybacks.

He was a Rhodes scholar and often called the explainer in chief because he could take complex information and explain it in a way everyone understood. He appealed to a lot of different demographics. He was normal, he was a democratic country boy from deep red Arkansas. He felt in some ways like a normal person who uses their skills and made it to the top. He championed the black community, he banned assault rifles and gun violence went down, he did a lot to help our education system, his economic plans massively helped the middle class (Kamalas plan is similar in many ways). He appointed many women to roles in our government for the first time, he came and inherited a huge budget deficit and balanced the books to not only pay it off but create a surplus of over 300 million by the time he left office. He is the last president to date to leave office with a budget surplus. He preserved national land/parks and monuments, was aware of climate change and worked to help combat that (Al Gore was his VP). he signed the violence against women act to further protect victims of DV and SA. He got family and medical leave for people. A child tax credit (another thing Kamala has vowed to expand further) He was supportive of LGBTQ+ rights and active in the fight against aids. He even tried to get us national healthcare. He took office after bush #1 and turned all his mess around and America really prospered under his presidency.He was smart. He was so charismatic and likable. He was even cool compared to most prior presidents. He appealed to people as both a talented politician capable of running the country but also as a president who played his saxophone on late night talk shows and who went to Macdonalds so often in his career that the store he frequented in Little Rock has a plaque thanking him for his buisness (and there is a funny SNL skit). He was a never met a stranger type guy who would take the time to talk to the public and give them his full attention. During the 90s he was so different and normal and relatable compared to most politicians. If you do a deep dive on him, he is a really interesting person and politician. Did he always get it rightno. He absolutely made mistakes too but he did a lot of good for our country overall and thats why a lot of people (boomers and up especially) who were adults at that time still feel a great fondness for him. Having him on the campaign is not only a great sign of all living and able democratic former presidents supporting Kamala but also important because Bill could impact some of the demographics or appeal to different types of voters. He is also just a great speaker and good with facts so he might be able to get through to some of the undecided voters and sway them or help them understand what Kamala plans to do in a way they understand. https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-01.html","title":"Obamas and Clintons to hit the campaign trail for Harris in the final stretch"},{"text":"Oh I remember this.

At different times and in different combinations, Niem?ller listed: communists, socialists, trade unionists, Jews, people with mental and physical disabilities, and Jehovahs Witnesses. Some printed versions of the quote include Protestants and Catholics in the list of victims. Given the history of the Nazi regime and Niem?llers personal experiences, it was highly unlikely that he included either group in his confession of complicity. In his post-war lectures, Niem?ller specifically focused on groups that the Nazis targeted prior to his arrest in 1937, and for whom he could have advocated in the 1930s, but did not.Regardless of his exact words, Niem?llers message remained consistent: he declared that through silence, indifference, and inaction, Germans had been complicit in the Nazi imprisonment, persecution, and murder of millions of people. He felt that it was particularly egregious that he and other German Protestant church leaders, whom he believed had positions of moral authority, chose to remain silent.","title":"'No place in America': Biden says narrative about Haitian immigrants 'simply wrong'"},{"text":"They need worker bees to serve them and slave away in their corporations and to keep being the little cogs in the system they've created.We are sub human to them.

Suppose that a FERS-FRAE (the 4.4% people) pays $50K in pension contributions and retires with a pension. Suppose further that they are expected to live 25 more years. This allows them to take an adjustment to income of $2000 per year to reduce the taxable pension. If they don't live the full 25 years, their estate can take the undeducted  pension contribution as a miscellaneous deduction. I would prefer being able to take the undeducted balance as an adjustment to income.You have to work at least five years (five years of creditable service is the way that it is usually said because the five years of service doesn't need to be continuous) to qualify for a pension under FERS. If you work less than 5 years, in total, you have two choices: have your pension contribtutions refunded or leave them in the pkln in case you return to federal serveice at a later date.

The same is true for the Euro, the Yen, and every other global currency.   We had a global pandemic that messed up supply chains and caused global inflation.  The USA recovered stronger and faster than all the others (partly due to to strong immigration, but I digress), but the fact remains that we had high inflation for a number of years and prices are higher.  So, while turning the clock 4 years, or 40, or 140, would make a dollar buy more, that really isnt a plan.  At least, its not a plan either candidate can offer.  Time moves forward. So where do we go from here?  Trumps plan is to deport 21 million people (equivalent to the population of Florida), add a 20% tax on all imported goods (causing a massive and death trade war), and lobotomies the federal government.  The economic forecast for all of this is grim. Really grim.  If you thought the pandemic economy was bad youre going to hate what Trump is planning to do.  Harris isnt proposing anything wild or bold like that.  I wish she was.  Id like to see some tax code changes that would disincentivize the runaway wealth transfer up that we have been enduring for more than 40 years.  Wealth inequality is worse today than it was the roaring 20s. Her plan is to keep things stable and continue the recovery.  Inflation is almost down to the 2% target level, unemployment is low, and so on.  The things she is proposing are small, common-sense changes that will help the working and middle classes. So our choice moving forward is either a fiscal Armageddon or regular paychecks.

Max Webers The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905)\\t?\\tFocus: This seminal work by Max Weber argues that Protestant values, particularly self-discipline, hard work, and delayed gratification, contributed to the rise of capitalism in the West. While not exclusively about sexual restraint, Weber discusses how personal discipline (including in sexual matters) is part of the broader moral ethic that fostered economic and societal development.2. J.D. Unwins Sex and Culture (1934)\\t?\\tFocus: J.D. Unwins controversial work claims that civilizations that maintained strict sexual norms (including chastity before marriage and monogamy) flourished, while those that became more sexually permissive tended to decline. Unwin examined 80 different societies and argued that strict sexual morality was linked to cultural energy and societal advancement.3. Pitirim Sorokins The American Sex Revolution (1956)\\t?\\tFocus: Sociologist Pitirim Sorokin examined the cultural shift in America toward more permissive sexual norms. He argued that a move away from traditional sexual restraint could lead to societal decay, claiming that civilizations thrive when they practice sexual self-control as part of broader moral and ethical frameworks.4. Carl Deglers At Odds: Women and the Family in America from the Revolution to the Present (1980)\\t?\\tFocus: Carl Degler explores the evolving family structure in America, including changing attitudes toward sex and marriage. While not exclusively about chastity, this work discusses how sexual restraint and family integrity are linked to social stability and progress in certain historical periods.5. Rodney Starks The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success (2005)\\t?\\tFocus: This book argues that Christian values, including those related to sexual ethics and family life, contributed to the rise of reason, capitalism, and technological advancement in the West. Stark emphasizes how Christian sexual morality helped to shape stable family structures, which in turn supported economic and societal success.6. Joseph Daniel Unwins Hopousia: Or the Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society (1940)\\t?\\tFocus: In this follow-up work to Sex and Culture, Unwin further explored his theory that societies that enforce strict sexual regulations, particularly in the context of marriage, are better able to focus their energies on productive societal tasks and expansion.7. Historical Studies on Confucianism in China:\\t?\\tFocus: Confucian societies placed great importance on sexual restraint and family values as part of maintaining social order and stability. Studies on Confucian ethics often discuss how sexual restraint within marriage was linked to the broader success of Chinese dynasties.8. Michel Foucaults The History of Sexuality (1976-1984)\\t?\\tFocus: Foucault explores how sexual norms have been regulated by societies throughout history. While his analysis is critical of modern institutions and their control of sexuality, he acknowledges that many societies have enforced sexual restraint as a way to maintain social order and political power.And there are several historical examples that show when societies start losing their traditional values and become more liberal they start collapsing. WHICH IS WHATS HAPPENING TO THE WEST.\\n1. Roman Empire\\t?\\tContext: In its early phases, Roman society valued discipline, family structure, and sexual restraint, particularly during the Republic. However, during the later stages of the Empire, sexual norms became more relaxed, with increased indulgence in orgies, promiscuity, and infidelity. Some historians, like Edward Gibbon, in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, argue that this moral decay contributed to the eventual collapse of the Empire.\\n\\t?\\tContributing Factors: Economic troubles, political instability, military overreach, but moral decline is often noted as part of the broader process.2. Ancient Greece (Athens)\\t?\\tContext: Classical Athens is often cited as a society that experienced significant changes in its moral and sexual values during its decline. After the golden age of Athens, which emphasized civic duty and traditional family structures, the society became more decadent and sexually permissive, as seen in some of the literature and arts of the time.\\n\\t?\\tContributing Factors: Military defeats, political instability, and internal strife (like the Peloponnesian War) also contributed to its decline.3. Weimar Republic (Germany)\\t?\\tContext: The Weimar Republic in Germany, post-World War I, became known for its liberal attitudes toward sex, with a flourishing of sexual experimentation, cabarets, and a breakdown of traditional sexual norms. Some historians argue that this moral liberalism was a symptom of broader societal instability, which contributed to the eventual collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of more authoritarian regimes.\\n\\t?\\tContributing Factors: Economic crises, political instability, and the impact of the Treaty of Versailles were more immediate causes.4. Byzantine Empire (Later Period)\\t?\\tContext: The Byzantine Empire, especially in its later years, experienced significant internal decadence, with a breakdown of traditional values, including in the areas of family and sexual norms. The final stages of the empire were marked by corruption, moral laxity, and internal divisions.\\n\\t?\\tContributing Factors: Military defeats (especially by the Ottomans), economic issues, and political instability were the main drivers of collapse.5. Late Ottoman Empire\\t?\\tContext: In its later years, the Ottoman Empire experienced a relaxation of its moral and sexual codes, particularly in urban centers like Istanbul, where indulgence in sexual pleasures became more widespread. This period coincided with the weakening of traditional Islamic values and the empires eventual collapse.\\n\\t?\\tContributing Factors: Military defeats, economic decline, and nationalist movements played larger roles, but moral and cultural decay is sometimes cited as part of the weakening of Ottoman society.","title":"Hollywood is controlled by the CIA with the purpose plunging society into the perverse."},{"text":"More like the GOP saying, \\"oh fuck, they see us for who we ARE!\\"","title":"Democrats go all in on tying Project 2025 to House GOP"},{"text":"The Buffalo Bills cycle:?

But for millions of Americans, care for mental health and substance use conditions is still hard to find and hard to afford. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a step toward changing that, by placing new requirements on health plans that will improve and strengthen access to mental health care for 175 million Americans with private health insurance.  \\n...  \\nFor over 15 years, robust access to mental health care has been a bipartisan priority. Thanks to the 2008 enactment of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which was further strengthened in 2020 on a bipartisan basis, health plans that cover mental health and substance use care benefits must do so at the same level as physical health care benefits. But despite this landmark law, too many Americans still struggle to find and afford the care they need. In 2020, less than half of all adults with mental illness received treatment.  For children, the numbers are even worse: nearly 70 percent of our kids who seek care for mental health or substance use cannot get it. Thats in part because insurers too often make it difficult to access mental health treatment, causing millions of consumers to have high out-of-pocket costs because they go out-of-network, or defer care altogether. One study shows that insured people are nearly four times as likely go out-of-network and pay higher fees for mental health care than for physical health care. And the problem is getting worse: in recent years, the gap between usage of out-of-network care for mental health and substance use disorder benefits versus physical health benefits increased 85 percent. \\n \\nTodays [September 9th] final rule strengthens consumer protections by reinforcing MHPAEAs fundamental purpose that all Americans should have the same access to mental health and substance use benefits as they do physical health benefits. And it will help lower families health care costs by making it easier to access mental health and substance use care and getting rid of barriers that keep people from getting the care they need, when they need it, for a price they can afford.  Specifically, the final rule will:* **Require health plans to make changes when they are providing inadequate access to mental health and substance use care.** In 2020, Congress made changes to MHPAEA that require health plans to conduct meaningful comparative analyses to make sure that they are not making it harder for individuals to access mental health and substance use benefits than it is to access medical benefits.  Todays new requirements make it clear that health plans need to evaluate their provider networks, how much they pay out-of-network providers, and how often they require C and deny C prior authorizations. The outcomes of these evaluations will show plans where they are failing to meet the laws requirements, and where they will need to make changes to come into compliance, like adding more mental health and substance use professionals to their networks or reducing red tape for providers to deliver care.\\n* **Make it clear what health plans can and cannot do.** Health plans cannot use more restrictive prior authorization, or other medical management techniques, or narrower networks to make it harder for people to access mental health and substance use disorder benefits than their medical benefits. Health plans also have to use similar factors in setting out-of-network payment rates for mental health and substance use disorder providers as they do for medical providers.\\n* **Close existing loopholes.** When MHPAEA was first enacted, it did not require non-federal governmental health plans, like those offered to state and local government employees, to comply with its requirements. Todays final rule closes that loophole, and now requires more than 200 additional health plans to comply with MHPAEA, providing critical protections to 120,000 consumers. Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration, these new requirements will help more people get the mental health and substance use care they need while also making sure that mental health and substance use care professionals are paid fairly, likely incentivizing more people to join the mental health workforce.  In addition to todays final rule, the Department of Health and Human Services is also releasing new tools for states to ensure compliance with MHPAEAs critical protections for the millions of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicaid health plans.Statement from the President:Mental health care is health care. But for far too many Americans, critical care and treatments are out of reach. Today, my Administration is taking action to address our nations mental health crisis by ensuring mental health coverage will be covered at the same level as other health care for Americans. There is no reason that breaking your arm should be treated differently than having a mental health condition. The steps my Administration is taking today will dramatically expand access to mental health care in America.\\nStatement from the Vice President:President Biden and I are committed to ensuring that every person in our country has the mental health care they need to thrive. That is why we made the largest investment in youth mental health in history and are transforming how mental health is understood, perceived, and treated for all Americans. Today, we are building on this lifesaving and lifechanging work by announcing the finalization of a historic rule that will expand mental health care across our nation so more of our loved ones, neighbors, coworkers, and classmates receive the care they deserve. As someone who has spent my entire career fighting to improve the health and well-being of all Americans, I will never stop working to ensure that health care is a right C not just a privilege for those who can afford it.-In other press releases:* [FACT SHEET: Days After Labor Day, Biden-?Harris Administration Issues Executive Order to Promote Good Jobs Through Investing in America Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/06/fact-sheet-days-after-labor-day-biden-harris-administration-issues-executive-order-to-promote-good-jobs-through-investing-in-america-agenda/) * [Executive Order on Investing in America and Investing in American Workers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/09/06/executive-order-on-investing-in-america-and-investing-in-american-workers/)* [FACT SHEET: Biden-?Harris Administration Advances Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, Reinforces Ocean Conservation Legacy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/06/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-chumash-heritage-national-marine-sanctuary-reinforces-ocean-conservation-legacy/)* [US Department of Labor, Mexican Consulate in San Jose renew partnership to educate, protect workers rights under federal law](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240906)* [US Department of Labor updates cybersecurity guidance for plan sponsors, fiduciaries, recordkeepers, plan participants to protect info, assets](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20240906-0)* [HUD Announces More than $1 Million to Reduce Radon Exposure in Connecticut and Ohio Public Housing | New funds will improve the safety of almost 1,700 families and prevent toxic exposures that could lead to cancer](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_229)* [U.S. Department of Transportation Provides Connecticut $3 Million in Quick Release Emergency Relief Funding to Repair Roads and Bridges Damaged by Flooding](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-provides-connecticut-3-million-quick-release-emergency)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces $232 Million in Grants to Clean Up Brownfield Sites, Address Legacy Pollution, Advance Environmental Justice, and Spur Economic Revitalization](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-232-million-grants-clean-brownfield-sites)* [Biden-Harris Administration officials celebrate New Yorks first national marine sanctuary designation with state and local partners](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/biden-harris-administration-officials-celebrate-new-yorks-first-national-marine-sanctuary)-Enforcement:* [EPA Issues Enforcement Alert to Address Illegal Import of Hydrofluorocarbons into the United States](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-issues-enforcement-alert-address-illegal-import-hydrofluorocarbons-united-states)* [EPA Announces Settlement with Federal Cartridge Co. in Anoka, Minnesota, for Alleged Clean Air Act Violations](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-settlement-federal-cartridge-co-anoka-minnesota-alleged-clean-air-act)* [FCC Fines 19 Station Groups for 'Kid Vid' Violations](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-fines-19-station-groups-kid-vid-violations)* [FCC Opens Eighteenth Inquiry on State of Broadband in the U.S.](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-eighteenth-inquiry-state-broadband-us)* [HSI San Diego, Partner Agencies Case Results in Wynn Las Vegas Forfeiting $130 Million for Illegally Conspiring With Unlicensed Money Transmitting Businesses](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/09/06/wynn-las-vegas-forfeits-130m-illegally-conspiring-unlicensed-money-transmitting)","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Lowers Mental Health Care Costs by Improving Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Care"},{"text":"It's happening in every \\"first world country\\".It's no longer a conspiracy but a fact.

Laws haven't really kept up with tech too well, as we still haven't even seen any comprehensive legal work for AI restrictions either. It will happen, because it kind of has to. This isn't the first time we've gone through a crisis like this. War of the Worlds original broadcast being a great example of this. It was entertainment, but was intentionally misleading. Police stormed the station to shut it down, the FCC filed complaint, CBS had to agree to making it known to audiences of the fictional content, etc..\\nThere wasn't anything to come of the police or the FCC complaint, because in 1938 broadcasting law was also behind on the medium in general it was all relatively uncharted territory, same as we are now.

They will also expand the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 tax cut to families with newborn children. They believe no child in America should live in poverty, and these actions would have a historic impact.Unlike Donald Trump, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are committed to ensuring no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes. They believe that we need to chart a New Way Forward by both making our tax system fairer and prioritizing investment and innovation. They will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share, so we can take action to build up the middle class while reducing the deficit. This includes rolling back Trumps tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, enacting a billionaire minimum tax, quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks, and other reforms to ensure the very wealthy are playing by the same rules as the middle class. Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent, because when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger.I will also say that she hasnt tried to overthrow the government, hasnt been indicted for or convicted of felonies, and is a good person with values, unlike the other guy.","title":"Harris says she is different from Biden because I offer a new generation of leadership"},{"text":"This seems like another bad economic policy, desirable federal jobs in STEM are already extremely competitive and come down to who you know, degree requirements are quite low.
