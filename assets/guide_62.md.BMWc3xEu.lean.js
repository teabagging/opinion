Qanon was part of a whole string of supposed government insiders with the anon suffix on 4chan. If you were on TheDonald in 2016, you definitely have heard about FBIanon and CIAanon, for example. They were shitposters which very few people on 4 chan took seriously but which got traction with people who were under the impression that 4chan was some kind of secret underground hub. Later on, when Qanon \\"moved\\" to 8chan (aka was banned from 4chan for being annoying and bringing annoying internet illiterate boomers and gen xers), it came under control of the owner of 8chan, a libertarian pig farmer who made a small fortune making porn sites in the 90s and now lives in Thailand or something.He and his son kept Qanon alive because it brought traffic to 8chan, a website that was mostly known for incels and pedophiles. And it gave him a little bit of political influence.I know it's more fun to think of it as a.CIA op, but that is giving it too much credit. The reality is so much dumber.My opinion on why Qanon became so popular among conspiracy theorists is because it gave anyone a chance to insert their own pet conspiracy theory in the lore.

This created fear in the people who then rushed to the banks to retrieve their money. Just to find out it was already stolen. Then the banks had to balls to foreclose on homes and farms when the people could no longer pay. Why the people thought SS run by the govt was a good idea right after ?Edit to add- I love being consistently gaslit by ChatGPT. Just change some words around and poof, nothing happened. ChatGPT-This comment reflects a popular but somewhat inaccurate or oversimplified view of the events leading to the Great Depression. Lets break down the key elements of the statement:1. **The Federal Reserves Role in the 1920s:**\\n   The claim that the Federal Reserve created the Great Depression by significantly counterfeiting the currency during the Roaring Twenties is not entirely accurate. While the Federal Reserve did increase the money supply during the 1920s, it was primarily aimed at stimulating the economy. However, there were also some poor policy decisions, such as keeping interest rates low in the late 1920s, which fueled a speculative stock market bubble. When the bubble burst in 1929, it contributed to the onset of the Great Depression. The term counterfeiting is misleading here; the Federal Reserve was not creating money out of thin air, but was managing the money supply and credit conditions.2. **Bank Runs and the Collapse:**\\n   Its true that during the Great Depression, many people rushed to banks to withdraw their money after the stock market crash of 1929. This led to widespread bank failures, as banks didnt keep enough reserves on hand to cover all depositors withdrawals. This was exacerbated by the lack of deposit insurance (which would come later with the FDIC in 1933). However, this was not because the money had been stolen, but because many banks had made risky loans, and when the economy collapsed, they couldnt pay back depositors.3. **Foreclosures and the Struggles of the People:**\\n   During the Depression, banks did foreclose on homes and farms as many Americans couldnt pay off their loans. This contributed to widespread economic suffering, but its important to note that the foreclosures were a result of a financial system in crisis, not a deliberate scheme by banks or the government.4. **Social Security and the Government:**\\n   The comment suggests that people supported Social Security (SS) because they trusted the government after the Depression. While its true that Social Security was introduced in the 1930s as part of the New Deal under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, its creation was not directly a response to the banks or the financial system. Rather, it was a response to widespread poverty and suffering caused by the Depression, aiming to provide financial support to the elderly and vulnerable. People supported Social Security because it provided a safety net after the devastating effects of the Depression, including widespread unemployment and poverty. In Summary:\\nWhile the Federal Reserves actions in the 1920s contributed to some of the economic instability that led to the Great Depression, the comment oversimplifies the complex factors involved. It also mischaracterizes the bank failures and the origins of Social Security. The Depression was a multifaceted crisis, and while government intervention (including Social Security) was part of the response, it was driven by the widespread suffering caused by economic collapse, not just a reaction to bank misdeeds or a sudden trust in the government.","title":"Of all the deceptive sales techniques the U.S. government has used on the American people, one of them  the Social Security Act  gets far too little attention.

Coincidence of elements is a foundational principle of criminal law (maybe American law is different, I do not know). In other words the act has to take place alongside the intention and alongside the location.The harming of the officers here is incidental to intent to influence the government. It is doubtful than any one was thinking, \\"by attacking this officer, Congress will not certify the election.\\" That \\"if I do violence X, Y change will result\\" I submit is the pith and substance of the terrorist offence.I might be wrong in theory, but perhaps not practice. I am not familiar with all terrorism cases in the USA, but can you think of any terrorist convictions where the violent act was incidental to the main thrust? In other words, is there a terrorist conviction where someone did something life threatening, but this act was not what communicated their intent to frighten civilians, influence government, etc. All the terrorism offences that I am familiar with are when the terrorist kills people to make a point or demand something. I cannot think of any terrorism offence where the offender killed someone, but that death did not assist them in making their threat/demand.EDIT: For further clarification. Let's say that they killed the police officer because they wanted to show all police in the USA that that's what would happen if to them if they do not stand behind Trump. That would be terrorism. That would be using a harmful act to promote fear among the civilians.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"I dont agree with bidens pardon to start, at least we can agree on that.

How often do you or others speak up about a significant amount of men not being bad? Personally, I have?*literally*?never?seen a feminist argue that men are naturally and inevitably bad (like, rooted in their biology, men are just?bad), but if I did - I would call that out.That sort of biological essentialism is something that I only see in men's rights and right-wing spaces.I have seen feminists make harsh generalizations about men that are descriptive in nature. What I mean by that is something like \\"Men are incapable of hearing criticism of masculinity without feeling like its a personal attack\\" or \\"Men are violent\\" or \\"Men support rape culture\\" etc. Are those generalizations universally true? No. #notallmen /s  However, those generalizations always reflect frustration with the **typical socialization** of men, not with some biological, innate trait that is intrinsic to men. It is very difficult for some people to understand that **it is possible to support and perpetuate an immoral system passively or unintentionally**. Most contemporary feminists agree that men **and women** are socialized to support the patriarchy and it would be unfair to blame them for the socialization they had no part in choosing. But socialization is not intrinsic. Men can change, and often do. Women can change, and often do. A better world is possible. Some feminists (such as in the [1960s political movement \\"political lesbianism\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_lesbianism)) do seem to think men are the enemy. That's not the sort of feminist I'm hanging out with and they are considered extremists. How are you actively encouraging feminists and men to support men and help others become good men?Whole lot of we dont hate men. Not a whole lot of we are doing x, y, z to help men feel more supported and grow.This is a bit like asking the fire department \\"What is your department doing to reduce the rate of heart disease?\\" In principle, it is a good thing to reduce the rate of heart disease. However, the fire department exists for a different primary purpose and it would distract from that purpose to pour disproportionate time and money into heart disease prevention. Women need help right now. Men need help too, but feminism is a movement generally by and for women. Men benefit indirectly from women's liberation (because men are oppressed by the patriarchy too), but it isn't feminists primary job to help men. Reframing every women's issue as a men's issue is kinda misogynistic too, isn't it?  There are men's liberation movements that are also feminist. I suggest checking out r/MensLib for an example of a men's interest group that is also feminist. They focus on the \\"men's issues\\" front of the \\"war\\" against patriarchy.","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"This article not only quotes trump, but outlines what he did for Israel during his presidency that increased tensions in the region. https://apnews.com/article/trump-mideast-netanyahu-israel-gaza-iran-wars-2e37305522d19bdc34e956586cce99bd","title":"Gov.

Income taxes are about average for the US for the bottom 80% of us, and higher for the top 20%, much higher for the top 5%. Property tax is all over the place thanks to Prop 13, which is mostly responsible for this mess. Sales taxes are pretty high (though essentials are generally untaxed), especially in some municipalities where they may bring it up to 10%. But there's no service tax at all.It's overall a high-tax state for the average person, but not the highest. A quick Google search will give you an AI result stating we have the highest tax, because our top income tax bracket is 13.3%, but that's only the top 1%. For the average Californian, we're fifth in total tax burden. Reasonable revisions to Proposition 13, without throwing the baby out with the bathwater, need to happen. But it's considered a third rail here, and you could only do that with another ballot initiative, and the changes that would need to be made to fix the problem may create an initiative that's complicated for voters to understand.

Maybe not a life-threatening issue, but certainly one where I can never gain that hair back and will instead lose one of the most important ways I have to express myself. Not only that, but my body will also store fat in places that will drive me up the wall and make me lose any hope in ever making meaningful improvement over my appearance because my body just isn't operating in that way.But then you have the mental. Before I transitioned, I had been through every kind of therapist you could imagine. Pretty much, I had accepted that I would never be truly at peace with myself and had decided that I would end my own life once my parents were gone. I would do my best until then for their sake, but every day was a waking nightmare where I would be lost in the void of seeing how people were perceiving me and my insides screaming at me over how wrong that was. Every day I felt like a freak and I hated myself. What's more is the T in my system would drive a temper in me that would frequently drive me to self harm. To be entirely honest, despite my promise to stick around for my family, I had already made a number of attempts on my own life and was lucky to have survived.When I was given estrogen for the first time, it was like a cloud was lifted from my mind. I no longer felt this constant feeling of everything being wrong. I didn't feel like every passing second was another second where I was not allowed to be me. I finally could start interacting with the world in an authentic way that made sense to not only me, but also to everyone in my life both close and distant. Since I started Hrt, I have never even considered ending my life once no matter how difficult things have gotten.Since then, I have been committed to excelling in my field as a musician and giving back to my community as a vocal coach. I dedicate as much of my energy as possible to create peace and joy in the world. I have something worth fighting for and I want to see it through more than anything. Because, as a wise trans person once said, \\"transitioning didn't solve my problems, it just made my problems worth solving\\". I am me because of how well my body has taken to this corrected hormone balance in my body. To take that away from me after granting me this joy for nearly five years is needlessly inhumane.

Trump is threatening to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico over their failures to curb the flow of illegal immigrants and illicit drugs from those countries into the U.S.Gotta appeal to the anti-immigrant fervor of your target audience!  According to two people at the table who heard the discussion, Trump, while cordial and welcoming, was very direct when it came to what he wants from his counterpart to the North.Seriously? \\"Cordial and welcoming?\\" The words cordial and welcoming aren't even in Trump's vocabulary. Plus, Trump is a temperamental manchild, his cordiality only lasts as long as he's being flattered.  Paraphrasing the discussion, Trump told Trudeau that Canada has failed the U.S. border by allowing large amounts of drugs and people across the border, including illegal immigrants from over 70 different countries. The president-elect told the prime minister if Canada cannot fix the border issues and trade deficit, he will levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods on day one when he returns to office.Trump obviously hasn't learned from his last trade war, that implementing tariffs indiscriminately and without the complex considerations that are typically involved in determining tariff rates, leads to economic tensions, damaging consequences for American businesses,  retaliatory measures, global trade issues, angry allies and perhaps even another trade war. Trudeau told Trump he cannot levy the tariff because it would kill the Canadian economy completely. Trump replied C asking, so your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion?  Trump then suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously, sources told Fox News. He told Trudeau that if he cannot handle his list of demands without ripping the U.S. off in trade, maybe Canada should really become a state or two and Trudeau could become a governor.I'd be nervous too if the president-elect of a neighboring country suggested annexing my country because I wouldn't cave into his ridiculous demands...And ffs, what kind of negotiation is this? The ghostwriter for The Art Of the Deal is even laughing nervously. Why on earth is his first response to annex Canada? How did he go from point a to point b?

Like lets be real here, he's a shitbag, definitely feels weird with his connections in Ukraine and China, but you've got to see that Trump has been running saying that they're coming after him because he's their political opponent. The optics of going after your opponent's kid after this campaign, even though I think he's up to no good, looks quite bad. The damage to hunter has been done, if a state wants to try to go after him for anything on that laptop, they'll get their chance to do so quite soon.I don't think anyone in a position of power actually gives a damn about Hunter Biden or his crimes, other than as a tool to get at his dad, either for influence (if you're in the Ukraine, or a shitty painting buyer somewhere in china) or for political smears if you're on the right. He was literally just a chess piece for each side of the political aisle to use to get at Joe. As his dad is now almost completely brainless due to his age, all of this potential criminal activity is probably about to cease, and more than likely that is going to be permanent. Hunter is permanently politically non-viable because of that laptop, theres no benefit to be had by pumping money to him at this point, and theres no benefit to continue prosecuting, they lost, its over. Whats the upside here though? We just got another bit of shit to sling, 10 minutes of footage of Biden himself, his administration, and the democrat establishment at large saying they wouldn't do the thing they just did.

And the OP doesn't seem to get its not something you can argue your way out of.  Its not an argument you can win.  Plenty of people didn't agree with the laws after September 11th.

Plenty of people won't agree with many of the things that will happen over the next 5-10 and it will happen anyways.It honestly confuses me how people can be so dogmatic and short sighted after one of the biggest and most one sided election upsets in our history.  I doubt many people on this Reddit wanted Trump to win.  It happened anyways.  No matter what they felt, argued, or posted on the internet.And we've got Trump being pardoned and Hunter Biden being Pardon'd at the same time, both sides upset that someone is \\"getting away with it\\".  The law is like a gun, it doesn't care who uses it or for what.  It's just a tool that can be used AND misused.  Which is why you have to be so bloody careful.  The legal or politica; weapon someone may gleefully uses today will often be used gleefully against you tomorrow.Identity politics is one of those things that recently had boomeranged back around.  Politics got made increasingly about identity politics.  Turns out that when you tell people to vote based on identity, that this can and will be used against you as well.  Certain identities showed up in droves this election that would have normally stayed home.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander...**EDIT:**  LOL, the president wins the popular vote, the electoral vote, the senate, and the house and somehow the below poster doesn't consider that a overwhelmingly one sided election because *\\"while Trump one popular vote the margin of his win was very small, smaller than many past margins between parties in presidential elections.\\"*This is a perfect example.  Take that same reasoning, flip it against the Democratic party.  Suddenly every single election we've had has in reality been divided and conflicted and not representative of the American people.  Far more so than this one.  Just by applying your exact same standards against the Dems in previous victories.  It's incredibly self defeating logic.

This often enables the group to commit atrocities more than it would to tolerate the comparison despite difference in scale.IMO, every single one of the J6 protesters were there to influence the election in a coordinated fashion. The point you make falls short in alternate contexts: if someone breaks the front door of a store during a riot - can you simply walk in and walk out and expect not to get at least charged with a crime? If you coordinate to commit insurance fraud while driving and one of your associates ends up killing someone, you may not get a murder charge but you will likely be an accessory to manslaughter at minimum.The protesters were there for a reason. They knew entering the Capitol was illegal (though jt does NOT matter if you know it is legal or not). They were coordinated by the speeches, arranged travel, and communication about their intent prior. Crimes were committed. There was massive amounts of violence. And the reasoning was political.There were _crowds_ of people participating in violence against police who _didn't_ enter the building. So trespassing is not a proper conditional to base charges on.In my opinion, if you did not leave after violence against police (even prior to entering the capitol), you _knew_ what you were doing and were party to it. Any argument against this seems to rely heavily on plausible deniability. Which is not really afforded much in most criminal cases against the common citizen.By giving out any get out of jail free cards for this event, there is messaging that some of these participants broke no laws, rules, or otherwise in their activities that day. But we _all_ knew before they even showed up what their intent was and that it was unacceptable and a threat to our government. Every person who entered the Capitol was well beyond this threshold and deserves to lose their freedom. This is not a _stupid_ or _silly_ mistake. Look at the rhetoric from J6 convicts - they would still do it again _and_ they're being held accountable. These people are terrorist criminals. At minimum - to the level of stochastic terrorism. Terrorism doesn't have to be a 9/11 attack. It can simply be a lynching a PoC, stoning a gay person, or smashing the windshield of a few car with Biden or Harris bumper stickers.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"Bruh you can still ignore him ??I couldnt tell you one thing hes tweeted, ever.

In 1935, the American people were sold a bill of goods. They were told, Pay into this system, and it'll be YOUR money for retirement. Sounds great, right?3. But here's where it gets juicy, in a really ugly way. Two years later, when the Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of the Social Security Act, the government did a complete 180.4. The governmentthrough Assistant Attorney General Robert Jacksonargued in essence, Oh no, this isnt YOUR money at all. This is a TAX, and we can do whatever we want with it. Classic bait and switch.5. Lets not forget the ruling in Helvering v. Davis, where the Supreme Court upheld the Social Security Act by embracing the governments argument / admission that what people pay into Social Security is tax revenueavailable to be used as Congress may directand not at all money belonging to those who paid it.6. So, to summarize: the proponents of the Social Security Act told American workers that what they paid into the system would remain *their* money, not the governmentsto get Congress to pass itand then told the courts the exact opposite when defending the Acts constitutionality. The Supreme Court accepted the governments argument, to the great detriment of the American people.7. Now, lets talk about what happens to your money once its in the government's hands. Spoiler alert: its not managed like your IRA or 401(k).8. First of all, this money doesnt sit in a nice, individual account with your name on it. No, it goes into a huge account called the Social Security Trust Fund.9. But heres the kickerthe government routinely raids this fund. Yes, you heard that right. They take your money and use it for whatever the current Congress deems necessary.10. Every few years, theres talk in Congress about saving Social Security. Ive introduced and cosponsored a number of measures over the years that would fix it. But most in Congress show little desire to fix it, and are instead constantly looking for ways to borrow from itwith no plan to put it back.11. And the returns? Forget about compound interest or stock market gains. Your investment in Social Security can give you a return lower than inflation.12. If you had put the same amount into literally ANYTHING elsea mutual fund, real estate, even a savings accountyoud be better off by the time you reached retirement age, even if the government kept some of it!13. Do the math: with Social Security, youre looking at a return that's pathetic compared to market averages. Its not even an investment; it's a tax.14. And lets talk about how this system is set up to fail. The demographic shift? More retirees, fewer workers. Its almost fair to compare it to a Ponzi scheme thats running out of new investors.15. Every dollar you pay into Social Security, only to see it gobbled up by the government itself, is a dollar you cant invest in your own future. Its government dependency at its worst.16. Remember, this isnt just about retirement. Its about independence, about controlling your own destiny. With Social Security, you control nothing.17. The government promises you security but gives you dependency. It promises ownership but gives you a tax receipt.18. And dont get me started on the management. The Social Security Administration is a bureaucratic behemoth, not exactly known for its efficiency or innovation.19. If you think your money is safe there, youre in for a rude awakening. The mismanagement, the waste, the deceptionits all on display.20. So, whats the solution? We need real, genuine reform. Within the Social Security system, Americans should be able to invest in their own future, and not be shackled by the worst parts of this outdated, mismanaged system.21. Its  time we acknowledge the truth: Social Security as it now exists isnt a retirement plan; its a tax plan with retirement benefits as an afterthought.22. We were sold a dream, but received a nightmare. Its time for a wake-up call. We need real reform.23. Its time for Americans to know the true history of the Social Security Act. The more people learn the truth, the more theyll start demanding answers, options, and real reform from Congress. Please help spread the word.24. The history of the Social Security Actwhich sadly must include the deceptive manner in which it was sold to the American peopleis yet another reason why Americas century-long era of progressive government must be brought to a close.Credit: Senator Mike Lee on Xhttps://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1863771172485104124?t=PIGVz2LdfeckJIjkt-O79Q&amp;s=19","title":"Of all the deceptive sales techniques the U.S. government has used on the American people, one of them  the Social Security Act  gets far too little attention.

Fluorocarbons/fluoropolymers were a miraculous discovery for Du Pont.  Teflon was basically discovered by accident as an unwanted residue in a lab setup.

So they were a boon to industry (and humanity) for a while before people started noticing that they also made people sick.

As a chemist, I appreciate why they are so widely used and why industry is so reluctant to replace them.Where us humans turn into self-harming idiots is when we discover how harmful certain chemicals are and then *persist in using them* for decades because corporations don't want to spend money developing safer alternatives or upgrading their processes or managing their legacy wastes.

Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one that actually knows what went down and that it's been blown entirely out of proportion.Interestingly, simply coming across your post had the effect of mildly softening my own perspective, and making me wish for someone to debate the nuances with.

I honestly am not even sure of how many individuals were being rowdy and disrespectful, or precisely out of hand the rioting got, because I'm trying to fight off the tide of the most common lies.If we could simply come down to facts of the matter, I likely could agree with some people who believe it never should have happened; that it's genuinely existentially frightening when people march on the national capitol, and it didn't make for a good look. I also understand *why* they did what they did--the peaceful protestors, anyways--we as American citizens have the right to assemble on public grounds, and the Capitol, while sacred to our governmental institutions, is also yet public property of all Americans. I understand the tensions leading up to the moment, that much of middle America felt so unheard that this was the last-ditch effort to take a stand.

In the remediation world there are several notorious pollutants that spurred large scale legislative reform, industry regulations, cleanups, etc.  Lead in pipes, lead in gasoline, DDT, PCBs, I'm sure you have heard of them because those things were \\"big\\" and bad enough to get into the dialogue of the general public.  PFAS are the newest iteration of that.  They're fascinating because they are so diverse and so chemically distinct from many of those past contaminants, but those properties are also what make them such a novel and difficult challenge.  To give context, PFAS have really only been getting sustained, serious industry-wide attention and research funding from the government for about 5 years.  Maybe 10, tops.  They've existed for far longer and have been known to be harmful for several decades, but in terms of getting serious attention and effort for cleanup they are quite new.  I'm just entering the mid level of my career and I'm hoping to focus the remaining 30 or so years I have in the workforce on PFAS.  By that point (if we're lucky) they will be sufficiently characterized and regulated that all efforts can focus solely on cleanup.

Because of this, protests known as Euromaidan erupted decrying government corruption. Militiamen bearing Russian weaponry but no insignia began occupying several key regions and airports of Crimea, and later on Ukraine. A Crimean referendum was held, with polling stations monitored by those very unmarked militiamen, and thousands of prefilled ballots were found indicating favor of joining Russia. The result was a staggering 95% vote in favor of joining Russia. Regions not monitored by these militiamen did not indicate favor for joining Russia. So no, not CIA involvement. An independent, sovereign, nation wanting to increase its ties with the EU is not a justifiable reason for invasion. It may cause tension, but not grounds for hostile takeover as Russia should have no claim to these lands. It is a bordering country which should come with its own autonomy.Some sources [here](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/why-was-crimea-taken-so-easily) [ and here](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-crisis-in-Crimea-and-eastern-Ukraine)","title":"Biden surges arms to Ukraine, fearing Trump will halt U.S. aid"},{"text":"If plutocracy and cronyism had a baby, what would it be called?","title":"Trump picks Republican mega-donor Warren Stephens as ambassador to UK"},{"text":"This is an exaggeration.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Departments decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. \\n \\nThe charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.   \\n \\nNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son C and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter C who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. \\n \\nFor my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. Theyll be fair-minded. Heres the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice C and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.

The definition of terrorism is debatable, but the one that's generally accepted and I've used in my published literature is:*\\"Politically motivated violence, carried out by a non-state actor against a non-military target, with the aim of spreading terror among a wider audience\\"*There are all kinds of exceptions to that definition, but it works well enough for this purpose.The Jan 6th perpetrators were non-state actors carrying out politically motivated violence against a non-military target, so they definitely tick all of those boxes. But, the key is the *purpose* of the act. Usually a terrorist attack is a random and unexpected thing, and because it's random and unexpected the wider audience becomes fearful that it could happen to them as well.It would be a stretch to say that the aim of the Jan 6th violence was to spread terror among a wider audience. The only people terrorised by this were people at that location at that time. The \\"wider audience\\" is not fearful that this might also happen to them.If you ignore the purpose and just define terrorism as politically motivated violence carried out by a non-state actor against a non-military target, then any person involved in any protest that involves any violence is a terrorist, even if they were protesting a particular issue and had no intent to cause terror among the population.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"if trump and company decides to pull the trigger on invading canada and mexico whose going to stop them?","title":"Trump suggests Canada become 51st state after Trudeau said tariff would kill economy: sources"},{"text":" Probably pardon bannon soon.again","title":"Hunter Biden pardon fuels Trump's 'weaponization' arguments"},{"text":"At no point did you say the definition wasnt the real definitely of terrorism until a commenter taught you how especially works.

Barely any of the protesters was armed. There were next to no guns and the only person who was shot was one of the protestors. For people who supposedly were mostly all second amendment advocates, that seems like all their guns would have been for exactly this moment, yet nothing?\\n2. There was no real plan to do anything. There is a lot of talk that they wanted to go in and kill Mike Pence with a noose that was erected, however, that noose was waist height, and clearly not able to carry the weight of a human being. The irony is that it seems to actually have disrupted what was supposedly \\"Trump's real plan\\" which was to have certain Republican congress members officially enter their objections to the electors, and petition to introduce his own allegedly electors for certain states. This was disrupted by the protests.In addition, the mob, even the proud boys in the NYT video have no real end goal. They were clearly not going to gain control of the government, when they did actually break in, they went around snapping pictures and putting their feet on desks.3. If you are going to take this NYT expose as gospel then it only makes sense for you to watch the documentaries that are providing alternative views of Jan 6th. The proud boys, many of them present, and many of them core members, were FBI informants. If there were FBI informants working within the proud boys already, why didn't the FBI use this information to stop them instead of just letting them do what they did? The truth seems to be that law enforcement didn't take this threat seriously, or they didn't want to stop them; take your pick, but there is evidence to support the latter, particularly Pelosi turning down the national guard support offered by Trump, and declaring on video that \\"this was what we wanted,\\" indicating that this was actually a desirable outcome for them, as it really made Trump look bad.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"Yes","title":"Drunken Trump nominee caught on stage with strippers"},{"text":"Ukraine is gonna Ukraine.

I don't believe \\"terrorist\\" is appropriate when their goal is directly in front of them. That is to say, they weren't trying to use Terror as a weapon, as to coerce with threats and fear -- they had a very clear plan, to disrupt the proceedings, capture and potentially kill Pence and Pelosi, and force Congress to accept alternate electors. Trump's original plan was to go to the Capitol and quell (or really, assume control of) the riot, and then declare that he got to stay President. If successful, it would have been a coup. We don't generally referred to failed coups as \\"terrorism\\". A close analogue is the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi coup in Germany that landed Hitler in jail (temporarily...). While I know you will argue they still meet the definition, I maintain that we've never used the word in that context, and it's just confusing to do so now.2. I don't believe the January 6th rioters did anything wrong, provided they genuinely believed the election had been stolen. If an election is stolen, the correct American thing to do is to storm the fucking Capitol. The problem is that they were lied to, and zero of the liars have yet seen the inside of a jail cell or the wrong end of a noose, either of which would be appropriate. But the actual Americans who were fed that lie and stormed the Capitol? No, imo, not terrorists.

I think the general republican narrative rightly points out that people are having a tough time, but wrongly attributes that to a bad economy. The general democrat narrative, on the other hand, rightly points out that the economy is generally healthy, but wrongly ignores that the average person is not benefiting from the broader economic situation. Of course there are specific republicans and democrats who dont match what Ive said, but this seems like the general split coming out of the election.?","title":"MAGA Filmmaker Trump Praised Admits 2020 Election Fraud Doc Was B.S."},{"text":"I really want this to be true.

If you follow ISIS into a building to disrupt a government anywhere in the world, the newspaper headline would read, ISIS attacks government building.This is a radical definition of terrorism. So if Hamas sets up a base in a hospital, is it justified to treat all of the people in the hospital as Hamas members?To be a terrorist, you have to have a political aim and use violence against civilians. Occupying a place you aren't supposed to be is not violence. If it is, then a sit-in is also an act of terrorism. Very few of the individuals used \\"violence\\" (if you can honestly call pushing and pepper spray violence). You cannot impute the \\"violence\\" to people who were not violent simply because they were there, especially when the vast majority of people were not part of any group that could be considered a conspiracy. The violence also has to be against civilians, which police are not.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"Biden isn't a king, it would take a federal law enacted by Congress to stop it being a schedule 1 drug.

To treat someone as a terrorist requires meeting specific criteria, including acts of violence aimed at intimidating or coercing a government or population for political purposes. Not everyone who entered the Capitol meets this definition.For example, many participants were swept up in the crowd and did not engage in violence or coordination. The video you linked does show premeditation and violence by certain groups, and those individuals absolutely deserve significant consequences. However, others entered through open doors, walked around, and then left. While their actions were unlawful, calling them terrorists is a stretch and diminishes the gravity of actual terrorism, which involves deliberate, large-scale harm like 9/11 or Oklahoma City.Additionally, equating all January 6 participants with ISIS is problematic. ISIS is a global terrorist organization responsible for mass atrocities and systematic violence. Drawing that parallel inflates what happened at the Capitol and risks undermining efforts to hold the truly dangerous actors accountable. The justice system has already differentiated between those who violently assaulted officers, smashed windows, and plotted attacks versus those who were merely trespassing. This measured approach ensures proportionality in sentencing, which is fundamental to justice.Demanding that every January 6 defendant be treated as a terrorist could backfire. It would make it harder to argue for fair, proportional consequences in future cases of political unrest. If we start calling all unlawful protests terrorism, we risk criminalizing dissent in ways that harm democracy. Addressing this requires holding the violent perpetrators accountable while not overgeneralizing the rest.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"It IS what I voted for!

If I slap you across the face, that is violent, but not dangerous to human life. So, there was a lot of pushing and shoving, but many people got into the building without personally doing an act dangerous to human life.Further, and I would need to look more into this myself because I am not sure, I suspect that this act dangerous to human life further intent to intimidate or influence, and not simply be incidental. For example, let's compare two acts.1. A groups breaks in a news station. They captures a left-handed security guard and kill him on live TV to inspire fear in the left-handed population.2. While breaking into the news station, they kill a guard trying to stop them. They take over the TV and shout of some propaganda against left-handed people.I suspect that No. 1 is terrorism, but not No. 2. Although there was a life-threatening act in the second offence, the act was not done to further their intent to intimidate the civilian population or influence policy in government.This is why although some of those on Jan 6 did participate in the attack on the police, that attack on the police was not to further their intent to influence the government. Maybe if they held the police officers hostage and demanded that Congress not certify the election or they would kill the hostages, that might suffice. However, harming the police there was the means to the end. The ends themselves were not violent. Again, I do not know for sure the terrorism jurisprudence in the USA, but to me this is a reasonable constraint of the offence. Otherwise, this offence would likely cast too wide a net.That said, it could be attempted terrorism. However, that would be more difficult to prove.You could certainly submit that they people involved deserve greater punishment. Sure, they can be charged with higher level offences or be given harsher sentencing because of the aggravating factor. However, I submit that terrorism is not quite appropriate here.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"TikTok is the same way but somehow people dooming in TikTok comments made me feel better because they famously dont know anything theyre talking about on there, so if they think were cooked, the opposite must be so.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 2, 2024"},{"text":"Im reading through the Dark Tower series by Stephen King and the main character refers to cheap fake jewelry as trumperey.","title":"In the 1988 Christmas movie Scrooged.

Initially, these terms described violence perpetrated by a government.

Hitler maybe wasnt as smart and dynamic behind closed doors as his reputation commonly espouses, but he had grand ideas and a big picture goal for Germany to have a thousand year Reich.

But trump himself is an absolute moron and everything he has ever been in charge of has been a mismanaged failure.I honestly believe that the true believers in his orbit, like Bannon and Miller, will be ultimately disappointed by how little he follows through with. Not because the competent ghouls from the heritage foundation and federalist society and P2025 arent executing their parts effectively, but because the rest of his picks are utterly incompetent and trump himself doesnt actually give a shit about any of their goals.

This part jumped out at me, and explains a lot of why women from lower socioeconomic classes might support Trump:Women with more social, economic, or educational capital are much more likely to support the activities of women making their own way in the world, to be proud when they see powerful women who stand up or who are getting ahead of men in any way, and theyre also much more open to supporting social policies that reward individual initiative even if they know that its not always rewarded equally.Women with less economic or personal autonomy are often drawn to a culture of family values that emphasizes mens responsibility to look after women. Women who have a shot at achieving or competing on their own emphasize equality, supporting the kind of policies that make it possible for them to move up in their jobs and combine work and family.Women who want to be protected in the private sphere or need to be protected in the private sphere tend to emphasize the need to protect and privilege womens special capacities for nurturing. I think its a big factor in the debates over contraception and sexuality and abortion. The flip side of women having all these freedoms from male control, they believe, is that it actually threatens womens entitlement to male protection.To me, it says a lot about how patriarchy keeps going among women - because a lot of them believe it's necessary, and depending on how a community is, they might actually need those protections.It also makes me re-think some of the talking points about how class intertwines with racial and gender politics.  I tend to roll my eyes at the commentators who think we should just talk about everything in terms of class, and write off racism and sexism as class problems.  I still think that oversimplifies it, but clearly it's a mistake to ignore how lack of opportunity does allow those ideas to fester.  Policies that give women more opportunities will also help them be more open to supporting equality, as well as being good ideas on their own merits.And who knows?  Maybe some of the guys will do the same thing.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 2, 2024"},{"text":"Im glad he did it","title":"White House says Trump wouldnt let go of Hunter Biden in defending pardon"},{"text":"We in the US unfortunately have a long history of fucking over our allies.

It's not like with normal people where you need information and facts to believe something, it's a religious delusion for these people.?\\nBelief requires nothing for them, no thought or reflection, just a feeling that something is true because their cult leader said it. But the kicker is that they can believe the complete opposite in a second, or even hold two completely opposing beliefs at the same time. Because truth is meaningless, they don't live in the real world, they live in a haze of bitter fury, too dumb to make sense of the world so they just believe their cult leaders like mindless drones.\\nYears ago during Trump's first term I saw a segment in CNN with Trump voters in the studio. I can't remember what the topic was, but one guy was vociferously arguing that Trump would never do a certain thing, ever, it was disgraceful to accuse him of it and that's why he likes him. Alisyn Camerota then told him Trump in fact said he'd do the complete opposite of that and the guy instantly flipped his position. They have no real principles, nothing tethering them to reality, Trump is always perfect.My own mother is how I know this. She'll angrily believe nonsense and if you ask her for a single reason why, she'll either say she can show a YouTube video about it or go weirdly silent like a robot from Westworld. Does constantly having it pointed out that her idiotic beliefs are based on nothing she can explain make her realise she shouldn't believe in them?\\nOf course not, it makes her even dumber, angrier, and more convinced she's right.

Biden's permission for Ukraine to use medium range missiles could have been a game-changer had it happened months ago, but it's likely too late to make that kind of difference now.            It seems to me the Biden Administration tried to use as much leverage as it could to try to get Ukraine to either devote more of its existing military to the fight (which I somewhat agree with), or to get the Zelenskyy government to conscript more, and younger, people. The fighting force has been around 200,000 (there have also been around 100,000 deserters) while about 500,000 more regular military troops haven't been involved in the conflict. Ukraine has said having more or their soldiers on the frontlines won't make a difference if they don't have materiel with which to fight, while the U.S. has sort of been \\"If they come, we will build it\\".                As sad as the plight of Ukraine is probably going to be, the worse thing is the Putin regime may have been no more than four or five months from collapse. Russia is suffering crippling stagflation as the war drains their treasury and sanctions have trashed the economy. The unrest in Georgia and Syria were going to be unwelcomed additional pain points that may have gone unanswered. Trump's re-election wasn't just a new lease on life for him, but it's going to save his boss, Vladimir and Putin isn't going to let Trump off the hook.               The Ukrainians have been brave and innovative fighters and they deserved our total support from Day One. The overcaution from Biden, and the Republican collaboration, allowed the clock to run out on Ukraine in the same way the clock ran out on Agent Orange. People have no idea, despite being told, the kind of fuckery they're going to experience.

Maybe every ten years. This court has overturned 6 major precedents in 6 years! And that's not to mention the other radical decisions its made. That was the point. If Dobbs were the only overhaul, it would be a different story, but it's a ton of other activist rulings pluse Dobbs. That said, there are two things to consider when considering Dobbs/Roe. One, why is it not reasonable for there to be a national-based right to a medical procedure like abortion? There is no movement to make each state decide whether people should be allowed to get prostate exams or mammograms. If one state decided to ban those procedureslet's say on the basis of modesty/belief that people should not be touched theresurely the SC would be open to ruling that that decision should fall under the per view of the individual and their doctor. Or would it be acceptable for residents of Virginia or Nevada or wherever to have to travel across state lines to see if they might have cancer? Second, is a court not supposed to consider it's impact on the people, on the politics? The Court basically in one day swooped its hands and took the right for a medical procedure away from millions of people. Even if you want to put that on individual state governments, the Court knew that there were trigger laws, lots of controversy, strong feelings on all sides. And still it decided that it was its job, despite the fact that it is unaccountable, politically biased, and unlikely to see any effects of its actions. Is that not the core of judicial activism? It could have made a stepping stone judgment, tightening the screws on Roe as conservative activists had tried to do for 50 years, but instead it decided that it was the power in America today. Not politicians, not the people, just 6 people in robes who think they know best. 1. The only way that it violates the 14th Amendment is if you subscribe to the belief in the harm of the impact, rather than the intent. The practice of affirmative action in admissions was intended to have a diverse class of students. That is a perfectly reasonable goal, lauded by the US military, by sociology (people with different experiences and perspectives make for a better whole), but the claim is that that intent, negatively impacted Asian applicants, who might have gotten in with a race-blind process. If you believe we should judge 14th Amendment issues based on harm/impact, rather than intent, that would mean more affirmative action (to address the harms borne by black Americans who are still far poorer than white or Asian Americans as a class). 2. Okay but in the case, Coach Kennedy prayed to the Christian god at his public school's football game half-times with other students and coaches. When the school board learned of it, they were willing to negotiate and said he could continue to pray in a less public setting as the middle of the field at half-time(despite him being, at that moment, a representative of a public school) or that the prayer would need to be student-led, without making students participate. He refused and continued to do his display of religiosity while being a public school coach. It caused a media circus and an incident where people felt like they were in real danger, but even then the school decided to put him on *paid* leave and simply to not renew his contract. The Supreme Court ruled that Coach Kennedy was in the right, the school was in the wrong. 3. I don't know what you're trying to say here. This court is the worst group of judicial activists since the 50s-60s. Even then, the court was trying to underline existing Constitutional law, not simply overturn precedents that they found politically frustrating. I don't expect this will make an impact on your view, but there is Fed Soc reality and then there is reality. You have to embrace the latter and spurn the former if you want to be a thoughtful person.","title":"CMV: Gorsuch is as good or better of a SC justice as Garland would have been"},{"text":"So the Fox News Triple Play? strikes yet again!","title":"Pete Hegseths secret history  A whistle-blower report and other documents suggest that Trumps nominee to run the Pentagon was forced out of previous leadership positions for financial mismanagement, sexist behavior, and being repeatedly intoxicated on the job."},{"text":"I truly can't bring myself to lose a wink of sleep over the Hunter Biden pardon thanks to MAGATS.","title":"Resurfaced Clip of Trump FBI Nominee Threatening to 'Come After' Media Goes Viral: 'Whether It's Criminally or Civilly, We'll Figure That Out'"},{"text":"And the Palestinians.","title":"What will happen to Zelenskyys Ukraine once Trump gets elected?"},{"text":"Absolutely, while Elong continues to take billions in federal subsidies","title":"prediction: Trump will further cut taxes on the rich and corporations, and the US federal deficit will stay huge.

For the sake of conversation, I'm going to just assume that they're actually interested in maintaining power and not just gutting the country for all it's worth and then bailing when there's nothing left to gut.What I'm worried about is this: when a regime seizes power and has trouble keeping it, bad shit happens to everyone- even people in the regime.  Historically speaking, in the best case scenario we'll have a poorly-run nation for a few years until these assholes piss everyone off and lose the next election (assuming we still get to have real ones).  In the worst case, they'll figure out that the easiest way to hang on to power is to make everyone afraid of even THINKING about opposing you, and punishing dissent in increasingly Draconian ways (think the Gulag system, Juche, or what went down in Cambodia in the 60s and 70s).  Most likely scenario, they'll figure out that actual governance is more complicated than \\"let's lie to everybody and blame our problems on our Scapegoat of the Month\\", and when they've run out of scapegoats and regular-ass people are truly suffering (and by \\"suffering\\", I don't mean \\"grocery prices are high\\"- use your imagination on that one), things will fall apart and we'll all be worse off for a few decades while the country tries to fix itself (assuming the country still exists at that point).

We need to hold people responsible. People who call on fellow Americans to pick up arms need to be held accountable. And we have never done that in our history, really for the right-wing.Maddow: One of the uncomfortable truths that you find in the dark corners of our history is that fascism happens, recurrently. Movements, and demagogues, and media figures and elected officials promote elements of fascism, antisemitism, hatred of minority groups and immigrants, worship of strongman leaders, wishing for the end to elections, the end to rule by law  it comes up, repeatedly. It has a certain appeal to a certain percentage of the country, in a fairly dependable way.And seeing that history of recurrence  in some ways, of course, its horrifying  but it can also be instructive and practical.Because previous generations of Americans have confronted this same type of threat before us. And learning what they did gives us some lessons learned about what works and what might not work.In a world that is always going to have some William Dudley Pelleys, we know that you can be a Leon Lewis. In a world thats going to have some Francis Morans, you can be a Frances Sweeney.In a world where the widow of the Nazi-connected Senator is calling up news organizations and berating them, telling them to spike their reporting, dont be the executive who agrees to do it.In a world where there will always be a Burton Wheeler, who throws his weight around, who leans on the Justice Department and tells them to fire the prosecutor who has him in their sights, dont be the Justice Department official who agrees, who caves, who fires the guy.Its not just one thing that works. It has to be everything.If theyre making war on the battlefield, you have to fight them in war and beat them.If theyre running for office, you have to fight them in elections and beat them.If theyre discrediting electoral politics and trying to make fascism seem like the cooler alternative, you have to defend electoral politics and make fascism seem as stupid and boring as it is.If theyre secretly organizing stuff to terrorize Americans, you need to infiltrate and investigate what theyre doing and make that secret stuff public  preferably in the most embarrassing possible way.And if they are doing crimes  they are usually doing crimes  prosecutors have to charge them. The criminal justice system cant do it all, but it does have to do its part.It all has to happen, all at once. There are no silver bullets.What was required then, in the 1940s, was all of it. It was the plucky, creative, heroic efforts of clever, brave Americans, journalists, activists, lawyers, people of faith, citizens of all stripes who came to democracys aid when it needed them the most.That is what got us through back then.And now, almost a full century later, we get to learn from what they left us. We inherit their work.

Our American criminal justice system is ill-equipped to defend democracy from those who seek to destroy it.End quote Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra |Episode 8: Ultra ViresBut we have never really openly as a country discussed right-wing danger. We need to hold people responsible. People who call on fellow Americans to pick up arms need to be held accountable. And we have never done that in our history, really for the right-wing.Maddow: One of the uncomfortable truths that you find in the dark corners of our history is that fascism happens, recurrently. Movements, and demagogues, and media figures and elected officials promote elements of fascism, antisemitism, hatred of minority groups and immigrants, worship of strongman leaders, wishing for the end to elections, the end to rule by law  it comes up, repeatedly. It has a certain appeal to a certain percentage of the country, in a fairly dependable way.And seeing that history of recurrence  in some ways, of course, its horrifying  but it can also be instructive and practical.Because previous generations of Americans have confronted this same type of threat before us. And learning what they did gives us some lessons learned about what works and what might not work.In a world that is always going to have some William Dudley Pelleys, we know that you can be a Leon Lewis. In a world thats going to have some Francis Morans, you can be a Frances Sweeney.In a world where the widow of the Nazi-connected Senator is calling up news organizations and berating them, telling them to spike their reporting, dont be the executive who agrees to do it.In a world where there will always be a Burton Wheeler, who throws his weight around, who leans on the Justice Department and tells them to fire the prosecutor who has him in their sights, dont be the Justice Department official who agrees, who caves, who fires the guy.Its not just one thing that works. It has to be everything.If theyre making war on the battlefield, you have to fight them in war and beat them.If theyre running for office, you have to fight them in elections and beat them.If theyre discrediting electoral politics and trying to make fascism seem like the cooler alternative, you have to defend electoral politics and make fascism seem as stupid and boring as it is.If theyre secretly organizing stuff to terrorize Americans, you need to infiltrate and investigate what theyre doing and make that secret stuff public  preferably in the most embarrassing possible way.And if they are doing crimes  they are usually doing crimes  prosecutors have to charge them. The criminal justice system cant do it all, but it does have to do its part.It all has to happen, all at once. There are no silver bullets.What was required then, in the 1940s, was all of it. It was the plucky, creative, heroic efforts of clever, brave Americans, journalists, activists, lawyers, people of faith, citizens of all stripes who came to democracys aid when it needed them the most.That is what got us through back then.And now, almost a full century later, we get to learn from what they left us. We inherit their work.

For you to try to label her as unstable for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you?

In a tight race, every non-vote for the better option effectively acts as a vote for the worse one. This means, in practice, **your non-vote contributed to the very outcome you claim to oppose**.Your decision reflects a rigid, na?ve adherence to moral absolutism and idealism. But the real world is not black and white. Politics is inherently complex, and navigating it often requires difficult compromises. **While I understand that voting for the status quo might feel like a betrayal of your values, abstaining isnt a neutral stanceits a passive decision with active consequences**.**Your refusal to vote allowed you to preserve a perception of moral superiority because you didnt support genocide.** But heres the truth: your choice not to vote for the less bad option directly enabled the worse option to win. And now, we are facing even greater harm because of that decision. You did voteinaction in this context is a voteand you voted for the worse candidate by failing to prevent them from gaining power.**Holding onto the belief that refusing to vote absolves you of responsibility is not a badge of honor; its a form of denial**. Real moral strength comes not from avoiding difficult decisions, but from making the best choice possible in imperfect circumstances. **True integrity lies in preventing greater harm, even when no option aligns perfectly with your ideals**.You must understand this: **there will rarely, if ever, be a good and bad choice in elections. There will only be lesser evils.** Strength of character is standing up against harm while preventing the worst possible outcome. **The only real moral high ground in an election is the willingness to fight for a better future by choosing the path that causes the least harm and enables the most good**.**By refusing to do this, you have not upheld your valuesyou have sacrificed them for the sake of preserving your sense of purity**. And that choice has real-world consequences for countless others. **It is something you must acknowledge and learn from if we are to avoid repeating this mistake**.","title":"Donald Trump declares Gaza will be hit harder than ever before and that there will be \\"hell to pay\\" for the entire Middle East if all the hostages aren't released with or without a ceasefire by the time he takes office"},{"text":"US also doesn't have that capacity.

At least as far as my understanding of US nuclear processes go, they get the order, input the code, which tells the missile where to go but the operators will not know the location at all. There are no coordinates involved in the process of actually launching it.The operators also don't get a \\"why\\" either. Russia could launch nukes right now and you only have a couple hours to react, so the entire line of communication has to be fast, efficient, and secure. So we could have our own bombs in the air 30 minutes after theirs are launched.My point being, the 2 guys required to launch a nuke, do not know the where or the why, in any instance, only who gave the order and when it was given.","title":"Donald Trump declares Gaza will be hit harder than ever before and that there will be \\"hell to pay\\" for the entire Middle East if all the hostages aren't released with or without a ceasefire by the time he takes office"},{"text":"Empathy.....come again?","title":"Trudeau told Trump Americans would also suffer if tariffs are imposed, a Canadian minister says"},{"text":"I work in law enforcement in Portland, OR ffs and didn't hear a single democrat here celebrating the rioting.

But for 90% of his filmography, he acts no different. Same thing over and over like hes Ryan Reynolds since Van Wilder.I love Casino, Goodfellas, and The Godfather Part II. I enjoyed Untouchables and Taxi Driver. But I see those movies a little differently now thanks to RDN tarnishing them with his TDS. Bobby Ds pal, Al Sonny Pacino, is the superior actor. Sonny might overact but hes better.De Niro is worse than Hamill because De Niro argues back with Trump supporters. Then remember when he said on stage, Fk Trump? Fk Robert De Niro.

Nope!Mark Hamill is another piece of work.[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784138/Ex-girlfriend-Mark-Hamill-s-son-says-Star-Wars-actor-tried-force-abortion.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784138/Ex-girlfriend-Mark-Hamill-s-son-says-Star-Wars-actor-tried-force-abortion.html)Hamills career has mostly been an abortion, anyway. He was a WEAK lead in Star Wars in the first place. Harrison Ford was the real star of that OG trio. Hence, why he also became Indiana Jones, one of the GOATs of movie heroes. I was never a fan of Luke Skywalker. I was always a Han guy. And I will never care for Luke Skywalker or Mark Hamill. Dude became a B star loser.The other pieces of shits are the entire cast of The View, Rob Meathead Reiner, and George Lopez. Fk George Lopez, especially. His ex-wife donated a kidney to save his life only for him to cheat on her with hookers and divorce her.https://preview.redd.it/jt7atb75zi4e1.jpeg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa56108f56f8a521ccbee66cf0fe466de3276277","title":"Out of all the shitbags the most vocal is now silent.

I wouldnt quite describe it as being taken care of, just that we have the means to take care of it if necessary (albeit with disastrous secondary effects on the ecosystem, but global cooling would be one result), or are heavily researching more sustainable means currently. An eruption of Yellowstone, for example, would noticeably cool the earth. It would also disrupt agricultural production for a couple decades and lead to starvation in resource-strapped areas, but it would serve as a buffer for climate changeperhaps long enough for a sustainable solution to be implemented, if necessary. Its not ideal, but we have options.Id recommend checking out a sci-fi book called Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. As part of its plot, it optimistically explores humanitys response to a global cooling event that threatens to cause the extinction of humanity within about 13 years. Humans are capable of great things if push comes to shove.","title":"CMV: Our global society is turning to a dumpster-fire due to pollution, animal cruelty, fossil fuel extraction, political/social polarization, new technologies being used to commit unspeakable injustices, and other harms."},{"text":"I followed Montana Skeptics coverage of this case before the election.

The prime minister said the UK would never turn away from its relationship with the US, despite the difficulties the new administration could pose, as it had been the cornerstone of security and prosperity for over a century. Yet he would also continue to reset Britains relationship with Europe, the countrys biggest trading partner, he said, after years of neglect post-Brexit, as strong bilateral links were vital for growth and security. Against the backdrop of these dangerous times, the idea that we must choose between our allies, that somehow were with either America or Europe, is plain wrong, he said.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/02/starmer-rejects-false-choice-between-trumps-us-and-eu-in-key-speechThe Telegraph is very anti-Labour and prone to gross editorialisation and it's trying to shit stir, hence how Starmer saying \\"we need to work with both\\" becomes \\"STARMER WARNS TRUMP!\\".","title":"British Prime Minister Starmer warns Trump: Britain will not side with America against the EU"},{"text":"We also screwed up allowing consolidation of so many radio stations and channels.

An egalitarian, feminist society is superior to any type of patriarchy, but I think that the current mainstream of American masculinity is *especially* toxic and has traits and influences that differentiate it from other cultures.For one, emotional suppression has not always been the norm in male-dominated societies. If you look at Ancient Greece and Rome, for example, you can see that men there were not only expected to be psychotic businessmen or Gruff action heroes, but to experience the full range of human emotions. Sure, men were expected to have near full control over their families, but they were able to express emotions and were required to act somewhat honorably. If we applied modern American masculinity to the Greco-Roman world, instead of Alexander wept for there were no more worlds to conquer, wed have gotten Alexander was a true sigma and hustle his way to the Indus River without being a pussy ass bitchIm not idolizing the Greco-Roman world or saying that it was better than the modern world, not by a long shot. In addition to terrible inequality between the genders, there was also everything from slavery to no antibiotics. But I think that one thing that we can learn from their culture or many historical cultures is that in social interactions, it wasnt seen as cool or encouraged to just be a dick, at least not in the open like today. (In the context of their time I mean. Greco-Roman men still beat their wives and kept slaves, but there were standards to at least treat ones peers well in public.)What we see in modern American masculinity is a concerted, anti-intellectual, subversive movement among the manosphere to just be a dick. Like actively try to screw people over by hustling, flaunt your wealth, and just be what even many mainstream to right wing people in modern society would consider being an arrogant douchebag. It has influences like the cutthroat business culture of the 80s and internet culture more broadly, but I think that a lot of American men are falling down the right wing rabbit hole because it tells them that they are great for just existing, their only purpose in life is to make a ton of money and preserve that wealth while flaunting it, and that women and anyone that doesnt agree with you is not worth your time. Theyre just a cuck or a beta male so why bother?This isnt the first country or moment where being a terrible person is so openly encouraged, but I think that the manosphere is the most blatant. Even Southern slavers were believers in their own idea of chivalry as they perpetuated some of the worst crimes against humanity imaginable.This is what I dont know how to address. How do we get people to understand, no, you cant just be a dick? How do we get people to listen to us when they think that we are evil or degenerate? Theres probably stuff we can do like community-oriented solutions, but this problem will take so long to scrub from our culture.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 2, 2024"},{"text":"Putin is ROFLing","title":"British Prime Minister Starmer warns Trump: Britain will not side with America against the EU"},{"text":"Thats spicy, I like it","title":"White House says Trump wouldnt let go of Hunter Biden in defending pardon"},{"text":"I had a woman tell me the media made up his convictions.

This system was to be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.  The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds central banks which were themselves private corporations.-Carroll Quigley*Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time, 1966*","title":"Trump said he was going to bring peace to the Middle East.

The entire planet could go green tomorrow and all of the issues besides that will still remain. We could cease all international shipping and travel and fossil fuels would still be acquired and used worldwide.While yes, by current estimations, climate change is irreversible, that wont always be the case. Carbon capture technology, plankton blooms, blotting out the sun if we have tosolutions are possible, if unlikely and blunted by a lack of cooperation. Even despite all of these environmental issues, efforts to curb them have been raised everywhere from the local to national level, all around the globe. Incumbents and progressives lost their elections worldwide, which spells a dire short term fate for the environment, but efforts will be made to reverse the problem when politicians homes begin to sink. When renewable energy inevitably becomes more profitable (or procurable) than fossil fuels, corporations will make the switch. Amazon just spent hundreds of millions on swapping their trucks in the US to electric, for example.
