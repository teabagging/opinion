One could argue that Democrats, with their emphasis on pathways to citizenship and stricter labor regulations, are actually the party of legal immigration. On the other hand, Republicans, with their historical ties to business interests and laissez-faire economic policies, may be seen as the party of illegal immigration. By maintaining a pool of undocumented workers, businesses can exploit this underclass for cheap labor, thereby undermining labor standards and keeping costs low. This dynamic creates a perverse incentive for Republicans to tolerate, if not outright encourage, illegal immigration, as it serves the interests of their corporate donors. Meanwhile, Democrats' push for legalization and worker protections threatens to disrupt this exploitative system, which may explain why some Republicans are so vehemently opposed to comprehensive immigration reform.","title":"Musk, Ramaswamy defend Silicon Valleys foreign-born hires"},{"text":"Loomer-tic","title":"SHOCKING: Laura Loomer Mocks Elon Musk and Donald Trump"},{"text":"I could have done a better job separating them but I think it works in reverse.

A modifying clause that follows two or more items is only read to apply to the last item (in this case \\"involuntary servitude\\") rather than the whole list (Statutory Canon of Last Antecedent). Involuntary servitude, which doesn't involve loss of personhood/citizenship and has limitations as to duration and scope, is allowable as punishment for a law, most notably as community service. The writers of the 13th Amendment were very clear it was meant to permanently ban slavery in all forms.There is, Mr. President, an essential difference between the emancipation of slaves and the abolition of slavery. The act of Congress of 17th July, 1862, set free certain classes of slaves. The President's proclamation of January 1, 1863, proclaimed freedom to those of certain districts. Both were measures of emancipation. The concerned the persons of slaves, and not the institution of slavery. Whatever their force and extent, no one pretends they altered or abolished the laws of servitude in any of the slave States. They rescued some of the victims, but they left the institution otherwise untouched. They let out some of the prisoners, but did not tear down the hated prison. They emancipated, let go from the hand, but they left the hand unlopped, to clutch again such unfortunate creatures as it could lay hold upon. This amendment of the Constitution is of wider scope and more searching operation. It goes deep into the soil, and upturns the roods of this poisonous plant to dry and wither. It not only sets free the present slave, but it provides for the future, and makes slavery impossible so long as this provision shall remain a part of the Constitution.Again, the modern prison labor system absolutely does need to be reformed, but if you claim that the 13th Amendment allows slavery then you're shooting yourself in the foot. If it allows slavery, then what they're doing is legal and can't be changed without a Constitutional amendment. If it doesn't (which it doesn't), then we can start demanding change now.","title":"These MAGA farmers could be ruined if Trump follows through with mass deportations"},{"text":"You still don't get it - Congress will not be giving it up, trump simply will ignore it and no one will stop him.

But OPs post doesnt explain what the US should expect to receive in exchange for providing that service. The next paragraph submits, as an example, the plight of Haitian migrants, as asylum seekers; but it appears to be in reference to specific, local scenarios where we can absolutely have a meaningful impact by accepting refugees. *Asylum seekers are different than refugees, btw, they occupy two different immigrant classifications under US code. Back to the service to the world point, Im going to have to guess that OP either suggested admiration as a tangible benefit. To wit, because we dont take in enough refugees, we dont win the worlds respect for the act; therefore, we should abandon the practice. But I am not sure why the amount of refugees the US takes in is a given, as opposed to a variable. The democratically elected US government leaders chose to limit the amount of refugees the country takes in, presumably because there is low public interest in inbound migration for purely humanitarian purposes.If there were more public interest in it, there likely would be more refugee admissions to the US. Whether there are refugee admissions on a meaningful scale is a choice.Arguments that are premised on a variable or a choice, as opposed to a given, are *illusory*. For example, a similar line of argument to your logic could be, Efforts to introduce aggressive gun control laws for handguns are meaningless because US constitution law provides that possessions of handguns is an inalienable right for citizens.This ignores the reality that DC v Heller, the landmark 2008 ruling by SCOTUS on gun rights was a 5-4 decision or that precedents, like Roe v Wade (1973), 7-2 decision, can be overturned based on the political preference of contemporary key policy makers.Thus  just as your premise appears to be illusory, my strawman gun rights illustration is also illusory.A viewpoint that is illusory cannot be valid. It necessitates a change of view, or a correction, so that it has complete logic.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Right - less diversity will be good for us in the U.S.  after all, late night discussions with people from all over the world will just erode your social media time and make it harder to get up for that 9am class.","title":"US universities urge international students to return to campus before Trump inauguration"},{"text":"I said they TYPICALLY want to live in the US afterwards. 73% do!

I work in construction and have seen firsthand how undocumented workers actually help maintain higher wages when they're organized and know their rights. Many join unions despite their status.You're looking at this backwards. Exploitation happens because these workers lack legal protections, not because they're here. When workers can't report wage theft or unsafe conditions, it drives down standards for EVERYONE. Making their presence legal would eliminate the exploitation you're concerned about. The only people who truly benefit off of Illegal immigration are the wealthy that exploit them for their laborThis is just factually wrong. Studies show immigration creates new businesses and jobs. In my city, immigrant communities revitalized entire neighborhoods that were previously abandoned. They're not just workers - they're entrepreneurs and consumers too. There is, at the same time, no real benefit we provide the world on a meaningful scale by accepting refugeesTell that to my neighbor who escaped gang violence in El Salvador and now runs a successful restaurant employing 15 people. Or the Ukrainian family down the street who started a tech company after fleeing the war.Your stance of refusing to discuss legal immigration reform while complaining about illegal immigration is completely contradictory. The solution to exploitation isn't fewer immigrants - it's giving them legal status and enforcing labor laws.

He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans took advantage of both opportunities to blame their opponents for the economic consequences.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump admin crippled the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize everything pandemic related, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*To elaborate more on Trump's tariffs:Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations, things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved, and risks that Trump failed to take into account. Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources to manage the fallout. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesTrump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the outcomes are estimated to be costly for most Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump is not an \\"economic genius,\\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. Trump has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.He has profited off of screwing over people who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties for decades, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.Trump is not a financial guru, his admin's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.The next Trump admin, which is already the richest in U.S. history, will destroy what's left of a labor movement that's been in steady decline ever since Reagan's presidency. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of union workers, when he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.And over the next four years, Trump's MAGA coalition will continue their efforts to redistribute wealth to the top.Even Trump's immigration policie, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"Trumps Tariff Threats Are Setting Off a Global Supply Chain Freakout"},{"text":"Does he think bitcoin is a physical coin?","title":"Trumps made in USA bitcoin vow not based in reality"},{"text":"Theyll be penniless and on the street and still blame the shitlibs.","title":"Am I the only one who wants Trump supporters to suffer?

They run Biden, hiding him from voters, when he is clearly projected to lose in a landslide against Trump and is declining with age. Switching to Harris was somewhat savvy  the options were limited late in the game. But even so, we got a prosecutor who never generated much political enthusiasm in the past and couldnt differentiate herself from an unpopular administration (fair or not). But the both-sides fallacy and rampant cynicism about political choices being inconsequential is killing us.

They have been picking away at it for years. Vouchers were originally sold with the idea that some parents pay for public schools but send their kids to private schools and deserve to get that portion of their taxes back to pay for the education of their kids. Education funding started being slashed by the Reagan administration in the 1980s. So public school quality started to suffer. That continues to this day. The Democrats have been complicit. As quality declined, charter schools started becoming more common. In most cases, charter schools don't use union teachers. They also aren't held to the same testing requirements in many cases. Since charter schools are owned by corporations, many politicians hold stock in them. So, moving the money around is basically a Ponzi scheme. Parents who home school their kids also sometimes receive public education rebates. The state is still providing education. They just rely on charter schools, religious schools, and home school parents to do the work. It's a good deal for everyone except the taxpayers and the public schools.","title":"School vouchers remain a GOP priority even as voters reject them"},{"text":"Takes time to ram through the death penalty.","title":"Aileen Cannon grants suspect in Trump assassination attempt a trial delay"},{"text":"Bad move\\nKeepin  My Mercedes","title":"Ford and GM to donate $1 million, vehicles to Trumps inauguration"},{"text":"Apparently they missed those parts of the Bible where God kept punishing his people for worshipping golden idols.

Thats why their plan makes sense - deport the actual citizens of another country and then ask them if they want the kids to stay or go. \\nCan there be a mistake? Sure, I suppose; but this wont be en masse and those people will eventually get it sorted out. Even Obama deported 3 million people. \\nSecond, 0 chance of retroactive.

Why are they protecting Trump all of a sudden?"},{"text":"Agreed. Things were slowly improving on a social level for a long time in the most general sense. 200 years ago we had slavery. 100 years ago women couldn't vote. We've moved forward. But in the past couple decades we have been backsliding and it is getting worse. Obama passing the ACA was the *visible* peak of power moving towards Dems. Now it's been receding ever since. Dems did not adapt to the internet. Putin did then Republicans followed. Dems still think traditional politics can win, but they can't. They also haven't figured out trump's game yet, and they fall into all of his traps. Just like the media does. Dems need to start playing as dirty as Republicans IMO. I don't mean the junk like taking bribes and fighting to help our enemies. But I mean conservatives have successfully astroturfed half the internet. Mainly, Dems need to change the way they attack trump and republicans, and do a lot more of it. Right now they try to appeal to people's sense of justice and morality by being the \\"good guys\\" and point out how evil trump is. But trump's fans love his supposed bad boy image. Just like most libs liked Biden's \\"Dark Brandon\\" thing more than the regular nice Biden - not that he did much Dark Brandon stuff but people sure liked the *idea* of a Biden playing hardball and smacking down the republicans. Mainly they need much better PR. In 2025 you gotta scream the same basic ideas over and over and over and over to cut through all the noise. Simplify the message. Stop attacking trump on every minor little goofy thing he says - that's why he says them. Focus solely on his failures and never, ever, ever let them fade from the public eye. And learn to meme. And by god Dems need to win some rural voters. They don't need to win the majority but like how trump is getting a few more % of the black and latino votes, each bit helps a ton. Right now everything past the suburbs is 99% solid red and not willing to change. Dems gotta run spoiler candidates like republicans do. Run a bunch of right leaning libertarians in purple states and districts to take votes from Republicans. In fact, I personally want a libertarian candidate/group to gain actual real power. Left/right is nowhere near as important to me as authoritarian/democratic, and the authoritarianism has always been the worst thing about Republicans. Real libertarianism has far more in common with the current Democrats than the current republicans. I think that social media is such a massive disrupter in politics that we are in a new era. And Dems and liberals and progressives have not adjusted while globally the right wing has. Dems are also way behind because of voter suppression and gerrymandering and how the Senate and EC work. This is why losing the rural vote hurts so much. When Dems and Republicans split the vote 50/50, Republicans win big. Look at NC - Dems won the popular vote in the state legislature 52-47% but Republicans ended up just like 1 seat shy of another supermajority. That has to end, by \\"voting harder\\" or by doing it the way the Founding Fathers did it when England denied them proper representation. Or somewhere in between. Whatever it takes, we are talking about people's lives and people's rights. I live in SC, which was blue 25 years ago. Once Republicans gain control they put 100% of their effort into locking in power permanently by changing the laws to make it so Dems can't win. Dems have to break this because it is what trump is attempting to do nationally and he is most of the way there. Also, Dems need to find a fucking monster stud of a presidential candidate. Not a nice guy. Someone that people see as a strong leader who doesn't take shit. But also someone who truly *doesn't take shit.* But also someone who appeals to the average person, not just to leftists and college professors and whatnot. Not someone like Biden and Harris who think the voters will just see that they are the better option without them spelling it out over and over. That really is the biggest failure of Dems - they can't seem to just spend time bragging about their victories. Biden did so many things he could have been shouting from the rooftops but no one knows he did them. And he basically didn't even talk to people about the economy until it was WAY too late and the GOP had already written the entire narrative. Anyway, Dems desperately need to shift gears and get with the new politics. They don't even have to jettison the old guard - Pelosi and Biden and that crowd are excellent statesmen (or statespeople if that's a word) and are great at negotiating things with other politicians behind closed doors. But they have lost the voters by being completely out of touch, and are way too worried about their personal success vs. success of the party or the people (looking at you, Clyburn). And culturally, liberals and progressives and social libertarians and everyone else who would potentially vote (D) are divided and scattered and no one is unifying them. Putin works to divide us and trump works to unite the far right and scare the center-right into accepting him as a \\"better\\" alternative to the \\"communist\\" Democrats.","title":"Hakeem Jeffries pulls off a pre-Trump power play"},{"text":"America has 210 million self-described \\"Christians\\" according to a quick google.So, the number of people signing this petition is roughly *zero point zero zero seven percent* of them.That's one in fourteen thousand practising Christians denouncing the guy.

Perfect pay them 100k and suddenly people line up.

How can a soldier in good conscience obey an order from an illegitimate Commander in Chief?  Every use of military power will become a constitutional crisis, as every member of the military has sworn to uphold the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.\\n2. Will any of the bills Trump signs be actual law?  It seems to me that the courts will flood with clever lawyers arguing that the laws he signs are illegitimate.\\n3. The appropriation bills he signs - can they actually authorize money, or will government checks start to bounce?\\n4. Presidential memoranda.  Same problem.\\n5. Will all foreign nations negotiate with him?  I could see a country rejecting talks on the grounds they are illegitimate.There are a ton of smaller issues - pay, occupation of the White House, and so on - but these pale in comparison to these 5.Note to Democrats - Congress needs to vote to remove the disqualification before Biden steps down on inauguration day.  The country needs a legitimate President.  If it's Trump, that's fine, if it's Vance, that's fine too, but whoever it is needs to be in good legal standing.

Trade initially existed to increase the general value of an overall society. Trade should also increase general value for people who participate in the activity.  Trade is not promoted so some people can accrue massive incomes and lead lives of leisure at the expense of others.   Trade that exists simply to make a comfortable living possible for the seller is not so much trade. As it is predatory consumerism. Trade at least used to be promoted to increase a society's potential to produce and sustain citizens with the aim of human thriving.   Those citizens would ultimately make society valuable by living value-adding lives.  If as a result of that process, some can live lives of leisure that is wonderful.  But not the raison d'etre of trade. I think that people who sell things should be selling things that add value to some sector of my life.  Making this post has shown me that most people don't seem to care whether what they pay for has such an impact. That is unfortunate and may be why we live in an unstable country of dissatisfied individuals.  People seem eager to earn and spend for the sake of it regardless of what impact that earning and spending has.  I don't think strong reporting will ever be so attractive that any significant sector of the country will pay for it.

But some News is not subscriber-only. Some news still uses advertising alone to stay afloat.  Yes it probably has more clickbait. But comparing The WSJ and NYTimes to Fox or the NYPost shows me that they are both generally reporting the same information.    \\nSaving 500 dollars from a WSJ subscription and putting in an index fund is probably way better for me than reading about the culture war the editorial board is waging.  Corruption is mostly legal in America per the radical Supreme Court majority we have.  Recently they reviewed some rulings that released several of obviously corrupt politicians who took bribes from business' under another spurious legal theory. Such as \\"money is speech\\"  Even the left is loosing corrupt judges like Michael Conohan without explanation.  According to most western nations what they consider corruption is simply sound business in our country.  Which is why we are considered a flawed democracy.  Despite having what people claim is a vibrant free press.  I don't think reporting about corruption helps. The news isn't the society moving lever it claims to be.   \\nWhat costly mistake could one make without paying for good reporting?  What mistake might you make by skipping the news?  What opportunities have you seized in the past year that were revealed to you by a subscriber-only newspaper? Which poor decisions might you have made that you were saved from making from a subscriber-funded news source?Honestly I can't think of any. We all know that fumes from melting plastic spatulas aren't good for us. I don't need the NYTimes for such revelations.   I also know that people who normally support Democrats don't think their worth supporting anymore. I don't need a well-paid reporter to tell me that. Don't get me wrong. I pay for several subscriptions.  There are a few edge cases where I might have saved a couple bucks here or there from a story advising consumers to negotiate more aggressively for car insurance or something. But in the grand scheme of things, this does not change my life.  The news provides talking points so I sound well-adjusted and alert to my coworkers.  They would forgive me if I only talked about my personal recreation and information found in traditional books. If anything its just frustrating because all of the issues and inequity that is reported leads to little or no change. Not to mention the fact that come election time. It is near impossible to learn a single thing about a local politician.  Whether it be their goals in office, their prior decisions in office or their missed targets.  I'm lucky if I can find a picture of some of the people running for local positions.  Beyond that their beliefs and ideas are a mystery to me.  Even at the congressional level most politicians provide nothing but a link to donate on their sites.  The news produces no profiles or useful summaries of their activities.  Furthering providing their lack of practical utility.  Occasionally a regional paper will do some interviews and include a paragraph or two summary of the discussion.  But that isn't helpful when electing someone to a two year term who may have vast powers that I am unaware of.","title":"CMV: If news papers demand payment for reporting.

The sale price of a pineapple ranges from $7-19 a box. The labor cost is about $5 a box (plus freight/shipping costs). If the price of pineapples go under $5, it no longer is worth picking and picking a pineapple would cost more than letting it rot. If labor shortage was an immediate problem, then the cost of labor would rise, and the average cost for a commodity would soar providing more room to increase the amount paid on labor. It would reduce the consumers for that commodity, and the growing areas would shrink. So a farmer who feeds 100k people and makes 10% of let's say that $7.00 item, would now feed 10k people with a $70 item. The farmer doesn't feel the impact, unless he actually cares about people consuming fruits and vegetables. The guys who founded Walmart or Costco believed in volume as the best way to make a sustainable company. Walmart was focused on reducing costs and pressuring their suppliers to deliver low prices, Costco believed in treating their employees well, their vendors well, and the result would be customers being treated well.The trump model is about selling gold to 1% of the population and as a result he's had several companies go bankrupt. The wealthy customer is a bad customer, they don't listen to ads, they don't have loyalty to brands. It's a failed philosophy that's not sustainable, but these farmers are tired of dealing with labor, and would rather let employees be laid off even if it results in their companies folding.

I think some of the back-sliding that the middle class has experienced could have been prevented. If so many Americans were not obsessed with escaping reality through entertainment seeking. Because therapeutic entertainment will never improve a person's life.  It promotes a docile posture that makes an individual an easy mark.Thats the problem with American capitalism. It has leaned on consumerism rather than the foundation of economic price theory.  Prices are supposed to be the most efficient communication channel for information.  I should know what does and does not add value based on the prices of goods. That is supposed to be the magic/ strength of capitalism.  When you pervert that model. With consumerism which thrives on extracting as much money as possible from consumers without delivering value adds. You get the unproductive non society improving capitalism we have now.  Where the seller who simply collects the most payments is king. Not the seller that delivers the most value.  You should look into *The Rise and Fall of America Growth.* The author details how massive value-adding innovations that built our global dominance has generally stopped.  Things like running water, the combustion engine, home-delivered electricity and modern sewage disposal.  These things kick started unprecedented economic growth that made the middle class aristocracy of the 50's through 70's possible.  People want America to be great again. But for that to happen we need to stop rewarding those who make useless expensive gadgets that are addicting and attractive. These products block us from accumulating human capital and becoming better.  Even the semi-conductor failed to deliver the kind of growth that the aforementioned innovations provided.  We have a pernicious consumers economy that predates on malaise by selling expensive knick knacks that can't make people smarter more innovative or more valuable.  So much so that Wall St now destroys any company that can't regularly generate ever-increasing profits every 90 days during an earnings call.  Making it impossible for helpful and value-adding products to get investment. Because there is no short-term profit potential.  Countless CEO's have admitted to divesting in employees and longterm growth to satisfy Wall St investors. The news is dying.  I will pay for it.  But I will not subsidize it like Bezos.  Our society is generating more and more poverty not well-heeled individuals that can sustain subscription-driven reporting.  I don't criticize the news out of disdain. I do it out of fear that they will not be able to exist in a consumerist economy that rewards the loudest most disruptive sellers. Not the most productive value-adding ones.   \\nI want someone to change my view that they can survive. But the prevalence of news diffusion through social media. Along with the death of almost all local papers makes me think they can not exist in the valueless consumer economy we have.","title":"CMV: If news papers demand payment for reporting.

That's a flaw against the ideal, but also an avenue for better discourse and democracy as opposed to a constant stalemate if no one ever budges on anything. The problem is that Trump will expect current congressmen and other big political players to crucify her. And if they don't, he either starts a war with them as well or goes extrajudicial and she somehow ends up atop - and very soon after, at the bottom of - a very tall building. I want to say that last sentence was hyperbolic, but I honestly can't be sure. In that formula, Trump has been a constant for the last decade, mitigated only by allies who are hard-right on paper, but fall short of Trump's darker wishes that he'd gleefully employ at will if he had the backing.

Because it seems like fewer people every year will have the disposable income for such products.  So if a person can't expect to save a significant sum of money from a newspaper subscription. How can they be expected to give the minimal amount of disposable income they do have. To a paper that is mostly providing entertainment and distraction not measurable value adds? Since an increasing majority of our population is lower income and is going to stay lower income for the majority of their lives. In a few years I wouldn't be surprised to see Bezos claim that \\"people don't trust the post enough to pay for it. So it can't exist anymore and I am closing it\\".

Generally speaking news has always been funded by advertisers. But now that the internet makes it more efficient to advertise on social media.  The lifeline for traditional reporting is wearing thin and looks as if it is on the brink of snapping.I want local journalism to be revived.  Because national papers can not provide information on local politics that voters need to make informed decisions. The problem is that corporations have made running a small business next to impossible because a small business can not overcome the savings that economies of scale produce.  Without those business almost no one has any interest in advertising enough at a local level to support local newspapers. In at least every American county.National papers can barely get by just on ad income. So reporters need a better value proposition than what they have been promoting lately.

But I used to not and I know I am not better off or better able to conduct my life than when I ignored it.  It largely serves as a distraction.  Unfortunately, the US opened the door for Putin's invasion.  By haphazardly invading Vietnam and Iraq. We claim to support a less violent \\"rules-based order\\" but only when we we're willing to keep our thumbs off the scales.  I never agreed with these conflicts but since I didn't prevent them and am a citizen I have to own them.   That double standard makes Putin's aggression seem less controversial to the rest of the world and posterity. This is evidenced by many uninterested nations not bending over backward for Ukraine. Since the US is leading the propaganda offensive against Putin. While acting as if we have never violated the \\"rules-based\\" model we expect other nations to follow. Regardless I don't need to know about Ukraine. I can't help them, I have no army.  Same with Israel.  The information I learned about COVID was mostly wrong at the end of the pandemic.  I have no problem with the Trump victory. I mention it to demonstrate that honest reporting on the man's issues did not serve as the lever. Defenders of the media would like you to think their reporting serves as. Trump is hilarious and will make the next 4 years rather entertaining. Biden is pathetic to watch and regardless of why, Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump won in 2020.  Which would have given Ukraine more time to strengthen its economy to mount a more effective defense. Trump demonstrates the bankruptcy of our society and its supposed greatness.  I think he is an excellent representative for our nation because he is more relatable to Americans than the leaders who control this country.  He is also representative of the perverse incentives that drive our society. Its high time the world sees us for what we are.  Not an efficient highly effective society capable of almost anything. But a sclerotic gerontocracy of overmarketed strengths that we simply lack and wish he had. Trump is right on a few things even if he is wrong on most things.  I have no animosity for the man and bet he's a hell of a time at a party.  His obsession with being the best at everything is sad for a man his age but I can learn to ignore it.  I want my view changed because I want local journalism to be revived. But when national journalism offers such a weak value proposition.  I don't think it can ever exist locally or even nationally for the foreseeable future. The largesse of billionaires may not be around to keep newspapers alive forever.","title":"CMV: If news papers demand payment for reporting.

You believe we can just sit back and wait for things to get bad enough that people will finally take action, but I'm telling you, that's a recipe for disaster. The damage that's being done to our democratic institutions and norms is not something that can be easily reversed. We're talking about decades, generations even, of rebuilding and restoration.And let's not forget, history has shown us what happens when we let authoritarianism take hold. It's not just a matter of \\"oh, we can just fix it later.\\" The consequences are real, and they're devastating. I'm not just talking about some hypothetical scenario, I'm talking about the very real possibility of descending into an oligarchic sewer, where the rule of law is meaningless and the powerful do whatever they want.You say humans are just the same apes we've always been, but that's a cop-out. Our societal structures and institutions matter, and they can either help us rise above our baser tendencies or enable them. By allowing the erosion of democratic norms and institutions, we're creating a perfect storm for our worst impulses to take over.I'm not being a \\"bleeding-heart idealist\\" when I warn about the dangers of inaction. I'm being a pragmatist who understands the stakes. We need to think critically about the long-term implications of our actions, and we need to take action to prevent the kind of brutal tyranny that's happening in other countries. It's not about being optimistic or pessimistic, it's about being realistic and taking responsibility for our future. So, let's stop pretending like we can just wait for things to get bad enough, and let's start taking action to protect our democracy and our way of life.","title":"Congress has the power to block Trump from taking office, but lawmakers must act now."},{"text":"Problem is everyone seems to have adhd these day.

Dont forget a significant number of Bernie supporters broke for Trump over the corrupt establishment, they will most certainly back a leftist. The way to handle it for Trump is to ensure no further widening of the income and wealth gap. Per exit polls, he received significantly higher support among people making under $100k median household income vs in the higher bracket over $100k (specifically in $30-100k range, so the lower side of the middle class). He needs to make sure the standard of living doesnt drop for those people. Can he do it? I dont know. I fear the rich have more to gain from the tax cuts and deregulation.

Your argument is that being pro-choice devalues life, and therefore murder is OK. The problem is that you're wrong about the pro-choice view, and frankly in a very asinine way. Pro-choice people don't support abortion because think murder is OK. They support abortion because they don't see abortion as murder. They don't see an early-term fetus as a human being. Neither side of the abortion argument thinks murdering a born baby, or any human thereafter, is OK, and frankly, any pro-choice person you made that argument to would be rightly offended. At that point you would be back to just debating abortion.My last point here is to return to my original evidence. If it is your view that being pro-choice leads to glorifying the UHC murder and being pro-life does not, then there should be a partisan divide among the people, which simply does not exist. From Wikipedia because I'm lazy:The BBC reported that the lack of pity for Thompson expressed online \\"seemed to bridge the political divide\\".[158] Prominent conservative commentators, like Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh, received online backlash from their viewership for condemning the criticism of Thompson and for portraying it as an exclusively leftist sentiment.[139][159] The Network Contagion Research Institute found that out of the top ten most-engaged tweets that mention Thompson or UnitedHealth, six of the posts implicitly or explicitly supported the killing or criticized Thompson. Some highlighted comments called for class war;[160] a researcher at the institute said that \\"the framing of this incident as some opening blow in a class war and not a brutal murder is especially alarming.\\"[132]Support for Mangiones actions has come plenty from both sides of the political aisle. You can try to draw this conceptual link if you want, but that doesn't make it based in reality. The actual evidence would suggest that there is no correlation between being whether someone is pro-choice or pro-life and being pro-Mangione. That links back to my previous point that there is no tradeoff in denying someone health care. Both sides think denying someone health care is wrong.","title":"CMV: The pro-choice ethical framework, with its emphasis on bodily autonomy and healthcare access, directly contributes to the celebration of individuals like Luigi Mangione, and this is morally wrong."},{"text":"He will be as diligent as his wife was, Im sure.","title":"US universities urge international students to return to campus before Trump inauguration"},{"text":"Nothing will happen, they will make huge carve outs for the farming industry, it will be illegals are bad, but ok for farming.

Culture from the 90s was chock full of Western superiority, casual racism, sexism, and homophobia couched in faux progressive values, the edges sanded off by the slightly more progressive attitude that exists among the creative set and the pragmatic bent of the moneyed class who, while being themselves largely conservative, were adept at assimilating into the system anything that looked enough like a threat to their true goal of making as much money as humanly possible.They didnt care that they were compromising their own strong conservative values in favour of a form of milquetoast center left acceptance.Non-white people (particularly African Americans with their rapidly rising cultural cache), homosexuals, women with actual character; art has represented these people for centuries to greater or lesser extent, but capitalism made them profitable and so we started to see them more, though usually filtered through the lens of rich white men, perhaps tilted slightly more in the favour of liberalism by an actual artist or two somewhere down the line, but usually just enough not to alienate the core market.They became part of the fantasy. Black actors and musicians rose to prominence, started actually getting leading roles and dominating certain cultural spaces, but this was all from behind a TV screen. They, like other marginalised groups, became mere curiosities to most, a woman as an action hero was a concept that could play in hollywood, because hollywood was a place of unreality as far as the average person was concerned. It didnt mean that men suddenly started seeing their daughters, sisters, or wives as more capable and deserving of their respect. Every black star was one of the good ones and totally distinct from the average black person the average white person might see in their day to day lives.?One thing that was taking place in 70s/80s/90s was the proliferation of media outside of the traditional cultural machine. We were allowed glimpses of counterculture before it was subsumed into the system and became a toothless parody of itself (one thing capitalism struggles with is that with a consumer class comes consumer technology, consumer grade technology allows the consumers to become cultural producers, and if they are able to break into the market and start profiting, they are able to expand their reach, the good thing for the moneyed classes is that everything is for sale, even counterculture, thus the hippy movement, punk, avant garde, outsider art, hip hop, protest music; anything that meant anything, and even things which didnt really mean much at all, art for the sake of art, it all comes to mean money in the end)?Add to that the fact that gen X was not making media for gen X, they were making media for Millennials, for kids. The 90s was, in my opinion, the first real manifestation of that cultural wasteland we now live in. By the 90s the machine was well oiled. Rap and hiphop was assimilated almost at its inception and became almost instantly a grotesque parody of what it started as. Sequels to popular, original, daring ideas were simply polished, toothless action packed facsimiles.Theres a lot more to be said about all of this, the takeaway is that the 90s, from a cultural perspective, was not as liberal and cool as you remember. It was a veneer of social harmony covering deep seated inequalities which, because said veneer was so convincing, has made people lust after the 90s as some kind of pinnacle of human fairness and equality. That was just a lie rich white people told other, poorer, white people so that they could expand their market share to minority classes who were themselves becoming consumers without offending the conservative values of white America.","title":"Trump dreams of empire expansion"},{"text":"They must not know what happened to Rudy Giuliani.","title":"US business leaders set to break record on donations to Trump inaugural fund"},{"text":"Does he not realize that would make ICE the Nazis?

This can be indirectly achieved through recognition by other countries. For example, many countries in the United Nations voted to recognize the Communist regime as the legitimate regime of China and drove the Kuomintang regime out. But usually the recognition of a big country is worth the recognition of many small countries.\\"De facto\\" means that a regime actually controls a certain area. For example, the Taliban now actually controls the entire Afghanistan, although not many countries in the world recognize them. In Nolan's Batman movie, Bane blew up Gotham's bridge to the outside world. He actually controlled Gotham, but no one thought Gotham could join the United Nations. This is easy to understand. Regional armed forces that do not participate in international politics are not considered countries. For example, primitive tribes in the Amazon jungle have their own laws and armed forces, and use bows and arrows to attack any strangers who approach, but they are still part of a larger country.Therefore, the United States is a country because the US government actually controls the United States, and Britain has given up its claims on the United States and recognized the existence of the United States as an independent country. It gets both \\"de jure\\" and \\"de facto\\".Similarly, Taiwan is not a country, the Taiwanese government only has de facto, there is no country in the world called Taiwan. Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China. They claim that they own the entire Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, but major regimes around the world do not recognize their claims. This is why Taiwan is keen to use money to get some small countries to support them.Now back to Tibet, when the Qing emperor abdicated, he announced that all territories would be handed over to the Republic of China, but the Republic of China was defeated by the People's Republic of China. Later, major countries in the world recognized the People's Republic of China as the only government representing China. Therefore, the People's Republic of China has \\"De jure\\" over Tibet.Tibet declared independence after China entered a state of chaos, but almost no country in the world recognized it (except Mongolia, which also took the opportunity to declare independence, but almost no one recognized Mongolia either, so they were just entertaining themselves). Later, the People's Republic of China took control of Tibet and thus gained \\"De facto\\" .Therefore, Tibet is an indisputable part of China. You asked what would happen if China lost. First of all, there is no if. Secondly, if China lost, Tibet would have to obtain de jure. The history of our world did not happen, so this question is meaningless.Also. yes, the United States was initially called a \\"rebellion\\" and only became a war of independence after it won. Assuming that Britain and major countries in the world did not recognize the United States after that, the United States would still be a regional armed force with only actual control capabilities.","title":"CMV: Nothing is wrong with Xinjiang and Tibet being part of China from a legal pov."},{"text":"Fuck cnn for sanewashing him since he drives the clickbaits for their failing billionaire owner.","title":"Trump says he will direct Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty"},{"text":"I really hope they get what they voted forand NO GOVERNMENT handouts for these welfare queens!!

So, there is no mandate and he is still disqualified. But like I said, nobody has the balls to do anything about it.
