You also have to factor in what seats are up.?In 2026 Maine &amp; North Carolina only seats reliably that can be flipped. Nebraska could be if Dan Osborn runs again. Kentucky has a slight maybe of flipping if Beshear runs &amp; it an open seat if McConnell retires.

Ohio I have no idea but they need to mobilize. Louisiana just unlikely to vote for a Democrat at federal level.

While all of these things are bad, they're not the same *level* of bad - with appropriate punishments ranging from a reprimand from HR all the way up to decades in prison.

The lower figure was based on an inflation and size-adjusted valuation of what the United States paid for Alaska, and the higher figure based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 847, which the newspaper said might be justified based on future valuations of its mineral deposits combined with the possibility that it might become a residential destination due to both the effects of climate change[117] and becoming a United States territory. FT Alphaville estimated a $1.1 trillion price for the territory. Its sum-of-the-parts analysis valued potential oil fields at $300 to 400 billion, rare-earth minerals at $500 to 700 billion, and real estate at $200 to $220 billion. The newspaper wrote that the US has a history of accretive land acquisitions, with a 7.1% internal rate of return for the Louisiana Purchase, 7.4% for Manhattan, and 9.0% for Alaska.[118] 24/7 Wall Street estimated a purchase price for Greenland of $533 billion, using Wyoming as a comparable. If the United States wants it for the strategic value of its property, both on land and offshore, and to project military power, the answer is that a value of $500 billion is not overly rich, 24/7 Wall Street concluded.[119]","title":"Can Trump Buy Greenland?

Im not promoting any of the following as the truth or anything.?The conspiracy theory of the elite wanting to reduce earths population is based on the alleged motivation of saving the climate and earth from overpopulation and the polution that follows with that for their own families. That is the supposed primary goal.?If the goal is to kill as many as possible to reduce earths population, and considering that more people took the (a) vaccine around the world than not, only killing those that didn't take one would still leave billions of people left, which wouldn't really solve the \\"issue\\" of overpopulation.?So why not just release a virus for which only they have the vaccine? Well, the problem with releasing a virus which is both extremely and easily contaigous, and extremely deadly, is that the elite can't guarentee that the virus wont mutate into a strain that's immune to the vaccine, leaving their lives and the lives of their family, their legacy at risk. That's probably not a risk they're willing to take.?So how else do they complete the task? Well one way would be to make sure that people die from a disease for which only they have the \\"switch\\", that they can turn on when they're confident they can live without the normal people. Technology is slowly bringing us to that point.?So how do you make sure people get this disease with a switch, which wont be contaigous to them??I have no idea. I dont know if there's science that even supports the idea of a vaccine doing this.?But for this idea to work, they need to make sure that more people than not take the vaccine. They also have to be in a secret conspiracy with the governments around the world like Russia and China, as only reducing the population in the West, doesn't really solve the \\"problem\\".?Also, the only people left will be the people not complying with their plan, so they either have to have a plan to take the rest of those people out, or a plan to force them into submission. Honestly this last part seems like the most easy part considering our technology today and the fact that most people would be gone in this scenario anyway.?Tbh, this population reduction conspiracy doesn't make sense to me. Not because I dont believe that at least some of the elite doesn't secretly have a wish to this effect, but because it seems like an impossible task, where so many things can go wrong for them. So I dont see them ever trying to do it. The risk of failure is to great for them.","title":"Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated"},{"text":"Well, they do keep using the Law* to keep the masses in Order, so there's that *The Law being whatever they feel like having SCOTUS rule that week","title":"Meanwhile, people are STILL claiming \\"Democrats and Republicans are the same\\""},{"text":"Millions of people knew he is a lifelong criminal who will openly extort money, lie, cheat, steal, and rape to get what he wants and they voted for him anyway.","title":"Companies Are Scrambling to Fund Trumps Inauguration.

Hes keeping tabs on whos donating  and who hasnt"},{"text":"The issue with that headline, is that it portrays a false neutrality to the events that have happened. There is a lot of things that can be true at once for a situation like that, and that's why you have to weigh everything in before you can make an accusation.The headline states that two events happened:1. A teen got stabbed with scissors.\\n2. A teen pulled up the student's dress.And this headline also connects the events to one another, in a way that event 1 would not have happened if event 2 wasn't happening to begin with. The event that is being put front and center is the stabbing, not the pulling up of the dress, and this can be done for either of two main reasons.Reason A: The headline is attempting to say that the stab is more problematic than the dress being pulled up. (Downplay)Reason B: The headline is attempting to put the consequence of pulling someone's dress up as the center of attention. (Demonstrate)If you demonstrate, you use language that attracts attention to both parts. \\"Stabbed\\" attracts attention, and implies a crime, or at least severe misconduct. \\"Pull \\\\[item\\\\] up\\" doesn't, and implies a normal action. I can tell you that if you asked 100 people who'd scrolled across the article without clicking on it or pondering it, you'd have a lot more people who'd remembered the \\"stabbed\\" part, and not the rest. They'd probably say something along the lines of \\"a guy at school got stabbed because he tried to tease a classmate\\", or something even less accurate.Because \\"stabbed\\" catches the eye.A better headline for this in the \\"demonstration\\" reason, would be something like \\"Teen stabbed after sexually harassing another student\\" // \\"Teen stabbed after sexually assaulting another student\\". This kind of headline would make it a demonstration of consequence, not a demonstration of importance. Which brings me to the downplay part, and why that's a really insidious thing to do.We have a case where someone was stabbed, and we have a case where someone was sexually assaulted. People will say stuff like \\"boys will be boys\\". People will say \\"he shouldn't have done that, but that was overreacting\\". People will defend the boy saying it was just playful tease. People will defend the boy saying that she should have gone to authorities. People will defend the boy.The general views in the USA about sexual harassment and/or assault, is that the victim is blowing it out of proportion (and sometimes lying for fame), while the assailant is being white knighted as either not guilty or malicious, and if they were, then they were likely tempted by the victim dressing or acting like they were asking for it.In a situation where the language for the stabbed part is more eye-catching than the language for the sexual assault, people are 100% going to take his side.And this is also what the video from Fox13Memphis did about it: It didn't give any of the girl's statements to explain why she defended herself. Nothing. Not. A. Peep. But the stabbed guy? He's been given a paraphrased quote, where he says it was just \\"playing\\", not serious. This inherently is bias. He gets to defend himself in the court of public opinion, she gets downplayed as overreacting, and before you know it, we're back to \\"boys will be boys\\".So that headline, it downplays sexual harassment at the very least, and judging by the summonses included in the original story, sexual battery. It downplays it by saying \\"So, there was a stabbing, apparently because someone's dress was pulled up.\\" It's drawing attention to the stab more than to the action that caused self-defense.To put it in a different light... If I were to be beating you up, and you stabbed me in self-defense. Should the stabbing be the crime you want to report on?","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"Musk might need to be careful near high-rise windows.

If it hadnt worked or had backfired long term, history might not remember him as well.Morally, is there any category that can justify this sort of thing coherently??I dont know, but the best argument Ive seen is that it falls under the traditional allowance for tyrannicide, which implies that there can be situations where the state itself has failed so badly that authority does in the end fall on whoever is willing to right the wrong.Even then, though, I think there must be some notion (that can possibly only be justified objectively in a retrospective sense) that your revolutionary act has a good chance of actually fixing the state.Does either John Brown or Luigi fall under this sort of idea? In the straightforward sense, no. The US *government,*!even under slavery, hadnt really fallen into tyrannyas the successful election of Lincoln (a man whose own virtue and heroism became totally apparent; Lincoln was the opposite of a tyrant) to right the ship eventually showed.And yetI could see an analysis where the slaving class in the antebellum US, and our corporate elite today, are actually part of a sort of aristocracy in capitalism even if they arent formally part of the government.I think its possible to make the argument that from a more economically-aware political analysisCEO are tyrants.?Because thats just how our power structure works; its designed to hide power by putting true power-holders outside the actual visible government structure. But in some sense they are still a tyrannical part of the state understood more broadly.And in that sense might Luigi and John Brown have been justified as tyrannicides? Its possible, if they really do move the needle and lead to change in the end. John Brown did. Luigi?

Nothing is entirely unbiased. That's why scientific papers always have a section on potential biases and how they were controlled. Word choice matters. This is the article in question: Two students have been issued a juvenile summons after a stabbing at a Memphis school.Trending stories:According to the police report, a student pulled up a girl's dress inside of a classroom at Central High School. The victim then grabbed a pair of scissors. She tried multiple times to stab the student before she connected.He was treated by a nurse at the school.The male student told police that he was only playing and never exposed the victim, the police report said.The male student was issued a juvenile summons for sexual battery. The female student was issued a juvenile summons for aggravated assault.The article itself states that the male student's actions are being considered sexual battery by the legal system.The word choice in the headline emphasizes the female student's actions (\\"stabbed with scissors\\" paints a vivid picture of violence) and downplays the male student's actions (\\"lifting up skirt\\" sounds like something a curious toddler does). This might sound like splitting hairs, but that sort of downplaying while *technically* stating facts has been used forever to support the \\"boys being boys\\" mentality that paints girls/women as overreacting and overly sensitive. For example, when I was middle school, I was constantly sexually harassed by this one guy for most of the school year. One thing he did all the time was stand *way* too close to me (think grinding in the club but with half an inch of separation). He loved doing it when there was a good chance I'd be taking a step back and thus collide with him. This happened in the crowded instrument storage room for band class, so teachers always framed it as \\"just bumping into each other\\" but it wasn't *just* that. My parents, however, did *not* frame it like that and told me they'd deal with it if I got in trouble for elbowing the shit out of him. Sure, that's anecdotal at best, but just about every woman I know has some sort of story like this from some point in their lives. This means a lot of people reading that headline are going to see that minimization as another instance of this happening. \\"Teen injures fellow student in response to sexual harassment\\" is an equally valid summary, but downplays the female student's actions because \\"injures\\" is vague and the likely assumption would be something like my example of elbowing a dude. In this case, she went after him with scissors. \\"Teen stabs fellow student with scissors after he sexually harassed her\\" is probably better because both sound equally serious from a colloquial/what comes to mind sense.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"Yes.

There's an act of interpretation: is flipping a dress \\"sexual assault\\"? Is stabbing someone with scissors \\"self defense\\"? Both are literally true, but using *those words* reinforces that he did a crime (sexual assault) while she acted in self defense. \\"He flipped up her dress\\" is an act that we can call a crime, but that doesn't call it a crime so it leaves that interpretation up to the reader. \\"She stabbed him\\" lacks the context that she felt threatened. Flipping a dress? That doesn't sound threatening. \\"Sexual assault\\" does. Both are describing the same actions. \\"Stabbing with scissors\\" sounds violent and unhinged. \\"Defended herself with the tool she had available\\" sounds reasonable and calculated. Again, it's the same action being described. Word order also matters. Humans have *primacy bias*. This is built into our brains. All things being equal, we tend to remember the first thing we hear, considering it to be the most important thing. We also tend to remember the end of the sentence if it's longer, and the middle tends to be forgotten. The first thing you get in the headline is \\"teen gets stabbed\\". If the headline is the only thing you get, you're most likely to remember the stabbing part and not the \\"he deserved it\\" part. Without that context, your natural inclination is to think that he did not deserve it, because that is a reasonable and correct response to hearing that a person got stabbed, because most of the time they don't deserve it. As part of that primacy bias, English does a thing called *passive voice*. Normally, English is very strictly ordered as Subject-Verb-Object. Student (subject) stabs (verb) teen (object). Passive voice reverses this order: Teen (object) is stabbed (passive verb) by student (subject). Without going into *why* passive voice is used, in short it's useful for putting the object at the front and often to obscure the subject, eg. \\"Mistakes were made.\\" Yeah but by whom?So the bias is: * The context is last and most likely to be forgotten or ignored* The description of her action does not include motive that gives context* The description of his actions sounds more tame than if it were described as the crime that it is* Passive voice moves the perp to the front of the sentence, a place of syntactic privilege because of primacy bias, so you will tend to care more about him and what happens to him instead of herAmong these, I can forgive calling it stabbing and him lifting a dress, instead of self defense and sexual assault, respectively, because that requires some interpretation from the writer. Stabbing isn't *always* self defense, lifting a dress isn't always a crime. Interpretating those actions in the headline would be another kind of bias and, I think, stronger bias than stating the actions as factually as possible, as they did. But the passive voice moving the \\"teen stabbed\\" to the front is totally unnecessary. It would read just as well and be more neutral in active voice: Girl stabs classmate with scissors after he lifted her dress.\\" You're still more likely to pay attention to the stabbing part instead of the context part, but the least important part (scissors) is in the least important middle of the sentence, and at least you're more likely to be concerned about her, the victim, instead of the perp.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"It's kind of tragically comedic already, I guess I can laugh at it now because I don't live in the US, even though Trumps shenanigans eventually affect everyone globally.","title":"MAGA Gets Roasted for Claiming Trump Saved Christmas"},{"text":"Cryptic and interesting.

I can imagine someone reading the headline that uses a category for the behavior as assuming she was being physically attacked and so sees her response as 'justified' whereas if they then learn that he was 'only' pulling up her dress they may then think \\"whoa, that's not assault\\" or some version of that thought process.So some think all or more information should be included so they can draw their own conclusion, and others feel that the behavior isn't relevant, what's relevant is that the victim felt assaulted and that behavior shouldn't be trivialized. I am in that second group. Too many people have judgments on the behaviour of the person being \\"attacked\\" (in this case the female student is the victim) and will say their response is not equal to the level of attack or threat they felt. That's a \\"logical\\" version of \\"but what was she wearing\\" in the sense that, in both circumstances, it is the behaviour of the female involved in the situation that is being evaluated. Not the male who committed the initial offending behavior. The female needs to either 'cover up more' or 'not freak out'. There's usually no comment on modifications needed for the males' behaviour. And this then perpetuates the ongoing narrative that in any situation, women are both responsible for the outcome and to blame for it, whatever that outcome is.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"You will only see cute moments like this on Reddit.","title":"Merry Christmas from VP Trump"},{"text":"What do you mean, an outside interest?Also, cool you have contact with MP and her team.","title":"Battlegrounds, primaries and potential retirements mark the key Senate races to watch in 2026 | Democrats need to net four seats to flip the Senate in two years, a tall order with just one Republican running in a state Kamala Harris carried in November."},{"text":"https://youtu.be/9V-vcXOpG9g","title":"Musks power over Republicans has an eerie historical parallel"},{"text":"To convey the most relevant information in the least words.

It's frustrating when journalists don't call a spade a spade. In my example, they should use the word rape because our laws state that children cannot consent, and many people feel this contributes to  the idea that male sexual abuse is not taken seriously.Similarly, this article down plays the self defense from sexual assault part and phrases the headline in such a way that it emphasizes the teenager getting stabbed with scissors. It's a subtle difference, but for many readers, it speaks to the subconscious biases of the author, and to a larger extent, society. You may or may not agree that those biases are present in the structuring of the headline, but that's what many people extrapolate from headlines like this.Personally, I think it's more transparent and neutral to say \\"a student was stabbed today after sexually assaling their classmate\\" or something like that. But  that headline isn't as controversial because obviously people will retaliate if you treat them poorly. It's hard to say whether the headline was intentional or not and for what reason, but it's clear that the framing being weird.","title":"cmv: this headline doesn't minimize sexual assault"},{"text":"Is this an argument against this particular headline not being biased, or against all news headlines not being biased?

They can't get past their internal divisions to put together a cogent campaign that appeals to or energizes voters in the seven swing states. Trump won all of them. If you can't win at least several of the swing states, you can't win the presidency and it wasn't about how much money was spent. Granted, Harris didn't get much lead time in terms of campaigning but the way she emphasized helping the middle class in so many appearances may have narrowed potential connections with lower income voters. The appeal of Trump's bull-in-the-china-shop rhetoric was visceral and easily understood while the Democrats somewhat abstract and overly rational messaging. A chicken in every pot goes a lot farther as a message than a lecture to the choir about the instability of her opponent. Trump supporters knew that Trump is unstable and didn't care. Maybe if the Dems spent more time trying to understand Trump's supporters in swing states instead of pillorying he and his supporters they would have found an exploitable cleavage. Unfortunately, with Pelosi and other Democratic elites refusing to admit that mistakes were made, the way forward is as clear as mud.","title":"Liberal leaders say they have a plan for a new, more effective anti-Trump resistance in 2025"},{"text":"They dont","title":"MAGA Gets Roasted for Claiming Trump Saved Christmas"},{"text":"Jesus Fried Chicken.

Most of us will probably agree that a government intentionally spreading lies is bad. If you find a Facebook conspiracy group with a thousand accounts that lead back to one cubicle in the Russian intelligence service headquarters, yeah that's relatively easy to call out and handle. But what about a thousand actual Russians spreading misinformation because they believe it? People are entitled to their opinions and do you really want governments or companies acting as arbiters of truth? What's the functional difference between a group of idiots spreading incorrect information and people intentionally and knowingly spreading incorrect information? The former is generally protected in the US, and having a legal mechanism to distinguish it from the latter is pretty damn tricky to implement and enforce. You can call out all of the above and provide evidence supporting your assertions, that seems to me to be the simplest and least intrusive option, but that is reliant on people generally trusting the people issuing such statements. American trust in government isn't exactly very high right now, and I'd say at least some of that mistrust is warranted.","title":"A leading US government agency that tracks foreign disinformation has terminated its operations, the State Department said Tuesday, after Congress failed to extend its funding following years of Republican criticism."},{"text":"Killing prisoners nullifies bird flu, and eggs get cheaper.","title":"Trump vows to pursue executions after Biden commutes most of federal death row"},{"text":"Citizen's United declared that being rich means your voice is louder and more important than any other American.

McConnel wouldn't confirm the nomination, saying that the Senate has the option to not confirm, because it was a Presidential Election year.  Do you know who invented the excuse of not confirming a Supreme Court Nomination during a Presidential Election year?   It was Joe Biden when he was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1992.Interestingly enough Biden changed his mind about in 2016, when  a Democrat President had a chance to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat in  2016.   And then 4 years later in 2020 when a Republican President had the opportunity, Biden was once again- against the idea.       Biden's position on this changes based on which option benefits the Democrat party the most. ?Or back in 2015 when republicans put a 2000 page bill for a vote but didn't give democrats enough time to read more than a few pages before they had to vote on it in congress?I'm not familiar with the bill that you are talking about,  but for the sake of argument it doesn't matter.

He stopped scheduling hearings for George H.W. Bush''s Judicial Nominees. 32 of Bush''s nominations never got a hearing. Including John Roberts who was nominated in January of 1992, 11 months prior to the 1992 Elections.[https://www.aei.org/articles/how-biden-killed-john-robertss-nomination-in-1992/](https://www.aei.org/articles/how-biden-killed-john-robertss-nomination-in-1992/)1992 was also the year that Joe Biden gave a speech on the Senate Floor, where he spoke against the President naming a replacement to the Supreme Court in a Presidential Election Year. Saying the Senate wouldn't consider the nomination if he did. Biden stated that Bush shouldn't even bother naming a replacement, and stated that a majority of his predecessors didn't nominate a replacement when they were in that situation. This was a lie, as most Presidents nominated Supreme Court Justices during a Presidential Election Year when there was a vacancy.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/joe-biden-argued-for-delaying-supreme-court-picks-in-1992.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/joe-biden-argued-for-delaying-supreme-court-picks-in-1992.html)And of course in 2016 when Democrats held the Presidency, Vice President Biden was all for the Democrat President nominating a Supreme Court Justice in the Presidential Election year. And just 4 years later when a Republican held the President Biden was once against a President nominating a Justice during a Presidential Election year.

But she carried real Florida state ID that said she was 21 - that was provided by the guy that's sitting in prison for fraud, trafficking girls, and blackmail.The whole scenario was such a shitshow, and the democrats were so intent on smearing Gaetz, that the democrats on the ethics committee broke all of the rules of said committee and released the sham ethics report that was based on the two federal prisoners.This is what our govt has sunk to. They're so afraid of having Gaetz at the DOJ that they'd violate every rule and law just to smear him.

Occupying another country is simply expensive and very troublesome. It's all a profit and loss calculation and it seems that the problems associated with maintaining order in occupied territories outweigh the potential gains. In addition, there is the issue of native societies. If the US were to annex a another country to its territory, it would have to regulate the legal status of its citizens in some way. Creating second-class citizens seems very controversial and I suspect that in the long run it would lead to major abuses.\\nIt would be much more likely that along with the annexed territory, its citizens would become US citizens. This is not a good solution as well, because having all the rights of citizens, they could internally sabotage US politics and strive for independence. I think that the method that the US has tried to use so far is much more rational. Which is maintain a broadly understood  influence zones. Another solution may be in a way that Russia has often used in history in countries that were in its sphere of influence. Creating a pseudo-sovereign state with its own government established as a result of imitation of democratic elections, which has a lot of autonomy, but is most importantly a matter of subordinating Russia's position. This is a very convenient solution because it really comes down to issuing orders that the government of the subordinate country implements.Perhaps in the case of Greenland, territorial annexation could be effective and profitable. It is a very depopulated area rich in resources.\\nIn the case of Panama, it's really about maintaining tight control over transit through the Panama Canal. To achieve that, you don't really have to conquer the territory, just allocate a few naval units there.","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"Greenland has no say when it comes to diplomacy.

I'm also vehemently opposed to the death penalty, but the idea of scum like child molesters and genocidal dictators being publicly executed is satisfying to my lesser brain parts on some level.I agree. This is an emotional reaction and frankly one that plays on our worst emotions. Hence why it resonates with today's reactionary populists since that thrives entirely on emotion (mostly fear, rage and hate).  Governments understand this, and that's why the modern death penalty is more of a political tool than a crime deterrent. In this modern era, where capital punishment is relatively rare compared to history, each execution is a major news item. When you give the government (and their corporate patrons) a monopoly on force, they get to pick and choose what kind of criminals to publicly execute, and they use the death penalty as a means to instill fear. It's not about the severity of the crimes, it's about WHO they were committed against.This is an important point, and IMHO it applies the law enforcement as seen by \\"law and order\\" types in general and the initiatives they've spawned over the years (e.g. \\"the war on drugs\\"). They don't actually like the rule of law, i.e. the idea that the law applies equally to everyone. They want to use the law, either through the arbitrary enforcement of the law or by criminalizing aspects of people's lives, into a cudgel to strike their enemies rather than a shield to protect the weak from the strong. The same people who would apply the death penalty to criminals (real or imagined) are perfectly fine with other people killing thousands because they do it in a boardroom while wearing suits. Nor is it something that is limited to \\"law and order\\"; the same logic usually extends to war crimes, political violence, sexual violence and victim blaming, ... These are all variants of the same idea, that the use of violence to preserve the social order is not only always legitimate but also an expression of that order. \\"Order\\" of course is a misnomer, because the primary characteristic of this hierarchy is that it is invariably chaotic, corrupt and arbitrary, with government power fracturing into feuding fiefdoms. This is true even of societies that fetishized discipline and order (e.g. fascism). The idea that the law is above politics is IMHO a delusion; it is just another instrument in the struggle between anarchic / progressive / egalitarian groups and authoritarian / reactionary / oligarchic ones. They disagree about the law and how it should be enforced because they fundamentally disagree about the nature of justice, power and morality.","title":"Trump Pledges to 'Vigorously Pursue the Death Penalty' | \\n\\"In the last six months of his first term, President Trump executed 13 individualsmore than any administration in 120 years,\\" one critic noted."},{"text":"Thats just the hard truth.

One of the big selling points of the place we ultimately chose was the large, prominently placed sign in the lobby that said the facility does not discriminate on basis of sex, gender, race, religion, etc. Every year, the daycare staged a big Holiday shindig, with each age group singing its own set of songs.  \\nRound Thanksgiving time, the teachers asked me what our family did to mark the holidays. I sent them the photo of the duck at the North Pole, explained I had gone there in July 2004, and we built our holiday tradition off of that.I then promptly forgot the conversation.Now, those of you who have forgotten the duck's name, here's your chance, because this story doesn't work without mentioning it.Time comes for the big holiday pageant show thingie. The kid is in the Green Group. They sing their songs.To our surprise, one of them is:  \\n  \\nThere was a duck at the North Pole  \\nAnd Quirk was his name-o!  \\n  \\nQ! U! I R K!  \\nQ! U!

The result of this is the patchwork of caucuses and coalitions the dems need to appease to pass legislation, forcing the party to moderate.

This just isn't how politics works. Its not rational, its not good, but its also not how politics works. For low-info, tuned-out voters, you need to work to earn their vote. You have to engage with them on the level they operate at. Kamala was never going to do that. The whole Dem leadership is so old and out of touch that they simply cannot do that. Thus the average low-info voter does not trust them and will go with whoever seems different and will promise them the things they want to hear. Larger and larger amounts of low-info voters are moving toward whoever seems like the 'change' candidate and they rely on authenticity to make the decision because that is just how people work. Trump is authentically a piece of shit but he signals the right way to low-info voters. Dems refuse to get in the mud and fight for those votes, and honestly Biden was so old that he couldn't have even if he wanted to. Trump, on the other, hand went to all manner small constituencies to fight for even small numbers of votes. He told people whatever they wanted to hear. He did what he had to to win. Dem leadership, being as old and out of touch as they are, would never lower themselves to do this. They don't care that much about winning frankly, no matter what they tell you about how important the election was. Be angry and low-info voters if you want, but they individually hold little to no power. Understand that isn't constructive in the slightest to spend time complaining about them. It might make you feel better but its a worthless endeavor. Focus on the people in power as they can actually change the situation.Edit: A lot of people learned nothing from the previous election.","title":"A leading US government agency that tracks foreign disinformation has terminated its operations, the State Department said Tuesday, after Congress failed to extend its funding following years of Republican criticism."},{"text":"A Trump never pays its debts","title":"Trump campaign wont pay $49,000 in bills for Grand Rapids rallies"},{"text":"And lowering prices at the same time?

These components are typically inert on their own but become dangerous when mixed under specific conditions.Applying to Biology\\nComponent 1: A substance is introduced into a person (e.g., via a vaccine, pill, or other delivery method). This substance could be designed to remain dormant until triggered.Component 2: A common substance like coffee, alcohol, or even a dietary ingredient acts as the trigger.Outcome: When combined, these two components interact in a way that harms the individual, potentially causing disease or other ailments.Key Requirements for This to WorkAdvanced PersonalizationThe weapon would need to account for an individuals unique biological makeup (e.g., genetics, metabolism, microbiome).Precision targeting like this would require detailed biometric data, potentially collected through medical records, genetic testing, nasal swabs or wearable devices.A Stable Dormant AgentThe substance delivered (e.g., in a \\"vaccine\\") must remain inert and stable until the trigger is introduced.\\nIt would need to bypass the immune system and metabolic pathways to avoid detection or degradation.Controlled TriggerThe trigger (e.g., coffee or another common substance) must react with the dormant agent in a predictable way, causing the desired harmful effect.It must be common enough to ensure exposure but specific enough not to affect everyone indiscriminately and raise suspicion.Complexity of Biological SystemsHuman biology is highly variable. Predicting how two components will interact in every individual is challenging but can be successful with advances in technology.Theres a high risk of unintended side effects or failure in certain individuals.Delivery and ConcealmentDelivering such a substance on a large scale while avoiding detection would would be difficult without strategic co-operation.Trigger SpecificityIf the trigger is too common, unintended exposure could lead to premature effects, alerting authorities.If the trigger is too rare, the weapons efficacy would be limited.Synthetic Biology: Advances in this field are rapidly improving the ability to engineer biological systems with precision.CRISPR and Gene Editing: Technologies like CRISPR could potentially be used to target specific genetic traits or introduce dormant agents.\\nNanotechnology: This could enable precise delivery of substances and ensure they remain inactive until triggered.","title":"Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated"},{"text":"Id10ts.","title":"A leading US government agency that tracks foreign disinformation has terminated its operations, the State Department said Tuesday, after Congress failed to extend its funding following years of Republican criticism."},{"text":"Who said he let them out?

I also don't see a single reason to believe that Musk would be more receptive to Democrats than Republicans. The resolution they were gonna pass with bipartisan support was blocked by Musk and the bill that did pass with his approval lacked major pieces, like funding for child cancer research. Musk is extremely right wing and will absolutely not be willing to hear our or help Democrats. I know I'm not really following what you said will change your view, but Musk has *a lot* of power with money influencing politics, so of course Republicans will bend to his will. The thing is, in your own example, Musk wanted Republicans to oppose Democrats *more*.To try to address what you say will change your view, if Trump really gets sick of Musk, Musk will be ruined. He relies heavily on government subsidies. Trump can literally just take those away and ruin him. On top of that, Trump's team has suggested denaturalizing citizens and deporting them, especially those who have spent time as an illegal immigrant. Well, as it turns out, Musk is not only an immigrant, but he was an illegal immigrant for a bit. If he pisses Trump off enough, he could get deported. Trump seemingly hinted at this very recently. Either way, be it deportation or taking his subsidies, if Trump flexes on Musk, Republicans don't have to worry about him anymore. His money and businesses are the only thing that keeps him relevant. Take those away and he has absolutely no voice","title":"CMV: Congressional Democrats should insist on the presence of Elon Musk for any kind of legislative negotiation"},{"text":"you wouldnt change your mind about the DNC being the problem. Lol 8 million more people showed up for stuttering old middle of the road Biden than one of the most progressive senators (more progressive than Bernie) in the 115th Congress Kamala Harris. did she make campaign mistakes like work with Cheney? Yeah. However if you actually dig into her policies they were pretty progressive. Price controls, stopping corporations like black rock from buying and renting homes, universal preschool, universal free school lunches, child tax credits, first time home buyers tax credit, wanted to continue to forgive student loan debt, make college more affordable. Continue to regulate corporations. Increase corporate taxes, expand the adorable care act, continue funding green energy initiatives. Continue helping unions (pro union) it really is fucking dumb that progressives thought her and Trump were the same. \\nRussian voter suppression propaganda is most probably the ACTUAL problem. Also if you watched Jan 6th unfold LIVE and decided not to vote YOU ARE THE PROBLEM as well. I preferred Harris over Trump a 100x. But I blame the DNC and GOP equally on making this great country a 2-party oligarchy.Lol it's been this way since it's founding. It used to be southern slave owners, large slave plantations  vs Northern merchants, Bankers, early industrialists and financiers. This isn't fucking new LOL. The issue here is that youre of the opinion that voting actually matters in a 2-party state because there will be short term pain if the other guy wins. Im of the opinion that in a 2-party state it *doesnt* matter if you vote when you dont wholeheartedly agree with your candidate, *because* at some point the other party will win (If that wasnt the case, itd be a 1-party state). The only way to express my disappointment with my own party is to simply not show up. Not having viable third parties or having better candidates is a symptom of the first past the post voting system. It's called [Duverger's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law) the oldest law in political science. Also first past the post voting systems unfortunately have a very bad side effect called [strategic voting ](https://electionscience.org/research-hub/tactical-voting-basics) The solution is to VOTE for candidates who support things like ranked choice voting or star voting systems that are resistant to strategic voting. And before you say \\"democrats don't support ranked choice. I would advise you to read some of their vote reform bills that have funding for researching ranked choice. I understand your opinion, I also understand the other point of view. The problem of course is that instead of working to get the people in the second group back on board, they are being blamed for the loss.In a first past the post voting system if you don't participate in strategic voting it is directly your fault. It's called [The spoiler effect ](https://electionscience.org/education/spoiler-effect) where not voting and voting third party will get the person you don't want to be elected elected.This is a dynamic unique to a 2-party state. In multiparty systems people would move from (for example) the liberal party to the socialist party to express their displeasure with economic policies, but being satisfied with social changes. Or move from that same liberal party to the christian democrats if they thought social reforms went too far. There would be options with a direct impact on government styles. We in the USA have none of that. We get to choose scorched earth or bad. I dont blame people for choosing the first option, though it certainly wasnt my choice.Again the two party system is a result of first past the post voting and plurality voting as stated above. It forces you to vote strategically and if you don't vote strategically it's your fault. The only way to change the two party system is to vote for candidates who support ranked choice voting. If you read some of the democrat voting proposals that failed due to Republican support you would see that Democrats are the choice to vote strategically in order to get ranked choice voting.But lets blame the right people.If you look at my credible sources you will see that the people who voted third party or the people who didn't vote are the ones directly responsible for the outcome we got. They did not strategically vote which led to the scorched earth outcome. I hope they feel all the consequences of Trump's presidency and not voting. The true enemy of democracy is the apathetic voter who do not understand the spoiler effect. I could probably make a strong case that these people who didn't vote were deeply affected by Russian propaganda voter suppression and possibly cut them some slack. There are a lot of things to blame and DNC is definitely included but these non-voters deserve to be in the equation. They need to understand the consequences of not strategically voting in a system that requires it.","title":"Elon Musk can easily use Donald Trump's greatest advantage against him"},{"text":"Is that even true?Britain's greatest leader was probably Churchill.

Dems would essentially be wasting legislative days to accommodate Musk's schedule. He is a billionaire who owns several large and high-profile corporations. I doubt he has room in his schedule to jet off to Washington, D.C., for days or weeks at a time. It would only make sense if a handful of Republicans nominate Musk as Speaker of the House, he accepts, and Dems join in to take him across the finish line. However, this would likely alienate their base. After all, they would essentially be elevating a controversial billionaire who owns one of the world's most influential social media companies to a powerful position in government. Every Dem congressman would be handing a primary challenger a major talking point for 2026.Second, however bad you think Musk and his ideas are, you're essentially granting him *even more* influence over the policymaking process. Closed-door negotiations can get pretty technical and wonky. You're inviting  Musk to have a direct hand in legislative language, specific programs, and so forth. Yeah, he jettisoned the CR Jeffries and Johnson hammered out, that sucks. But there are limits to his pressure campaigns. Musk backed Scott for Majority Leader and lost that battle, for instance. There's no guarantee Republicans will fold on issues where Musk and Dems align. Remember, Musk's influence comes from his ability to tap into and animate Trump's base. Are MAGA Republicans going to follow his beck and whim on EVs and stricter emission standards? Or will they prioritize Americans who work for the oil &amp; gas industry? Who can exert more *individual* pressure on legislators during the primary season - Musk or industry groups representing oil tycoons? Third, who the fuck knows what kind of staying power Musk has. Trump is mercurial and so are his most ardent followers and advisors. Six months from now, Musk could be Public Enemy No. 1 and his input might be next to useless. A month from now we might have a completely different Speaker - one who could be a better or worse negotiating partner than Musk.Finally, Dems have little to gain and much to lose from a cohesive Republican party. GOP chaos benefits Dems politically. If Musk being in the room makes the Republican party more efficient, then that is not a good thing. It's much better for Republicans to be tripping over themselves in intra-party knife-fights and trying to balance a multitude of interest groups in their coalition than working lockstep towards Trump's agenda.","title":"CMV: Congressional Democrats should insist on the presence of Elon Musk for any kind of legislative negotiation"},{"text":"Are you willing to risk nuclear war to attack a nuclear armed Nato?Because once you invade Canada, nato declares war.","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"As Republicans don't govern or work in good faith all you get are shady games that somehow only Republicans can win","title":"Biden vetoes bill that would have given Trump more judicial seats to fill"},{"text":"It's even weirder that you believe that.","title":"CMV: Congressional Democrats should insist on the presence of Elon Musk for any kind of legislative negotiation"},{"text":"For me personally? 2.
