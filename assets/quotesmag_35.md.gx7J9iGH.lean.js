Mitt Romney once called comments she made about Putin's aggression against Ukraine treasonous. Now, she makes these comments and backs away from them, but I don't think that's a question of disagreement over issues. I think that's a fundamental question about her loyalty and given that her job, if she's confirmed, is keeper of the secrets of the United States, that's incredibly serious. And that's why I think Republicans who go - who are rushing to throw themselves over these grenades for Donald Trump really need to hold back until they hear more about both of these nominees because the senators are risking their personal integrity and really their place and history by kind of blindly saying that they'll support him.https://www.yahoo.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-trump-intelligence-chief-234106139.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACuKyd4LlDvk8VWHYi_nnNoqd5-5xwFqkfycmR-jRYcK59XPBlRfJQ6Cq1OTbI7mB39mDp8VfybPgnDPAFJ5P5cAtCnmftvKyYHDECoeEkBoUskMaU29kmFV96giHeeMvhiVxUfoxRtolI7OR7JRJoY-3tJLG2Dr2rHUrQal8VQJhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2022/03/14/checks--imbalances-gabbards-pro-putin-patron-russian-oligarch-indicted/Google for more, or look back to her Fox News segments.","title":"Dem Rep.

In Ohio, approximately two thirds of registered voters were completely left out of the study, and potentially relevant information like underlying health conditions, lifestyle factors, access to health insurance, or whether someone lives in a nursing home or private residence, was completely ignored.For all we know, Ohio Republican voters live longer healthier lives, and end up living in nursing homes *(nursing homes accounted for 64% of Ohio covid deaths)* at a higher rate than Democrat voters, where they were exposed to covid by health care staff *(staff were the primary transmission vector for covid infections in nursing homes)* and that study is too superficial to disprove that conjecture.If Ohio registered Democrats were supposedly more vaccine-eager than Republicans, the fact that there were \\"significantly higher\\" death rates for registered Democrats in the 65 to 74 years range after the vaccine was fully rolled out, suggests the vaccine didn't do them much good.

I dug deeper. Every Republican administration since Nixon has led to a recession. In fact, Ten of the eleven U.S. recessions between 1953 and 2020 began under Republican presidents.

Polls in the months leading up to the election showed that a strong majority of Americans supported imposing an arms embargo on Israel and that in critical swing states, imposing one would have gained Harris many more voters than it would have lost her. Harris did not heed these warnings and instead continuously spit upon the Uncommitted movement that was begging for the faintest reason to vote for herHarris would not even grant them the hollow gesture of allowing a Palestinian speaker to voice their concerns at the Democratic convention for a measly two minutes. Did this single-handedly cost her the election? We really cant know for sure. But we know that Harris support completely collapsed in Michigans majority-Arab cities of Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, and Hamtramck, where voters appear to have followed through on their promise to Abandon Harris if she failed to break from Bidens policy on the Middle East. We also know that in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, the number of people who voted Uncommitted (or other equivalents) in the Democratic Primary to voice their disgust at Bidens policy toward Palestine was greater than the margin of victory for Trump.

Out of all the major 2028 candidates, he has the least amount of obvious weaknesses but Ill give you some that I think he has:1. Maryland is not an ideologically diverse state, in fact being Governor of Maryland is a quite boring position politically. Marylands state politics have been stable for decades now, even when Hogan was governor. The electorate in MD is overwhelmingly center-left which makes Moores job pretty easy compared to his other Democratic Governor counterparts. Even Newsom has to deal with a more ideological diverse electorate, as CA has progressive hotbeds, MAGA country, and center-left places all in one state.2. Very ambitious and has wanted to run for President for a long time. This shouldnt be a weakness in Presidential politics, but the fact is that many voters are turned off by candidates that have obviously positioned themselves for Presidential runs. Wes has been pushed to run for office ever since he was in his mid-20s, and I can see some voters being turned off by that.3. He has the habit of making very flowery, word salad-esque speeches.

Do you understand that $35 TRILLION in debt is approximately $100,000 of debt per person in the United States? How do you think that will ever be paid back, especially when the US is adding another $TRILLION to the total every few moths?At the start of the Great Depression, Hoover raised tariffs to protect American industry. This is popularly assumed to have caused the Depression. However - and this data takes some time to search out - at the same time, the Federal Reserve and the commercial banks worked to reduce the money supply by an unprecedented 20%. That had never happened before, and the results were catastrophic.Most people are unaware of the link between the money supply and inflation/deflation. If you look at no other chart, look at this one: \\\\[US money supply\\\\](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL). Note the huge spike upwards immediately after Biden took office; then you won't have to wonder why prices went crazy for the next year. And note that upward spike was only about 10% of the total. The similar process took place in reverse in 1930. Commercial banks, fearful, stopped making loans, and the Fed did not step in to provide extra liquidity. As a result, the money supply fell by over 20%. Without cash, businesses failed, and the downward spiral began. It wasn't until the war and the massive government stimulus that the US economy was able to reflate. So, I don't doubt that top Dems at the Fed - like Powell - and at the big commercial banks - like Jamie Dimon - would love nothing more than to pull the plug on the US economy and have it go in the dumper while Trump's in power. They don't care personally - they are insulated from the downturn by their own millions - and they will happily see millions in despair and poverty if it gets them their political goals.","title":"What The Hell Is Mike Lindell Talking About?"},{"text":"It's more of I need to find something to write about to get clicks since the election is over.?","title":"Dont You Dare Blame Harriss Loss on the Left"},{"text":" Today, even my conservative relatives dont.X","title":"Why not Wes Moore in 2028?"},{"text":"I should have read this comment first.

In fact, I met so many people that hate black people when Obama became president that I could look out the window and easily count 50 people sitting outside at the smoke pit that would say, Ill never accept a black man for president, and every single one of them had varying levels of security clearances because it was a submarine base. Ive been there around them. I know first hand people that hate Jews. I met the sketchiest fucking Russian man you could ever meet who was for some weird ass reason, in possession of a top secret security clearance, in the U.S. navy. The number of cocaine users is astronomically high, hell, I saw some literally smoking meth and hes still an officer right now. There are people with gambling addictions and people who spend 90% of their paychecks on strippers every single for payday, forcing them to eat at the mess hall because they are broke bitches and make poor financial decisions. Ive even met a two sex traffickers *before* they got caught. Every single person Ive mentioned so far had a secret, top secret clearance.\\n  \\nSo for you to say, she has at least a secret clearance in a way suggesting theres no way she is suspicious or has secret motives means nothing. Im sorry to break it to you so roughly. They catch people who cant pass the clearance, but most still pass through.","title":"Dem Rep.

It is sort of a compromise between a full default, which is where the federal government has been heading towards, and massively raising taxes while simultaneously cutting spending to pay off the debt. It is also more fair to elderly and impoverished people than using inflation (implicit default), which is what has previously been pursued to an extent by the federal government.The odious debt doctrine is an established legal principle  \\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/odious-debt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/odious-debt.asp)[https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osgdp20074\\\\_en.pdf](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osgdp20074_en.pdf)An obstacle to this is the 14th Amendment.

She got a lot of flak for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017 and questioning U.S. intelligence about chemical attacks in Syria, which critics say played into Russian-backed narratives. On top of that, Russian outlets like RT gave her a surprising amount of positive coverage during her 2020 presidential campaign, which raised eyebrows.Things escalated in 2019 when Hillary Clinton suggested that a Democratic candidate - widely assumed to be Gabbard - was being groomed by Russia to run as a third-party spoiler and help Trump win re-election. Gabbards comments about NATO and the Ukraine war, where she said the West provoked Russia, only added fuel to the fire and gave her critics more ammunition.Gabbard has denied all of this, calling the claims baseless smears. She even sued Clinton for defamation, though she later dropped the case.

Even with the damage to our institutions, facts still matter a lot more in the former settings.  We've been at this for 10 years now, there is a right and wrong way to resist trump.The wrong way is the meandering approach that his opponents took in the primaries.  Put your head down, do your job, wait for trump to screw up, then hope you can clean up.  Democrats that take this approach are the Governors and congress people that talk about \\"working with\\" trump.  The ones that think they can treat him like a normal president, respect the office, flatter him to do the right things, take advantage of his vanity, and thereby undercut his worst impulses.  Sure this sounds noble and pragmatic, and when trump was surrounded by more serious people it could at times be effective.  But trump is now surrounded by people that will indulge the very worst impulses such tactics are designed to undercut.  trump will just use any deference or willingness to play by the rules against his opponents.  We can still play by the rules, but we need to understand that a lot of the old rules no longer apply.The correct approach is to go right at him.  He's a bully, and the only way to stop a bully is to stand up to him.  Blue state governors need to recognize that yes trump won, but they also represent voters that absolutely despise him and his agenda.  70 million of us voted against him and our constitution is designed to protect the minority from the very kind of tyranny trump is aiming to wield.  Operationally, this means when trump orders the feds into blue cities, those Governors and Mayors need to order their police chiefs that in no uncertain terms they are to respect their chain of command and respect their jurisdictions right to self determination.  No \\"we look forward to the Federal government assisting us with this problem\\", no \\"the president won and this is his agenda\\".  No.  When trump threatens to pull funding for blue states or otherwise punish them for not showing proper fealty, we need to dare him to do it.  Rolling over for trump to \\"get what you need\\" or to mitigate the damage only gives him a reservoir for the next power grab.  He has a toxic grip on the psyche of this country and a lot of it comes from the fact that hes able to humiliate his opponents.  It makes him look powerful and unstoppable which draws people to him.  Most of the power that authoritarians wield is power that is freely given to them.  People play by the rules in hopes that they will too.  People shy away from resistance because theyre exhausted and the cost becomes too high.  yeah we're all tired and demoralized, but there is an effective model to stopping this motherfucker.

She criticized US military aid to Ukraine, arguing that aid prolongs suffering and suggesting that the US should prioritize negotiations on Moscows terms.  On social media, she referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a pawn of the West, a term often used in Russian state media to discredit the leadership in Kyiv.  Such statements, as well as her frequent appearances on platforms promoting pro-Russian narratives, have fueled speculation about her ties to Moscow.\\"","title":"Dem Rep.

Tariffs are not a free trade thing. Free trade invites moving manufacturing to places where its cheaper. it can lead to cheaper prices for consumers, it definitely leads to bigger profit margins, but it comes at the expense of jobs here.

The first presidents of Johns Hopkins and Cornell were both prominent Skull &amp; Bones members. Cornell is also connected to Skull &amp; Bones through the Morrill Bill land grant. And of course, Yale is home to Skull &amp; Bones. Johns Hopkins, one of the [Covid corona simulation party planners](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) and official Covid data compilers, has been connected to The Order of Skull &amp; Bones since 1876.Hopkins first president was Bonesman Daniel Coit Gilman.**If Prescott Bush could become an instant Captain in a regiment with the same number (322) as his fraternity chapter** - then why could not son Bush be favorably considered when medals were handed out?  It is not unknown to allocate so many medals per unit for distribution at the discretion of the commanding officer. ^1THOSE on the inside know it as **The Order.** Others have known it for more than 150 years as **Chapter 322 of a German secret society.** More formally for legal purposes, The Order was incorporated as **The Russell Trust in 1856.**  It was also once known as the Brotherhood of Death.  **Those who make light of it, or want to make fun of it, call it Skull &amp; Bones, or just plain Bones.** ^2The American chapter of this German order was founded in 1833 at Yale University by General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft who, in 1876, became Secretary of War in the Grant Administration. Alphonso Taft was the father of William Howard Taft, the only to be both President and Chief Justice of the United States.**What is the significance of the 322 in Chapter 322?**  William Russell imported the society from Germany and so it has been argued the 322 stands for 32 (from 1832), the second chapter, of this German organization. Possibly a chapter 320 and a chapter 321 may exist somewhere.  And 323 is the designation of a room within the Skull &amp; Bones temple at Yale.Another interpretation is that The Order is descended from a Greek fraternal society dating back to Demosthenes in 322 B.C.  This has perhaps some credibility because Bones records are dated by adding 322 to the current year, i.e., records originating in 1950 are dated Anno - Demostheni 2272.According to the US News &amp; World Report, May 13, 1991, when asked by a reporter if he had news about the rebellion in Iraq? **George HW Bush** answered only with the code-word seven. According to the magazines source seven refers to the fact that, because Skull &amp; Bones has fifteen members, a majority eight vote means yes and seven votes represents a no, lose or fail. The source also reports that when the president was invited to a meeting in the Tomb,... he declined because he could not enter its inner sanctum without his Secret Service officers, none of whom are members. **Bush was then fined  and he subsequently paid  $3.22 for missing a meeting.** ^3322 is the Orders particular, peculiar number, and is on the door and inlaid on the floor of their sanctum sanctorum in the upstairs of the original hall.  What 322 means has been debated for years.  Some say that it relates to the year 1832 when the Yale society was founded and the second 2 meant it was a second chapter of a German secret society. Some say it represents the date of the death of Demosthenes, claiming it was upon his philosophy that Bones was founded.  Others point to the occultic and numerological aspects of the number.  Again there are several differing explanations.  One being that 322 represents the symbolic dimensions for an isosceles triangle with three as the base and the twos becoming equal sides. In an isosceles triangle with the point of the apex representing a Logos, and the two equal sides flowing from it representing the masculine and feminine rays, the horizontal base-line stands for the physical foundation from which the manifested objective world starts into existence.The most visible and recognized symbol of the group is the skull and crossbones.  A symbol of death, that is found on bottles of poison, pirates flags and the Nazi totenkopf, deaths head the insignia of the Nazi Schutzstaffel or, as commonly known, the SS. It has been used in Prussia for elite troops as far back as 1740.**A History of Drug Trafficking**Skull and Bones  **the Russell Trust Association**  was first established among the class graduating from Yale in 1833. Its founder was [William Huntington Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Huntington_Russell) of Middletown, Connecticut.  The Russell family was the master of incalculable wealth derived from **the largest U.S. criminal organization of the nineteenth century: Russell and Company, the great opium syndicate.** ^4Not only did Skull and Bones become a **major force in drug smuggling (the Bush and Prescott families in the 1860s), but in true Hegelian fashion, generated the antithesis, the so-called war on drugs.** This hypocritical policy maintains the price of drugs, controls supply, and puts millions in jail while the gainers, in great part, are none other than the same Bonesmen who pass the laws to prohibit (Bonesman Taft, 1904). ^2**References**^1 Two Faces of George Bush\\nAntony Sutton, 1988^2 Americas Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones,\\nAntony C.

Josephson ran into problems with the corrupt Rockefeller Syndicate and AMA. He would go on to write several books aimed at the Rockefeller Syndicate. Josephson also wrote of Weishaupts historical Bavarian Illuminati.  Writing that **the Illuminati merged with European Freemasonry in 1782, and forced the Vatican to reinstate the Jesuit Order.** Nesta Websters earlier work also mentions this. Josephson acknowledges the Rothschilds as more of serving the Vatican/Jesuit/Illuminati. Josephson writes:Several groups of members offered Weishaupt special problems. The Protestant princes and rulers of Germany and Europe were delighted with Weishaupts plan to destroy the Catholic Church, and they flocked to the Order. **They brought with them control of the Masonic Order, in which they initiated Weishaupt and his fellow conspirators in 1777.  Subsequently, at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, they effected a merger of the Order of Illuminati and the Masonic Order. Weishaupt sought and welcomed the powerful support of these rulers.** But he realized that he must not permit them to suspect that, in furtherance of his internationalist goal of One World dictatorship, the Order was dedicated to destroying them also. Weishaupt craftily solved this problem by limiting the princes and rulers to the lower degrees and barring them from the knowledge of the true purposes of the Order, that were revealed, cautiously, only to those in the higher degrees. ^1Renegade Jesuits, whom Weishaupt initially welcomed, then rejected, and finally welcomed once again into the Order, and Jews, who were initially rejected and later were welcomed, also constituted special problems.  Eventually, however, Weishaupt and his successors welcomed into the Order these groups, and all others that could be trusted to be thoroughly discontent with the prevailing order. And it was primarily, renegade Catholics, chronic malcontents and revolutionaries among the Protestants, and Jews who were selectively advanced to the highest degrees and innermost secrets of the Order of Illuminati and its successor organizations.An amusing story is told of the earliest relations of the Rothschilds with the Vatican. The Vatican found itself short of ready cash after almost half a century of war waged on it for the Jesuit Order by one of its unordained members, Adam Weishaupt, to avenge its abolition, in 1773, as immoral and a menace to the Church and the Faith by short-lived Pope Clement XIV in his Papal breve Dominus Ac Redemptor. Weishaupt and his fellow Jesuits cut off the income to \\nthe Vatican by launching and leading the French Revolution; by directing Napoleons conquest of Catholic Europe; by the revolt against the Church led by such priests as Father Hidalgo, in Mexico and Latin America; by eventually having Napoleon throw Pope Pius VII in jail at Avignon until he agreed, as the price for his release, to \\nreestablish the Jesuit Order. This Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret, 1822, Treaty of Verona. (72:8 ;73) ^2The Jesuits thus so completely impaired the credit of the Vatican that no Christian banker would entrust it with a loan of needed funds. Only the nouveau riche Jewish upstarts, who had made their fortune in the latter part of the Napoleonic wars, the Rothschilds, would trust the Church with urgently needed 5 million pounds. Pope Gregory XVI was so grateful to the Rothschilds that he conferred on Kalman Rothschild a Papal decoration. In deference to the Jewish faith of the philanthropic banker, the usual cross in the decoration was replaced by a Star of David. Rothschild was incensed at this discriminatory gesture. He demanded, and was awarded, the decoration with a cross. Ever since, the Rothschilds have been the fiscal agents of the Vatican. The Rothschilds sought to extend their financial and political dominion to the United States, for themselves primarily to serve the interests of their Vatican masters.\\nEdit: formatting **REFERENCES**^1 Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

That last one gets your lymphatic system moving and waste products expelled.One thing to not do is have any fear. Fear is known to weaken your immune system. The fact that you are alive and cognizant of the whole situation means that you are in a position to do something about it.

Do all the research you can, and then do whatever you can with what resources you have, and you should be fine.Shake off your fear, and get proactive in your approach to your life.

I do not think a statistically significant portion of leftists would ever vote Trump lmfao and its hardly their fault that the Harris campaign (basically a 2012 Republican platform promising to continue genocide in Gaza) did not appeal to those who stayed home. Thats on the admin/campaign team, not on the individuals who werent part of the demographics the campaign chose to target.I didnt vote Kamala. I voted Claudia and Karina, but did so knowing my states electoral votes were safely blue so I didnt *have to* vote Harris. Im one of the more informed, high-propensity voters and the Harris campaign was off-putting at nearly every point.Did I think C&amp;K would magically win and stop the genocide? No. But the only power I have in this process (being in a guaranteed blue county/state) is in downballot voting and trying to pressure the campaign to change course on Palestine, the border, and economic messaging. I tried, didnt work, so it goes. Lots of us tried, dems didnt budge, dems lost (and would have lost even if every morally abstaining leftist voted dem). I suppose I dont understand people like you, who are ostensibly against genocide or inhumane deportation UNLESS its happening to people who didnt vote how you wanted, in which case get bent and theyre cooked.

To borrow from Bill Clintons Republicans fall in line, Democrats fall in love, I say if you say something bad and untrue about their candidate, Republicans wont believe and Democrats want to believe. Just look at how the two parties voters handled their candidates clearly age related declines. They both took the circular approach. Republicans circled their wagons and shut the story down while Democrats formed a circular firing squad and let it dominate the narrative. The problem is, the Democrats just do not have the echo chamber to control narratives the way Republicans and or the far left can. Make the kind of ads like the Republicans did with Harris did targeting different pro-Israel or pro-Palestine voters as the article discussed, and the Republicans/Green Party will make sure Democratic Pro-Israel voters will see that ad targeting Pro-Palestine voters. But more importantly, it just does not work, at least with Trump because Republicans just do not want to believe. And this is not an opinion, we know this for a fact. And we know this not from lies we have had to make up against Trump, but the truth. Democrats have tried to target Christians with all of Trumps un-Christian like words and actions, and it does not move the needle of his base (or floor). They will figure out a way to justify it.

If we want to truly lose our prejudices, not talking about our gender identity is the way to go. We need to stop labeling people as anything other than people. In fact i would encourage u to stop labeling ur self as trans. Think of it like this. If u truly believe that u are the sex u have changed to, then why call ur self trans in any other situation which is unnecessary. At a dr appointment u might need to admit that ur trans for medical reasons. If ur on a dating site u might need to admit that ur trans so u can be honest with the person whom u might spend the rest of ur life with. If ur at the store there doesnt red to be a mention of it by anyone. I wouldnt bring it up unless others start being hateful. I only say this because I realize that a significant portion of our society is defined by the sexual orientation. However, I am heterosexual and when I talk about myself that never gets brought up because it doesnt define who I am. Just like u being trans shouldnt define who u are. I dont know u but I believe every person has a beautiful person inside. Some of them have locked that beautiful person up in a prison cell in their mind and dont allow it to be seen because theyre too worried about other people. Just be that beautiful person. Stop worrying about what other people say or do.  There will be haters. Let them hate. Because u cant control other people, u can only control urself and ur own reaction to them. Learn not to care about their opinions because they have a right to them even if we dont like them. Once I learned this lesson I became a much happier person. Believe it or not, heterosexuals can go through self hatred also. Once i learned to really love myself and not care what other people thought, I found peace. Hopefully u can find urs.","title":"Hi Im a member of the lgbt community and I voted for trump."},{"text":"Dobbs was constitutionally incorrect.

Jews in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw ads from the same group with the opposite message: Harris wanted to stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel.Another group promoted Kamalas bold progressive agenda to conservative-leaning Donald Trump voters, while a third filled the phones of young liberals with videos about how Harris had abandoned the progressive dream. Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.**What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single, $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk** who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the groups efforts obtained by The Washington Post.","title":"Inside the Republican false-flag effort to turn off Kamala Harris voters"},{"text":"400 a month with crazy interest is insane.

It's breaking my heart."},{"text":"So I'm not sure if this will change your view or shed light on my perspective but here we go. First, viewing many hours of violent media every day at a young age has been shown to increase apathy and aggression as the person grows older. However this only seems to be true up until the brain is fully developed. After the brain is developed, desensitization can still occur but it is mostly just the brain getting used to the stimulus and recognizing that no harm is actually present. Link to a page that has compiled sources: https://www.apa.org/topics/video-games/violence-harmful-effects \\nAccess to this much violent media really only started around the 80's and maybe late 70's, which means that  Gen X is the first generation to have experienced the effects of violent media with things like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And I think you can see this trend quite easily, Boomers and some Gen X tend to dislike gorey media, but are still okay with action films as long as the violence and gore is not too over the top. Millennials and Gen Z seem to ENJOY horror and violent films and are not necessarily grossed out as much. I think this can be attributed to having more access to violent media at a younger age.\\nPersonally, I fall into this category. I am not an emotional person and am very apathetic to anything I see on TV, characters dying or getting hurt is irrelevant to me and I rarely ever feel anything for the characters either. I find more enjoyment in watching how the characters navigate a scenario and try to overcome the odds. Breaking Bad is a great example of this, and Walter White is an amazing character. Do I really care that Walt has cancer and his family is being torn apart? Not really, but it creates a very very interesting tension that I would never want to experience in real life (for obvious life changing reasons), but it is very interesting to try and see things from Walt's point of view and try and figure out how he will \\"win\\".\\nNow I do think that viewing violent media at a young age causes apathy and does not illicit the anxiety response one would expect, but I think this happens for a different reason. Moral Decoupling theory explains this perfectly I think. If a child begins viewing violent media at a young age they will slowly become desensitized to it, at the same time children learn to separate fact from fiction and apply moral decoupling. This creates the effect described above where violent media no longer creates an anxiety effect in the brain, but still allows for people to recognize that those violent behaviours are wrong and not tolerable in real life. Anecdotally, while I am a very apathetic person regarding characters in a show, I find it extremely difficult when others are upset around me. I want nothing more than for everyone to be happy and fulfilled because that means I will be happy and fulfilled. Performing violent actions like those in violent media will not achieve that goal.\\nIn any case, violent media is not a new concept and has been around for as long as we have. People find watching violence to be enjoyable (e.g. the roman colosseum) and I don't know if that will ever go completely away. However, I will say that our propensity for violence has been decreasing drastically since the dawn of civilization (see Steven Pinkers work). To me this suggests that while most humans find violence to be interesting, most recognize that this violence is not helpful or beneficial to themselves or society and thus it is shunned and shameful to be violent in that way. \\nInstead of watching real people fight to the death in an arena, we now watch films and sports where that aggression can be imbibed without consequences. And this is where I think the key point lies. Viewing violent media does not create consequences in any one person's life and thus it leads people to finding the violence interesting instead of revolting. The anxiety response that people who do not view violent media experience is instinctual and so once the brain recognizes that there is no real threat, then that anxiety goes away and you are left feeling apathetic or interested in the violence instead of being afraid of it. I find it very similar to becoming desensitized to loud noises at a job. Eventually the brain recognizes the noises are not actually harmful and so you can instead work without the fear of something bad happening.\\nSo while I agree that viewing violent media can make you more apathetic to violence in the media, I don't think people actually want that to happen in or around their lives.","title":"CMV: Enjoying fictionalized violence/cruelty in movies does in fact say something about you as a person"},{"text":"Seems like a good call.

Imagine if your intention was to read the novel and actively cheer for Humbert in his crimes. The point of slasher movies is to get the audience to root for a violent serial killer by presenting characters flimsy and unlikable enough to justify celebrating their deaths.I strongly disagree. Yes, Lolita is written in a way that makes it clear to the audience that what Humbert is doing is extremely wrong and we should not cheer for him. But it also *humanizes* him. Since the novel is told from his perspective, the audience understands that he is also struggling with the desires he has at times and we see him as an evil person, yes, but still a person. It also humanizes his victim - despite how in his narration, he tries to blame it all on Dolores, the audience and see through it and understand that what happens to her is unjustifiable. It allows the audience to engage with the topic.Slashers on the other hand dehumanize the villain as much as their victims.

Imagine if your intention was to read the novel and actively cheer for Humbert in his crimes.  The point of slasher movies is to get the audience to root for a violent serial killer by presenting characters flimsy and unlikable enough to justify celebrating their deaths.The problem is that in order to process those themes, you need to interact with them in a safe manner. Knowing it's fiction and nobody actually got hurt in telling this story while at the same time being aware that such awful things do happen to real people the real world actually allows many people to approach the topic and start speaking about it. Interacting directly with real violence is much too traumatizing for many people.I understand this point and I think it's fair, but I also think it's being very charitable to the audiences for these films.  I don't think people are buying tickets to Terrifier 3 to test their tolerance or to confront challenging themes in a safe manner.  Maybe I'm just completely wrong on that front but based on how it's marketed, I don't think so.But we are. Yes, you're viewing other people suffering, but you do it consensually (you chose to see the film), and you have the safety buffer of knowing that these people aren't real. You can approach the topic at your own pace (choice of movie with the amount of violence you're comfortable seeing) when you're in the right headspace (when and where to watch) and if it's too much for you, you can always stop and leave the cinema.I think the problem I have with this approach is that fiction is never in a bubble.  Using Terrifier 3 for example, it has a scene of a bombing at a shopping mall.  That's not an idea that spawned into someone's mind out of thin air.  Things like that have happened in real life and are being played not to challenge the audience, but to excite them.  Yes, the people who die in that on screen explosion do not exist, but the people who have died in countless real life ones did.  At the end of the day, it is still the depiction of mass murder and terrorism played with the same gravitas as Rocky Balboa winning the championship fight.","title":"CMV: Enjoying fictionalized violence/cruelty in movies does in fact say something about you as a person"},{"text":"Hasnt happened hysterical person","title":"The End of US Democracy Was All Too Predictable"},{"text":"lets gooooo","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"At least Palestine will be free now?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"And he is deficient at both.","title":"Jill Biden gives letter to Trump to give to Melania after she skips White House meet"},{"text":"Counter opposition.

Thats unknown in my opinion and individual for every case. Is enjoyment of macabre associated with increase in psychopathic or dark triad features? Again, I believe its individual.Its anecdotal but let me show you my example. When I was young, in my late teens, I used to like these kinds of movies, they were novel and I was *still innocent*, they *excited me*. They were something new and my dopamine was flying high, as is the case with novelty. I was a very good kid back then, devoted and practicing Christian, I would look for homeless people in winter and buy them clothes for whatever money I had. Maybe the gore was sort of Edens Apple?Then, in my early 20s  a series of major mental illnesses came and I had to go through some serious shit. My brain desensitized over these years to the point I became half-psychopath. It was my brains survival mechanism, if it hadnt done it, I would probably be dead. Moreover, I studied anatomy class and was dealing with dead bodies for a year. I watched Terrifier 2 with my girlfriend yesterday but stopped in the 1/3 and couldnt continue. It was the first movie in many, many years that I didnt finish, I almost always finish movies as otherwise I feel like I have lost time. It just didnt create any emotions in me. The story was boring as fk and I felt like an 80 year old man with atrophied testicles watching a porn video for the plot. Who watches porn for plot if they dont feel\\nanything? To sum up, I believe it can go both ways. Someone might be a sick fuck who loves to see others suffer and gets a lot of entertainment from movies like this. Then, someone might be an innocent, good person, for whom gore stuff like Terrifier is an Adams Apple, a forgiven fruit spiking dopamine like a good coke. If they become devoid of emotions in general, the enjoyment disappears.","title":"CMV: Enjoying fictionalized violence/cruelty in movies does in fact say something about you as a person"},{"text":"Link?

If there's no distinction between the two, and people?*just*?don't care about or are completely desensitised to violence, then why pay money for a less-real version of what they can see for free at home?Fair question, before I answer it let me ask you in return; if the appeal of these movies is NOT to watch violence and suffering, why does that make up the majority of their runtime?  Why are they so successful?  We cannot pretend that there is some greater artistic vision to them, or that such movies tend to do well with general audiences to begin with.I notice you use the logic of seeing people dress up as slasher villains, but there have been droves of people sharing their Halloween costumes of Lauren LaVera's final girl, Sienna, a character who has spent two films on a mission to end Art The Clown's violent rampage. If wearing an Art costume shows people condone and enjoy violence, then it must logically follow that those wearing Sienna's must abhor and want a stop to on-screen killings?I think it's a bit naive to assume that the protagonist characters in these films are even remotely as lionized as the slashers themselves are.  Most people cannot even name the victims of Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger.  I'd also argue that the reason her costume exists is because it's a literal plot point in the second movie, because if she wasn't a cosplayer wearing an elaborate outfit for Halloween you'd probably not see what she wears sold at Spirit Halloween.It's interesting that you discuss fictionalised violence, but only really within the gory horror sphere. Comic book films use violence frequently, are they a symptom of a broken society? Are people who watch war films doing so because they genuinely love battlefield killings, what does?*that*?say about them as a person?These films don't really use them for the sake of voyeurism.  There ARE war movies with jingoistic sentiments but that's a separate can of worms.  I specifically named Saving Private Ryan because it has an infamously distressing scene of a young soldier dying.  Nobody who watches that movie is cheering for it the way they do a Freddy Krueger kill.  If you want to see what happens when a war movie DOES start catering to people like that, look at the Rambo franchise.  The first film is a very serious and very sincere military drama, the rest are ra ra USA patriotism.Some of the top grossing films of the year are Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, Dune Part Two, Godzilla X Kong, and Kung Fu Panda 4. All depict violence in different ways, and people clearly want to see it, yet those sort of films don't appear to be an issue in your post. What's the difference, is it practical effects rather than a violent act in and of itself? How confident are you that you can draw a line and say on one side you have people that are enjoying an action film for wholesome reasons, and on the other side you have people that are enjoying on screen violence because they have a bloodlust and desire to see injury and pain inflicted?Again, those films are not designed from the ground up and marketed with the premise that you will watch innocent people be horrifically butchered.  Deadpool and Wolverine is a superhero movie where good guys in spandex fight bad guys in spandex.  Kung Fu Panda is a martial arts fantasy.  Dune is a drama that uses violent and distressing themes to share a thematic vision with the audience.  I don't really see where I'm contradicting myself here, it's like saying that a Seth Rogen stoner flick is comparable to Requiem for a Dream because they both have characters using drugs.  To be clear, I have no issue with those two things, but still.","title":"CMV: Enjoying fictionalized violence/cruelty in movies does in fact say something about you as a person"},{"text":"Holy shit!

Jaws certainly hurt their public image, but sharks aren't endangered because people saw the movie and went out to kill them.

The Slenderman stabbing and James Holmes? These are literally one-in-a-millions events among the billions of people who consume violent media daily. By this logic, we should also ban romance movies because stalkers exist, or racing movies because of street racing deaths.I understand the basis of this argument and I don't think it's a bad one.  However, I think it's a false equivalency.  Romances that depict glorified cases of stalking tend to be fringe cases that are rightfully criticized.  Slashers are different in that the entire appeal of the genre hinges upon enjoyment from watching an antagonist do bad things to people.This actually proves the opposite of what you're claiming. If we're constantly exposed to real violence and tragedy on social media, then fictional violence serves as a healthy outlet for processing these feelings. It's precisely BECAUSE we're aware of real horror that we need safe spaces to engage with these themes.I guess I can only really speak for myself, but if I've got a stomach ache the last thing I want is to eat more food.

I'd like to rescind those people from my criticism, so in that regard I consider this a success at changing my view, which is much appreciated.  However, my criticism remains for people who are actively engaging in these movies just to watch (fictional) people suffer out of a sense of voyeuristic cruelty.I've worked in trauma counseling. You know what many of my clients found therapeutic? Horror movies. They helped them process their fears and trauma in a controlled environment where THEY had the power - they could pause, walk away, or watch with friends.This anecdote helps me understand your position a bit more.  I myself am a victim of assault and I know for a fact that I don't enjoy when movies glamorize things like what happen to me for the sake of exploitative shock value.  Again, everyone copes differently, so I guess in that regard I can only speak for myself.  If there are people who do find these depictions help them vent then I respect that.  But again, I do not respect people who get a kick out of seeing people be sexually assaulted.The fact that you bring up Berserk shows you're missing the point entirely.

But what this guy was mostly raving about has to do with the GS. Particularly its eDRAM and the somewhat absurd 2560-bit memory bus as well as the very wide 16 pipeline core. This design is very interesting because the potential pixel throughput is very high which is needed due to the low clocks of the GS, but the eDRAM and memory bus are not necessarily advantages and more necessities to keep the GS fed. The bandwidth looks very high but the GS can only read from the eDRAM, so most of it is spent on marshalling. And GS is fixed function and you're essentially limited to some masking and RMW operations which have to be chained which is horrendously inefficient. PS2 likely had horrendous overdraw issues which was fine at the time because memory bandwidth was relatively keeping up with CPU speed. Pixel shaders even at their early stage could of course much more efficiently perform operations that a fixed function pipeline could. This has some interesting corollaries. For starters, the PS2 is very good at rendering fog and really anything with lots of layered alpha textures. The fog in Silent Hill 2 had to be downgraded not just for the Xbox release but for the PS3 as well. Tonemapping on the other hand is a major problem since it requires too many GS operations. One of the most impressive things about GT3/4 is probably the image options screen even though it doesn't stand out at all.Another thing is that while the OG Xbox was very graphically capable, there's a lack of games that really showcase this and some of them barely any have played. Yes, there are stuff like [Far Cry Instincts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqVm7uNUaU&amp;t=3343s) which is so absurdly ahead of anything the PS2 could muster up but have fun arguing this to fanboys who think MGS3 on PS2 looks and runs like MGS3 HD.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Blood tests to check for a Y chromosome.

That I am convinced, was a much more run-of-the-mill kind of attempt, spurred by financial incentive and ideological fervor coming together in an unstable individual.But the first attempt was not that. It was much more carefully, yet hastily, orchestrated and only a fraction of an inch from being successful. A pretty clear case of security-stripping.There were apparently some indications via findings at the scene and his house that he was a possible recruit and asset for one of the Feds' entrapment operations involving making bombs.The assassin was being tapped, but not as a shooter, because of his aforementioned limitations.This is why it is belived to be a hasty attempt thrown together at a late hour, after the major attempts to use lawfare to neutralize Trumplestiltskin failed and after his winning of the primary. The final security-stripping occured the night before and morning of the event, based on the supposed need to cover a sudden and seemingly arbitrary trip to the state by Jill Biden.Those in power who chose to do this needed a *disposable* asset to do it though. If it even *looked* too professional, it would *definitely* start a civil war, rather than there being the mere possibility of it after Trumplestiltskin's death, which they were already clearly prepared to manage via the media, judging by how they reacted in lockstep, complete with an apparent directive to ignore and minimize it (just like you're doing) while they whistled past the graveyard and hoped no one would notice all the fuckery they'd had to engage in, just to make sure it could even happen.The second attempt as I said, was likely a fluke for two reasons: the first being that not just the public, but members of the opposing faction of the aristocracy were now looking directly at the SS and elsewhere, digging to find out who might have orchestrated the attempt and on high alert to even more bullshit.The other was the fact the near miss demonstrated that he would have become a martyr if killed and no one would ever believe it wasn't the government.Which meant that it would be the government the people came for. Not their cats-paws and proxies. Them.And the people would not bother trying to differentiate to see who should be spared, so it wouldn't even matter which faction had done it.So both 'sides' of the uniparty shut it all down, with any discussion of it kept to a minimum and as I said, full of minimizations and scolding about people believing in conspiracy theories.But hey, it's not like the only difference these days between a conspiracy theory and accepted fact is about six months to a year, right?","title":"Donald Trump gets unexpected praise from Bernie Sanders: \\"Good idea\\""},{"text":"your exclusionary language is problematic, i think you mean Latinx mxn","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"\\"Liberals always support fascists\\"","title":"Donald Trump Gets Unexpected Praise from Bernie Sanders: 'Good Idea'"},{"text":"Gotta say deleting Twitter has honestly been really effective.

Its better to do some good rather than block every policy that wont monetarily benefit you.People werent up and arms about farmers getting subsidies when Trump was putting farmers out of business, werent upset about PPP loans, both of which didnt affect everyone.Its literally the top 1% putting the middle and lower classes against each other. And were falling for it. We should pretty much all be on the same side here, trying to make the multi-billionaires pay and have an effective tax rate to at least what someone making $60,000/yr makes. But no, you and I are paying more of our incomes percentage-wise in taxes than Bezos, Gates, Elon, Biden, or Trump. Stop fighting everyday working people over whats essentially pennies to these people. $1.6 trillion in student loans. Trump and Biden both ran up the national debt ~$7 trillion. Guarantee the 45 million Americans who have loans each would easily put $30,000 back into the economy over a decade that wouldnt have been there before equaling to about $1.8 trillion towards businesses rather than banks.","title":"President Joe Biden has forgiven over $166 billion in student debtsee how much in each state"},{"text":"https://youtu.be/dslLBsHkVzE?si=8rRe1baOo8E9Hc37tl;dw - Just some usual crypto pump and dump from Mr Beast","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It's because they're addicted to their fame.

You know how they got 128 bit? Well, at the time a new SIMD instruction sets were being rolled out on CPU design. Basically, these relied on packing like, 4 or so 32 bit values into a single 128-bit register and preforming operations on them simultaneously. So it only actually operated on 32 bit values, and was otherwise an entirely 32 bit chipset.The cpu the emotion engine is based on didn't even originally have SIMD capabilities. Sony hacked something together by basically smashing two of the previous designs 64 bit FPUs together. It was inelegant, but it worked and provided genuine performance benefits.You know what else simultaneously was a 32 bit chip that was integrating SIMD capabilities, including 128 bit \\"packing\\" registers at the time? The pentium III - it's called SSE. By the standards that the emotion engine is a 128 bit chip, the Pentium III in the Xbox also would be. In fact SSE probably has better SIMD capabilities all said than the sort of hacked together arrangement of the emotion engine.All of this was done of course in the first place because the \\"bit war\\" was kind of at its tail end, so how could you outstrip the N64 without more bits right? Nevermind that in practice most N64 games were more or less entirely coded in 32 bit for performance reasons. So that was also really 32 bit.

This is stated on the European Commissions website. Each of the five selected projects is being implemented under the European Defence Industry Reinforcement through Common Procurement Act (EDIRPA). The total budget of the program is 300 million, and each of the funding areas will receive 60 million. The five selected projects represent a total procurement value of more than 11 billion. In this way, the European Union ensures more efficient use of funds through the mechanism of joint large-scale procurement. In addition, such joint projects increase the interoperability of EU member states forces. The clearer prospects and greater predictability that come with larger contracts will strengthen European industry and allow it to adapt its production capacity to Europes defense needs. Overall, joint procurement will strengthen the defense capabilities of EU member states, the European Commission stated. In addition to the selected projects, other promising areas were submitted. They have been added to the reserve list so that they can be identified for potential funding in the future. The European Commission emphasizes that most of the selected projects also involve the purchase of defense products intended for Ukraine, including air defense systems and ammunition. EU countries are leading two projects to strengthen joint capabilities in air and missile defense. The Mistral project supports the joint procurement of air defense systems of the same name by nine member states. Another project, JAMIE (Joint Air and Missile Defense Initiative for Europe), involves the joint procurement of IRIS-T SLM medium-range air defense systems by six EU member states.\\nIRIS-T SLM air defense missile system.  EDIRPA also finances the purchase of Patria 66 armored personnel carriers for the armed forces of Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Denmark. Two other projects support the joint procurement of different types of 155 mm artillery ammunition, under the CPoA 155 mm and HE 155 mm projects.

Its exactly this. Im no longer gaslighting myself to vote Capital D Democrat against the MAGA alternative. For the exact reason you list out. We need to show these people we mean it. That means voting for a Bernie instead of a Hillary every single time, even if its an election like 2016. Even if it means losing for an entire other generations worth of elections. Thats coming from a Bernie Bro who voted Bernie in the primary and then Hillary in the general no problem. Now looking back, I can see that was a huge mistake. I dont blame myself. I and many other progressives had our valid reasons to fall in line back then after being pissed at how Bernies campaign was never even considered by the party establishment. Did it surprise us? No. But the energy and political power that grew from that grassroots movement was real and should have been harnessed, not outright rejected. That rejection has led us here. Trump won this election by gaining ground with the exact demographics that Bernies populist left movement had done so well with: blacks, Latinos, and brosmen. This election has shown us that people will always vote for their wallets first in this country even at the risk of a horrible future otherwise. And when you think about it, who can blame them? Its a matter of survival. People have kids to fucking feed yet the bills get higher and their Democrat president says the economy is doing soooo well. Its infuriating. That rage is these peoples truth. And now it can be realized given the shocking result of this election. Those who turned to or turned back to Trump in 2024 could not be giving us a clearer message: you want us back? You have to get real then in order to get our vote. You cant serve the stock market, or any corporate or special interests while pretending to advocate for the common working American. Enough bullshit. You work for me. At this point we dont care about the environment. Or our neighbor.  Or our democracy and whether it stays in tact. If we arent being represented at all we will try Trump or reject you flat out until someone with the same understanding and ability as Bernie Sanders comes along. You have to respect it. Its a strong message that will no doubt be studied. This election result may make it easier for the next Bernie Sanders like figure to come along. Bernies inevitable failure to win the presidency serves as an incredibly important lesson taught to the American people. It may be enough for the Democratic Party to finally be radically reformed. Who knows. This is my MOST optimistic view. We very well may never have another election at this point.Paradoxically, the populist MAGA movement that took over the GOP as we once knew it also serves as a lesson or, put more aptly, a blueprint for what needs to happen on the left. I just hope such change will be able to happen in this country. I cant help but feel that these lessons learned regarding progressive populism will only be applicable in other countries contexts. The US is a dictatorship now full stop. Doesnt matter what you think. This is what the Supreme Court has stated, and our politics have resulted in our electorate giving all branches of federal government to an authoritarian party whose only concern is centralizing all power in one man. Calling that anything other than a dictatorship is delusional at this point.","title":"Sanders Says Democrats Have Lost  Their Way - NTY Daily Interview"},{"text":"In 2004, Bush was able to pull it off by shielding America from the lies of the war in Afghanistan and the Iraq Invasion.

Both cases you have the government telling an individual what they can and cannot do with their body. In the case of women it's what they can do with their body. In the case of African Americans it's what they can do with their freedom. Same deal. While I believe in some circumstances abortion is necessaryMost red states that have banned abortion do not let women get one under any circumstances. So far I've seen three stories of women who have died because their state said no on getting abortion care. I also believe that killing another human life because you werent ready to be a mom is a poor morally corrupt excuse.10-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. A miscarriage is your body rejecting the fetus for various reasons. Your morality on this topic is moot.  I believe unborn children are just as entitled to rights as we are.Which is truly wild IMO. It would mean that all miscarriages have to be considered homicides and must be investigated. It means that IVF is effectively impossible to perform, as Alabama briefly found out. It means that women will continue to die and bleed out in parking lots because doctors are unable to treat them.Your stance has killed women, just like everyone told you it would.Ultimately it has opened the door for the government to control the people. It's not going to stop with just this. Why someone would champion the government being able to control the people, I'll never understand.

Walmart &amp; Target are really pushing this inflation narrative.There's no way that swipe fees materially increase costs to retailers.  Know how to prove it?  Go into your local retailer and pay cash.  If they don't give you a cash discount, then swipe fees didn't increase the costs to consumers - at least not as materially as they want you to believe.  If it were *truly* material, why not give a cash discount  Try it with buying a car instead... negotiate a \\"finance\\" versus \\"cash offer\\" and you'll get very different sales prices - because the dealers get significant kick-back from financing offers.  For them, the method of payment matters a lot to their bottom line... but for big box retailers?  No way... it's lobbyists pandering to \\"American consumers\\" to increase profits.Here's an example to illustrate.  I'm using Giant Eagle as a reference since they're cited in your blog post.|Item|Before|After|% Increase|$ Increase|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|COGS|$50|$55|10%|$5|\\n|Sales Price|$52.50|$57.76|10.02%|$5.26|\\n|Service Fee|$1.3125 (2.5%)|$1.4534 (2.51625%\\\\~)|11% (0.65%)|$0.14|\\n|Margin |$1.1875 (2.26%)|$1.3065 (2.26%)|0|$0.12|*\\\\~Where am I getting this number?  Your blog post from 2022 cites that Giant Eagle is quoting a $1.3M cost as a result of the MSF increase.  Their 2021 annual revenue was about $10Bn.  If we assume that 80% of transactions are credit cards, then that $1.3M cost has to be absorbed by $8Bn of Revenue, implying an increase in the MSF of .65%.  In other words, 2.5% paid on 8Bn of Rev = 200M; 2.51625% paid on 8Bn of Rev = 201.3M, which is the increase of 1.3M in cost.*What this example shows is that, in order to hold Giant Eagle's Margin stable at 2.26% (*sidenote: their net is probably around 2 or 3 %... I'm just going to assume constant labor, etc. here to demo the impact of merchant fees vs generic COGS*), then consumers have to pay **$5.26** more for this good.  Those dollars are allocated primarily to the COGS (suppliers) as **$5**, and then roughly equally between Giant Eagle's profit margin and the MSF.  In reality though, we also probably see things like **labor increases** and other GOE increases (like advertising, insurance premiums, etc.) that create even more pressure on the bottom line... so Giant Eagle has to increase the sales price well above simply the COGS increases.  But the important thing is that even though the service fee increased by a large *percentage* (11%), the actual impact to the consumer is quite muted (0.14 / 5.26 = 2.6%).  All of the other inflationary pressures (in this example, COGS) are having an outsized impact relative to the MSF increase they're citing.In addition to this bullshit narrative, the reality is that handling cash is [expensive](https://www.plainscapital.com/blog/the-cost-of-accepting-cash/).  Pennies are more expensive to produce than their value.  Cash has to be continuously pulled out of circulation, destroyed, re-printed and minted, and shipped all over.  Cash can be easily stolen / pilfered, and the US taxes are likely under-reported (thus Fed missing out on money) due to cash transactions.  By pretty much any measure, electronic forms of payment are faster, easier to trace / track / reconcile, more reliable, and safer.  And over the past several decades, we've had even more companies enter the space; from Apple and Google Pay, to proprietary apps like Starbucks, and P2P solutions like Venmo / Zelle.  If anything, the issue with electronic payments should be that they make spending money *too easy*... but retailers aren't putting up any stink about that!I'm certainly not saying we should ban cash entirely... but the false narrative that credit cards are contributing to inflation via merchant service fees should absolutely be challenged.","title":"Bernie Sanders tentatively pledges to support cap on credit card interest rates proposed by Trump."},{"text":"people saw the \\"white guy taco\\" clip and assumed the democrats were going to put people who look like Tim Walz in a concentration camp","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Curiously, the only one actual MAGA guy I've met is a raging antisemite.

There used to be a hell of a lot more forests like this, he said, calling them our planets lungs and extolling their power to fight climate change.The amount of carbon trees suck out of the air increases dramatically with age, making older trees especially important. These trees are also rare: Less than 10% of forests in the lower 48 states remain unlogged or undisturbed by development.The president uncapped his pen, preparing to sign an executive order to protect mature and old-growth forests on federal lands. I just think this is the beginning of a new day, Biden said.But two years later, at a timber auction in a federal office in Roseburg, Oregon, this new day was nowhere to be seen. As journalists and protestors waited outside, logging company representatives filed through a secure glass door to a room where only qualified bidders were allowed.BLM officials believe federal law forces them to keep chopping trees. Its part of a balancing act between resource extraction and other priorities, like recreation and conservation. We are a multi-use agency, spokesperson Brian Hires wrote in response to questions from OPB and ProPublica. We are committed to forest health and providing the timber Americans need.Last year, a pair of appellate court rulings called into question the idea that the O&amp;C Act is little more than a logging mandate. Judges affirmed the BLM and its parent agency, the Department of Interior, have significant discretion in determining how much to cut and where. The Departments duty to oversee the lands is obligatory, reads a 2023 opinion from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but treating every parcel as timberland is not.","title":"Despite Bidens Promise to Protect Old Forests, His Administration Keeps Approving Plans to Cut Them Down"},{"text":"I dont know.

Of this 65% reliably vote republican in basically every election for the last 50 years EXCEPT when there is some major crisis that shakes the faith (Watergate, Financial Crisis, Covid handling) or a split-the-conservative vote alternative (Perot). 70% * 65% = 45.5% With some variation thrown in the base range of voters you find an electorate that is voting conservative ~40-50% in every other state outside of California and most of New England.And there-in is the issue. The Democrats simply have much further to go in every election than the Republicans. The reliable base for the Republican party is 40-50%, for Democrats it's more like 25-35% (Depending on the state).

One example is the \\"Protecting Moms Who Served Act\\" (a bill specifically about post-partum care for veterans), and while it did pass near unanimously, it had 9 House Republicans vote against it  including two mothers who claim to love veterans, Bobo and MTG.What's particularly infuriating is there had been a massive decrease in the number of homeless veterans, and naturally Trump decided to take credit for it  except credit belonged to Obama, who *managed to cut veteran homelessness ~50%* by the end of his second term. Almost immediately after Trump took office, the number of homeless veterans became relatively static, and part of that was due to changes made by Trump's dumbass HUD Secretary Ben Carson to the HUD-VASH program  changes which benefitted and protected landlords.
