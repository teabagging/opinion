This dismissal of President Bidens approach and calling it a failure overlooks a number of key achievements. First, Bidens unwavering support has fortified NATO and expanded it with Sweden and Finlands membership. This sends a clear message to these Muscovy fucks that the alliance is stronger than ever. Additionally, Ukraines resilience and effective defensewith support from Western allieshas surprised much of the world, halting Russias advancement and showing the entire world that Russia is a paper tiger and their 3-Day War was strategically impotent.Sanctions on Russia, though complex, have significantly strained its economy and isolated it to BRICS (which is still a chunk of the worlds GDP and not a real win, tbh), reducing its ability to fund its war effort as effectively as theyd hoped. Despite predictions of swift Russian victories, Ukraine remains free, a testament to international unity against authoritarian aggression. Bidens diplomatic efforts have united Europe and the U.S. (unless Trump wins), managing complex differences within NATO while avoiding direct conflict with Russia, which could risk nuclear escalation.Ukraines resistance has exposed Russias military vulnerabilities and shaken its sphere of influence, causing autocratic regimes to reconsider unchecked military ambitions. While China and Russia may grow closer, this is a predictable alignment rather than a result of Western action. Bidens strategy has prioritized freedom and stability without risking catastrophic escalation, underscoring a balanced commitment to global peace and security. Bidens approach is not one of failure but of measured success in a challenging, multi-dimensional conflict.Now, would I have liked to see a little more hawkishness against Russia. Yes.

Like remember the Simpsons episode where Jomer went to hell and the devil made him eat all the donuts? Like that but innocent little victims. That's worse by a lot. There are a lot of things that need to be drastically overhauled. I think mental health support is severely lacking globally right now. People are not okay. The wealth disparity is getting out of control, AI is going to radically change things, climate change is going to force mass migration. I would say our current cycle of putting people in jail and not offering them realistic pathways to repay society and better themselves is way worse.  Then we put them out on the street with no support and a huge obstacle to re-entering society once they've wasted enough of their life that it feels \\"fair and square\\" for the harm they've caused. I actually honestly believe that's a worse system because it wastes the life of the abuser, we fail to support the victim, then the abuser either cycles in and out of prison or gets out and causes more harm. I know there are success stories, but maybe death is better if we can't actually reform the worst of the worst.","title":"CMV: Death sentence is the single worst way to deal with sexual offenders"},{"text":"\\"Drawing criticism for fanning the flames of the Democratic Party's history of racism and genocide, Harris hopes to mobilize those who identify with the need for eugenics and a state mandated social order\\"-- Jailed Media Weekly","title":"Kamala Harris is delivering her campaigns closing speech at the DC National Mall.

My whole point was that identifying certain political groups as \\"evil\\" or \\"the enemy\\" gets in the way of a little kid learning how to think about the people you disagree with. I feel strongly about this because I experienced my own parents teaching me that anything liberal, left-leaning, or democrat as being bad. It skewed my perspective growing up, and I know that this is a trend that is perpetuated on both sides. I think this kind of good/evil rhetoric only helps a kid grow into someone with extreme views. My perspective is just an effort to make a departure from tribal identity and more towards respectful, individualistic identity. Moving the focus onto issues rather than political parties, in my opinion, helps turn a kid into an informed voter who votes on issues rather than tribal identity.

We also have reasonable expectation that our justice system is not corrupt and actually just. Even those who have issues with the justice system must conclude that the likelihood of a judge being paid off to let someone free, or a prison guard for the same, is very low.However, there are still to this day a great number of places in the world where these things are not true. Either it is very difficult to apprehend a criminal, it is very difficult to ensure justice through a fair trial and just sentencing, or it is difficult to ensure that someone will remain incarcerated. In such societies, it is even less likely that there is any hope for reform for most criminals.When we consider that the sort of criminals we typically see executed are generally the same sort that we see given life in prison as an alternative, an inability to reliably carry that sentence out becomes a great barrier to transitioning away from execution as a means to ensure public safety. These communities simply have no realistic means to avoid executing those who seek to do them harm.So in these (admittedly limited) circumstances, I hope to demonstrate that it may be the most prudent (and just) course of action to execute those who engage in such crimes as rape, which would otherwise be punished by lengthy prison terms.","title":"CMV: Death sentence is the single worst way to deal with sexual offenders"},{"text":"You can leave now.","title":"Kamala Harris is delivering her campaigns closing speech at the DC National Mall.

Homosexual acts being considered illegal, is directly caused by colonialism.If we were to study what is happening as societal issues, we would be much better off explaining it as socio-economic and political issues. For example I would state that people with issues more likely descend from a rural background than an urban one. I would assume they are also poorer and with a lower level of education. .

This takes people who have already shown a penchant for exerting their power over others inappropriately and amplifies this desire/urge in them and teaches them that this is in fact a more optimal way for them to gain power in their lives.Thus, our current system makes people who are offenders less helpful members of society by amplifying these negative traits and then releasing them back into the population.

No sleep, drink or eating?More that when the opportunity presents itself, to fail to do so is the opposite of virtuous (morally evil, sinful if you're religious). For example, if you refuse to save an infant drowning in a shallow pool, you have done an evil thing. Therefore, in order to be a morally upright person, you would have some obligation to do the moral thing. In deontology, you have an actual duty to behave in a moral fashion. It is quite rules-based, where the act itself is what matters, rather than the consequence of the act. We have some obligation to take positive action, not merely refrain from comitting an evil through positive action.Historically human sacrifices ie ritual murder was held as a virtue, as moral. Those societies existed for a very long timeThese societies (with some exceptions like the Aztecs) typically used ritual sacrifice in a way that we would today call the execution of criminals. They merely use religious pretext where we do not, to be entirely fair to these cultures. Does that make it okay? Probably not, but the framing does matter. And just because a society declares that something is virtuous and moral does not make it so (which is why you would correctly identify ritualistic murder as wrong).However, these societies never universalized murder. They had specific circumstances in which they argue that murder is a good thing, beyond which they would not take kindly to you randomly killing someone on the street.","title":"CMV: voting is totally useless"},{"text":"you clearly didnt read the post","title":"CMV: Death sentence is the single worst way to deal with sexual offenders"},{"text":"Who gives a shit! lol","title":"Biden calls Trump supporters 'garbage' during Harris campaign call as VP calls for unity at Ellipse rally"},{"text":"Youve got to come see the Rangers play the Islanders.

After 36 years in the Senate and 8 years as Vice President he only had a net worth of $2.5 million. To wield that much power and have so little money is amazing. Could never happen in actual oligarchies like Russia where the political elites are always the wealthiest people. He spent his whole life being a modest public servant working for the welfare of the American people while living modestly.

This threat-bias can distort reality, fuel irrational fears, and make one more vulnerable to fear-mongering politicians.\\nliberals own more books and travel-related items, conservatives have more things that kept order in their lives, like calendars and cleaning supplies.?\\nthe right-wing response to the pandemic is part of a larger political practice: Victimized Bully Syndrome.\\nSome of you will be familiar with DARVO, an acronym for deny, attack and reverse victim and offender. DARVO describes the behavior of psychological abusers when they are being held accountable for their behavior. Donald Trump and his supporters clearly exhibit DARVO habits. Rather than accept blame for anything they do, they turn around and accuse those blaming them of creating the problem. Victimized Bully Syndrome (VBS), as I'm describing it, though, is slightly different from DARVO. With DARVO the abusive behavior comes first and DARVO only emerges if the attacker is asked to take responsibility. But with VBS the cries of being victims come first and are used to justify the underlying bullying behaviors. The bully under VBS is always already acting in self-defense.\\nTake this example: In a recent interview with Fox News, Dr. Mehmet Oz, candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania suggested that Americans had been victimized by President Biden's \\"one-size-fits-all\\" COVID-19 \\"rules that limit our freedom.\\" According to Oz, U.S. citizens \\"want government to get out of their way to stop scaring them into submission.\\"\\nIf we set aside the sheer stupidity of a doctor suggesting that we need \\"as many different approaches as possible\\" to the pandemic, the critical takeaway is Oz's claim that Biden's policy is designed to victimize the public by scaring them, taking away their freedoms, and destroying their dignity. According to this logic, refusing to wear a mask, get vaccinated, or support public health policy is a valid defense, rather than bullying behavior that puts everyone in peril.\\nAnd lest there be any doubt, the right isn't just refusing to be vaccinated and to follow public health guidelines; in the face of the pandemic they have chosen to respond with aggressive bullying: engaging in violent confrontations over masking policies, attacking teachers, threatening school board members, violently trolling scientists who speak to the media about COVID, and more. In fact, the violent far-right has exploded in the United States along with COVID-19.\\nSimilar to the \\"sore winner syndrome\\" we saw emerge in the wake of former President Trump's election, VBS posits that those on the right are all the time being victimized by their government and that it makes perfect sense to respond aggressively.\\nIt is this exact same logic that was the backdrop to the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and we can see the same logic in play in right-wing responses to the House investigation into the attack. Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich claimed, \\"Democracy is under attack. However, not by the people who illegally entered the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, but instead by a committee whose members walk freely in its halls every day.\\" That's right, according to Budowich the real threat to our democracy are those elected officials investigating what happened on January 6, not the actual people who attacked the Capitol. Those people were, according to this twisted logic, simply victims of election fraud.\\nIt gets worse.\\nThe victim card was at the heart of the Kyle Rittenhouse case as well. Rittenhouse claimed he shot three men, two fatally, with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle in self-defense. In his testimony, Rittenhouse stated the only reason he even went to Kenosha, Wisconsin on the night of the shootings was to provide first aid to people in need. Rittenhouse, then, was no average vigilante. Instead, he was an already victimized one, prepared to claim self-defense if he attacked anyone. In a post-verdict statement issued by the victims' parents, they nail the dangers of Rittenhouse's VBS. The verdict, according to them, \\"sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street.\\nVBS, then, isn't only being used by the right to foster a public health catastrophe, it is literally being used to justify armed murder and armed insurrection. As long as we allow the right to continue to describe themselves as victims who have been harmed, injured, threatened and therefore need to act aggressively in self-defense, the closer we get to civil war. In fact, a recent Public Religion Research Institute poll showed that 30 percent of Republicans believe that \\"true American patriots\\" might need to resort to violence in order to save the country. Nearly 40% still think the election was stolen.\\nSo as long as the victimized bully syndrome pandemic is transmitted across the right-wing community, it will continue to surpass any threats to our nation from any new variants to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until we address the real threats to our nation, we not only won't stop COVID-19; we will allow the true risks to our health and the health of our democracy to continue to spread.","title":"Busted: The Inside Story Of How The Kamala Harris Campaign Manipulates Reddit (And Breaks The Rules) To Control The Platform"},{"text":"It's been exhausting and humiliating being an American since 2016.

I don't mind someone coming in ready to debate but you're not going to change my view by strawmanning me.  you are claiming that the Jews are the colonizers - not the Ottomans and not the BritishNever claimed anything of the sort, find me a quote if you disagree. My last comment even very explicitly directed most of the blame at European/Western powers. I have made a point to bring up their involvement many times in this thread. My take, if you care to hear it, is that the real injustices here were committed mostly by the European/western powers. The Ottomans and British for \\"ruling\\" the area in the first place. The Germans for committing the Holocaust. &lt;Almost every other country in Europe and many other places for being anti-Semitic assholes for two thousand years. The Americans/UN for not pushing for a more equitable solution like carving a Jewish homeland out of German land (because, again, of the Holocaust). The surrounding Arab states for invading immediately instead of supporting the new Palestinian state and finding a non-violent way to coexist with their new neighbors (although this was technically after Israel had formed and thus kind of irrelevant to the colonialist argument). I haven't and wouldn't cast aspersions on any Jewish person who moved to Israel in the 1940s, it was obviously a great opportunity for people who'd been treated terribly for centuries. I'm quite sure I would have done the same in their shoes.  Kindly shove off with that kind of accusation, it honestly reflects quite poorly on you and how you've chosen to read what I've written.  You wanted to ignore the existence of indigenous Jews in the regionI quite literally acknowledged that a small Jewish minority existed continuously in the region in my OP, plus in many comments.   the gradual nature of the immigration to the regionI literally *just* told you why I didn't bring that up initially, and also *just* described why that gradual immigration was colonial in nature. If you want to argue whether it was or wasn't colonial, that's fine - but saying I didn't acknowledge it is nonsense.  the stateless nature of the territoryAddressed that pretty explicitly too! It's in my OP, plus I've discussed it WITH YOU in these comments. They were a colonial possession. Was Kenya also a \\"stateless\\" territory in 1945? Algeria? The Philippines? India? Malaya? Why don't YOU address why the Palestinian territory shouldn't have been given a chance for self-determination, like the vast majority of other former colonial possessions? \\nI'm honestly a little surprised by this response, you'd been pretty reasonable thus far.","title":"CMV: Israel is a colonial state"},{"text":"Wait, I thought bOTh sIdEs ArE tHe SaMe?!

Eventually you will inevitably learn some of the less decent details about stuff like celebrities and historical figures. That being said, I would argue that the office of president is something that traditionally is supposed to be held to a specific standard of manners and decorum due to their intended position of authority. Now although regardless of your position on political views I think children should be raised and expected to develop certain habits and understandings of respect and authority both in learning what they should give, as well as what they receive.\\nPolitics, political theater, and media coverage of such has failed our society of this in a way I do not think many adults are comprehending right now, much less the children. How do you tell a child?to not be insulting, or to be respectful, or to have empathy when the most prominent 'leader' figureheads they have do no such things??\\nHow can you effectively upbring a society where those with the least amount of responsibility, experience, authority, and free will are held to a higher standard than those with the most? I'm not sure it is possible to really.\\nI don't want kids to be raised completely naive or unknowledgeable about how the world works, but navigating social relationships and authority and growing responsibilities and power dynamics are not simple, and the chaotic and embarrassing standard that we have fallen to I would say undeniably harms attempts to rear children to recognize the proper patterns they need to grow up able to navigate our society successfully.\\nSo, yes I agree with you that kids do require exposure and understanding of the real world, including that people aren't perfect, president included. The current climate is incredibly toxic and embarrassing though and I don't think their development should pay the consequences of a country that didn't hold its adult generations adequately accountable in their decline. A child learning about free speech and 'we have the freedom to be openly critical of our government without government repercussions' should not then go home and be exposed to interviews of presidential candidates wanting to jail critics and journalists. Nor should they be developing a message of 'the president is a criminal' which has been tossed around with varying levels of accuracy for the past 28 years at least from my understanding.","title":"CMV: learning about presidential candidates and voting as a kid is ok"},{"text":"Tricky Nikki","title":"Nikki Haley is choosing billionaire tax breaks over democracy."},{"text":"I dont really know anything about video games, but if theres a large contingent that are adults of voting age, its worth a shot","title":"Kamala Harris And Tim Walz Launch Their Own Fortnite Map"},{"text":"Everyone you mentioned is an insecure little pussy.","title":"George W.

I read an article recently about students being belittled by their teacher for choosing Trump in a mock election.So, while I don't entirely disagree with you, it needs to come from parents first and foremost. I wouldn't want teachers, politicians, content creators, whoever to be the ones teaching my child about which policies and politicians are best. You get a lot of bias involved.

But here I do agree with you; it is wrong to blame straight white men for the actions of various regimes over in Pakistan, but again, the article I posted seemed to be doing (at least, heavily implying) exactly that. As for the UK: I mentioned in my comment on the subject that, even if \\"straight white men\\" no longer held power here (to the extent that \\"straight white men\\" are even a single monolithic entity, as I alluded to in my paragraph using the Civil War as an example), that still wouldn't alleviate all our problems or abolish conservatism from our politics, as many non white people ALSO hold extremely socially conservative views, which could go on to pose issues for others. See the generally popular belief among Islamic communities here that homosexuality ought to be recriminalized, for example - an attitude far more common in that community than any 'white male' one.Moreover; even if straight white men did run the UK as a monolithic bloc - well, it's thanks to them we have labour laws, sanitation laws, regulations about food and drugs, even democracy itself.

The point is more that we just need to run more people like that rather than running liberals/progressives. Like in 2022, we ran a freaking black progressive, in Wisconsin, against an entrenched incumbent who had previously beat an incumbent white progressive twice. In North Carolina we ran someone who lost a statewide election two years prior in a much bluer environment. Would it have killed us to run Manchin's there? Same with Texas in 2018, Iowa 2020, and so onHow do Democrats maintain turnout among low propensity voters (racial minorities, young people) with a reputation as ineffective do-nothings?Well if these people won't turn out for conservadems, then we can get conservative rule and the people can learn another vivid lesson on why it's so important to elect conservadems. Or maybe they'll scream and scream and scream but keep refusing to vote, in which case maybe it's a sign that things are actually ok and they don't need as much liberal change anyway, if they are privileged enough to keep letting the Dems winOne extra Supreme Court justice, if all the dominos happen to fall right?Could have made a huge difference in 2016. Especially since that instead probably means three replacements (RGB and Breyer too) and a durable liberal majority. Which would have a huge impact Remember that Republicans can always cut taxes with reconciliation - Democrats can't do that to deliver healthcare reform or regulate in response to the Recession.A lot of democratic healthcare policy is just subsidizing demand, stuff like expanding ACA subsidies or closing the medicaid gap, and you can do that with reconciliation. They were also able to do prescription drug stuff with reconciliation and could do more with that.

His very young girlfriends are apparently beards, though they may not even be aware of it themselves. They might wonder why Leo never has sex with them, but then he buys them something and they forget about it. The point of dating such young women is that he doesnt have to worry about pressure to marry and have children. With all that said, I dont know if this has anything to do with his support of democrats.

The majority of crime and degenerate behavior is by white British people. That doesn't mean I blame Western culture. Seeing people you assume to be Muslim acting in a degenerate way does not mean Islam is incompatible with Western values. Western values include religious freedom, so this entire conversation is regressive. Muslims want the same as non Muslims- a peaceful life, economic prosperity, and safe family living. Is that different from you? Or your friends? Europe has a huge Muslim population and has had for years. We are more visible now because there is a loaded right wing political agenda where we are being victimised to distract you from greater issues. You're poorer than you were 10 years ago. No one can afford a home. Wages are stagnating. Quality of education is worsening. Economic and military strength is shifting from west to east. In an among all this is a catastrophe of political failure. Rather than focus on this, people have developed an obsession with Muslims- either our dress or our language. I mean you're criticizing our holy book without reading it? Would you write a report on a book you never read? I think fundamentally there are bad people in all walks of life. Likely most Muslims you come across are very nice, but your negative experiences fuel preexisting prejudice. As far as integration is concerned, Muslims often feel very threatened and posts like this only reaffirm that position. This makes us feel safer in our own communities (this is similar to orthodox jews for example). Also you need to define integration? I can't speak about Germany, but in the UK we have many high profile people who are Muslims - from football players to politicians to businessmen. A huge proportion of doctors are Muslim, and Muslims contribute the most to the charity sector. So let me ask you, can you live peacefully with Muslims?

But there's a lot of caveats to that.As an example, let's take school. Your kids are in a class, and they hear from a teacher that \\"all democrats are Satan worshipers\\" or \\"all Republicans should be killed\\" or whatever other extreme opinion. Is that OK? Of course not.Then since we've established it's not OK, what if the same thing is said by another student? Well, it might be fine - they might not notice or they might not care. But what if it's their best friend who says it? Then that could be a big problem.What if the teacher doesn't say anything so extreme, but teaches in a biased enough way that all the kids are going to agree (if they haven't already been exposed to politics) that Republican policy is obviously correct. Or that Republicans are dumb for believing in fiscal conservatism.Again, you gotta remember that as humans it takes a lot to change our belief, but we form beliefs very easily.Obviously teaching them politics and being perfectly neutral while doing so would be great. But being perfectly neutral is impossible to achieve, and even being mostly neutral can be very hard. Do you trust your school board to make the judgment call that the class is unbiased?The fact is that any teaching they receive will be biased - it's just a matter of how much and in which way.So in general yeah it's important that kids learn about the government and politics and all that, but it's a very difficult thing to get right. Deciding at what age they should learn what is complicated. Deciding who should teach them such stuff (parents, community members, teachers at school, the internet, fortnite) isnt easy either.I have no idea what fortnite is teaching kids about politics, but I certainly don't want that to be the first exposure they have to politics because it will affect their perception of politics for at least a very long time.","title":"CMV: learning about presidential candidates and voting as a kid is ok"},{"text":"Fascist shills response to 3rd parties is to lie, lie, and lie.","title":"The open propaganda against alternatives to the corporate duopoly by so called progressives at institutions like Teen Vogue is absolutely shameful.

They don't believe in Pizzagate, Qanon, or wacky conspiracies.? Their rationales are more ordinary.? 70 million people have not been brainwashed.?

On the other hand, you're likely not going to walk around outside with a 10 foot metal pole when there is thunder.The risks are never zero, but in both scenario it's quite obvious which situation is \\"at risk\\" of being hit by lightning.Same is true about pregnancies. There are 32.9 fatalities out of 100000 birth in the USA. This includes death from at risk pregnancies, but we can assume that this is a normal probability, or an acceptable risk.In which case, a physician that is certified in prenatal care, will be able to confirm if a pregnancy is \\"at risk\\" by determining the probability of death or morbidity based on whatever is determined acceptable.Let's say an X,Y,Z health situation is known to increase mortality or morbidity to 100/100000, well the physician might declare the pregnancy at risk as the probability is way above what is considered normal. On the other hand, if a person is absolutely healthy, and there is no health issues at all, the mortality or morbidity probabilities might be 10/100000, thus way below the normal probability rate, and declare that the is a pregnancy that is not \\"at risk\\".Now, I'm no physician, and cannot say what is an acceptable risk when it comes to pregnancy.

I try not to listen to Bernie's cringe-worthy script that he's required to speak from.  I prefer to remember the words from his rallies when he educated tens of thousands about the extent of the take-over of this country by the billionaire ruling class.This message from Bernie delivered to my email earlier today (in answer to this incident I'm guessing):*Dear **Yesterday, I recorded a video which now has over 7 million views across multiple platforms. The message of the video is simple: even if you strongly disagree with Kamala on Gaza, as I do, please vote for her. We simply cannot allow Donald Trump to become president.*https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1851040553745432775*I understand that there are millions of Americans who disagree with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the terrible war in Gaza. I am one of them.**While Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of October 7th, which killed 1200 innocent people and took 250 hostages, it did not have the right to wage an all out war against the entire Palestinian people.**It did not have the right to kill 42,000 Palestinians, two- thirds of whom were children, women and the elderly, or injure over 100,000 people in Gaza. It did not have the right to destroy Gaza's infrastructure and housing and health care systems. It did not have the right to bomb every one of Gaza's 12 universities. It did not have the right to block humanitarian aid, causing massive malnutrition in children and, in fact, starvation.**And that is why I am doing everything I can to block U.S. military aid and offensive weapons sales to the right wing extremist Netanyahu government in Israel. And I know that many of you share those feelings. And some of you are saying, how can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war? And that is a very fair question.**And let me give you my best answer. And that is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his right wing friends are worse. In the Senate and in Congress the Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice president both support getting as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible.**Trump has said that Netanyahu is doing a good job and that Biden is holding him back. He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. It is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office.**But even more importantly, and this I promise you, after Kamala wins we will, together, do everything that we can to change U.S. policy toward Netanyahu - including an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, a surge of massive humanitarian aid, the stopping of settler attacks on the West Bank, and the rebuilding of Gaza for the Palestinian people.**And let me be clear. We will have, in my view, a much better chance of changing U.S. policy with Kamala than with Trump, who is extremely close to Netanyahu and sees him as a like- minded, right wing extremist ally.**But let me also say this, and I deal with this every single day as a U.S. Senator. As important as Gaza is, and as strongly as many of us feel about this issue, it is not the only issue at stake in this election.**If Trump wins, women in this country will suffer an enormous setback and lose the ability to control their own bodies. That is not acceptable.**If Trump wins, to be honest with you, the struggle against climate change is over. While virtually every scientist who has studied the issue understands that climate change is real and an existential threat to our country and the world, Trump believes it is a \\"hoax.\\" And if the United States, the largest economy in the world, stops transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, every other country - China, Europe, all over the world, they will do exactly the same thing. And God only knows the kind of planet we will leave to our kids and future generations.**If Trump wins, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, he will demand even more tax breaks for the very richest people in our country, while cutting back on programs that working families desperately need. The rich will only get richer, while the minimum wage will remain at $7.25 an hour, and millions of our fellow workers will continue to earn starvation wages.**Did you all see the recent Trump rally at Madison Square Garden? Well, I did, and what I can tell you is that as a nation, as all of you know, we have struggled for years against impossible odds to try to overcome all forms of bigotry - whether it is racism, whether it's sexism, whether it's homophobia, whether it's xenophobia, you name it.**We have tried to fight against bigotry, but that is exactly what we saw on display at that unbelievable Trump rally. It was not a question of speakers getting up there and disagreeing with Kamala Harris on the issues. That wasn't the issue at all. They were attacking her simply because she was a woman and a woman of color. Extreme vulgar sexism and racism. Is that really the kind of America that we can allow?**So let me conclude by saying this. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Many of you have differences of opinion with Kamala Harris on Gaza. So do I. But we cannot sit this election out. Trump has got to be defeated. Let's do everything we can in the next week to make sure that Kamala Harris is our next president.**Thank you very much.*","title":"Bernie Sanders is disrupted by members of CODEPINK during a Harris campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin"},{"text":"Thanks bro.

She gives speeches about how we need less schools and more prisons while cackling like a maniac.Additionally, Kamala and Biden both support the border wall.?https://prospect.org/justice/how-kamala-harris-fought-to-keep-nonviolent-prisoners-locked-up/Trump says he'll end the war in Ukraine on day 1. Dems seem to openly plan to start WW3. Biden spent his vice presidency under Obama organizing a neo-nazi coup in Ukraine which directly resulted in the current Ukraine war.Trump says states should decide whether they allow abortion or not. Biden was outspokenly opposed to abortion rights his entire career until he got dementia, and Roe vs Wade was overturned under his watch. Meanwhile, supporting abortion is literally the only policy position Kamala Harris cites at all LMAO which is not good, POTUS should really offer more than just fkn war and abortions...Trump gave out $1000+ checks during COVID. Biden did the opposite, austerity has only increased under his administration.

Theyve done so partly by posing as defenders of abortion rights.\\nIn 2020, Joe Biden promised to pass legislation to make Roe the law of the land. He failed to deliver, and Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. In the midterms that year, Democrats benefited from increased turnout among women and young voters fired up by the abortion issue.While Biden was still in the race, 70% of women voters report feeling frustrated by the upcoming election, and a majority say theyre not satisfied with the options on the ballot.\\nKamala Harris, Bidens sidekick-turned-successor, is once again relying on empty promises and lesser-evilist appeals, saying: [Republicans] plan to restrict access to contraception and ban abortion nationwide. We will stop them. Whether such rhetoric will fool enough working-class women to push her into the presidency remains to be seen.**THE HYDE AMENDMENT**In reality, the Democrats have consistently worked with Republicans to strip abortion rights from poor, working-class women who rely on government-funded healthcare.\\nIn 1976, the Democratswho had a supermajority in both House and Senatepassed the Hyde Amendment. This prevents any federal funding for abortions, including any hospital funding and state-funded health coverage. Democratic Senator Joe Biden notably voted against making exceptions in the Hyde Amendment for cases of rape and incest.\\nIn 1993, Democrat Bill Clinton included the Hyde Amendment in his federal budget, despite the Democrats having House and Senate majorities.In 2022, Roe v. Wade was overturned, and 206 Democrats once again voted in favor of a budget that included the Hyde Amendment.**HARRISS STRAIGHT TALKING**Harris was interviewed by a CBS correspondent, Robert Costa, shortly after the court struck down Roe v. Wade. Eager to seize the opportunity to present the Democrats as the only hope for defending abortion rights in the lead up to the 2022 midterms, Harris delivered her moral sermon about womens sacred right to choose.**Costa mentioned the basic fact that, in 50 years, the Democrats had never even attempted to pass federal legislation guaranteeing the right to abortion instead of letting this right hang precariously on a court ruling. He asked Harris what she had to say about the record of the Democratic Party on this issue, and the Vice President served up one of her famous word salads:*Costa:** When you look back, did Democrats failpast Democratic presidents, congressional leadersto not codify Roe v. Wade over the past five decades?\\n \\n**Harris:** I think thatto be very honest with youI do believe that we should have rightly believed, but we certainly believe that certain issues are just settled. Certain issues are just settled.\\n \\n**Costa:** Clearly were not.\\n \\n**Harris:** No, thats right. And thats why I do believe that we are livingsadlyin real unsettled times.The Democrats cynically hold the threat to abortion rights over women, so that people vote for them and against the Republicans. But after decades of this, millions can see through it.**FRUSTRATED AND UNSATISFIED**Its no mystery why so many women [ME] are frustrated by and dissatisfied with the capitalist parties. As a 26-year-old Hispanic woman explained, There has been more inflation since President Trump. Womens reproductive rights continue to be under attack. Undocumented immigrants still dont have a path to citizenship, and I dont support the use of our American dollars to fund genocide in Gaza.Polls show a majority of women say their vote wont be determined by abortion; it will be determined by inflation. When the cost of traveling to a clinic can easily exceed $2,000, abortion is an out-of-reach luxury for most working-class women. So the main question comes down to bread.**Women have not stopped caring about abortion rights, but they recognize that on this issue, as with everything else, there is no difference between the two capitalist parties. Both have proved intractable enemies of working womennot just in the US, but internationally. The fight for abortion rights is a fight against capitalism, and both parties were built to defend that system.**There is a political vacuum where there should be a workers party fighting for free, quality reproductive healthcare. Similarly, neither capitalist party stands for an end to the violence against women at the border or in Gaza.","title":"Lightly redacted screenshots: Kamala Harris volunteer campaign runs sophisticated network of Reddit manipulation to flood the entire site with pro-Harris messaging"},{"text":"Trump is up 2.7% in PA.

This is what happened with my very conservative best friend, he dates a very liberal woman because they both enjoy the outdoors, and both have the same work ethics. Politics never guided their opinion of the other, because in the end its not relevant what the other thinks about politics.","title":"CMV: People on different sides of the political spectrum can't be friends"},{"text":"What matters are the facts, not your taste or what you want to be true.If you want facts, I can click on just about any thread with a lot of replies on whitepeopletwitter, politics, or conservative and find a highly upvoted comment that is complete bullshit.

The world was finally getting to the point of seeing that going against Israel doesn't make you anti-Semitic. As to specifically Harris, her job right now is VP of the United States. To speak against the president as VP is to disrespect the office and should show a lack of principles to many. Harris has no easy direction here.

The \\"evicting and marginalization\\" of the Arabic population happened first through economic land purchases from the Ottomans, then later as a result of territorial wars fought with the Arabic population in which the Arabic people were at least equally complicit.  A better description of this history would be that it is a territorial conflict that was created through immigration patterns, ethno-religious tensions, and the political ambiguities of a stateless region.

I cant verify her discounted rent, just a rumor that checks out. Letter to the Editor which I mostly agree with. I respect sex workers but I still have morals and ethics. Women should be held to the same standard as men:-For those who may be unaware, Kamala Harris is well-known throughout California as Willie Browns party girl. Thats because, as a single woman in the mid 1990s, Kamala orchestrated her way to the top of the California Democratic Party by sleeping and partying with a married career politician named Willie Brown. [Brown was actually separated from his wife, not divorced.]Willie at the time was one of the most powerful and influential Democrat bosses in California history. He was the speaker of the California State Assembly, a prominent position hed held for 15 consecutive years. And Willie was as ruthless, as audacious, and as corrupt as they come. He later became the mayor of San Francisco and held that seat for eight years.Kamala didnt climb to the top of the Democratic Party ladder because of any personal achievements, superior intellect, or particular ability as a politician. She might be a dynamo in the bedroom, but in the political arena shes mediocre at best and has all the acumen of a high school sophomore on the debate team. She had an open affair with a married man nearly twice her age, someone she knew had the raw political power to push her up the rungs of the ladder and she made the most of it. Kamalas scandalous history of unethical and immoral personal behavior with old Willie makes Hillary Clinton appear virtuous by comparison. Kamala Harris is categorically unfit to hold the office of vice-president, much less the office of president.As bad as its been in this country since 2021, it can C and just might C become a whole lot worse in the very near future. Kamala Harris, the California tart commonly referred to as Willie Browns party girl, could be our nations final straw and the one who pushes the United States right off a cliff.L.

Moreover, the deep historical and religious significance cannot be understated here, on top of the already existing Jewish community.Specifically about the Holocaust - like it or not, but the British Mandate for Palestine was one of the safest places you could be at the time. Europe, at large, was persecuting Jews even before the Holocaust, and during it, the urgent need for a place to run to grew exponentially. America had its borders closed to the Jews, and other countries either didn't want them, were too dangerous, or simply couldn't handle such an influx of refugees. The Yeshuv, however, had financial support, established community, relative safety provided by its own militias, as well as the British, and more.

My definition of colonial state here is a state that was built by outsiders and on land that was inhabited by other people who are subsequently evicted and/or marginalized.By that definition, (almost) all states are colonial states, so it's not a useful definition.  Your definition would seem to describe any state where the dominant culture is not derived from or developed by the first inhabitants who did not die out or move out naturally.  Even with states where the conquerors assimilated (e.g., Mongols in China), if the conquerors ruled for any length of time, in doing so they marginalized the earlier inhabitants.To be clear, I'm not saying that means you think (almost) all states are bad, as you addressed.  I'm pointing out that a definition that describes (nearly) everything isn't terribly useful, unless you intend to proceed to some sort of universal claim (but then you, hypothetically, run into the that-applies-to-all-states problem).That's why we tend to think of a colonial state as being a colony *of* somewhere: that makes it much more usefully specific, since we can productively talk about states that are substantially governed from abroad versus those governed locally.","title":"CMV: Israel is a colonial state"},{"text":"its because they arent a state. sadly they have been shafted into being a territory of the united states","title":"Puerto Ricos Leading Newspaper Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Kelly was arrested Tuesday on three felony counts of acts of terrorism and seven other counts related to the shootings, court records show.

The bill allocated significant resources across various areas, including defense, domestic programs, and Homeland Security initiatives, which impact CBP (Customs and Border Protection) and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) received approximately $57.5 billion, with over $23 billion allocated for CBP and ICE. The bill prioritized resources for physical infrastructure at the border, addressing migrant processing backlogs, and supporting refugee, asylum, and immigration benefit applications.I mean this was the first traditional omnibus spending bill Biden signed into law. The American Rescue Plan didn't contain a lot of prioritization for border patrol funding but I think that's understandable since crossings were low. Every since then I think every omnibus spending bill has contained increases in funding for cbp.

A clear example of the phenomenon was foreign misinformation during the covid crisis which led to many  deaths.  Here are two sources on the subject, one of which is the National Institute of Health.[https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2884217/misleading-a-pandemic-the-viral-effects-of-chinese-propaganda-and-the-coronavir/](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2884217/misleading-a-pandemic-the-viral-effects-of-chinese-propaganda-and-the-coronavir/)[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9114791/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9114791/)  \\n**Example of when a foreign agent demonstrated ability to actually bring America democracy to the brink, or evidence of a threat that was thwarted prior to occurring**I would say the current election environment in the United States is clear and convincing proof of this.  If you don't think democracy is on the brink now, I don't think we can form a stable basis to debate (not saying you are saying this).  Social media manipulation is only one form of this btw.  It could be foreign actors paying off American politicians.  I'll cite Jill Stein as an example of this.  She IS a Russian agent.  There are other examples and I suspect that after this election we will learn about a whole lot more.  \\n**Example of interference devastating it can reasonably be compared to launching missles at an American city, or at as close to that level as possible.**Again, if a foreign state deploys disinformation that causes dozens, hundred, or thousands, or even millions of deaths, this is comparable to the death tolls from various weapons.  The covid example is easy.   There are numerous examples of violence globally attributable to misinformation, much of which is coming from foreign actors.[https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/misinformation-is-inciting-violence-around-the-world-and-tech-platforms-dont-have-a-plan-to-stop-it/](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/misinformation-is-inciting-violence-around-the-world-and-tech-platforms-dont-have-a-plan-to-stop-it/)","title":"cmv: Foreign interference in U.S media generally, or more specifically during election periods should be treated as acts of open warfare and responded to with overwhelming force."},{"text":"This is just an ill-informed take that has been really bothering me for a long time.What is now the State of Israel is situated on a piece of land that has been routinely conquered and colonized over thousands of years.

For thousands of years, Jewish people in the diaspora were deemed others by Europeans, Arabs, Berbers, Persians/Iranians Turks, yada yada yada.. it goes on. Even in places where Jews lived fairly well this was the case.Now suddenly, that flips? Now everyone wants to identify Jews with the people who persecuted them, slaughtered them, committed genocide against them, and broadly excluded and discriminated against them. Suddenly, Jews are white Europeans despite there still being people alive who remember Europeans murdering Jews en masse. Same goes with antisemitic violence in the Muslim world.Fundamentally, in order to believe what you believe, you have to identify Jews as being members of the groups that do not agree that Jews are part of them.

Palestine throughout the last hundreds years was a small and barely populated part of the Ottomam empire, and for 19 years, British empire. It was even known for a while as the land without people). So lets pretend we are not talking about Israel but the America Wild West, maybe California. In this reality there is slavery of black people throughout most of the usa (clearly an analogy to the holocaust and overall Jewish persecution). So many slaves escape to California. They build there their own towns and dont bother any one. There are local christiofascist white peoples who live there, and the idea of black people living like white folks piss them off (analogy to the Muslim view of dhimmis). Initially they didnt do anything about it. Over time, the rumors of a safe place travel around and more and more black people arrive. The locals get pissed off and start to give the locals a tough time (analogy to Hebron massacre and the 1936-39 Arab revolt). But whatever they do it is still better than slavery so more black people arrive. Eventually, the white folks call the armies of neighboring states (Texas, Arizona, etc) to once and for all to the care of their black problem (clear analogy to the 1948 war). Surprisingly, the white people lose. Many of the white folks escaped before or after the official loss. But sone stayed. Once the black people won, they declare a democratic state of which people of all colors have equal rights and is a safe haven for black slaves who seek freedom.So, now let me ask you a few questions. In this hypothetical scenario, are the black people colonizing white people land? If the people arriving were white, would you still call it colonization? Is there any scenario in which future attacks by white peoples on the black peoples is not driven by racism?","title":"CMV: Israel is a colonial state"},{"text":"I take umbrage with the term indigenous.
