First off, Ukraine gave it's nukes to Russia, not the US. Second, I'm not talking about any current nukes in Ukraine. I'm saying Ukraine gave up it's nukes because both Russia and the US guaranteed that they wouldn't need them.The Budapest Memorandums alone leaves the US at least honor-bound to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression, but let's explore the other big reason.The US is the biggest proponent of non-proliferation and has been since the beginning for two reasons: 1) having nukes when your opponent doesn't is a HUGE advantage, and 2) having nukes in the hands of many smaller nations without huge amounts of checks and security means they're more likely to be launched by a rogue state or stolen by terrorists. This makes the world a much more dangerous place and a dangerous world is not very profitable for political donors.If the US guarantees for non proliferation mean nothing then small nations SHOULD get nukes for security. If there's nothing stopping a nuclear neighbour from gobbling you up, then the logical conclusion is that you need nukes too. Ukraine has already said if the US stops supplying arms then they may as well develop the bomb, and with their current facilities and expertise in nuclear power and containing Chernobyl, they would have one within a year or two, maybe even quicker  with a little under the table help from the UK who has had a \\"Fuck Russia\\" stance for the last 400 years.THOSE are the nukes I'm talking about.

Lets vote for Trump because inflation! (Which happened AROUND THE WORLD and America has the LOWEST.) Lets vote for Trump because of violent illegal immigrants!! (Yes, lets get rid of a HUGE source of cheap labor by people with LOWER crime rates than Americas own citizens.) Theres a reason that the majority of educated Americans didnt vote for Trump: they can read FACTS and discern lies spouted by Trump and they understand Trumps insane economic policies will ONLY benefit the ultra rich and corporations and directly harm the average American.Remind me in 4 years how beneficial a 2nd Trump term has benefited America (if its not already known as USSR 2.0 among other world leaders). If Im proved wrong and Trump has miraculously fixed all these problems, Ill admit I was wrong about his economic and immigration policies. Ill still be right that a person of Trumps lack of morality deserves no place as leader of the United States. I dont want my children looking up to someone like that and thinking bad behavior=rewards. A man who bankrupts casinos of all places (for his own net gain) likely cannot and will not put average Americans best interests first and foremost. I do not want to live in a Christian fascist government that takes away rights from its citizens and forces religious ideologies upon me. The American experiment was so successful (up until now) because of religious and personal freedoms. Theres a reason church and state should be separate. Not anymore though. The man who swore he knew nothing and wanted to know nothing of Project 2025s game plan has now single-handedly suggested multiple Project 2025 supporters for his cabinet. Funny how the man known for his lies and corruption lied about that, isnt it? Almost as if hes lied about much, much more. But at least DOGE can cut corruption and government waste! (Along with cutting important government agencies that are providing necessary safety nets to the less fortunate among us.) Your intelligence, common sense, and self preservation instincts are severely lacking, just like America as a whole will be in 4 years.

Other topics discussed included fentanyl, NATO, Ukraine, energy, China and next year's G7 summit in Canada. Leaving his hotel on Saturday morning, Trudeau briefly spoke to the media, saying he had an \\"excellent conversation\\" with Trump. The prime minister returned to Canada late Saturday morning. Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc accompanied Trudeau on the trip, along with the prime minister's chief of staff Katie Telford and deputy chief of staff Brian Clow.\\nAfter arriving back to Ottawa on Saturday, Leblanc spoke to reporters and called the meeting an interesting, positive dinner. Trump later commented on the dinner in a post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, describing it as \\"productive.\\" Trump also said he spoke to Trudeau about the importance of tackling the \\"drug epidemic.\\" [...] On the American side, president-elect Trump was joined by his nominee for Interior Secretary North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and his wife, Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and his wife, as well as National Security Advisor nominee Rep. Mike Waltz and his wife. Pennsylvania senator-elect Dave McCormick and his wife Dina Powell were also in attendance. Sources tell CTV News that Fridays dinner was also a social opportunity to determine who to connect with within Trumps incoming administration. [...] According to sources, Trump expressed he does not support relying on drones or technology as enforcement and would like to see manned aircraft and more officers on the ground before making any decisions. In a social media post on X, Ontario Premier Doug Ford wrote \\"Im glad (Trudeau) was able to meet with the president-elect to learn more about his concerns,\\" but reiterated his call for a clear plan on border security. Meanwhile, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said it was \\"telling\\" that oil and gas pipelines were discussed at the Mar-a-Lago meeting. On X, Smith used the discussion as chance to reaffirm her call for the federal government to \\"scrap the Canadian oil and gas production cap and work with Alberta and all provinces to secure the border from illegal drugs and illegal migrants, and critically, to commence work on additional pipeline infrastructure between Canada and the United States.\\"!ping Can&amp;Containers","title":"Canadian team told Trump's tariffs unavoidable in short term in surprise Mar-a-Lago meeting"},{"text":"As Obama wrote in his book, Mitch never came off to him as caring about moving good legislation forward (for us), or working with presidents on either side of the aisle when it didnt benefit him directly.

It's not Biden.  It's not Harris.  It's partially the messaging.But the real problem of the DEMs is themselves: THE DEMs ARE NOT, HAVE NOT EVER BEEN, UNIFIED.  The DEMs have no central plan, no set of goals, no consensus, no objectives that ALL OF THEM want to achieve. Look at us over the past election year.  Every small group within the DEM/Left (which is a lie)/Progressive coalition came out and demanded ... DEMANDED ... their small, minor, fringe objective be the MOST important.Look at the GOP.  They vote - over 90% of the time - along party lines.  They do not waiver.  They do not hesitate.  Right or wrong - mostly very wrong, because the DEMs keep cleaning up their shit - they proceed in lock goose step with each other.Our failure is one of unity.  Where was the unified push by the DEMs in the House, the Senate, the White House, the Cabinet, to push Garlard early and hard to go after Trump.  Garland saw equivocation and waited.  Jack Smith?  Saw equivocation and hesitated.  Time after time after time we failed to slam the hammer down on the GOP for their lies, their cheating, their adultery, their graft, their acting like fascists.  We need to unify under a core set of principles and to use the same media tactics they've beaten us up with for decades.  Which party has more convicted felons?  The GOP.  Which party causes the most inflation?  The GOP. Which party lies to the People most and most obviously? The GOP.  Which party lies about being with God?  The GOP.  Which party has more adulterers?  The GOP.  Which party has more 'pay-to-play' corruption?  The GOP.     IT IS TIME TO USE THEIR WEAPONS AGAINST THEM AND SHINE THE LIGHT IN ON THEIR EVIL.But we won't.  Until we come together, we won't.Some issues need to go far, far away from the media attention.   I'm sorry my trans brothers/sisters, but this gay man is telling you to wait like we did for decades.

Projections for the vote share of the three biggest parties suggest that Fianna Fail will win the largest share of votes, with 21.9 per cent of first preferences, with Fine Gael in second on 20.5 per cent and Sinn Fin in third place on 19.1 per cent.A majority of seats is 88, and Fianna Fil and Fine Gael are on course to win over 80, which means they will almost certainly form the next government, but they will need the support of a third party or independents to get a majority. Their former coalition partner, the Greens, are no longer a viable option and are on track to lose almost all their seats, if not all of them. Also this means the exit poll last night was slightly off. It predicted Sinn Fin leading the first preference vote at 21.1%, then Fine Gael at 21.0%, and then Fianna Fail at 19.5%.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 30, 2024"},{"text":"Sure they were.","title":"Political Violence in the US: Trump transition says Cabinet picks, appointees were targeted by bomb threats, death threats, SWAT attacks"},{"text":"The Temu of education","title":"Trump threatens 100% tariff on the BRIC bloc of nations if they act to undermine US dollar"},{"text":"There are many things we could and should be doing differently/better.

That also ignores what we import.  We import a ton of oil from Canada, something that would increase our costs to import from elsewhere. It would increase the cost of vehicles since factories would have to build more models due to lack of imports.  Farmers in the US are also uninterested in growing the fruit and vegetables that we import from Mexico either.  The reason why we import these products is to reduce cost. Raising the cost of imports to the point where we make more here will increase what those goods cost.

It was ALL scripted... And Trump getting elected in the first place, too... And his role in the Covid operation (just like Biden had a role to play.)The \\"Trump Derangement Syndrome\\" that Democrats were whipped into was used to whip them in a frenzy so much to the point they flipped from being skeptical of Big Pharma to being ENFORCERS of the vaccine and its associated censorship.But it wasn't just their side affected. The \\"lab leak\\" was used to fool Republicans into believing in Covid, too.It was a brilliant plan that worked because no one takes the time to actually think things out. None of it actually makes sense.If there was a virus, the elite would have been hiding in bunkers. But they didn't. They actually had big giant parties while ordering else indoors.And hospitals would have been full. But they weren't, and the \\"filmyourhospital\\" movement proved that.And nurses would have been busy, instead of having the time to do choreographed dance routines.And lastly, if the vaccine worked then it wouldn't have mattered if someone else didn't take it, because you would be protected... But they wanted EVERYONE to take it.Because in this case it wasn't \\"working\\" against a \\"virus.\\" It was effective at *something else*, which bit by bit people are coming to realize...\\\\---Sometimes people say, \\"Well at least under Trump there were no new wars!\\" No no no --- under Trump came *the war against the people*. And that includes both the division against them, which OPs post is about, but also the use of an exaggerated virus to steal TRILLIONS and take people's rights away. Oh, and the biological warfare attack that was injected into people.Not the \\"virus.\\" Again, if there was a virus the elite would have been hiding in bunkers. Remember all those videos of politicians putting masks on right before the camera turned on and immediately removed when they thought the camera was off? That's because masks were useless because there was nothing to mask against.The whole thing was a lie.And people believed it because of all the division. People literally injected themselves multiple times to \\"show those Trump supporters\\" --- meanwhile a whole lot of Trump supporters took the shots in fear of \\"the China virus that was lab leaked.\\"None of that was real.

Just seemed really off that theyre all buddy buddy after all that drama the past few years.  Starting having similar thoughts that you have laid out in this post.  Its must all just be scripted.  And look back at Elon Musks takeover of Twitter.  He was saying everything we all wanted to hear.  Twitter has become a propaganda machine, the censorship is out of control, theres no way Biden could have won an election without all the censorship, social media should never have that kind of power and influence, it should be a safe place for all different viewpoints to openly express themselves, freedom of speech for all.  And then what, 2 years later he uses Twitter to do the exact same thing he accused the old owner of doing, but not only that.  He went a step further and set himself up to pretty much be the Presidents top advisor.  Or more likely the Presidents boss if were being realistic.  That all played out way too well to be coincidental, he knew exactly what he was doing when he bought Twitter, and it had nothing to do with free speech and separation of Government and social media influence.","title":"Trump Losing in 2020 Was Always Part of the Script"},{"text":"It's the natural result of fomenting hate and fascism.","title":"Political Violence in the US: Trump transition says Cabinet picks, appointees were targeted by bomb threats, death threats, SWAT attacks"},{"text":"I agree, but I also think this is a sign of failed leadership on the part of democrats.

IE: The wait time in an Ohio city was 8-12 times longer on average than a rural location.

In 2010, the average wait time was 1.5 hours in the cities, and around 45 minutes in rural locations, so the next argument is that it was always longer in cities ignoring that used to be twice as long and now it is at least 8 times as long.

As such, restricting it would essentially be a matter of restricting freedom of speech, which can be a slippery slope. For example, in both the US and a fair number of other countries, religion and politics tend to mix, so such restrictions could spill over into political speech, which I'm sure you agree is not ideal.\\nAlso, the definition of what is a religion and what isn't can be somewhat subjective. For example, could MAGA/Trumpism be defined as a religion? If you let the government make this distinction (which you'd have to do if you want them to impose such laws), what's to stop them from declaring any set of beliefs they dislike as a religion and using that to stop people talking about it?\\nI think the current approach most of the world has on this matter is the right one. People have the right to talk about their religion as part of free speech, but just like with any other free speech, they don't have the right to force you to listen. If they infringe on your rights by refusing to leave your house when told to, you can call the cops on them for tresspassing. If they try to force it on you at work, your employer/HR has the legal right to force them to stop.

Theres no question about it, Mr Trudeau said.Our responsibility is to point out that, in this way, he would be, actually, not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States; he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and businesses, he added.Mr Trudeau said he looks forward to having lots of great conversations with Mr Trump and that the two will work together to meet some of the concerns and respond to some of the issues.Any hit to the Canadian economy would add to Mr Trudeaus woes at a time when his popularity has sunk, in part due to a slowing economy and a surge in the cost of living over the past few years.Mr Trudeaus public itinerary did not list a scheduled visit to Florida.

The peace and economic relief alone can make a person think.Remember, California voted red this election far more than recent history.

Without people, the economy just, well, slows down as does GDP. And since debt is only repaid if GDP reaches certain rates, population growth is a front and center issue for all Canadians. One of the ways to increase population is immigration. Having robust immigration policy allows to compensate for a declining population. Without immigration, Canada would be facing similar issues as other counties like Japan. But Japan has a ton of exports and reserves, which is helping but is only a temporary patch. Conversely, they dont have a robust immigration population, they simply dont have a to of people looking to immigrate, so their population decreases and then theres less people to care for the elderly and replace jobs that people retire from. All western countries are facing this issue and Canada is trying to mitigate it while also not disrupting their culture, which Id say that Canada does a superior job of encouraging those to keep their culture rather than conform.","title":"A New York state senator Liz Krueger has urged liberal states to secede from the U.S. and to join Canada in response to Donald Trump's threats of mass deportations."},{"text":"I don't know how we move past this.

He would not be the first president to use the military for some domestic purpose. Others have done so to break strikes, tamp down election or race riots, and enforce court orders or tax collection. But overreach in this area can do real damage to the relationship between the American military and the public. In his first term, Trump showed that he was willing to push that boundary.The Constitution prohibits domestic use of the U.S. military unless the country is invaded or the president declares that an insurrection is occurring. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act further restricts the American military from getting involved in law enforcement, unless Congress legislates it or the president invokes the Insurrection Act. During his first term as president, Trump stopped short of invoking the Insurrection Act, but he did set about corroding the professionalism of the armed forces by making its use as a partisan political force acceptable and attempting to create military loyalty that was personal to him. As commander in chief, he used meetings with service members as campaign stops, encouraging them to agree with him that we had a wonderful election, didnt we? And I saw those numbersand you like me, and I like you. He asked military audiences to lobby their members of Congress in support of his policies, and he pardoned a serviceman who had been convicted of serious crimesincluding war crimesby court-martial and then included him in campaign events.Trump also attempted to reach past the senior leaders who discipline the rank and file by ridiculing the generals and accusing them of stupidity, cowardice, and betraying the fighting forces. He has since said that, once back in office, he will fire all the woke generals and that hes considering creating an external board of preferred veterans to determine which active-duty military leaders to remove. He insinuated that retired General Mark Milley in particular should be executed for treason. Is Trump disciplined enough to devise and enact a plan to use the military against constitutional authority? To believe that hes not is tempting. Unfortunately, it also underestimates the protean instincts that have made him successful and the authoritarian ambitions that animate him and many around him. Americans have not had to worry about military threats to democracy in the past. The armed forces have never aspired or organized to overthrow the government, and their professional ethos of subordination to civilian control is deeply ingrained. But a determined president and his civilian officials could change this relationship, even radically, through entirely legal means, such as by using the Insurrection Act.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/PTYIyGjD](https://theatln.tc/PTYIyGjD)?","title":"What Trump Doesnt Understand About the Military"},{"text":"He sure as hell did.","title":"Did Merrick Garland blow it?

There probably ARE secret human clones, particularly for medical experiments, but that's not what this is. It's just body doubles. These doubles might be brainwashed with MKUltra style programming, but they don't have to be, and they're not genetically related to the people they are replacing. It's simple. I think everyone everywhere knows that some public figures definitely DO use body doubles for certain things, so there's no doubt that it sometimes happens. Saying it has to be \\"clones\\" makes the theory outlandish though. Anyone who doesn't like the idea can just reject the idea because them being clones sounds crazy. The other replies to this post prove that. We already know they use doubles who AREN'T clones. There's no reason why these doubles have to be clones. If they were all clones, they'd look like identical twins of the person they replace. They don't. People notice differences in apperance. Also, imagine there's a 45 year old celebrity who they want to replace. Where do you get a 45 year old clone who is properly aged? Did they make that clone 45 years ago, knowing in advance that they'd need an extra copy of that person later? Or are you imagining they can make a clone that looks 45 on the day it is born? All of this is needlessly outlandish. Just say \\"they use body doubles to replace celebrities against their will\\" and that would be accurate and harder to dismiss. Adding scifi concepts like magically aged clones only makes you less likely to be correct. Even the completely real idea of MKUltra brainwashing isn't required. The replacement \\"clones\\" could just be trained assets who take the job in exchange for getting to live the life of a famous celebrity.","title":"They are Cloning Celebrities"},{"text":"Agreed.

It's a poisonous mindset used to justify not changing or shifting to the right.What the American people want is change. They hate Pelosi,  Schumer, Clinton, McConnell, McCarthy, etc. Anyone who is seen as \\"Establishment\\". Dems have become the establishment in the eyes of voters. Having Kamala picked without a primary contributed to that. The messaging that dems care about marginalized groups and not average Americans contributes to that, too. Largely, dems have avoided being bold on economics, and it has hurt them. Yes, they are good on economics, but often, they aren't bold.The key to winning isn't being left, right, or center, it's being populist. Being populist means having a narrative with villains that need to be defeated. The candidate needs to be seen as a fighter for average Americans and needs to have the aura of a protagonist or underdog. They need to be loud, obnoxious, a little edgy or controversial, on message, but not too much. They also need to be humans. These candidates need to have an ideology and ideas they believe in. When you believe in something, voters can tell. It's why 2020 was so toxic to Kamala. Rather than being firm in her beliefs, she backtracked, and it made her look artificial, like she was following trends or focus groups. Bernie can say very progressive stuff, and it never seems to harm him because he firmly believes in it. Americans aren't ideological. They are incoherent. It's why AOC/Trump voters exist. They don't care about policy. They care about people who say they are fighting for them. This means that American opinion on policy is a lot more malleable than I think anyone has ever thought. I think Bernie really shows this well. I come from Colorado (I have lived in Vermont the past couple of years for work)and know many Latino voters. They love Bernie. They think themselves moderate or conservative and often are very conservative on things like abortion, gay marriage, and Trans rights and view themselves as moderate on many other policies, but they love Bernie. It doesn't make sense until you realize that Bernie talks to them about their concerns. Groceries, healthcare, education, income, retirement, good paying jobs. He named villians, the 1% and billionares. He believed in something. He has been saying the same stuff since the 70s. They trust him because he speaks to their feelings, facts, and policy be damned. Americans aren't progressive or conservative right now, they want change and leaders who believe in things even if they disagree. What matters in not policy but the feeling that they fight for you. That's populism! Americans will believe anything you sell them as long as it's anti-establishment and comes from someone who believes in something, has a vision, a story, a narrative, names villains, and looks like the protagonist. That's Bernie formula. Any politician could emulate it, left, right, and center. Trump embodies that formula. The formula is populism. Its a stinky ideology as it is rooted in feelings, not fact, and can lead to fascism, but its the ideology the western world us moving towards and Dems need to get on board because Republicans have a head start on the populism train. The problem is Republicans can point fingers at marginalized groups and \\"cultural elites\\" as villains. If dems want villains, they have to go after the wealthy, and their donors don't like that.

Over time, though, Congress has ceded more and more authority to the executive branch, and the courts, the third coequal branch of government, have happily blessed the arrangement. Nowhere is this clearer than in trade policy.The constitution explicitly grants to Congress the powers to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises and to regulate commerce with foreign nations. And yet laws passed over the past century have turned power over to the president to raise and lower tariffs as he sees fit. President-elect Donald Trump is promising to immediately use these powers when he returns to office on January 20th 2025 by imposing tariffs of 25% on all imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on those from China. Could he really do so?Legally, yes. To get his way Mr Trump could invoke a myriad of legal authoritiessome with off-putting three-digit numerical names like Section 232 and Section 301but the most straightforward would be the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This allows the president to impose tariffs with few limits (to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threatif the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat).IEEPA has attractive features for Mr Trump. Its an emergency power, so theres minimal procedural requirements. So, he could do it very quicklyon day one, if he wants, says Warren Maruyama, a former general counsel for the United States Trade Representative. Mr Trump was the first to invoke the law to impose tariffs when, in 2019, he threatened a 5% levy on all Mexican goods in retaliation for illegal migration. And there is another important precedent. In 1971, when Richard Nixon took America off the gold standard and in effect ended the first Bretton Woods system, he imposed an extra 10% duty on all imports by declaring the need to strengthen the international economic position of the United States to be an emergency. Courts upheld Nixons actions.Constitutional objectionsfor example, that the president had exceeded the bounds of administrative actionwould face an uphill battle, says Kathleen Claussen, a professor of law at Georgetown University. Although American courts have become gradually more sceptical of the administrative state, they have remained deferential to presidents when they invoke national security. In principle, simple majorities in Congress could pass a joint resolution to overturn Mr Trumps emergency declaration, but in reality a two-thirds majority would be needed to override the presidents inevitable veto. Republicans may even choose to pass some of Mr Trumps tariffs into law to make fiscal room for the tax cuts they promised, putting them on unquestionable legal ground.The other legal avenues at Mr Trumps disposal are better tested but slower. Section 301 (of the Trade Act of 1974) was the workhorse of his first administration, used for tariffs on $370bn of Chinese imports (and $7.5bn from the European Union). It could easily be invoked to slap broader tariffs on China but would be less immediately useful for Mexico and Canada, since the president must conduct an investigation and adhere to the long notice-and-comment periods required in American administrative law. Section 232, also deployed during Trump I for steel and aluminium duties, would be less useful for broad tariffs as it needs designation of specific products as threats to national security.Domestic litigation is not all Mr Trump must fend off. America has a free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada called the USMCA, negotiated under Mr Trump. It has a dispute-settlement mechanism that Mexico or Canada would undoubtedly invoke if Mr Trump were to go through with his threats. But here, too, IEEPA would prove useful. Mark Wu, of Harvard Law School, says Mr Trumps subordinates could point to the national-security exceptions in the deal to argue that they had not violated it. USMCA faces a mandatory review (and probable renegotiation) in 2026. A protracted dispute over its fundamental tenets might lead to its collapse.The likeliest constraint on Mr Trump will not be legal. It will be fear of backlash from the markets and the public. More than half of our fresh fruits and vegetables are from Canada and MexicoSuper Bowl season is right around the corner. Do we really think Trumps going to impose a 25% guacamole tax on his first day in office? says Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. He suspects that Mr Trump is issuing tariff threats as a negotiating tactic to force concessions that he can then tout before his inauguration even begins (see Americas section).Mr Trump campaigned on resolving the plight of carworkers, farmers and consumers angry about the price of everyday staples. He would quickly run out of goodwill if he were to make imported goods much more expensive. The court of public opinion is probably the only one that can curb Mr Trumps instincts.","title":"Does Donald Trump have unlimited authority to impose tariffs?"},{"text":"But we all get it.

There are 33 Senate seats up for re-election, 20 GOP and 13 Dem.  Nearly all the GOP seats are in solid red states except ME and NC.  There's an AK seat that could potentially flip given they already have an independent Senator and though unlikely it's possible Mitch McConnell's seat could open up as his term ends.  Dems need to flip 3 to take a majority I think.

If it's all about saving lives, why don't they yell just as loudly for encouraging blood donation, and for people to opt in on being organ donors?In fact, why we don't force people to donate blood or organs in some circumstances? Because pro-life is about svaing lives and also about teaching responsibility lessons for irresponsible behavior, right?Somebody assaults a family is a drunk driver his a family for example, and one of the victims is a pregnant woman  who now needs blood transfusions...we don't require the perpetrator to donate blood. (If they aren't a donor match, they could still donate to make up for the bags of blood in the next best possible way).If a child needs a bone marrow donation, we don't *force* anyone, not even their parents donate if they are a match. Oh surely evert parent would want to donate, right? Well, some parents are abusive negligent shitbags who would refuse. Even if that parent was horrifically abusive and are rotting in prison the rest of their lives after causing theor child to need donations in the first place, we don't *force* them to donate. Not even to our bloodbank stocks to try to help them not run so low all the tome.Here in Pennsylvannia, McFall v. Shimp (1978) [ruled that a person could not be legally compelled to participate in medical treatment to save another person's life.](https://hulr.org/spring-2021/mcfall-v-shimp-and-the-case-for-bodily-autonomy)Sure this is a case of two adult cousins, but even if McFall was a p and Shimp an adult, surely pro-lifers would feel Shimp *should've been forced* to follow through on bone marrow donation to try to save McCall's life, right? Bone marrow donation is rough to recover from, unlike donating blood, but the donor will make a full recovery! Bone marrow is classified as an organ, so it is one of the precious few organs you can donate while alive and be completely fine after.There are so goddamn many lives, including pregnant women and babies and very little children, who could be saved by increasing blood and organ donation rates. My coffee hasn't fully kicked in yet, so this can all be put more straightforward and clearly than I'm doing here.Another option is the 'saving an IVF case of 10+ embryos vs a single baby' in a burning hospital scenario, but that's easier for forced birthers to worm their \\"sperm meets egg=human life\\" way out of because the tech is too hypothetical and the scenario too unlikely to happen ?? But huh, all of a sudden it's about when the embryo implants in the uterus, not about a fertilized egg being a human being.Yet another fun angle is why fertilized eggs and implanted embryos and fetuses can't be claimed for the same things you'd be able to claim for born children. Child tax credit? Nope. Child support? Absolutely not! That precious valued real human life has to be *born* before you can get any of those benefits ?? But with that point they'll go diving into the welfare queens bullshit, and ditto fir things like subsidized daycare and free dchool meals, so I prefer the blood and organ donation points.If nothing else, maybe it will encourage somebody out there to donate blood and/or sign up to be an organ donor. I don't weigh enough to donate blood because I am an extremely very short and tiny woman, but I am an organ donor and encourage others to be one too! I wonder how many \\"pro-lifers\\" do the same. Oh, and if they're disturbed by what goes into post-mortem organ harvesting, they REALLY need to learn what goes into making an embalmed open casket corpse. Absolutely disturbing, invasive, and will make the more prudish ones very uncomfortable to boot.","title":"Is it safe to have a child?
