Id definitely be happy to add it to my list of sources! Personally, I prefer tim pool. He's not conservative or Republican (I'm not either, Trump supporter yes, on the right, no, the right just aligns better with what I want). He does video content, but he also is the owner, or maybe just founder, of scnr (I'm not going to pretend to know every detail about the site).No, I was more under the belief that conservatives believed that free markets allowed for class-mobility and therefore being poor in a free market was a sign of personal failing. It sounds like maybe that is only true with the caveat being that the economy should have enough jobs to allow for this social mobility?It's less about the \\"free market\\" as laissez-faire, and more about getting rid of over-involvement of the government. Just as an easy example, there's a reason it took the literal billionaire mark cuban to make a website for buying medicine with only a 30% markup and shipping costs. It's not easy by design. It's why we have regional monopolies on isps, it's so difficult to start that there's never any real competition even though people generally tend to hate their isp and would happily switch.Again surprising take for me! Is there a reason then that conservatives seem ok with the rollback of emissions regulations? Emissions in the air seems very similar to waste in rivers. Is it that you believe those two things to be very different? Or that the economic impact of the regulations are worse then the impact of emissions?I agree, I would happily switch to cleaner things if they were an option. We've known since using leaded gas, how dangerous things in the air can be, but I do think there is a difference based on the what's and how's of contamination. I'd love to switch to nuclear like France already has, but that never seems to be on the table. Efficient and clean. Which is the main issue for me when talking about air pollution and contamination. Everyone *always* targets countries like the US that actively want to do better, so we just ship off the really bad parts to countries like China, who then do our polluting for us, but the activists never target China. And they'll advocate for electric vehicles, which have pretty big contributions just in being manufactured, while also using the exact same pollution-driven power grid that's already complained about.In short, a lot of complaining and changes that ultimately don't change anything. Making proper procedures to get rid of waste that isn't the river has directly helpful effects. One does nothing but make people feel like they did something, and the other actually does something.It does seem like there was some mis-conduct in how tax-exempt statuses were audited but it doesnt seem clear to me that it was biased in any specific direction? And I see nothing about Christians, but you might be talking about something else! I didn't read that exact article, but it's from a .gov, and that's like asking the police to investigate themselves. Under the Obama administration, they were specifically targeting catholics, if I remember correctly. While I just recently searched again, what I found were mostly articles in the last 2 or 3 years about the FBI targeting catholics, it is a separate situation and just goes to show how much \\"some misconduct\\" has happened. And, I'd like to find out how much misconduct by the government is acceptable? While not an every day occurrence, it's also not uncommon.","title":"Why so much pro market-distorting sentiment? (I.e.

His North Carolina vote share increased by 120k. His Pennsylvania vote share increased by 130k. His vote share in Nevada went up by 60k.Trump had the same national popular vote as last time, but it was in different places. It is quite ironic that she is claiming that people don't like facts when her entire argument breaks down the moment you dig into the state by state numbers. Trump gained voters in many areas. He also lost voters in others. But in all cases, Harris' percentage of the vote went down by more than Trump's. Her argument doesn't work unless you can explain why voters flipped. Because her argument fundamentally relies on the idea that voter flips didn't happen, but we know as a fact that they did happen.edit: Looking deeper, it seems that Trump gained votes in every Swing state and Blue state, but lost votes in most Red states. He lost 60k votes in Mississippi. Lost 6k votes in Arkansas. Lost 40k votes in Alaska. Lost 100k in Utah. And so on. So it seems that we now know why Trump's numbers were even nationally.

I think you're actually pointing to a deeper issue that culturally we have a hard time talking about. We seem to culturally be squeamish about the word grace. Grace is often associated with Christianity but there is actually a secular definition that would apply in the case of Marilyn Monroe.Grace is another way to talk about giving someone: a chance, time, the ability to make mistakes without punishment, and to extend forgiveness. When people choose to only focus their attention on the negative aspects of a person's life they are effectively refusing to give the person the grace (a chance) to be human.The second issue is I think one of definition and context. The term elegant is often used to define the word class but another definition of classy is having or showing refined behavior. Someone may lack refinement in style and social graces like which fork to use but they may have refinement in knowing the exact right thing to say to help someone who is anxious feel at ease. The dictionary definition of elegant is pleasingly?graceful and stylish in appearance *or* manner. So someone may not dress elegantly but the way they conduct themselves in regards to people less fortunate may be very elegant.\\nI think in certain contexts Marilyn Monroe was very classy and in others she was not. So I think it really matters in what context and for what reason are we talking about someone being elegant or classy.","title":"CMV: Elegance and Class Are About Presentation, Not Just Personal Choices"},{"text":"The generations that were adults during his terms are getting older and older.

Also public radio I guess. That's not good enough. They're not likeable enough even remotely to contest the likes of Joe Rogan.Historically the dems have relied on, basically, being Correct-On-The-Facts to carry the day on their messaging because hey, the truth is easy to sell, but as the alternative fact sphere becomes more effectively isolated and as social media allows it to infect a great variety of communities this is only to get less effective.The only solution, if it can even be implemented before elections are lost as an option forever, is to actually support both financially and infrastructurally a left wing media ecosystem that can effectively talk to the general public without coming across as preachy. This can be done (People like Hbomberguy are great) but can't be a short term commitment done through specific individual programs. This may involve being nice to people further left than they're normally comfortable with.Additionally the dems are going to need to embrace the same sort of aggression the republicans exhibit in going after their enemy, and especially in disrupting their ability to organize. And when the Republicans act butthurt about it and try to make them suffer consequences for it, they're going to need to bite the bullet and keep doing it, even if it hurts them in the short term.","title":"Democrats finding no shortage of blame to assign for Harris loss"},{"text":"All I can think about is Mace Windu attempting to arrest Palpatine.","title":"President-elect Trump has accepted President Biden's invitation to an Oval Office meeting next week"},{"text":"You in 1954: \\"The majority of people don't want to see Noes in white people's spaces\\"","title":"These Democratic Lawmakers Are Already Blaming Trans People for Trumps Win"},{"text":"Based on his almost giddy demeanor at the speech he gave after Kamala's loss...

They don't learn, they _justify._ And this is not a product of ignorance, it is a natural human behavior. Studies suggest that people's brains react to contrary ideas in some of the same ways they react to physical threats.To be scientific, you have to _want_ to learn. You have to make a conscious decision to examine evidence and potentially form new beliefs based on it.Most people are not scientific.I've had this same experience: presented with a litany of \\"evidence\\" (a wall of links to papers, some of which weren't even freely available, making it unliklely that the person ever would have read them) to support a claim, only to dig into the evidence and find that it doesn't support that claim, and in many cases refutes it. Were the people who tried to win the argument with a ready-made rhetorical firehose aware that their evidence was bunk? Did they even care whether they were wrong? It didn't seem so.To be fair, it can be difficult to be scientific when the end result could upend your entire worldview, or when you have a strong emotional tie to the subject. Sometimes the evidence is inconclusive. We can't all be scientific all the time.

My entire point in sharing them was to explain things I had erroneously believed. I think an important caveat is that the Russia investigation went on for close to 2 years with daily and weekly leaks, some true and others unproven, being the main attraction in this sub. Rachel Maddow covered it weekly for 2 years. The feeling when the report dropped was not oh, hes exonerated. when Ive expressed these thoughts Ive had messages and comment replies from people telling me I was a liar and Trump DID have an agreement with Russia prior to his campaign and that Trump DID have cognitive difficulties. You can find articles from numerous main stream media sites questioning Trumps cognitive ability related to cherry picked quotes or scenarios and all of them were posted and upvoted here. I had a child a few years ago and havent been following Bidens presidency nearly as involved as I did Trumps, but the amount of static that came along with any news around Bidens cognitive decline was heavy, especially around this sub. I would see mention of it from right wing comment sections, but the media I took in was not covering it in full or completely truthfully and I was convinced the bad moments were outliers and I always knew Biden was a stutterer and said dumb shit out of nowhere for his entire career. It confirmed my existing bias. I dont understand why it is hard to believe. Does Fox News show it? News Max? Does my aunts preacher tell her about it? They see the narrative in the center/left media and can point to numerous narratives that are based on mistruths or anonymous leaks or any number of reasons and they can explain away why they dont trust the source. Thats what I do when I see a story from Tucker Carlson or OAN or Stephen Crowder. Could I have brushed off reports based on truth as completely bogus because I didnt trust the source?

Democrats were dealt a bad hand this term, but they also played it abysmally. Whether in hindsight or not, Biden's decision to run for reelection all but guaranteed an uphill battle Voter turnout stayed consistent for Trump this election, the same cannot be said for Democrats. The why is something that the party will need to deeply reflect on.Walter Lippman, one of America's most influential journalists, who had the ear of presidents, called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" almost a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever. He argued that Americans don't make politically informed decisions, and that's what happened this election, Americans let their *feelings* decide the outcome. The onus was on Democrats, not Republicans, to help Americans make those politically informed decisions, however unfair that may seem.So Democrats have to take some of the blame. But first, yes, Biden was supposed to be a transitional president. His decision to run for re-election put democrats in a very tough spot. He was also tasked with overseeing an economic recovery and his admin was blamed for the fallout that followed the pandemic.In fact, an economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped into office and oversaw an economic recovery. Republicans exploited these situations for political gain.It was particularly effective this time because, unfortunately, many Americans care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any \\"threat to democracy.\\"What's more, American voters tend to have short memories and a large swath of low propensity voters are who decide our elections. Many of them don't tune in until they're being inundated with political messaging months leading up to an election. And that messaging is excessively sensational, propagandistic, misleading, deceptive, partisan, heavily distorted etc.And this is, in large part, because, as studies consistently show, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda and lies travel farther and faster, reaching wider audiences. The truth receives far less engagement I'll be willing to concede that this type of messaging comes from both parties, but it's Republicans who disproportionately benefit from it.Combine this with the fact that incumbent leaders around the globe were facing political challenges due to world wide economic tensions, and it becomes obvious that this was always going to be an uphill battle.Add Kamala Harris being shoehorned in at the last minute, and you've got yourself a recipe for an election loss What's really frustrating is that Donald Trump is going to be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. One he'll surely take credit for *again*. The only consolation is that Joe Biden's presidency will act as a sort of stop gap effort, sandwiched in between two Trump presidencies. Two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.Trump's loss to Biden in 2020 was of necessity. The beginning of a return back to normalcy, and it could very well set up obstacles for Republicans that would not have been put in place otherwiseYes, Democrats would have had a much better shot had Biden refused to run for a second term, but what was done was done. And after Biden stepped down, Democrats continued to blunderWhile they failed to take into account how Americans care more about their immediate circumstances, how they have short memories and show disinterest or lack of concern for political nuance, they also failed to articulate a message that should have emphasized, above all else, Trump's poor economic and foreign policy record.Inflation and economic issues were the key drivers this election, and while many Americans tend to think in black and white terms, e.g. \\"when inflation/economy bad, it must be the fault of whoever is in power,\\" it still would have benefitted Democrats if they prioritized, above all else, the message that Trump was *not* better for the economy and his economic policies for his next term are even more potentially damaging.Voters cared far more about this than they did about Trump as a threat to core Democratic values.But the national debt ballooned under Trump.He instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. He pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.His admin took actions to that made it more difficult for workers to unionize, and for unions to operate effectively.He championed tax cut legislation that is estimated to cost the govt trillions (while Republicans bragged that it would pay for itself), and these tax cuts permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations. Trump and his Republican allies preserved a GOP agenda that has been hamstringing the labor movement, redistributing wealth to the top, safeguarding a broken tax code, promoting corporate profit-mongering and personhood, prioritizing rich/special interests, cultivating an economic culture of greed and profligacy, and widening the wealth gap, among other things, for *decades**All of these things contributed to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the Biden administration*Trump's foreign policy record was a disaster too. He weakened our alliances, escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our ability to act as peace brokers, withdrew from the working non-proliferation agreement with Iran, emboldened Putin's autocratic agenda, aided his proxy wars and aligned himself with Putin's goals, cozied up to dictators around the globe, dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone, forced Congress to pass not one, but two historical war powers resolutions, abandoned our Kurdish allies, negotiated with terrorists and the list goes on and on.On immigration, Democrats weren't going to reach through to anyone cheering on mass deportations, but Trump tanking the bipartisan border deal should have been emphasized more along with how Republicans prefer to run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears and appealing to grievances while proposing extreme, non viable \\"solutions\\" instead of more practical, economically considerate, humane ones.Most Americans don't know this stuff. And, yeah, maybe they don't care as long as they're paying more for groceries and gas, while believing that whoever's in charge is responsible for higher prices, but even if this is the case, you at least try to convince them otherwise.And if Harris was ever going to have a shot, despite rolling in at the last minute, her campaign was going to have to articulate these points, emphasize them over and over again, so that those low propensity voters might get the picture.In the end, there were a multitude of factors working against democrats, they also likely miscalculated how some voters just weren't willing to vote for a woman considering the alternative was a perceived strongman, especially during a period where a movement and \\"crisis of masculinity\\" is on the rise. Walter Lippman was right a century ago, and he's still right today. The general public *is* an irrational force. He argued that voters don't make politically informed decisions. Well, they're especially not making politically informed decisions if you're not *informing* them. So instead, they're voting based on feelings, and that's what won Trump this election, *feelings.*","title":" Bidens internal polling had Trump winning 400 electoral votes, ex-Obama official claims: Catastrophic mistake"},{"text":"And if they do when they lose in 26 because of bored mid term voters, theyll regret it all","title":"Democrat Jacky Rosen wins re-election in critical U.S. Senate race"},{"text":"\\"Whether crime is good or bad is subjective\\"My, you are special","title":"The party of democracy demanding votes and calling us all Nazis doesnt seem to make their party any more ridiculous.

There are studies that suggest that folate deficiency in you maternal mother or grandmother could be a possible cause.

I know how it feels to try crazy diets and not receive care or answers from the medical health system. Unfortunately its hard to determine your specific circumstances. Was it really the animal protein though? Or could it be inadequate calories or macro consumption. If you were to eat a well-planned sufficient diet, with sufficient protein how do you know you wont obtain the same results sans the animal protein? \\nUnfortunately many people try to green smoothie their way to health but fail to realize how they are barely consuming any calories, and are consuming way too many oxalates. Thats because we bred greens to enhance the taste of our food and supply condensed sources of certain nutrients. However it should never be the basis of our diet.

Turned out the top 5% just keeps that money, and doesn't put it back into the economy.So, in terms of this situation, it would be like the DNC keeping the money in a bank account to collect interest, while the rest of us continue to donate to said account in the hopes that someday they'll spend some of it to boost the economy.\\nWhats really happening here is just called \\"capitalism\\" where money is traded from one person or entity to another for goods and services.The entities that recieved that money then use it to employ people to create the products or services that the first party traded the money for.Those people then take the money they made creating the product, and they go out and use it to buy products from others, and so on.And each step of the way, that money is taxed, and those taxes are used to sustain the government and public system\\nOr, are you saying you'd prefer the DNC take that money and just sit on it, never spend it?

This causes a slew of administrative problems in our lives and prevents us from accessing numerous services, both public and private\\\\]Not so important to us:* School sports is a nothing-burger. For 12 years, I've almost never seen anyone mention it in the trans community as a problem in their life; it's the problems above that everyone worries about.\\n* Having everyone like us and understand us. The reality is that a lot of people don't understand transness, and some may never. And that's OK. One can't force others to like them, nor force them to support their community. All we do ask is to be respected and treated fairly even if you don't actively 'get it'.\\n* Triggering people. This is a strange one, but I've sometimes heard the accusation that trans people's goal is to go around 'looking strange' in public so that we can provoke and upset people. But in reality we're just trying to be ourselves, and feel ourselves.\\n* People basing their vote on us. Although our transness obviously has an effect on *our* votes, we're not expecting everyone else to base their entire vote on helping us out. Everyone has issues that matter to them, and should vote for what matters to them. That said, obviously if you have a trans family member or other loved one in your personal life, I'd recommend at least hearing their perspective before voting for someone that demonizes them.

The point is that the Democrats are perceived as being worse than the Republicans because of all of the *other* issues that voters care about - most notably immigration - and because Biden damaged the Democratic campaign by attempting to run for a second term despite no longer being in the physical condition necessary to match Trump's energy.","title":"The Economist dropping truth-nukes this weekend"},{"text":"Seriously why is he being so professional and cordial with this guy?

Youre probably familiar with now. Its a public report that under Donald Trumps administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system* So I would argue that she did, in fact, address it. She did not say she would push to repeal the law- you may or may not think she should have gone that farbut she certainly addressed it and did not make it part of her platform. Again, James Carville is useless for anything other than hot takes. Wokeness is a blob of a word that serves as placeholder for whatever group the pundit class thinks Democrats need to dump in order to do better in future elections. In 2020 the wokeness that Carville had an issue with was black Americans who were tired of being killed by cops. I suspected, and you kind of just confirmed, that now the wokeness that Carville is criticizing is treating trans Americans with dignity. It isnt helpful. Its finger pointing, based on vibes. Literally a week ago he was guaranteeing a Harris victory. His vibes are off. So honestly, no, I dont think hes right. Democrats didnt lose because Kamala Harris said she was in favor of allowing trans inmates to transition in 2019. Democrats lost because the cost of living is very high right now and the majority of voters blame the democrats and believe Trumps bs facade about being a competent businessman.

I'll mention a few things specific to your points:1) Economy and immigration - Sure, Harris had plans like banning price gouging.... But we've been told for four years about supply chain issues and inflation driving prices up... So if you ban price \\"gouging\\" or you implement price caps... Is that going to stop supply chain issues or inflation? People understand that it costs money to make things. The Democrats missed their mark on this by assuming that voters wouldn't question the other effects of it. For immigration... Again, Democrats assumed that voters weren't going to hear about the Venezuelan gangs taking over apartments. They assumed that giving illegal immigrants free housing, gift cards, etc was a \\"popular\\" opinion, because it was their opinion. They assumed that people wouldn't be paying attention to what mass immigration is doing in Canada or Germany, and how their citizens were reacting to it. It wasn't a messaging failure. It was an arrogance failure.2) This is a big one... By this point, people either believe Trump is a fascist or they don't. If they do, they were never voting for him. If they don't, finding yet another reason to say that he's fascist isn't going to convince them. Predicting all of these dramatic shifts, and extreme things... It didn't land, because people don't believe that Trump is evil to the same degree that Democrats do. For voting rights, again... Are you referring to the fact that Democrats want to remove voter ID laws and such? That's not all that popular an opinion. Most people don't have a problem with it, and most people realize that the number of people who genuinely don't have, and cannot acquire, and ID, and are mentally sound enough to vote, is very, very small. On abortion, again... Democrats have shifted so far to the left that their arguments aren't popular. I guess you could chalk a couple of those things up to bad messaging... But to me, the primary failure of the Democrats this election cycle is just a complete disconnect from what voters actually cared about.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"She was a democrat","title":"DNC official calls Harris campaign a $1 billion disaster"},{"text":"So which other minority groups should we throw overboard?

We can't unstupid the electorate. But we can pick nominees whose message may get through to the electorate. The nation came out with an article recently about how it shouldn't be left or right,But pro or anti systems+institutionsThe American quality of life has been spiraling downwards for decades, long before inflation. Housing, Healthcare, and Education inflation has been bonkers.It's not the only paradigm to view this loss, there's always multiple factors. But I think it's an important one.There is surprisingly a lot of carry over between people who donated to Bernie and people who donated to Trump.Bernie and Trump's rhetoric do share some elements. That shit is rigged, and they're going to tear down something.Kamala Harris has a very strong impression of being an institutionalist. Someone who would fight for institutions, not tear them down. Of course Kamala was talking about the type of institutions that literally hold our nation together and get rid of criminals. But that nuance was lost. And to be their credit, Kamala is very institutional.When Kamala was younger, she protested against the death penalty. As CA AG, she fought for it, despite being widely unpopular in CA.It can't get anymore institutional than that.Kamala had very little time to campaign. She only had 3 months vs Trump's 4 years. Every second counted. And she spent a whole effing day of that entertaining the VISA CEO at her house, amidst the DOJ bringing an anti-trust lawsuit against them for gouging small businesses with fees.On domestic issues, I was a fan of Kamala. But even I knew that she was going to work within existing systems, rather than do something bold like what Obama did with healthcare.And to be honest, Biden did some institutional rawamping himself. Lina Khan. em effing Lina Khan!If I was in a coma and learned about Biden's accomplishments but told me it was Bernie who won and did them, I would have believed you.Even though Biden won, he was smart enough to realize it's because of Obama being the de-facto leader of the democratic party and Biden only won due to Obama's involvement. Biden knew that the people really wanted Bernie, and so he did everything he could to implement his domestic agenda.But he marketed himself in a way not to spook conservative voters, instead of marketing himself to those desperate for change.But a non-college educated white guy isn't even going to realize this. All they saw was Biden supporting institutions.Also, i have say that Gaza probably painted the impressions on what Biden and Kamala would do on domestic policy. Though Gaza was not a high priority on the vast majority voters concerns, I can imagine that if Kamala and Joe can't stand up to a ginocide, how are they going to standup for others with no voices? It may explain why 30 polls found that Kamala would have gained 5-6 points in all of the swing states, despite Gaza being a low priority for voters.In 2028, it'll be Ron DeSantis, who would probably also be seen as an institutionalist as 2x gov of Florida. But so would Gavin Newsome, and for the midwest, Gavin would probably be seen more of the institutionalist.AOC has very similar messaging to Bernie Sanders. I think she would do well in 2028.Even at her speech at the DNC, she called out that Trump would sell out the country for a dollar. That's the type of messaging that hits these people.","title":"DNC be like...??NEW: After Democratic elites ostracized Bernie Sanders and spent years denigrating his movement as \\"Bernie Bros,\\" new data show Democrats in 2024 wildly underperformed among the specific demographic groups that were the strongest Sanders supporters. https://"},{"text":"that is a big problem. for a while like in the 90's and after citizens united - republicans were better at getting the big donors, wall street, raising money for big corportations - their policies favored them and republicans were always allies of big business....RNC had Fox news, am radio and many news paper on lock ....they used to have most of the national news networks....with Clintons and Obama the DNC they figured it....with the Carter Dems moved to the right, with bill clinton they mastered the art of using reagan policies while championing liberal and even progressive ideas but they favored trickle down economics/anti lgbtq/pro war on drugs/cutting welfare.....By the 2000's and deff by Obama Hillary DNC figured out and basically started being the party for big business, wall street, energy companies, MIC and after Mitt Romney with Hillary 2016 - Dems were fully what the RNC used to be just that they also had unions, big academia too - they were the party funded for elites that advocated for the elites - Trump came in and killed the Neo Cons and tooks control of the republican party from evangicals and the Bush people.He won in 2016 mainly because he really was an f you to the elites, billionaires, both parties political machines and donar groups.what is crazy Dems kinda doubled down on being the big business, wall street, big academia, MIC, elite party since 2016 and even went mroe wall street - Like i never thought I would see Dems advocate for globalism and off shoring Jobs and sighting and embracing Goldman Sacks policies and proudly campaigning with Goldman's endorsement.  I never thought Dems would fight for and being pro illegal immigration, open boarders, and saying it was good to bring in more low skilled cheap labor with these immigrants and having them work jobs for companies instead of americans...like they had adds and interviews with those companies in which management was saying these immigrants work longer and harder than americans and that they prefered to hire the immigrants and would state the wages which while sounded good, you instantly would realize that the wages were under what was average for that position and what they were paying US citizens also many of those jobs were usually down by unions in that region - like that is what Dems where always against.DNC is a money making machine. their donars are willing to donate to them because if they win, dems will pass policies that help them....if they don't welp republicans policies align with them and their goals anyway so its win win.DNC realized they can get money and bought by huge donars and industries basically get paid to not be progressive or anti average american and working class.  Dem's liberal and progressive platform is basically a shake down of big money holders - DNC is charging a protection fee.Republicans are going to be conservative pro business regardless. So the big money has no reason to pay them.  Elon saw this and was like yo I got the most valuable car company, an ev company, my supply line is in china, my company does solar and batteries. My other company does rockets and space contracts from nasa and darpa.  I get a ton of money from Gov subsidies and contracts and I am liked by one party mainly, the democrats. My compeitors and rivals are the tech companies, ICE car manufactures, and fossil fuel industry.....after trump won in 2016....he saw the shift in donars and parties and was like hmm Dems are getting bought by the people that don't like me and are probably going to loose these next few cycles I got to hedge politically....so he bought twitter and went right wing and endorsed trump.  there is more too it but Elon hedged and got the political support and power he needed to protect and benefit his companies.

But, it seems like anything at all we say or do to support the trans community will be announced full blast until the end of time.That being said. I think there are a couple principles at stake here.  First, people have to go to the bathroom and get changed somewhere. So, where is the best place?  If it's based on sex at birth and then you have a trans-female using the male bathroom or a trans-male using the female bathroom, is that perfectly normal to you?  It might actually feel weirder not just for the transgender person but the cisgender people using the bathroom with them.  The other way is probably most preferred by the transgendered person, where they use the bathroom of current gender.  But, people are often at different stages of gender transformation, so it really just makes sense to allow the transgendered person to use the bathroom they're most comfortable with.  Offering smaller unisex bathrooms and locker rooms would help alleviate the problems, but overall I can't really seeing it being an issue and I think that would depend of if schools want to allocate funds to create these bathrooms.Second, for sports, the main principle is people should have the opportunity to participate.  The executive order is vague enough it's not clear that it requires trans-females to be allowed to compete in female competition only that they have access to these sports.  I do think at the highest levels of competition and where excess physical harm is possible that trans-females probably shouldn't be allowed, but I'd prefer that decision be made by the sporting bodies governing their respective sports.","title":"Two Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"I hate to be pedantic, but Maher ain't no billionaire lol.","title":"\\"Look in the mirror\\": Maher sends message to Democrat \\"losers\\""},{"text":"This dipshit is just vacuous noise.

Yet I understood that Magna Carta was a contract between CEO's, between barons and the king. It staked out rights for the barons and reigned in some powers of the king, but the day after it was signed was no different for the serfs than the day before. You were just as powerless and you had no rights and the law protected you not at all against the will of a lord.Today there is no agency that will protect you from a modern baron, a corporation. You have a dispute with your ISP or your power company or an airline? You can have justice if you are able to hire another baron, a corporation of lawyers to take up your case as well as half of your compensation. Feudalism was characterized by a code of obligations owed by Serfs to their Lord and by the Lord to his Serfs. The obligations of the Serf were mandatory and brutally enforced. The obligations of the Lord were optional and lapses were neither penalized nor punished. Not so much has changed.

Lets look at a sampling of major swing states that also have Senate elections this year: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Trump is projected to win ALL of these yet for four out of five the Democrat is projected to win the Senate election at the same time, and the fifth its neck and neck with the Republican barely ahead while Trump is way ahead.I know people dont always vote for the same party for president and senator, but they usually do. Heres the current voting numbers to compare and see the disparity:ArizonaD: Senator-1,360,000 vs Harris-1,310,000 (-50,000)R: Senator-1,353,000 vs Trump-1,492,000 (+139,000)NevadaD: Senator-675,000 vs Harris-678,000 (+3,000)R: Senator-654,000 vs Trump-724,000 (+70,000)WisconsinD: Senator-1,672,000 vs Harris-1,667,000 (-5,000)R: Senator-1,643,000 vs Trump-1,697,000 (+54,000)MichiganD: Senator-2,708,000 vs Harris-2,724,000 (+16,000)R: Senator-2,687,000 vs Trump-2,804,000 (+117,000)PennsylvaniaD: Senator-3,327,000 vs Harris-3,364,000 (+37,000)R: Senator-3,369,000 vs Trump-3,510,000 (+141,000)For historical comparison, in 2020 there were NO states that voted for one party for president and another party for Senate (the only arguable one being Maine that gave electoral votes to both parties for president so whoever they voted into the Senate would contradict part of the state regardless).As well, in 2016, there were absolutely ZERO states that voted one party for president and another for Senate.","title":"Democrats on track to win all but one of the swing state Senate races"},{"text":"Yeah, the theories they're taking for granted are insane.

Instead of bragging about how good the economy is to people who only see what they're paying for groceries, they should have pointed out that under Biden inflation in the US is half of what it is for our industrial competitors and our economy is far more robust than in all the other nations which are still recovering from the same pandemic we are.They should have pointed out that Trump ignored the pandemic, then called it a democratic hoax, then said it would be over by Easter. All that after he'd been briefed about how bad it would be. They could have pointed out that if he hadn't mismanaged the pandemic, thrown out the playbook and disbanded the office created to watch out for it, minimized the threat, ridiculed masking and isolation we might have saved the lives of one hundred thousand Americans.Democrats failed the same way the usually fail: they see the obvious and assume that if they point it out to people they'll see it too. They forget that people are ~~morons~~ imperfect observers and must not only be lead to water but have to be encouraged over and over again to drink. But the greater problem is that none of this message would have been broadcast in any of the states where the media is controlled by rightwing extremists. That's all the swing states and all the south and all the middle of the country. All of the main-stream broadcast networks have spent the last eight years sane-washing Trump and minimizing or concealing his crimes. He spends an hour spewing vile racism and on the nightly news we hear, \\"Former President Trump expressed his long held interest in genealogy.\\"Half of the media is controlled by fascists. The other half is controlled by billionaires who really want another trillion-dollar tax cut. In that context the quality of the opposition's messaging doesn't really matter.

I agree with pretty much everything you said. I absolutely think regular middle and working class economics is the biggest issue the US faces right now and I think both parties are failing them miserably.I'll admit I didn't really dig in to trump's platform because my mind was made up well before the election for a myriad of reasons, many based on his character but also GOP policy. I definitely was curious about Harris's platform during the campaign and I noticed actual policy for child tax credits (raising it to $6k) and first time homebuyers ($25k credit). Things that would've directly and substantially benefit me personally. Biden was the most FDR president we've had since that time and if you look at the actual policy he tried and successfully enacted some of it was legitimately beneficial for the middle and working class. It could've been better if Dems didn't have Sinema and Manchin standing in the way of it along with other factors but I'm digressing and none of that nuance was going to reach the masses. I went to trump's campaign website and a lot of it is vague and wasn't specific about tax credits other than a raise to $5k for the child credit. There is nothing specific for the housing crisis other than opening up non-specific federal land and ambiguity about removing red tape. I chose these two issues as they were the most easily identifiable for me and middle / working class people. Generally I do not see tangible ways to fully bring back the middle class from either political party besides maybe from Bernie Sanders and even less so from the GOP comparing them to the dems. I think you're spot on about the media. The mainstream traditional media is fox news. They're the most successful \\"news\\" in the country and to that end the GOP / republicans are the majority politically speaking. I would've assumed both political campaigns would have modernized their strategies to take digital / internet media into account. The dem's don't really have an apparatus like fox news but like you said there is more going on in media than just TV. Based on nothing but knowing his ties to Vance, I think Peter Thiel and Palantir's big data capabilities had more to do with Trump / GOP campaign efforts than can be understood right now. Combine that with Elon's control of twitter and other digital strategies, there's a lot of capability. I have little faith in dems and especially republicans right now in terms of fixing economic issues for the middle and working class. I am genuinely curious to know what Trump and the GOP intends to do for these Americans. Ok they got their big wins, whats actually going to happen now? And Dem's sure as fuck need to wise up about getting better on these issues and communication to voters. https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5170351/trump-harris-housing-costs-planhttps://apnews.com/article/child-tax-credit-poverty-cc423366a1a6f2299fb23ed169045b7b","title":"Barack Obama Voters Are Donald Trump Supporters Now"},{"text":"and then stopped talking about it when corporate interests likely got her to stop.Every time someone on FB complians about Biden causing inflation I ask them simply.So if it's just inflation, how come corporations have record profits?

The Plan B pill is most effective within 72 hours, I have no problem with that.Now to elaborate on the parasite argument, I often hear advocates for abortion claim the unborn \\"child\\" can not live outside the womb, so it has no rights and is nothing more than a virus. When I hear this, my eyes roll so far back into my head that I'm blinded with anger. Once composed, I then argue that a 2-year-old can't live autonomously either, so is it ok to kill a 2-year-old? Where is the line drawn?As you commented, it's a highly alienating stance, and if the pro-choicers? want to gain any ground with pro-lifers, they need to address the keystone to both arguments and find an agreeable answer to \\"When is it a baby?\\".Forced pregnancies. Ok, lets break that down a little because I see a few sides to this.Forced in the context of a woman being abused and the abuser forcing her to carry full term. That's abuse and a crime. Period....Forced in the context of a woman being legally required to carry full term if the pregnancy is detected far too late and it is not a threat to her life is what I think you're eluding to. Here is where the argument of life begins. Is it a baby at 9, 7, 6, 5, or 2 months? When is it considered murder? I think you will agree that everyone with a moral compass is against murder. Thus leaving us with our current situation of when abortion becomes immoral and a crime.?Until that question is finally decided, and agreeable to both sides, abortion will continue to be an issue. This is why I support individual states voting on issues like this. If you don't agree, dont live in that state. And I stand by that fully. My home state lost its damn mind about 16 years ago and started going in a direction I vehemently disagreed with. So I sold everything, packed up my family, and left to a state that did support my values. It wasn't easy, it wasn't cheap, and it caused all kinds of issues.

There is no fault Harris could have had that would make her objectively a worse choice than Trump. They werent using objectivity. They were using emotions, manufactured outrage, and deep seated biases to guide their mindset. I will NOT accept the idea that this is the Democrats fault. Its the GOPs fault, and they dont get to get off the hook for what they have done. The Democrats are not the pasties, meant to go down for not being perfect while allowing Republicans to be as flawed as they want to be.

The lion and the ox shall eat straw (back to their righteous diet). They shall neither be able to hurt or destroy anyone on my holy mountain.\\nYoure right our digestive biology is not like a herbivorous animal, God intended us to eat seeds of the grass and fruits not the grass itself, that was for the animals.?\\nBut its clear our diet historically consisted of mainly plant matter by the basis of jaws which are wide and move laterally to break down plant matter. True meat eaters cannot move their jaws side to side.?\\nReference the above link I shared. ?https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02382-zOur results unequivocally demonstrate a substantial plant-based component in the diets of these hunter-gatherers. This distinct dietary pattern challenges the prevailing notion of high reliance on animal proteins among pre-agricultural human groups.We see the difference between a polar bear whose climate necessitates the consumption of animal flesh while the panda bear who lives in a climate with an abundance of Bamboo (Poaceae grass) whose jaws become wider and have the ability to move laterally. A true carnivore loses their ability to move their jaw sideways.?\\nThis is why men have lost their jawlines and have crooked teeth because their jaw is shrinking to adapt with all the carne they consume.?\\nCompare the teeth of a? Pacu fish and a PiranhaLet me know which one eats plants and which one eats only meat.Animals do consume most of our food, animals are fed grains and soy because those are far more calorically dense than grass and you can fatten the animal way faster. Majority of our crops go towards animal feed, then the remnant is used for biofuel and then finally for us (However they give majority of the nutritious bran and germ to animals)?\\nMono-cropping is a problem because of capitalism.? If all our land wasnt going towards the most efficient way to mass produce animal feed and if every family was given their own land to grow food they could do it in a responsible way, crop combining, permaculture etc. EX: adding nasturtium to increase nitrogen etc.?\\nPeople need to understand the people who run the media are not stupid they created this PSYOP to kill you guys faster. The jewish media (Daily Wire, Praguer U, NYT, MSNBC, FOX, CNN) which are all owned by individuals with the same goal. Push articles like theyll take your meat away which works so well because they know you fools will do the opposite . But thats because none of you guys actually read the science. Nobody is taking your meat away. The government every single year increases subsidies for the meat industry and promotes it further. The algorithm promotes countless articles such as Bill Gates invested in Beyond stock knowingly that anything Bill Gates touches conspiracy theorists love to latch onto.?\\nThe reason we see all historical civilizations were built around their grain productions was because that is literally what sustained human life. Grains/seeds were universally eaten in every society and culture. Abstaining from flesh has been a concept as old as time. Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, all advocated for abstaining from animal flesh; the Essences, Ebionites, and many early Christians were vegetarian, James the Just, Peter and Matthew were all said to be vegetarians. Daniel, Ezekiel, Jonah, Elijah etc all ceased eating meat in order to repent and follow Gods will.

At the same time, they are doing everything they can (not totally sure how tbh, free trade?) to keep prices for goods in the cpi bundle down (food, gas, stuff) so inflation per cpi is low.

I'm speaking as a former rural Republican no less who has been on both sides of the fence. I have a pretty good idea of why these various voting groups who turned out opted to vote Trump; and I have a very good idea as well as to why so many people sat out this election entirely rather than voting for anyone at all.Sure on hindsight I have critiques on how the Harris campaign could've improved on messaging that resonated with these disenfranchised groups. What some of us are sad about is the fact that it was necessary to dangle a carrot in front of them because, if you knew what I knew, the choice was clear from the outset *even if* we entertained the notion that Harris was somehow worse or responsible for the economy, for immigration (neither being the case in all actuality).There's a reason one of the biggest gaps of this election wasn't the gender gap, but the education gap. People educated with critical-thinking skills and perhaps having more free time at their disposal had a capacity to parse through fact from bullshit. You have a sleazy used car salesman selling snake oil, and many believing it. I mean even right here, the \\"roe v wade\\" thing so utterly downplays the double-standard that conservatives have with individual freedom and small government. My house my rules?

But, for the most part, these men are tired of the nuanced approach and want radical law enforcement and are blindly hoping that whatever comes, its able to separate the good from the bad correctly, which ..you know. Good for them for one last grasp I guess in trying to be apart of the America as promised, when it comes to if you face discrimination. The women that voted for Trump are women of certain privileges that just want things to go back to the time where they didnt have to personally be aware of the complaints of others. Where they could be blind and numb to anyone elses suffering but their own. And they think a guy like Trump and the men and women he appoints will hush the noise so they can enjoy their unbothered lives. It basically comes down to people really, really wanting to live in a reality that they want to live in, and not the reality they actually live in. And Trump promises that by promising a fantasy world of making America great again and democrats promise to help you cope with reality. And they dont want to cope with reality. They want to shape their reality. And theres more people right now that are like Cipher in the matrix, they are tired of eating sloop and want to just go back in, at any cost.

Exactly!I have seen this too.","title":"Harris just surpassed Obama on the all-time list"},{"text":"We had a pandemic response task team left behind by President Obama following the ebola outbreaks, and Trump disbanded it prior to covid. During covid he had his children handling the response... We needed supplies at hospitals and they were selling them overseas.People were being told to social distance, then in the midst of the shutdown he ordered Trump goes on twitter tirades to attack solely dem governors for the shutdown.In addition he's holding rallies (while being advised not to), his entire administration comes down with covid, he goes to the hospital and almost dies himself. Others in his administration were put on ventilators. Hermain Cain actually died from his rallies. Same time there's food, supply shortages at the supermarkets, and an entire summer of riots. 2020 was a complete basket case of a year... and it ended with an insurrection in early 2021.The country was a total mess.The point is you can't just look at a presidency when everything is going well and judge it solely by that point. The job of the president to also handle these types of crises. President Obama's task teams had placed us in a head start and ready for it, and he made us less ready... and he ended up suffering physically from it while we suffered economically.Joe Biden's entire 1st year was met with handling a crisis from the very beginning. In contrast, Trump came in skating on the best economy you could possibly inherit in the past 30 years, and it all fell apart as soon as he was met with a crisis.I think by measure Biden did by far a better job than Trump. Specifically the United States exited the pandemic better than China, better than the G7. So who else are we competing against for people to conclude the country is going in a wrong direction, and we need a sharp turnaround backwards? Who else is doing better than America at this very moment?Most people I've talked to seem to be of mind that his reaction to covid was poor, but he was good before that and covid's done now so it's not a worry.The people that you are talking to are saying that because there is a concensus among some in this country to give credit for President Obama's economic recovery to Donald Trump. I remember Donald Trump's 1st day.... watching Fox News. Day 1 the markets were at all time highs, we had good job numbers, everything was going great. And the headlines were that this was Trump's economy.When President Obama came into office in 2009 we were losing 1 million jobs a month. Put that into perspective what kind of a disaster he inherited from Bush. The years from 2010 to 2016 in terms of recovery were some of the best years in US history.The way I see this argument, people dismiss or forget about 2010 to 2016. But then only acknowledge 2017 to 2019 (still the 2010s but they cut out all the work it took to get to 2017). And then 2020 (the worst year possible) is entirely ommitted as an aberration - it never happened. But the impact of 2020 which is felt from 2021 to 2024 is 100% the fault of the next guy who came into office in the midst of a disaster.And again, America recovered better than all our competitors.It doesn't make sense, and it's not a fair assessment. I feel this narrative should have been tackled head on during the election, and not allowed to just go unanswered. Because from my perspective having lived through all this, it feels like the American people have collective amnesia. And one side understands this and has taken advantage of it successfully time and time again.","title":"Democratic Sen.

She won the popular vote but she still wasnt widely liked at all. Fast forward to 2020 and Harris flops in the primaries but Biden promised to pick a woman VP so he chooses her, which is undeniably a partial DE&amp;I hire. Then go to 2024 and she has the worst net negative approval rating of any VP in history. Bidens approval rating is crap. So what do they do? Instead of holding a primary so Democrats could choose again, Biden hangs on until hes on life support and Democrats pull the plug and put Harris on the ticket and just told us to get in line. So the person nobody wanted in 2020 became the VP that nobody liked and then the presidential candidate that nobody asked for. Then all the money and energy kicks in which gave everyone a false sense of security and confidence, but Democrats ran the same old tired identity politics playbook, thinking that they had the woman and minority vote in the bag, meanwhile threw around the dictator fascist nazi shtick against Trump which hasnt worked in nearly a decade.So, hindsight being what it is, what else did you expect to happen?","title":"The Interview: Nancy Pelosi Insists the Election Was Not a Rebuke of the Democrats"},{"text":"To be fair I've heard similair jokes cracked ablut California wildfires","title":"Compilation of Democrats wishing for Hurricane Rafael to destroy Florida for voting red"},{"text":"I remember hearing that, and if the phrasing was like yours I know why I wasn't impressed and why Trump people would be less impressed.\\nThey want a clear explanation of who's doing it (if she's implying Biden isn't), and what she can do to bring down *current* prices when she takes office.
