This requires an unrealistic level of foolishness on the part of a protestors.on the flip side if a protestor pulls a George Floyd and a cop murders him over nothing, and that happen 20 times, someone will get it on video and the public support will shift.  The overwhelming majority of Americans are anti-murder.Police don't want to kill innocent protestors.  Protestors don't want to get killed.  The public (the voters) don't want anybody to get killed.  The entire time this is happening US laws will be completely reworked in ways that will ensure no legal challenges can be made to unseat the president.

Yes, they lifted restrictions, but they did so in a way that overwhelmingly benefits right-wing troll farms, disinformation networks, and nationalist narratives that align with war posturing.The platforms didnt just step back and let things flow naturally. X, for example, has been shown to throttle left-wing accounts and voices critical of right-wing policies. Removing fact-checking while amplifying certain types of content creates an illusion of freedom, but it disproportionately empowers groups that already dominate the disinformation space. Troll farms linked to right-wing actors have a long track record of spreading coordinated, divisive messaging, and they thrive in unregulated environments like this one. So, while it appears that restrictions were lifted, in practice, it enables a flood of one-sided narratives, creating an \\"unlocked\\" system where misinformation and propaganda from certain factions dominate.In this context, \\"unlocking the narrative\\" means selectively empowering actors who spread the types of rhetoric that prepare the population for conflict. Its not about opennessits about controlled chaos, where those pushing for aggressive policies get an outsized voice without interference. So yes, restrictions were lifted, but not in a way that promotes balanced discourse.

Given a split congress and a very obstructionist Republican party, legislative success was always going to be a difficult if not impossible and the razor thin margins naturally necessitated moderate change and policy that isn't particularly controversial. On a practical level, what things do you think Biden could have accomplished given the makeup of Congress at the time that he didn't? I'm not technically disagreeing with your title assertion I just want to point out that Biden was starting with a weak hand to begin with. I personally think, given the congressional makeup at the time, Biden deserves some credit for passing the infrastructure bill at all, although I agree that it is a weak victory when compared to the broader goals of the American left.However, even though I think that Biden was dealt a poor hand, I don't want to discount his own contribution to creating the situation he found himself in. Posturing himself as \\"nothing will fundamentally change\\" candidate when he was running and attempting to distance himself from more progressive politicians in his own party, imo, subdued voters excitement for him on the left and forced him into a situation where he could not champion more left leaning ideas (even if he wanted) without hurting his campaign persona that was focused primarily on picking up moderates that had become disillusioned by trump. I would argue that this strategy worked for getting him elected, but inevitably tied his hands from actually accomplishing much or setting the stage for future liberal victories. Essentially, I believe that Biden, and the Democratic party more broadly, chose a strategy that gave them a short sighted win, but at the cost of voter enthusiasm and a long term goal to accomplish leftist victories you are alluding to.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"I doubt it would be 1 v 49 if the US went to war over California seceding.

First and foremost, if Trump pardons the violent offenders from Jan.6, particularly those that were convicted on seditious conspiracy charges, it will be a clear message to his supporters that violence in furthering his aims will be tolerated, even rewarded. It  will embolden a lot of viciously minded people to act of their own accord, in support of what they view Trump's goals to be. You would see militia's trying to round up people they deem \\"illegal\\", and things like that. This would be very noisy and get a lot of public attention. To even begin using law enforcement, the National Guard, or military in the manner you're talking about, would require removing obstacles to those orders. All autocrats engage in purges of personnel not viewed as sufficiently loyal. It would have to start with high level Federal positions in The DOJ and the military, and then work its way down the chain of command. This process would not be quiet, it would be very visible, very public and impossible for you not to hear about daily. A lot of people will insists the courts or legislature will stop these kinds of abuses of power. But all of their mechanisms for enforcing the laws will be under Presidential control, and thus easily ignored. On the plus side, all of this would require an immense amount of work, by way of managing the people involved and getting them to follow through on a plan that will scare the hell out of them. Even a shithead like Pete Hegseth may well balk at enabling a military dictatorship in America. And looking at Trump's last administration demonstrates that he doesn't have much fortitude when people aren't cooperating with his demands. He's much more likely to get tired of trying, because he wants to play golf, or sit in bed watching TV and scarfing \\"hamberders\\".

But I'll make my argument: Half his presidency was simply recovering from the shit-show that was Trump and the pandemic, and people love to forget that. He wasn't handed a thriving economy like Trump was, he was handed a flaming pile of you know what. The housing crisis? Trump removed the brakes in 2020 by dropping the fed rate to 0.05% and left the federal government with absolutely nothing to leverage to help with it moving forward. They made it so cheap to borrow that it sharply increased demand for mortgages at a time where supply was rock bottom. This triggered the never-ending increase that still hasn't stopped due to speculators, flippers, and people just planting their feet and demanding that \\"Yes, my home is worth 60% more than it was 4 years ago for some unknown reason.\\" Inflation? Not caused or fixable by the federal government. It's all corporate greed. We're looking at record profits EVERYWHERE. When there's record profits, and high inflation, a lot of that profit is because of just jacking up the price beyond what inflation would have deemed necessary, further adding to overall inflation. Aka: Take advantage and blame some \\"mysterious inflation\\" for your unnecessary price increases.

You'll see that with the other comments (currently zero but I haven't refreshed since I started writing this.)

While youre right that this was often seen as government-aligned censorship, it inadvertently limited the spread of hyper-nationalist war narratives. Now, by removing those controls and allowing unchecked narratives to flourish, theyre not fostering open discoursetheyre tilting the playing field in favor of those who benefit from a fear-driven, militaristic worldview.Locking down a narrative doesnt require government censorship. In fact, its more effective when it appears organic, driven by the people. Letting unverified and nationalist rhetoric dominate unchecked gives the illusion of grassroots legitimacy. This helps frame a conflict with China as inevitable and necessary without it being framed as top-down propaganda. So, while on the surface it may seem like a loosening of control, it's a strategic pivot that still aims to steer the public toward supporting future aggressive policies.In short, they didnt need to fire department heads or maintain overt control.

There's been a broad misunderstanding, perpetuated by shallow clickbait takes on social media, that the opponents of Republican interests are only the ones who want to outlaw rich people, and abolish capitalism. All this bulllshit conspiratorialism about the \\"class war\\", as if we don't have millennia of evidence about what motivates conservatism and the affect it has on the world.In reality, that's just conservatism fighting for a different colored flag. It's just tribalism for the blue team. Meanwhile, the quiet sanity of American liberalism enjoyed four more years of an executive branch with its head on straight, doing what used to be the bare minimum to be considered a functioning government. The result was a historic victory: record low unemployment, strongest economy in world history, record low crime rates, fastest recovery from covid inflation of all nations in the world. The US rejoined climate change accords, redoubled efforts to invest in renewable energy, funded science-based legislation, strengthened ties with our allies, crippled the growing war machine of our historic enemies (who are the enemies of democracies everywhere), and put the United States in a position to be a world leader for peace and prosperity again.And look, if half a decade of health and wealth isn't enough, then what the f are we even doing? An outlook that suggests that every sitting leader must dramatically reshape the structure of their society seems haphazard at best. Likely catastrophic. That's the sort of attitude that cultivates the modern Nazi movement. Meanwhile, historians and social scientists can point to 6000 years or more of slow but steady improvements to human well-being, each one an act of rejecting conservatism.That's all going to be f** again now, just like last time. Hopefully fewer than a million Americans die as a result of brain dead anti-science illiterates making decisions this time. But as it stands, Biden's 4 years serve as a powerful monument to basic sanity: without revolution, without burning anything to the ground, just making one thoughtful decision after another, America became once again the strongest and most economically powerful country the world has ever seen.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"This is the same person who was demanding anyone who violated the flag code be imprisoned.

Someone so uniquely unqualified to be president they don't even have the wherewithal or mental fortitude to understand when they are wrong or don't know ANYTHING about the subject being broached, or the ramifications of their actions. A literal petulant highschool bully who uses their dad's principal status to bully kids without retaliation. That's literally all trump has done his entire life. He's already a laughing stock world wide, and he's already caused damage to our country the first time that if he never got elected again, we would have been dealing with for at least 30 years. Now? I doubt any of us will see a lifetime where Donald Trump's shit isn't causing damage to average Americans, and most people in general. Donald Trump is going to sink the entire fucking planet into global recession, and then the rest of the countries will work together and move on. Leaving the U S a flaming country sized garbage pile. The only thing we will have is a powerful military and you get your ass he will try to use it to seize land, breaching our contracts and quite possibly having us removed from NATO, and our funding we get from them to build our army will be depleted. I bet China will gleefully inject themselves to that position, then start forcing Americans off their bases world wide. That will launch us into war with everyone else because Donny Babyhands will cry he made the biggest most beautiful deal and they broke it so we gotta kill them all, and it will turn into a world war, one that will be fought on American soil after our bases are sacked worldwide. He's going to get everyone killed.","title":"Trump says U.S. doesn't need Canadian cars, lumber or dairy.

All of this in direct contravention to US law, most notably 22 USC 2378-1, which forbids sending US military aid to foreign countries that are blocking US Humanitarian aid. [This is especially egregious after the Biden administration demanded Israel increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza to a daily average of 350 trucks of aid a day for the period between Oct 13th and Nov 13th, a target which Israel, by its own numbers, radically missed, only averaging about 60~ trucks a day over the period](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-aid-us-48cd09c1c007cacd6d7a309589490320).So yeah, not a top 10 President in my book.","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Final Foreign Policy Address"},{"text":"I wonder if there were some last min thing that were being taken care of.  lets see what he announces","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Final Foreign Policy Address"},{"text":"The only physicians who would be qualifying for the PSLF should be ones employed by the government or certain nonprofit organizations approved on the list. Which means realistically it's basically just another form of compensation to incentive physicians and other medical personnel to work for these groups. There's not too much meaningful difference if you pay them 400k a year and forgive 100k student debt after ten years of work or pay 410k a year. (The math is obviously a bit more complex with interest/investment opportunities/whatever else but it's just to showcase the logic).Additionally just in general *government should keep its promises* and not be scummy or slimy in deal making. Even if there is a policy we disagree with or think is bad, we should be able to trust the US government to follow through and not try to play bullshit tricks on citizens. For the most part (obviously I can't speak to *every one*) Biden's PSLF approvals seems to be following through with this logic. Some people qualified but weren't getting it (they should), some were mislead by the government and didn't \\"properly\\" qualify but realistically should have (they should also get it), some were fucked over by poor record keeping (they should get it), etc etc.Government should be trustworthy and keep its promises, not just in the technical sense but in the general sense.","title":"Student loan relief: $183.6 billion cancelled by Joe Biden, Trump plans review"},{"text":"Yeah its about a voice to said rights not the rights themself.

I know Trump can't use a computer, but he makes really good TV, taps into the poor and middle class anger on the right, and his social media game is strong. They've gotta beat them with facts, and it became way harder to do that now that an overwhelming amount of Americans get their news from the \\"new media\\".And I'm not telling you you're wrong on anything, I just have been actively trying to word things lately when discussing politics with people to be lighter on the passion, self critical, and try to figure out their perspective.

Maybe with the SCOTUS ruling on immunity and having to switch legal gears, DOJ didnt have a choice. But I believe they should have expedited this report so the public had an opportunity to see the report before the election.Honestly, though, with Trump supporters flat out ignoring the fact that he is a convicted felon, insurrectionist and rapist, I dont know if releasing the report before the election would have swayed any Trump supporters. We are at a dangerous part of our democracy where Americans are seeing a split screen, not receiving a common set of facts. Conservative media reframes information to fit their narrative and then pushes it out to their audience who never take it upon themselves to read information firsthand. It is why we see legal cases like the Dominion case, where Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million, and acknowledged Fox had broadcast false statements about Dominion during the 2020 election.  We also have some working class Americans who dont have time to look at the details. There are religious conservative Americans who have risen Trump to Golden Calf status and dont care that he is a criminal. Trump was their vessel to overturn Roe. Some Evangelicals also love Trumps stunts, like the Bible photo op in front of St. Johns Episcopal Church in 2020, after violently clearing George Floyd protesters from Lafayette Square. Then you have the racists who love that Trump parrots Hitler, saying immigrants are poisoning the blood of our nation. And of course, the very wealthy and corporations who want that additional tax cut Trump says he will pass, putting more money into the pockets of the wealthy.I dont want to say that there is no hope that this group of Americans can be swayed, but it does not appear there is any bar that is too low. This is the bar that has been set for the American president.

It makes sense why they tried to structure as much as they could in such a way that few entities could sue them due to standing rules. The original promise was that Biden would sign legislation forgiving $10K of loans. Activists then made it sound so easy to just write these loans off without Congress, leading to the current predicament where people feel misled.  The Administration probably should have been more forceful in acknowledging their limitations without Congress. Its clear now that throwing things against a wall and seeing what sticks isn't a great strategy (although it might still be the best one they had).The Biden Administrations reform efforts for student loans (both the ones enacted and those they attempted but had rebuffed in the Courts) really didn't address the exorbitant cost of higher education. It should seriously not cost as much as it does.

The US naval supremacy and its global reach are its real advantages, but if the US continues to antagonize our allies those hundreds of bases become hundreds of unwanted occupations and that global reach is also lost.","title":"CMV: The US is Preparing for a Global War of Conquest"},{"text":"\\"The racist businesses would just go under because no one wants to go to a racist business.\\"","title":"Why would Donald Trump do this?"},{"text":"Revolt.

Since the United States cannot even control Israel, why does it have enough power to suppress China? On the other hand, if the United States has such strong organizational power, it will achieve the return of manufacturing.

He shook my hand. I said, Congratulations,?[Mr. President](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump), and he said, Thanks, Mike,\\" Pence said.Pence also recalled one of his final conversations with Trump in 2021, when he told Trump he would continue to pray for him. Trump responded, \\"Don't bother,\\" the outlet reported.?\\"I said, You know, theres probably two things that were never going to agree on.  Were probably never going to agree on what my duty was under the Constitution on?[Jan. 6](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-considers-charging-200-more-people-4-years-after-jan-6-capitol-attack).' And then I said, And Im never going to stop praying for you,'\\" Pence told Christianity Today. \\"And he said, 'Thats right, Mike, dont ever change.'\\"He said he kept his word.\\\\---I think Pence gets judged overly harshly in these circles. He was a loyal and active force pushing Trump's message and agenda for 4 years (unlike, say, Harris under Biden). But he's assigned a disproportionate amount of blame for not \\"stopping the steal\\" on Jan 6th. As if it was just a routine thing he could have done.Maybe he should have. I don't think so, because it would have been just legitimate as Harris stopping Trump's certification this year. However, I am willing to say that it's a incredible risky decision either way and that reasonable people can disagree with it.The treatment of Pence as some irredeemable traitor based on this incredibly difficult decision is baffling to me. The consequence of him not certifying the election would have ended up kind of like President Yoon's declaration of martial law in South Korea a few weeks ago.

Until we have boots on ground in any of those countries, he is just trying to change the conversation to something harmless to him, and succeeding. You do point out that world trade is changing.

The few takeaways I have are: 1. They often do not have any understanding of mathematics beyond arithmatic. Geometry is especially weak. I walked through some calculations with one flat earther and we both agreed that in the flat earth model, the sun sets when it is 23 degrees above the horizon. The self contradition of that conclusion was not apparent to this person.2. They frequently believe incorrect things about phenomena they can literally see every day. EG: The sun is directly overhead at noon, the sun shrinks during sunset, the horizon 'rises to meet the eye', etc.3. If you are particularly good at explaining things in a simple way that is easy to understand this upsets them greatly. They seem to almost have a fight or flight response when they begin to understand the flaws in their understanding.4. Every aspect of their belief is totally sequestered from every other aspect. They will defend one aspect using a line of reasoning that contradicts a different aspect, and then vice versa. They don't seem to hold one cohesive view but like, many smaller subviews that follow a theme.5. They are often anchored in a believe that they are special / powerful / smart in a fudamental way. Either that the universe was specifically designed for them by god, or that they are one of the few people that sees through the lies of the experts and professionals that contradict them.My guess would be that this is a trauma / stress induced coping mechanism for larger, more uncontrollable things that are happening / have happened in their lives.

Because he back dated all of his inventions he lost the credit for all of them but had a never ending, all expanding source of income but created history, A more joyful history. This kid made a lot of people happy, brought many people up to his level of wealth, guided those with comparable wealth. Those people recognized his vision and aided him while he warned them not to interfere, not to be kind and to be selfish. The reason was for his complete understanding that no good deed shall go unpunished. The United States government confiscated his wealth and left him with nothing as they were effectively borrowing his wealth for core infrastructure he created. They wanted to control it themselves. After exhausting his rights he acknowledged that this was illegal but it did not stop them. He then vowed to destroy everything he built, and punish everyone that wronged him. All of which taken as further justification to steal his wealth, But unbeknownst to them, his allies of comparable wealth were in that room and they hated the United States more than ever. Left with nothing, he forbidd anyone to assist him as he self destructed slowly but surely. The world has been in a state of constant momentum, Carried by a contraption they cannot begin to understand or comprehend, it is on its last legs and only 3 people on this earth that are capable of fixing it. The kid, His partner or his prodigy. The kid now lives day to day in a zombie like state, The partner cant fix it after what theyve done to the kid. And the prodigy would rather start from scratch.

President Obama knew and got it done. Millions of Americans have health Insurance, with no threat of insurance attorneys denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, because President Obama passed the ACA. Republicans have spent millions of dollars in taxpayer money over the last several years trying to overturn the ACA. The last attempt was close, but thanks to Senator John McCains thumbs down vote, it is still intact. Trump is all bluster, thrown in with hate and vitriol, parroting Hitler, saying immigrants are poisoning the blood of our nation, and yelling about mass detention and deportation. But when asked how much his plan will cost, Trump had no idea. There are those surrounding him, though who do have a plan, and some of what he would like to accomplish, may actually happen because there are no adults in the room this time.  For the economy, there has always been one plan by Trump and Republicans.  More tax cuts for corporations and the rich, less regulation and more money in their pockets. After five decades of failed trickle down theory, the rich are not going to trickle down their generosity to the working class. I have faith that working class Americans will get this at some point.

What is it?](https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2024/07/22/gop-vp-nominee-j-d-vance-is-linked-to-catholic-integralism-what-is-it/)\\nCatholic Integralists share an opposition to liberalism. Generally, liberalism is understood as a political philosophy that supports limits on the governments authority and constitutional protections for the rights of individuals and minorities. But Catholic Integralists argue that liberalism is incapable of establishing deep forms of human community because it values individualism and liberty above all things.\\n[Meet Americas New Catholic Radicals: Hostile to Liberal Democracy, a Threat to U.S. Jews](https://archive.ph/2024.05.22-070652/https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2023-08-21/ty-article-opinion/.premium/meet-americas-new-catholic-radicals-hostile-to-liberal-democracy-a-threat-to-u-s-jews/0000018a-1700-da8a-af8f-3757689d0000)Catholic conservatism have formed a new political movement youve probably never heard of.\\nIts called **Catholic Integralism** Integralism is no ordinary Catholic traditionalism, but something new. **This group rejects liberal democracy wholesale**. They teach that the best governments unite with the Catholic Church to support Catholicisms spiritual mission. Together, church and state promote the common good of the human community in this life and the next. In many cases, they would use coercion to do so.\\nAre they a threat today? Right now, their numbers are small, and they carry limited influence. But I expect them to grow. Still, the American integralists are well-known on the American right and among American thought leaders in religious circles.You may be familiar with figures adjacent to integralism, like Steven Bannon, Rod Dreher, or Sohrab Ahmari. But the movement has several significant leaders, with the most prominent intellectuals including Adrian Vermeule, a Harvard law professor and Gladden Pappin, a political theorist. Another figure is theologian Chad Pecknold.\\nTheyre focused on changing the judiciary and the administrative state, not winning elections.The American integralists have been central in mainstreaming Orban-like tactics in public policy.They have, in my view, an indirect influence on Ron De Santis, as these figures have been among the most adamant that the American right use state governments, and the federal government, to win the culture war. **They have also developed relationships with at least one U.S. Senator, JD Vance. (Bannon and Dreher in many ways opposed to liberal democracy, but they are not pushing for an established religion)**Indeed, we even see some illiberal trends in the current Israeli government from some of the parties in the current ruling coalition.They ultimately want the Catholic Church to become the established church of the U.S., though they know theyre very far away from it.**Integralism resembles Islamism but with Catholicism as the religion**","title":"Vance says Trump supporters who committed violence during Capitol attack shouldnt be pardoned"},{"text":"spheres of influence.

Conservatives have absurdly been foaming at the mouth about Biden's supposed imperialist dictator tendencies. Biden and Hillary are \\"war hawks\\" and yet the evil donald trump is simultaneously somehow some sort of \\"dove\\" and now also a balls-to-the-wall, wheels up on the idea of pillaging the globe anytime we think we'd benefit from seizing the property of our former allies. Anyone with half a brain could realize from day one that Trump wouldn't hesitate to get millions killed for the tiniest personal benefit to himself. And yet the scoundrels on the right who no longer believe in reality will eagerly tell us Trump is both peaceful and a total genius for telling other countries like a fucking asshole moron that he's going to take from them whatever he wants.I genuinely pity the intellects of people who think a return to imperialism is some simple \\"win\\" for Trump. It's nothing but one more painfully idiotic, deeply immoral and unethical stride into the selfishness and evilness that the right has somehow inexplicably convinced itself is now reasonable and virtuous. I don't know if you've noticed, but right wing America has completely lost any semblance of good faith. Everything is a \\"win\\" for Trump to these pitiful morons. If he's arrested for obvious crimes, he's \\"won.\\" If he's ultimately not punished, he's \\"won.\\" He \\"wins\\" when he loses elections and he wins when he wins elections.

The same folks that brought you \\"the stock market IS the economy\\".","title":"TikTok Sale Should Be Trumps First Deal"},{"text":"I mean, real talk, you're not entirely inaccurate here.  Yeah, labor in a given field is subject to supply and demand shifts which increase or decrease the wages paid.  That's just how things work.But at the same time the general consensus of economics is \\"a rising tide raises all ships\\" IE the \\"lump of labor fallacy\\" in which, in aggregated, labor produces value meaning it increases the total and per capita wealth of all involved.  If not through direct compensation, then in lower prices of goods so that the same dollar you earned goes farther than it would, thus making you richer.Now the caveats?1. When it comes to the \\"low-skill immigration\\" you're talking about?  The counterfactual is that, in theory, if this low-skill immigration didn't exist and thus wages had to rise to meet the supply needs?  It would become uncompetitive to the point of failure.  A tomato that costs twice as much to get on store shelves is one that won't sell and will end the firm.  In practice, we suppose that American Agrobusiness without this labor... just ceases to exist outside of niche applications.  Maybe that's not the case of course, maybe it'd just be marginally more expensive but still exist.2. Yes the lump of labor fallacy is a fallacy, but there isn't a magic money fairy that makes it so all wages in every industry go up.  Some lose, some win, in finding equilibrium.  And globally, free trade makes us all richer, but that doesn't mean every single person gets richer.  How much shifts actually occur depends a lot, but probably isn't to the extreme level you said. Or maybe that's the case, who knows.That's why I mentioned the Maoist-Third-Worldists here, their whole bit being the \\"Labor Aristocracy\\" IE: American and other First-World Workers make \\"Super-Profits\\" that push their wages up off the exploitation of the Global South.  Put another way, a world without American Hegemony and policy that benefit American Workers has the world getting richer as a whole while Americans get poorer.

This is likely due to the massively increased cost of healthcare leading to people avoiding/unable to get care and/or being denied it by their insurers, but a big contributing factor to the drop seen around 2014-15 was actually suicides, drug overdoses and alcoholism, aka \\"deaths of despair\\" primarily among middle-aged Americans who've seen their standard of living decline over their lifetimes, were unable to afford college to secure the middle-class salaries their parents had, etc.This is what Americans are pissed about, *whether they know it or not*, and while the post-COVID inflation put a fine point on it, even if the economy is doing \\"good\\" on paper and people are working/wages rise, they've still been getting increasingly gouged left and right on rent/mortages, student loans, healthcare costs, and can't get ahead by going to college without going into lifelong debt. It's why since Bush's 2nd term, and really the Great Recession, every president has quickly ended up with a negative approval rating, regardless of party. We also know Trump will do *nothing* to address any of this, and only make it worse - but unless Democrats do address it: nothing will change.

We need to remember that there are some big European countries whose opinion was not always the right one, and that in relation to Russia they were wrong.That was likely to be a reference to Germany, as was a subsequent comment by Kosiniak-Kamysz, who told the?*Financial Times*?that when others were only sending helmets \\\\[to Ukraine\\\\], we sent tanks.Polands defence spending has risen dramatically since Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has bought hundreds of?tanks,?rocket artillery,?fighter planes?and other hardware, mainly from the US and South Korea.In March 2022, a new?Homeland Defence Act?set a target of doubling the size of Polands armed forces to 300,000 personnel.

He says Poland can be the transatlantic link between this challenge set by President Trump and its implementation in Europe.Poland is already NATOs biggest relative spender. It?devoted 4.12% of GDP?to defence in 2024, which is set to?rise to 4.7%?this year.The US itself last year spent 3.38% of GDP on defence, though in absolute terms its spending is by far the highest in the alliance. Only three other countries C Estonia (3.43%), Latvia (3.15%) and Greece (3.08%) C exceeded 3%.At the other end of the scale, eight of the alliances 32 members did not even meet NATOs guideline target of 2%: Spain (1.28%), Slovenia (1.29%), Luxembourg (1.29%), Belgium (1.30%), Canada (1.37%), Italy (1.49%), Portugal (1.55%) and Croatia (1.81%).I think NATO should have 5%, said Trump earlier this week ahead of his swearing in for a second term as president on 20 January. They can all afford it.During his previous term as president, Trump regularly chided many NATO countries for not even meeting the alliances 2% target.Speaking today to the?*Financial Times*, W?adys?aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, who serves as both defence minister and deputy prime minister of Poland, called Trumps remarks an important wake-up call for Europe.Reaching 5% will take another decade, but I think he should not be criticised for setting a really ambitious target because otherwise there will be some countries that will continue to debate whether more spending is really needed, added Kosiniak-Kamysz.Even before Trumps re-election, Poland had been pushing its European partners to bolster security. In February last year, Prime Minister Donald Tusk?called on the European Union?to turn itself into a military power during visits to Paris and BerlinIn May, Tusk?issued an appeal?alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for Europe to boost defence spending.In November, NATOs new secretary-general, Mark Rutte,?visited Warsaw, where he hailed Polands huge contribution to NATO, in particular its exemplary defence spending.This sends a clear message not only to our adversaries but also to the United States, that Europe understands it must do more to ensure our shared security, said Rutte.","title":"Poland supports Trump call for NATO members to spend 5% of GDP on defence"},{"text":"I was banned from comic book movies Reddit page the same, I replied with kiss my ass.","title":"Banned for like Donald trump wow"},{"text":"And twice loser Kari Lake in Arizona.

What was once a corporate tactic for market manipulation has been transformed into a governance strategy of unprecedented scale and psychological sophistication. Through my decades studying political warfare, Ive observed how this tactic of perpetual menace traces its lineage not just through corporate boardrooms, but to the very mechanisms of authoritarian control that haunted the 20th century.Trump, in his particularly American strain of demagoguery, has perfected what I call the fog of pre-war - a calculated state of perpetual anxiety where the threat remains eternally just over the horizon. This is not mere political theater; it is psychological operations conducted against the American electorate with surgical precision.Consider his latest salvos: warnings of a war that shifts eternally forward, prophecies of doom that remain intentionally unfulfilled. The parallels to IBMs market dominance strategy are striking, yet Trump has transmuted this corporate tactic into something far more insidious. While IBM sought merely to preserve market share, Trump seeks nothing less than the dissolution of democratic certainty itself.The historical record demonstrates how demagogues manufacture crisis to sustain power - a pattern that repeats with devastating regularity across cultures and centuries. Trump has elevated this dark art to new heights, creating what I term a certainty vacuum - a void where facts become malleable and truth itself becomes negotiable.The genius - and yes, we must acknowledge the diabolic genius here - lies in the way he has weaponized uncertainty itself. Like a political black hole, his FUD strategy bends reality around itself, creating a gravitational pull that distorts all rational discourse that ventures too close to its event horizon.This is not merely rhetoric; it is an assault on the very foundations of democratic discourse. Having witnessed similar tactics deployed in various forms across decades of political warfare, I recognize this as something new and uniquely dangerous - a fusion of corporate psychological operations with authoritarian power politics that threatens to reshape the very nature of American democracy.","title":"Donald Trump isnt even in office yet and silly season has already begun"},{"text":"Look at Texas as an example.

Be Afraid."},{"text":"The idea that conservatives are simply \\"force-fed\\" talking points like Hunter Bidens laptop and the border crisis overlooks a critical issue: these are real problems that directly affect the American people. Under the Biden administration, the country has experienced significant challenges, many of which stem from liberal policies and mismanagement.Border Crisis:\\nThe border crisis is not a talking pointits a crisis by every definition. Under Trump, illegal border crossings were at record lows due to policies like the \\"Remain in Mexico\\" program and increased border wall construction. Biden reversed many of these measures on Day One, creating an influx of illegal immigration and overwhelming border towns. Since then, millions of illegal immigrants have crossed the border, straining resources, increasing drug trafficking (including record fentanyl deaths), and endangering public safety. Democrats claim to offer solutions, but their proposals often include amnesty for millions, which only incentivizes more illegal immigration. Republicans proposed stronger border security and enforcement, but Democrats refused to prioritize these measures, instead framing them as \\"inhumane.\\"Hunter Biden's Laptop:\\nThe Hunter Biden laptop story isnt just about personal misconduct; it raises serious questions about influence peddling and corruption at the highest levels. Emails and documents suggest potential connections between Hunter's business dealings and Joe Biden, yet liberal media outlets buried the story before the 2020 election. Imagine if a similar scandal surrounded a Trump childit would dominate headlines for months. Ignoring this issue undercuts the very transparency Democrats claim to champion.Conservative Leadership vs. Liberal Failures:\\nYou mentioned conservatives' silence on the border under their leadership, but this is misleading. Under Trump, policies prioritized Americans' safety, like halting catch-and-release and increasing deportations. Conversely, Biden halted deportations, released illegal immigrants into communities without court dates, and vilified Border Patrol agents. The result? Chaos. This isnt about declining wins for Biden but rejecting ineffective, unserious solutions that dont address root problems.Liberal Policies Have Hurt Americans:\\nEconomy: Under Biden, inflation reached a 40-year high, eroding wages and savings. The cost of living skyrocketed due to reckless spending, like the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package that caused massive price hikes.Energy: Trumps energy policies made America energy independent, reducing gas prices and creating jobs. Biden killed the Keystone XL pipeline and restricted domestic drilling, making the U.S. reliant on foreign oil and driving up costs.\\nCrime: Liberal cities embraced \\"defund the police\\" movements, leading to a surge in violent crime. Meanwhile, Trump supported law enforcement and saw historic drops in crime rates during his tenure.Education: Democrats push woke ideologies in schools, focusing on divisive critical race theory and gender ideology instead of academic excellence, leaving students less prepared for the future.\\nIn conclusion, the issues conservatives focus onborder security, economic stability, energy independence, and transparencyare not manufactured talking points. They are urgent problems caused or exacerbated by liberal policies. By pointing out these failures, conservatives arent avoiding solutions; they are advocating for real, effective leadership that prioritizes Americans over political gamesmanship.","title":"BREAKING: Anti-Trump Crusader Jack Smith Resigns From DOJ Before President-Elect Can Fire Him"},{"text":"Is Trump the butthole?","title":"Steve Bannon Vows To Oust Elon Musk From Donald Trumps Inner Circle Before The Inauguration: I made it my personal thing to take this guy down"},{"text":"Ah, the famous American imperialism that Putin has been talking about for years!","title":"\\"We have troops in Greenland\\": Vance nods at using military to get Trump's expansionist deal done"},{"text":"Senate Republicans will also vote for it or hide the bill.**Every Republican in Congress supports Israel.**","title":"The amount of power Israel has over us..."},{"text":"Pretty sure republicans have said theyre blocking aid to California and theyve cut funding to FEMA so it cant aid NC.","title":"They are determined to escalate this into WW3 as Trump takes office.

We have the #1 economy in the world. Despite not being perfect, were still miles ahead of most countries politically &amp; socially. Compared to other countries, America is still so much better, that's why millions do everything they can to get here. But compared to what this country used to be, it's not.Our economy is hard on the people right now even if better than other countries. Many can barely afford to live like they did just a decade or less ago and it's slowly getting worse despite what the government says about it. They show numbers and charts saying things are better but they are always misleading. They keep the details limited to a specific time period that will show improvement, but if they expand that range just a little it shows worse. This is not greatness.Politically the left and right don't just differ in opinion, they are practically at war. They will say and do just about anything to stick it to the other side at the expense of the people. They claim to serve the people but then do what is in their own best interest, what makes them rich while in office, but does not help the people. This is not greatness.Socially is just as bad. As just one example we have men dressing as women to compete in sports where they crush their competition but when competing against other men they're at the bottom of the sport, way at the bottom. Women are being made into a costume for men to wear so they can excel at things where they otherwise can't compete. Some in society see this as equality but others view it as destroying the equality that women have fought for decades to achieve.

I had this conversation with my wife last night. In our lifetimes we can hope to have on the order of $1-10 million in assets. That is 1, 000 times less than a billionaire. I think over a lifetime, about $1 million is assets is achievable by rhe average western family, especially if we are just rounding and using orders of magnitude.The worlds poor are likely not to ever have more that $1,000 in assets, if any at all. If you make $2 a day, over the course of 60 years of working you will have made $40,000... Over your whole life. The difference between the average western family and the worlds poor is also 1000 times.The difference in wealth between a billionaire?and an average western family is the same order of magnitude as between the average western family and the worlds poor. The worlds poorest people are even poorer than that. There is literal slavery in this world and we haven't talked about access to developed resources that we have that the worlds poor do not, like roads, hospitals, schools, etc. I feel quite confident in saying that in terms of wealth, there is a smaller gap between a billionaire and the average western family than there is between the average western family and the worlds poor.*edit the replies below are missing the forest through the trees here. Firstly, \\"especially if we are just rounding and using orders of magnitude\\". The numbers $500,001 through $5,000,000 are all on the same order of magnitude as $1,000,000. Secondly, even if we drop this one order of magnitude and say the average western only makes $100,000 (aka $50,001 to $500,000) in their life time, it really does not change that much and this number is 100% justified as the median and mean wealth (not just boomers) in every western country is greater than $50,000. This actually starts to extend into developing nations as well. The world's poor have nothing. The average member of the world's poor are at least as far away as the average westerner is from a billionaire (or if you want a hundred millionaire). The point here is to try and put into perspective the gulf in wealth between a member of the worlds poor and the average western.But, to re-iterate, we have not even taken into account access to developed resources. As an example, my wife and I were discussing someone in poverty in Canada. My wife is a doctor and had seen this person 3 times in the last month for various ailments including abortion and reproductive services. This person lives in arctic Canada and has access to a home with heating and has access to food regularly. This individual is signifigantly better off than a member of the worlds poor whom makes less that $2 a day. Again, that individual will earn about $40,000 over their entire life at that wage. This poor Canadian accessed more that $40,000 in medical services over the past month. Something this member of the world's poor would never see in their lifetime.To summarize, \\"I do not think the average person truly understands how poor the worlds poor are.\\"","title":"Why the MAGA Fight Over H-1B Visas Is Crossing Party Lines: Critics from the left and the right say Big Tech companies are exploiting the visa system for high-skilled workers to reduce labor costs and boost profits"},{"text":"Vance seems to be forgetting that military presence should be about defense not expansion","title":"\\"We have troops in Greenland\\": Vance nods at using military to get Trump's expansionist deal done"},{"text":"Here in the US, I don't think the mainstream right *wanted to even tried* to keep the fascists under control.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, reintroduced legislation aimed at stopping noncitizens from voting in federal elections  something that is already illegal and which research has universally shown rarely happens.The bill, dubbed the SAVE Act, would add new proof-of-citizenship requirements to voter registration that experts say could disenfranchise scores of eligible voters.It was one of the first bills introduced in the 119th Congress, a sign that what supporters call election integrity policy remains a key part of the GOP agenda, even after Trump's win....There has never been evidence of widespread noncitizen voting, but Hayduk says the false narrative has been around more than 100 years and it combines multiple helpful ideas for the right.\\"It keeps immigrants in the news as public enemy No. 1,\\" Hayduk said. \\"But most importantly, it is a basis to enact legislation that for the foreseeable future hampers the capacity to vote of a whole set of constituents that tend to line up with Democrats.\\"Most Americans, on both sides of the aisle, feel only U.S. citizens should vote in American elections. But surveys have shown that legislation requiring proof-of-citizenship documents like a birth certificate or passport to register to vote would probably have a disproportionate impact on eligible citizens of color as well as registered Democrats and independents, versus Republicans....The federal SAVE Act could have a hard time getting past the Senate's 60-vote threshold, but restrictive policy initiatives may have more success in Republican-led states.\\"Obviously we hope that there will be some federal election reform  but we can't count on that,\\" Heather Honey, a Pennsylvania election activist who works with Mitchell, told state lawmakers during the ALEC panel. \\"So states have to take this opportunity to modernize the laws.\\"Proof-of-citizenship requirements specifically could, however, take states into murky legal territory.Kansas' effort to institute a proof-of-citizenship law a decade ago was ruled unconstitutional after a lengthy and politically damaging legal battle, and Arizona is now forced to maintain separate registration lists for federal and state elections due to a court ruling about its law. New Hampshire also passed a citizenship documentation requirement last year that is facing legal challenge.Election officials usually say noncitizen voting has never been shown to be a real issue, so there's no need for further tightening on top of the current system, which requires would-be voters to attest to their citizenship. If a noncitizen illegally registers and votes, they risk arrest and they potentially eliminate the chance they will ever become a U.S. citizen.This is clearly a bad-faith attempt to disenfranchise certain populations, discourage voting and voter engagement, and to protect the republicans' base. Combined with the already problematic gerrymandering that we see in so many districts, it seems that in the coming years it might be more difficult than ever to encourage people to vote. Electoral reform is needed now more than ever, but this isn't it.","title":"Despite Trump's win, 'election integrity' activists still seek sweeping voting changes"},{"text":"F**k them!","title":"White Christian nationalists are poised to remake America in their image during Trumps second term, author says"},{"text":"The Couch-fucker needs to run this by President Musk first.","title":"\\"We have troops in Greenland\\": Vance nods at using military to get Trump's expansionist deal done"},{"text":"Can you imagine if the US invaded another country?!","title":"GOP Sen.

There isnt some magical, international legal provision that only Trump is aware of which would enable the U.S. to take over anything related to the canals operations. Its just more daily bloviating and distraction like back in 2016.And all his bombast about Canada becoming the 51st state? Hes just trying to bait a reaction out of Trudeau and exploit it as a fig leaf for his objectively awful tariff plans.Focus.Defunding the government, disrupting its operations, promoting even more tax advantages for the wealthy at the expense of middle-and low-income earners, and weakening the military and security presence of the U.S. and its allies throughout the world are what to watch out for with this administration.This is just more red meat for his base and another shiny penny to distract everyone else from the real insidious shit above.","title":"Suddenly Donald Trump doesnt want to talk so much about the economy"},{"text":"That happens on the right, too.

Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute. Theres going to be supply chain issues. Theres going to be increases in prices, decreases in services. Experts are concerned that deporting such a large number of undocumented immigrants at once could leave a hole in the labor force. [A 2023 study in the *Journal of Labor Economics* found that 44,000 U.S.-born workers could lose their jobs for every 500,000 immigrants removed from the labor force.](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/721152?journalCode=jole) Immigrants, especially unauthorized immigrants, are much more likely to work in the types of jobs that create the goods and services where were seeing the prices go up, said Chloe East, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research who was also one of the researchers behind the 2023 study. We cant say for sure what the effects will be, she said. But based on what we know from past mass deportation efforts, it seems like goods and services where unauthorized immigrants are super concentrated like construction and agriculture, the prices are likely going to go up as a result of a mass deportation effort rather than down.!ping IMMIGRATION","title":"Trump's plan for mass deportation could have a big effect on prices"},{"text":"Pay to play.

Carbon taxes are bullshit because the amount of the tax is unknowable but statists were forced to justify a figure so one was essentially made up using imperfect climate modeling. Raising income taxes on the rich to 90% is just silly.   Yes it was that high back in the 1950's but  something like 10 people paid that tax.

The Nazi's never got a majority and were actually on the downward path when they got \\"invited\\" to take over by politicians on the mainstream right who though they could use and control them for their own ends.The centrists had been sabotaging most attempts at solving or mitigating the ongoing socioeconomic crisis, even when they allied with the social democrats.The social democrats and the communists opposed them, but the whole point of the takeover was to imprison or kill all of them, so that didn't last long. Unions were abolished and union leaders arrested. The army supported it because they were a reactionary (though not populist) state-within-the-state who just wanted funding and pro-military policies. The religious types mostly supported them because they saw socialism as the greater threat and there was a concordat with the papacy afterwards that neutered catholic resistance. The police is difficult to gauge, as they had been arresting fascist paramilitaries for years until the mainstream right wing parties did a deal with the fascists to legalize them, and afterwards many of those same paramilitaries were put in charge of the police. They actively collaborated in the political violence and incarceration that followed IIRC.As a general rule: don't expect the \\"moderate\\" right or the security apparatus to be on your side and expect the centrists to prefer laissez faire-economics over social democracy even in the face of an authoritarian takeover. The army is probably not comparable because the German army was a reactionary / authoritarian organization that didn't like democracy but didn't like the Nazi's either because of the populism.

Authoritarianism always rises because of the unique blend of two things: Lack of civic duty from a nation's leadership, and a sense of indignant apathy from the general population of that nation. Those two ingrediants are essential for authoritarism to take root, with the former usually leading to the latter.Ultimately, people go \\"well, it's not *my* problem - why should I risk my \\\\[life, liberty, family, job, whatever\\\\] for this country? What has my country done for me, lately?\\" and, sure enough, that leads to leaders and officials who not only recognize that apathy, but actively exploit it. That's actually the most curious part: Fascists, authoritarians, would-be dictators... all broudly and loudly telegraph their intentions to any and everybody; they never hide their intent -- they may lie about it, but they never take any real measures to actually conceal their schemes; in fact, the more obvious their schemes, the easier it is for them to exploit and leverage those aformentioned indignant, apathetic masses. And that means that... it's easy enough to identify who will work to become the next dictator, right? And of course, we *always know* what will happen if they manage to get into power - we *know* the suffering it will yield. And yet... we let it happen. Time and time and time again.The real reason that nations fall to fascism is because there's always an inexplicable shortage of people who might be willing to make \\"the\\" sacrifice necessary to help ensure their nation doesn't fall to fascism -- even though, statistically, they'll suffer just the same if fascism takes root in their nation, regardless.","title":"Incoming Trump team is questioning civil servants at National Security Council about their loyalty"},{"text":"I have a feeling Barkley could probably take him in a round.","title":"Trumps deportation vows only for rabid Republicans and will fail, says Newt Gingrich"},{"text":"Yeah, they are clever the way they do it.
