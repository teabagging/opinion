If the person you loved and the person they became are arguably two different people, was any love actually removed from the equation? Because, arguably, you can still love the version of your partner that was with you during your relationship. If I love the Mario Bros., and every copy of the game ever made was destroyed - I still love the Mario Bros. If I love the Mario Bros., and every copy of the game ever made was destroyed and replaced with copies of Tetris - I still love Mario Bros. My love was never withdrawn, the subject of my love is merely gone.If the essence of what you love transforms so drastically that it no longer resembles the original, it raises the question: was your love for the thing itself or the qualities that defined it?I mean, one could argue that things themselves are only defined by their characteristics, could they not? That's literally how all of language and science works, and how most people perceive themselves and other people. You're talking about the same thing. To love someone or something unconditionally, to my mind, means to love it no matter what it does, no matter what happens to it, no matter what happens to you, and no matter how it's treats you or is treated.a replacement with different characteristics could render that love moot, which in turn indicates that conditions exist around what makes the object of love worthy of that affection.No, the fact that a replacement is not loved the same way as the original, if anything, implies a LACK of conditionality. What made the object individual, separate from some other being or some generic classification, is what defines what it is, and an imitation doesn't warrant my love by checking all the boxes. If I love my wife unconditionally, that doesn't mean I'm going to love any human being who walks through my door imitating my wife. If it did - then my wife was never something to love, even conditionally, to begin with, I merely loved the idea of whatever a wife is.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"This is 100% the most sensible reason to vote for Trump.","title":"The ILA ruined my life"},{"text":"I think if districts were re-apportioned to something proportional to the constitution and clearly define that districts are to be based on the official statistical population and area of each metropolitan area , city, or country seat. The House of Representatives hasn't been re-apportioned since 1929.  The US population was less than a third of the current population. It's easy to argue that if there should currently be three times as many representatives in Congress. That's like 1310 members in the House of Representatives. If there's 900 more seats up for grabs, that should help with gerrymandering. And if each district gets an individual vote and not a winner, take all like in most states. The Electoral College   would work as intended.  Just an idea, but the fact our country hasn't been re-apportioned in almost a hundred years and the country has more than 3 times the population, bugs the shot out of me. I love that she's bringing attention to Gerrymandering, and I hope it and apportionment can be a \\"We the People\\" type cause it shouldn't be a partisan issue.

Why this Democrat is running a race she knows she can't win | Kate Barr is running in North Carolina to draw attention to Republican gerrymandering"},{"text":"Most parents have a limit to their love, often tied to their childrens behavior or choices. This suggests that love is not purely unconditional but is influenced by the actions and values of the child.Does it suggest that, though? Seems to me all that proves is that unconditional love is *rare*, not *impossible.* Even if most parents stop loving their murderous child, wouldn't the mere possibility that even as little as a single parent doing so prove that it can happen? If 99 out of 100 toads are green instead of blue, why would that suggest the one blue toad isn't blue at all?it may reflect a desire to love unconditionally rather than an outright demonstration of it. The ability to love in the face of extreme actions is admirable, but it doesnt negate the fact that such love is often challenged by the childs choices.Does the reason I decide to love something unconditionally matter when considering whether or not my love is unconditional? Does love being challenging prove that it can't exist? Climbing mount Everest is hard, but that doesn't mean I can't do it. Even if the only reason I choose to love my child through their entire lifespan regardless of their wrongdoing is because of a deep seeded desire to prove you specifically wrong, if I'm able to do that successfully, doesn't that mean it worked?However, many religious teachings convey a sense of conditionality in Gods love, particularly regarding salvation. The idea that eternal damnation exists for those who dont follow specific beliefs suggests that Gods love is conditional based on adherence to certain criteria.Again, I have to ask, does it really suggest that? You're correlating an omnipotent being's actions to an innate internal feeling that you and I can't see. If many religious teachings really did believe in conditional love, they wouldn't all be preaching about it's unconditionality, would they? If God loves unconditionally, why would there be a need for punishment?That is a very good question that all factions of faith and nonbelievers debate all the time. You'd have to ask God. To argue that unconditional love doesn't exist would be to argue that *no possible explanation* can exist for why he does what he does in spite of his love, but to do so would be to assume a lot for a person none of us have spoken to. Just because you can't imagine punishing someone you love doesn't mean it is incapable of someone else to do.Hard agree that its certainly possible to love someone even after a breakup, but, the relationship itself has changed fundamentally. When boundaries are crossed, the dynamic shifts, often resulting in a loss of love or affection.Once again, just because you can prove unconditional love is rare, does not mean you can prove it doesn't exist. Not every single human on the planet who has ever gone through a breakup with every single one of their past relationships experienced a loss of love or affection for their ex-partner. My father was still madly in love with my mother till the day he died, even after she left him for another man.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"Ideal or realistic?

Why this Democrat is running a race she knows she can't win | Kate Barr is running in North Carolina to draw attention to Republican gerrymandering"},{"text":"All voters have some form of red line after which point they cannot vote for a politician anymore. For example, if there was a politician you agreed with on nearly every point, but they also campaigned on murdering every LGBT+ person in the country, you might reasonably not want to vote for them anymore because that is such an abhorrent position.For me, arming a genocide is that red line. As it stands, both Harris and Trump seem poised to continue giving Israel everything they want with essentially no pushback. Thus, since both cross my red line I cannot bring myself to vote for either of them.Most liberals try to counter this point by saying something nebulous about Harris \\"wanting a two-state solution\\" or \\"caring about Palestinians\\" with no actual policy to back it up, just meaningless rhetoric. At least in my opinion, if your rhetoric is that you care about group A but you give group B billions in weapons they consistently use to murder innocent civilians in group A, you don't actually care about them regardless of what you say.Despite all of this, I am willing to believe that Harris does care about Palestinians and thus vote for her, but there has to be some actual proof of that being the case. What I feel is the most straightforward and easy way for Harris to provide that proof is to outline concrete policy positions on her campaign website that she would push for if elected. Note that this is the bare minimum. I'm not asking for her to snub Israel, or even condemn the Biden administration's role in genocide. Just to have actual policy towards achieving a ceasefire.Currently her campaign site just has empty words to the effect of \\"ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself while supporting the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.\\" Which, even if we ignore that variations of \\"Israel has a right to defend itself\\" are just dog-whistles for \\"Israel has the right to murder civilians with no consequences\\" at this point, she outlines no actual policy for ensuring the human rights of Palestinians are protected. And, in fact, but standing so steadfastly with Israel, the entity that is most responsible for human rights violations against Palestinians, it appears that she will instead be a party to those human rights violations.","title":"Biden says US discussing possible Israeli plans to attack Irans oil industry"},{"text":"Kamala!","title":"Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris, calls Trump the most dangerous candidate in my lifetime"},{"text":"Oh god I got up to bees and didnt realize there's MORE.Edit: Bruh.

In 2016, he wound up with just over 46% with his polling again being low 40's.* Now look at present polling, and he's consistently hovering in the ~45-48ish range, exactly where he wound up in 2016/2020.So do I know for sure my analysis is correct?  No.  Could this be wishful thinking?  Absolutely.  But the facts are the facts, and unless we're speculating a similar polling miss where Trump gets  50% of the national vote (which is what a similar miss would imply and something I'd be willing to bet a large portion of my savings will not come to pass), it seems far more likely to me that polling is a better representation this cycle than previous as methodologies have changed across the board to not miss three times in a row.In fact I think you could make the argument that a polling miss in the opposite direction (underestimating Harris) is at least as likely as pollsters have gone waaaaay out of their way to avoid missing three times in a row.  I think it's also safe to say pollsters would feel better about missing in the opposite direction than underestimating Trump for a third time.But I will not disagree that this is all conjecture.","title":"Kamala Harris Leads Trump by Half the Margin Biden Did in 2020: Poll"},{"text":"It doesn't help the economy in any way.

I am not a scientist\\n2. I am not an educator\\n3. I am not a child psychologistSo, these are just one guy's thoughts and observations. (They may also be badly out of date since I haven't been to school in decades.)With all that in mind, I think that one of the problems with the way science is taught is that it is taught as a body of knowledge, not a method of acquiring new knowledge. This is a tremendous disservice to both science, and more importantly, the students, imo. It gives the impression of an argument from authority rather than emphasizing the curiosity, imagination, and hard work that leads to scientific conclusions. It also can leave students with the impression that they are learning immutable truths about the universe. And, of course, immutable truths are the polar opposite of science.Instead, of simply learning who discovered what when, students should be presented with the observations that led the scientists to ask, \\"Why does that happen?\\" That should be followed up with a list of possible answers. Then the possible answers should be eliminated one-by-one as they are tested until only one answer remains. (Hopefully, it will be the answer science has arrived at...unless they come up with an even better explanation. This gives much more of a flavor of what science is and why it cannot provide immutable truths. That instead, science provides supportable answers based on the available evidence.In tandem (or before or after as expertise dictates) the essentials of critical thinking generally should be taught. Over several years the types of fallacies can be added in, to teach them clear thinking. Real world situations should be evaluated to determine whether these situations are the result of good critical thinking or simply unfounded belief.

If you think back to the election of 2016, one of the biggest concerns for Democrats for the election is that the economy was heading towards a possible recession and there was big worry that it could be formally announced before November . . .  that was how the prior administrations economic impact ended.  Remember, the announced GDP rate for Quarter one of 2016 was 1.4%.  The announced GDP for Quarter two of 2016 was 1.2%.  Remember, by the time the election was held in 2016, the stock market was up only a modest 5.2% year to date - people were concerned about the economy.And I voted for Obama and think he did a decent job. But there is nothing that indicates his implemented policies had any notable impact on the sudden economic acceleration during Trumps term.  That's just wishfully claiming unsupported by any evidence.You're right, every Republican and Every Democrat has talked about blue collar jobs during the election season - but that's part of the problem, it's been only during the election season for the Democrats.  And surprisingly, Biden who typical likes to cast himself as a blue collar guy - spent half his time insulting their lifestyles and their values during his current term.  Heck, half the time he made visits to union plants during his Presidency, he would get ridiculed by the members and challenged - and then he would lash out at them.  Trump, and I can completely see why you don't like his personality, talked about them in a positive light, in their language, in appreciation for their personal interests, not just when he was campaigning in 2016, but all throughout his presidency.As much as many Democrats may think otherwise, midwest and Southern union members are not dumb and don't fall for the typical Democrat rhetoric and fear mongering as you think.It was like when Don Lemon recently went out into public to interview middle class people, who repeatedly said the economy sucks and their lifes aren't better - and Don being the good poster boy that he is, tried to tell them they were wrong and didn't know what they were talking about.  Don Lemon is the poster child of Democrat rationalization and rhetoric . . . You can't convince a person standing in dog shit that their life is full of roses.","title":"CMV: The comparative lack of union support for Harris vs. previous Democratic nominees is a very bad sign for her chances this November."},{"text":"Congrats!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 3, 2024 - 33 days until election day!"},{"text":"Mail in voting already has this duress problem, but we have it anyway.No, online voting in a democratic election is a bad idea because being a secure, auditable and hack-resistant system, that verifies an identity to cast a ballot, yet keeps that vote anonymous to the system, is borderline impossible.","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Georgia Boost as 120,000 New Voters Sign Up"},{"text":"He was never seen again.??","title":"Never Trumper converts"},{"text":"Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Venerable-Weasel ([2?](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Venerable-Weasel)).^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/3tnrci4j9nsd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bc495a135802bc7079a5132d8d485e60666b98","title":"Bruce Springsteen Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Allred has a chance.

If we define love this way, it suggests that love exists regardless of feelings or circumstancesmeaning you have a duty to love someone no matter what they do.

However, I would argue that this perspective still raises questions:* If love is purely about obligation, can it really be called love in the emotional sense? It might be more about a sense of responsibility or duty rather than the warmth and affection typically associated with love.\\n* In this view, love can become more like a contract.

The federal government has certain duties, powers, and responsibilities, the states have some of their own. The intention of the U.S. federalist system, codified into the 10th amendment, is that the federal government only has powers specifically given to it, but it's the other way around for the states. The constitution does not explicitly give the federal government the power to involve itself in abortion policy, and Roe v Wade where the federal Supreme Court defined what states could and could not pass for abortion policy was based on shaky grounds with the Due Process clause of the 14th amendment, which says nothing about and was not intended to apply to abortion.Therefore, whether you think it's good policy for the U.S. or not, it does make sense that abortion should either be left to state policy.The talk about \\"what's right for California may not be what's right for Georgia &amp; Arizona\\" is a justification for federalism itself, the same argument you'd find in a civics class. It's simplified because most people are not going to experience the debate in its full form, but are going to watch clips in sound bites on the news or on social media. The point here is not that people, or communities, with differing view points should always get their way. Now lets shift from [Federal Level = Collective and States = Individual Members] to [States = Collective and People = Individual Members] and apply the exact same logic.With that in mind, I don't think that this switch follows. The point of federalism is not to protect \\"individual members\\" (which states really aren't) or differing viewpoints. If an individual with a differing viewpoint could override the policy decided by the consensus of the community they live in, what's the point of having local/state governments in the first place?","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"The strike that just ended today?","title":"Ex-Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson says she is a conservative who is \\"proud\\" to vote for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Which is funny because I was born and raised in Texas both of my parents are Mexican, I have loads of Mexican family in Mexico that I visited every year, I speak Spanish fairly well, I've encountered and immersed in Mexican culture (both popular and tradicional) a lot over the years.

But if the conditions change, the relationship most likely will too.  Because underlying the relationship, is an unconditional affection, caring about their welfare and wishing success in all things.A partner relationship is much more conditional.  A partnership is created based on conditions, mutual needs and compromises to meet your and their needs.   over time, assuming that the conditions (that do change over time) are met can grow into unconditional love.  After that maturity is built based upon shared experiences, confidence and trust, that was built on the earlier conditions, unconditional love evolved.

You could argue that their love?*was*?unconditional, but that doesn't prove that a parent?*can't*?love a child unconditionally. There are parents who love their children even after they become murderers or rapists or crime bosses or terrorists.While its true that some parents may continue to love their children even after they commit heinous acts, this isnt the norm. Most parents have a limit to their love, often tied to their childrens behavior or choices. This suggests that love is not purely unconditional but is influenced by the actions and values of the child. Moreover, if a parent expresses love for a child despite serious wrongdoing, it may reflect a desire to love unconditionally rather than an outright demonstration of it. The ability to love in the face of extreme actions is admirable, but it doesnt negate the fact that such love is often challenged by the childs choices.Similar to our inability to prove how other people feel about things, you can't prove how God (assuming he's real) feels about things either. Eternal damnation?*to you*?feels like a withdrawal of love, but unless God himself tells you that you can't know that for sure. Isn't it possible that he loves everyone unconditionally, even if they don't get saved and go to hell?Youre right that we cannot definitively know Gods feelings or intentions. However, many religious teachings convey a sense of conditionality in Gods love, particularly regarding salvation. The idea that eternal damnation exists for those who dont follow specific beliefs suggests that Gods love is conditional based on adherence to certain criteria. If God loves unconditionally, why would there be a need for punishment? This brings into question the nature of that love and whether it can truly be unconditional if it comes with consequences.You can still love someone even after breaking up with them. In theory, boundaries in a relationship may be less about whether or not you love someone, and more about whether or not they treat you in a way that you expect from someone in your life.Hard agree that its certainly possible to love someone even after a breakup, but, the relationship itself has changed fundamentally. When boundaries are crossed, the dynamic shifts, often resulting in a loss of love or affection. The love may have been genuine, but the conditions that supported that love have altered. If we define love as a relationship that thrives on mutual respect and trust, then when those conditions are broken, its difficult to maintain the same level of love.You can still love someone even after breaking up with them. In theory, boundaries in a relationship may be less about whether or not you love someone, and more about whether or not they treat you in a way that you expect from someone in your life.Your example about the potential death of a loved ones identity is compelling, but to me it just more so raises another point about the nature of love. If a person fundamentally changes in a way that violates core values or trust, can they still be considered the same person in the context of love? The love we have for someone is often tied to who they are at their core. When they act contrary to that core (like betrayal or violence), i think its reasonable to feel that the person we loved is no longer present, thus leading to the withdrawal of love.Imagine I love, unconditionally, the ship of Theseus. If I say I love it unconditionally, you can't prove otherwise. If I sell the ship or replace parts of it, that doesn't prove I don't love it. If I replace all the pieces, at one point is it no longer the ship I love? If I rebuild the ship with the old parts, am I supposed to love that ship too? If I'm supposed to love every possible version of my ship that ever exists, has existed, or will existed, AND treat it a certain way at all times in order for my love to be uncondtional, then sure, maybe by that definition unconditional love can't exist, but at that point, does the distinction make any practical difference? Do I have to love my wife as a worm in order for it to not be conditional? At that point, both versions of the word lose their meaning.Intriguing thought experiment\\\\~ But I think the idea of love changing as the object of love changes does imply that love is still kinda conditional. If the essence of what you love transforms so drastically that it no longer resembles the original, it raises the question: was your love for the *thing* itself or the *qualities* that defined it? If your love for the ship was based on its historical significance, craftsmanship, or functionality, a replacement with different characteristics could render that love moot, which in turn indicates that conditions exist around what makes the object of love worthy of that affection.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"We are poised for a re-alignment given they historically have happened on average every forty years or so.

Low inflation, wages in the country rising notably faster than inflation - the first REAL wage growth (fyi, REAL means adjusted for inflation) in quite some time.  They saw record low unemployment rates in the country for all sectors and geographies, they experienced tax cuts under Trump - equating to even better standard of living increases over and above the REAL wage growth.And what Trump did that the Democrats have a history of not doing, he spoke their language and he spoke about the importance of manufacturing in the USA throughout his administration - not just when the election rolled around.  From year 1 to the very end, he was always talking about American jobs - not the high tech engineering jobs - but the actual hard working, get dirty and produce something jobs - you know, those jobs that half of the workers in our country do everyday.If you honestly think about it, which forces you to take you ideological party blinders off - you have to honestly ask yourself why in the world would they vote for Harris over Trump?  She is the most liberal politicians based on actual voting records in our country - midwest and southern union members are moderates (excepting the teachers unions), are more likely to own guns, be married, have been very negatively impacted by the runaway rampant inflation and resulting losses of income and standard of living that accompanied that high inflation.Anybody who questions and wonders why so many of the union employees will support and vote for Trump over Harris are simply refusing to look at reality.  Just like the party has, you've simply taken them for granted and have spent years insulting how many of them live their lives, what they enjoy, and where most of them live, and endlessly insulted their typical education levels, and while you may not have realized how often you've insulted them unintentionally - it's exactly what you've been doing for the past few years - until election time rolled around - though now you're spending time insulting them for making a direct unbiased comparison of their lives under Trump vs, their lives under Harris.

Boundaries can (and should) be set without making them an express condition of love. We all *know* that transgressions of boundaries don't have much to do with conditions on the emotion of love anyway... because if it did, no one would ever stay in an abusive relationship. The most healthy way to approach boundaries is that some things will, regrettably, make it impossible to continue the *relationship*.  You start introducing love into that, and it becomes emotionally manipulative. Edit: Indeed, thinking of boundaries in terms of \\"conditions of love\\" is *dangerous*, because it lends itself to rationalizing staying in an abusive relationship because \\"well, I still love them, so it must not be bad enough to leave\\". Similarly, a prenup isn't about love or conditions thereupon. It's about your relationship with the State, with regard to the joint desires of the couple to modify the default \\"contract\\" of a marriage. If a prenup  ever becomes \\"conditions on our love\\", then a) it will almost certainly be declared invalid (that's not something that can legally be in a prenup), and b) it's also a strong sign that you don't belong in that marriage. Again, the basic concept of \\"unconditional love\\" is: \\"I trust you not to do anything that would change my love for you\\". In general, this is a positive view of how to be in a relationship, because if that's *not* true, you really have no business linking your life to a person.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"I have never seen a single person say \\"I would change my vote from Kamala if she took a more critical stance on Isreal\\".","title":"Kamala Harris Calls Support for Israels Security Unwavering"},{"text":"I can't complain about the RC.

For instance, when a homophobic parent disowns their queer child, it shows that love can indeed be conditional based on personal criteria. Trusting someone not to do something harmful is different from withdrawing love when they don't meet your specific criteria for who deserves love.Regarding your point about a partner saying, \\"I love you, subject to the following conditions,\\" I see that as a way to set boundaries, which isnt inherently negative. Its a method of ensuring both partners understand each others expectations.Your concern that such a statement could imply an accusation is valid, but consider situations like setting up a prenup before marriage. While some might interpret that as distrust, addressing potential issues directly can be a healthy conversation. Its about being open and honest rather than avoiding difficult topics.As for your point about keeping internal conditions unexpressed, I agree that this can lead to passive-aggressive behavior in some individuals. However, I think that speaks more to their personal issues rather than to the broader concept of conditional love itself.

You can fear monger and cry wolf only for so long when all the evidence is to the contrary.Rank and file union members are much more apt to be moderate politically than typical far left leaning Democrats (the majority of the party now).  They're most likely to be midwestern, middle to upper middle income, married with families (something that is no longer valued by Democrats), males (generally not liked by liberals and progressives), and enjoy doing the things that are popular with middle income people in the US midwest and south/southeast - not the interest of the Coastal Elitists.  They are more apt to be trade school educated versus college degreed and have listened to Democrats describe such people for the past 8 years as being dumb and unable to make wise choices and live in a part of the country that democrats are constantly ignoring - and then criticizing them when they're not ignoring them.  They are more apt than the average American to own a gun, hunt and fish, and value the rights to do those things - all of which are targets of the Democrat coastal elitists leftist party.They haven't left the Democrat party - the Democrat party has left them, and kicked them in the butt and endlessly insulted them while doing so.

Like many other emotions, we can't know for sure what other people are feeling, and simply have to take their word for it. If Bob from HR says he has unconditional love for literally anything, it's impossible for me to prove he's wrong unless he does in fact one day stop loving it and outright tells me that he has.But just for devil's advocacy sake, I'd like to push back on your 3 predicted counter arguments.* Yes, some parents grow out of love for their children who become murderers or other such serious actions. You could argue that their love *was* unconditional, but that doesn't prove that a parent *can't* love a child unconditionally. There are parents who love their children even after they become murderers or rapists or crime bosses or terrorists.\\n* Similar to our inability to prove how other people feel about things, you can't prove how God (assuming he's real) feels about things either. Eternal damnation *to you* feels like a withdrawal of love, but unless God himself tells you that you can't know that for sure. Isn't it possible that he loves everyone unconditionally, even if they don't get saved and go to hell?\\n* You can still love someone even after breaking up with them. In theory, boundaries in a relationship may be less about whether or not you love someone, and more about whether or not they treat you in a way that you expect from someone in your life.\\n* There's also, potentially, the idea that unconditional love only \\"falters\\" when the thing you love no longer exists. Is your child being your child a condition of your love for them, or is that simply an aspect of their existence? I could say I love pizza, but if the pizza were suddenly a taco I don't love it, because it's simply not the same thing anymore. If I love a celebrity and he dies, there isn't a celebrity to love anymore, only his memory. Similarly, if I love my wife, and she suddenly cheats on me, stabs my daughter in the chest, and moves to Europe never to see me again, does me not loving her anymore prove that my love was conditional, or did the person I unconditionally love \\"die\\", get replace by a new person with the same name, and I'm left loving the memory of my old wife instead?Imagine I love, unconditionally, the ship of Theseus. If I say I love it unconditionally, you can't prove otherwise. If I sell the ship or replace parts of it, that doesn't prove I don't love it. If I replace all the pieces, at one point is it no longer the ship I love? If I rebuild the ship with the old parts, am I supposed to love that ship too? If I'm supposed to love every possible version of my ship that ever exists, has existed, or will existed, AND treat it a certain way at all times in order for my love to be uncondtional, then sure, maybe by that definition unconditional love can't exist, but at that point, does the distinction make any practical difference? Do I have to love my wife as a worm in order for it to not be conditional? At that point, both versions of the word lose their meaning.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"Either way I dont have the money.

Sure, the union leaders are still prone to support and want to endorse the Democrats (no matter how bad or how good they are).  But the rank and file, they have been consistently moving to the right as the Democrat party has moved further and further to the extreme left.This year, it has become so apparent that the union leaders, probably rightfully so to some degree, need to worry about endorsing a candidate that their rank and file members don't like or want.Remember, union workers are most likely to be middle income or upper middle income Americans that are hard working meat and potatoes people.  These are the very people that have suffered the most under the economic crisis and runaway rampant inflation of the last few years - while being ignored by the same party who much prefers to focus on the coastal elites and the philosophy that borders are unAmerican (not recognizing that people - no matter who they are or where they came from or how they got here - are all competing for the same limited number of jobs and too many job seekers drives down wages as a natural result of supply and demand).The Democrats constant characterizations of the midwest male is also utterly demeaning to them and completely turns them off - for which a few campaign season stops after ignoring and insulting them for 3 years doesn't work anymore to get their vote.The Democrats are actually starting to have the very some problems with the Black voters.  Ignore them until election time, they claim anybody who isn't a Democrat is racist and hates them!  Black voters are the most moderate Democrat voters - as the Coastal Extremist Progressive Democrats that cater to the coastal elites keep moving further and further to the extreme left - Blacks are wondering why voting Democrat is the best choice.

Blacks overall are opposed to defunding the police - they too want to live in safe, crime-free neighborhoods.

It's an expression of *trust*, not of stupidity.As for the TL version:I think you're taking this expression far beyond its function, which is to *express* something. Here's the problem with *expressing* your love as \\"conditional\\". It becomes *inherently* transactional after that expression of conditions. There's nothing less \\"loving\\" that \\"if you really loved me, you'd &lt;something\\". It's borderline abusive, in fact. Imagine your partner saying, \\"I love you, subject to the following conditions, that you don't become a serial killer, that you... X, Y, and Z\\". What would a statement like that *communicate* to you? It's almost an *accusation* that the other person has a chance of becoming a serial killer, and a demand that they *earn* your love. I.e. In a sense... the expression \\"unconditional love\\" is about refraining from expressing conditions, or spending your mental effort on devising conditions. But if all you have to do is avoid *expressing* them to the other person... what happens to your internal emotional landscape? If all you do is keep your mouth shut while internally expressing \\"If they (don't) do this thing, I won't love them any more\\", that's kind of the passive-aggressive equivalent of the above.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"Trump/Vance is clearly the lesser of two evils though.Yea, but only with actual peopleWhat about LGBTQ Mexican babies that he's pulling off ventilators, hmm?","title":"David Frum from The Atlantic: \\"The Vance Warning\\""},{"text":"Phew good to know Kamala now stands a chance of carrying New Jersey.","title":"Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris, calls Trump the most dangerous candidate in my lifetime"},{"text":"I agree that its not necessarily true, but its also not necessarily false.

I remember learning about these in philosophy class during my first year in uni. Youre absolutely right that these distinctions add nuance to the discussion, but still, I think they ultimately reinforce my point that love, even in its various forms, has conditions attached to it. Let me explain.Each type of love you mentionedwhether its romantic (Eros), familial (Storge), friendship-based (Philia), or divine (Agape)exists in specific contexts with expectations that must be met. For instance:* Storge (familial love): Yes, this kind of love often includes deep affection and an instinctual bond, but even here, its not entirely unconditional. A parent may naturally love their child, but if that child engages in severe, harmful actions (abuse, crime, etc.), the emotional connection can be strained or even broken. The emotional attachment might linger, but the quality and intensity of the love would likely shift. In that sense, the continuation of love depends on the relationship staying within certain bounds.\\n* Agape (religious love): In religious contexts, Agape is frequently cited as the purest form of unconditional love. But even here, as I mentioned in my original post, divine love in many traditions still carries conditions. In Christianity, for example, while Gods love is said to be boundless, eternal consequences (hell, punishment) are tied to human actions, beliefs, or failure to meet specific criteria (e.g., faith in God, moral behavior). If love exists alongside judgment or punishment, doesnt that suggest a conditional element? It becomes difficult to reconcile unconditional love with the idea of eternal condemnation for not fulfilling certain requirements.\\n* Eros and Philia (romantic &amp; friendship): These forms of love clearly come with conditionsrespect, trust, shared values. As soon as those conditions are no longer met, the love is often weakened or lost. Romantic relationships and friendships frequently break down when one partner/friend violates important boundaries, demonstrating that the love was sustained by meeting certain emotional or behavioral standards.From what I learned and understand about these concepts, I don't think that the historical and philosophical significance of these different categories of love contradicts my argument. If anything, they highlight how love in all its forms is deeply tied to context, expectations, and conditionswhether its the duty of care in Storge or the moral conditions tied to Agape.You mentioned that my original argument glosses over some of this nuance, but Id argue that this nuance still supports the idea that love, even when divided into categories, is conditional. Each form of love carries with it specific responsibilities, behaviors, or expectations, and when those conditions are no longer met, the nature of the love changes, weakens, or even disappears.So, while we can acknowledge that the Greeks and others throughout history defined love in various ways, I think its fair to ask whether unconditional love, in the sense of *no* conditions whatsoever, truly exists beyond the idealized concept.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"LOL they gave billions to Ukraine, $750 to the American family.

They capped this in 1929, and it's been stuck at 435 ever since. America's population has almost tripled since 1929, and yet the US has not increased the number of representatives AT ALL in nearly 100 years.If you uncapped that number and accounted for all the seats there should be, there IS the matter of deciding how to allot representatives (the ratio of citizens to reps underwent a few variations before the cap). But by most metrics I've seen, the number of reps should at least be over 1000. Hell, if you go by Jefferson's original model of around 30k per district, the House should have over 9000 members in it. It wouldn't KILL gerrymandering, but significantly more and significantly SMALLER districts would make it much harder to effectively disenfranchise a sizeable bloc of voters.","title":"She's a loser, baby.

To me, that still points to love being conditional because its contingent on factors like mutual respect and well-being.I do agree with your last point, though. Just because love might not be enough to sustain a relationship doesnt mean the love itself vanishes. You can still love someone, but realize the relationship doesnt work or that its healthier to move on.

By taking so seriously some form of measurable adjective along with it, you negate its meaning and impact. Of course, it's conditional, but don't concern yourself with such metrics.

Zero. Now it's used as a \\"catch all\\" to avoid any accountability for any issue at all. This has been true since 2015. When Trump is forced out, or in prison, or finishes his 2nd term, what will the DNC do then? They'll have staffers and elected officials who have only known \\"Trump Bad\\" as a strategy. And nothing else. Here's how it works. That Trump is a coin flip away from being POTUS again is treated like an indictment on many working class Americans because the DNC won't take any accountability for their failures and corruption. It has to be the fault of a \\"cult\\" for all the bad things happening. Feelings over facts. However that Trump, a truly horrible POTUS candidate overall, is a coin flips shot from POTUS again is actually a lagging indicator of the total failure of the modern Democratic Party. They are now a corporate driven hypocritical cancel culture identity politics loving set of policy sanctioned terrorists that won't even bother to conceal the truth that they are total warmongers. The one favor that Trump did for for working class America is he was so polarizing, that the leftist cabal dropped it's mask in public while attacking him for almost a full decade now. Now it's clear they see working class America as nothing better than cattle. The current administration and most of the core establishment Democrats in power see the people of Palestine as nothing better than cattle. But why is that so shocking?

Id like to explore a few of your points in more detail:You mentioned that unconditional love means \\"there are no situations or behaviors that would make it stop.\\" But I think that love is inherently tied to the *context* of a relationship, which includes behaviors, situations, and interactions. If someone violates core principles of trust, safety, or respect, it seems natural for love to wane. If love persists despite abuse or harm, is that really love, or something elseperhaps obligation, nostalgia, or even denial?Regarding couples who split up but still love each other \\"on a different level,\\" I would argue that this isnt necessarily *unconditional* love but rather a different form of emotional connection. The fact that theyre no longer in an active relationship shows that some conditionbe it trust, compatibility, or even effortwas no longer met, causing the relationship to change. That shift implies that the *active* love they once shared was conditional on those factors, even if remnants of affection or care remain.You also mention that the nature of the relationship can change, and its possible to still love someone while distancing yourself, like in the case of abuse. However, Id argue that whats often described as love in such cases is better understood as emotional attachment, familiarity, or a sense of responsibilityfeelings that may linger but arent the same as genuine, unconditional love. True love, as I see it, involves trust, respect, and emotional safety, and if those are compromised, I question whether love in the pure sense can persist. If we distance ourselves from someone to avoid harm, isnt that a reflection of the fact that their behavior failed to meet conditions we need for a healthy loving relationship?Even in cases where love seems to continue in a different form (such as after a breakup or with an abusive person), its still tied to certain conditions that shaped the relationship. If those conditions break down, the love may change or take on a different form, but it shows that love wasnt unconditionalit was responsive to circumstances.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"Sorry and no offense but I said I am not voting Trump.","title":"Firefighters union wont endorse in Trump-Harris race"},{"text":"(and reform campaign finance but with you for sure)","title":"She's a loser, baby.

Like it's not a bad thing to expect to be treated with respect, love, honesty, etc. And it's not a bad thing to say, \\"We need to go our seperate ways\\" when those conditions aren't met. The difference is you can still love someone for who they are, or other values, so it isn't transactional. Humans are inherently a social species where the sense of love and belonging are basic human needs. But, you also don't have to be a doormat in order to validate a healthy relationship. In fact, the lack of standards creates a lot of risk of being abused.I think the closest bond that we have to being \\"unconditional\\" is a child. It's heart breaking to see a child crave the validation and love from an abusive or neglectful parent. Because the amount a child will endure prior to giving up on trying to get love from a parent is higher than you would think. Parents can do some pretty horrible shit and the child will still want their love.It's here where I want to change your mind specifically:we often stop loving themWhen someone is an abusive relationship with you, it isn't that you stop loving them. It's that you love yourself enough to end the relationship. I've had past partners who couldn't meet my needs and I couldn't meet theres; it isn't that there isn't a love, it's that there isn't a fit and reciprocity was impossible.I believe that the heart is only capable of endless love, that the heart can't break. What breaks is the ego. It's the feeling you wish things were different. When you can accept things for how they are, then you can still recognize and admit your love for others but realize that love itself isn't the only factor and it isn't enough.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":"-Deporting illegal immigrants, which might increase wages for union membersIt's not \\"might\\".

There isn't necessarily an objective answer to what \\"love\\" is, it's more about figuring out what we really mean when we use the word \\"love.\\"I think there is some extent to which we think of true love as \\"unconditional\\" because otherwise love would be nothing more than liking something *a lot*.  Liking something is definitely conditional, it's just a positive reaction to whatever the thing is or does.  Sometimes we use the word \\"love\\" to express a greater degree of pleasure, like saying that you *love* pizza to indicate that you *really really* *like* pizza.  But we wouldn't think that someone saying \\"I love pizza\\" is using the word \\"love\\" in the same way as when they say \\"I love my Mom\\" or \\"I love my wife.\\"  I think most people would assume that the word \\"love\\" in these latter examples is being used to express not just a *quantitative* difference in how much pleasure you receive from the beloved person, but a *qualitative* difference in the form of affection and attachment they feel towards the beloved person.In my opinion, this *qualitative* difference has to be the *unconditional* nature of these feelings.  This is reflected in how we usually think of the greatest demonstrations of love to be acts of *sacrifice*: \\"I love you so much it hurts\\"; \\"I love you so much that I'm going to spend thousands of dollars on a diamond ring for you\\"; \\"I love you so much that I'm going to take care of you when you're sick\\"; \\"I love you so much that I'm going to watch a stupid romantic comedy with you\\"; and so on.It's also important to note that this form of love can only really exist between two *subjects*.  We don't ever love objects unconditionally, nor do we ever make sacrifices for objects.  We just like them a lot, so long as they are what they are.  There are weird exceptions where we act like we do love an object, such as a person's \\"love\\" for the American flag - but in these cases, what's really happening is that the object has come to *symbolize a greater subject*, such as the flag symbolizing the subject of the American nation.The problem that arises is that this still isn't an *absolutely* unconditioned form of love, otherwise it wouldn't be the case that people could ever fall out of love.  How do we explain people falling out of love?I would say that love is unconditional so long as we assume that the subjectivity of the lover and/or the beloved remain basically the same.  But human subjects don't always stay the same, often they change in fundamental ways - human beings grow, they sometimes become fundamentally different people.  And when those sorts of changes occur on the side of the *subject*, then people might fall out of love.  In a sense, the people that they *were* still love each other and always will - but those people have disappeared, and the new people don't have the same feelings for each other.","title":"CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional"},{"text":" People being underpaid for what a market efficient rate would beAnd the people being paid can more accurately determine the \\"market efficient rate\\" of their labor than the market can?","title":"Firefighters union declines to issue presidential endorsement"},{"text":"The funny thing is - let the states choose is democracy.

It wasn't going to turn around instantly with a new administration. Overall, it's been pretty good given the circumstances. Our allies are in fucking massive wars Which ones? There's Ukraine, but Trump just wants to let Russia completely conquer them, so you probably don't care, unless you consider Russia to be an ally. There's Israel, but they would be involved in a massive war under Trump as well. It might even be more massive since he essentially said Israel should just nuke Gaza and get it over with.Our European allies that Trump constantly insulted and tried to push away aren't in any massive wars. Inflation that I've NEVER seenLike I said, it would have been far worse if Trump had his way and the Fed had acquiesced to his demands to keep interest rates low. This administration has been so bad that it's almost treasonous Trump's picture should be in the dictionary next to the definition of treason. Trying to overthrow the government to keep yourself in power is about as treasonous as it gets.

Despite the claims otherwise, the Biden administration has been incredibly effective in terms of policy on nearly every level - Republican obstruction on issues like immigration have hampered efforts in some areas. But when it comes to inflation and the economy, the US did FAR better than the vast majority of nations with pandemic recovery. As we cried about our inflation crisis, most of our allies (and all of our enemies) were dealing with much worse, in some cases 5-10x worse. International policies are a whole nother issue - no one can control insane near-death tyrants like Putin, but we have managed to coordinate a united front that has worn down Russia and prevented an outright takeover of Ukraine. People forget the chaos of the Trump years. Not just the chaos of the awful Covid response or the months long government shutdowns that destroyed projects, jobs and ruined lives of those who needed critical services that were impacted. Homes were skyrocketing in value and becoming completely unaffordable. The tax reform hurt people in urban areas with the elimination of SALT deductions and baloond our deficit by cutting taxes from the wealthy who already barely paid any. Trump is a vote for chaos and instability. He is a convicted felon, serial sex criminal and represents the extreme values of a small percentage of the population. You may not agree with Harris on everything, but I guarantee you that you will find more common ground with her and the Democrats - they are fueled by grassroots funding and represent many, many interests. You cant say the same about Trump, whose primary backing is from those in the crypto and oil industries who benefit from the chaos he causes.","title":"Firefighters union wont endorse in Trump-Harris race"},{"text":"Trump actually now has a Lebanese Muslim son in law, married to his daughter Tiffany.

That is largely true. It also means men face violence and death at higher rates than women while controlling for numbers of encounters.It's just flat out true that men commit violent crimes at higher rates compared to women. Since they are more likely to be armed and hostile when encountering police, they are more likely to receive a violent response. So it's not simply a \\"perception\\" that men are more likely to be dangerous to police officers.If women were more frequent violent crime perpetuators, than I can assure you the rates of police brutality against women would likely rise accordingly (ie.

If you think Jan 6th was a serious coup, I'm not really sure what to tell you.Most of it was just a mob of brainwashed idiots, and \\"protestors\\". Some of it it included armed individuals who wanted to kill and/or take hostage US legislators, and *somehow* attempt to force Trump to retain power.Had those idiots *succeeded*, what then?You could have had dead members of congress. Interrupted or \\"stopped\\" legal proceedings / formalities. An *actual,* fully unambiguous attempted insurrection, with dozens to hundreds of individuals *executed* over it, active ongoing FBI operations and counterinsurgency to arrest and detain members affiliated with it, and the *erasure* of MAGA / Trump support as an acceptable political position within US society.ie. a massive, massive self-own for Trump et al. And absolutely *no* Trump heading the (R) ticket in 2024.But *not* a successful coup.A successful coup would be if ex. the USMC - *as a bare minimum* - overthrew, or directly supported / backed an overthrow of the US govt and/or its govt institutions, incl the formal transfer of power etc.That isn't going to happen. And no US president could just throw out and ignore the country's electoral process and/or swearing-in formalities et al, even *with* fullthroated partisan support from half of congress, without immediately having a civil war or threat thereof on their hands.Calling Jan 6 a \\"coup\\" is problematic w/r an *actual* discussion of what an *actual* coup would look like. It is 'helpful' w/r attempting to call attention and protest towards what Trump was - very hare-brainedly - attempting to do there, and unhelpful insofar as that has further contributed to the two-mirror-world-americas problem w/r liberal and conservative discussion and consensus (ie on universally agreed upon facts and understanding, or lack thereof). And the perceived and actual problem that liberal-leaning (and centrist) talking heads tend to engage in severe group think, and do *not* tend to bother actually looking up and understanding what words and/or concepts used world history mean.I am of course largely playing devil's advocate here, but this really is, seriously, an actual problem.Americans across the board need to be living in the *same* political + historical reality, not *two* (or more) ones.Jan 6th *was* an attempted insurrection, technically, albeit probably the most dumb-ass and hare-brained one ever attempted in modern history.But it was *not* a *serious*, or even remotely conceivably successful coup attempt, because it was *not* backed by military forces or leadership, it was *not* executed in a country that has degraded or utterly nonexistent \\"democratic\\" ie transfer-of-power norms, and it could not *in any universe* have ever worked.Unless *all* dem politicians across the US all just rolled over, and said \\"hey yeah Trump, actually you *can* just continue to be president, despite not winning the last election. Here, would you like our heads (and/or balls / ovaries) on a platter for your inauguration / whatever dinner too?\\" \\\\[1\\\\]And/or \\"hey, whoops, you interrupted our formal ribbon-cutting / torch passing ceremony that we've used continuously for the last 232 years, guess that means our democratic process is broken and you can just stay president now\\"\\\\[1\\\\] which, given the spines of DC dem congress reps might not be *entirely* out of character, but I digress.It's probably worth noting here that the one \\"benefit\\" of the EC is that it *does* make US presidential electoral outcomes *utterly* unambiguous. And would again directly cause a constitutional crisis ie civil war if you tried to just ignore and throw out those state EC tallies or what have you.You could certainly cheat at elections at the *state* level, but doing so federally is pretty much impossible.So there's one thing for being stuck with that otherwise godawful archaic system of voting and choosing presidential victors, I guess.","title":"These may be the ramblings of a guy who just got into the history of Rome podcast butisnt this how the republic dies?"},{"text":"If youre going to be condescending and elitist youre to lose.

People being underpaid for what a market efficient rate would be doesn't mean they're at the poverty level.Other countries like Germany have shown you can have fairly cooperative labor-capital relations while still having unions. Meanwhile French unions are frequently parasites that resist even the most basic and common sense of reforms. I recall when my family lived there. The company my father was brought on to help with their bankruptcy/restructuring proceeding (he was an accounting background) he had some truly wild stories. One woman had virtually no responsibilities, only had to show up twice a week, and often failed to meet that because of how stressful things were. But she was a key member of the union so so the company didn't even try to discipline her as it would kick up such a storm. Another guy got to know my father and was a good dude. As my father is British and worked in a post-Thatcher UK his experience with union protections was a bit different. Guy told me father not to worry about him in the event he has to get laid off because he'd get unemployment for 34 months at 85% of his pay since he'd been there a certain amount of time. Oh and a disgruntled employee made a bomb threat at the family apartment because that's just normal to do :)\\nI swear I *want* to take the side of unions because I know just how much companies can screw people over and how ineffective regulation can be, assuming it survives at all and doesn't get struck down.

It brings nuclear weapons closer to Russia. The US promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand East of Germany after he let East Germany reunify.The US then put Poland and the Baltic States into NATO. The danger is always putting nuclear weapons near an enemy. It means that one side has a huge advantage over the other. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US first put nuclear weapons in Turkiye. The USSR then responded by putting weapons in Cuba. The US basically told the USSR, withdraw your nuclear weapons from Cuba or we all die. An agreement was made between the USSR and USA that the nukes in both Cuba and Turkiye would be withdrawn.In 2021, the US was in the process of integrating Ukraine. Apart from the killing of ethnic Russians, Putin had a call with Biden. He asked if nuclear weapons would be placed into Ukraine. Biden said no. Later that year, Blinken met with Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister. Blinken basically told Lavrov that the US is going to put nuclear weapons where they want.The Russians has been warning that they would not allow NATO to admit Ukraine all throughout 2021, something they ignored. Ultimately in 2022, they declared their SMO.Ultimately the goal of the US was to station nuclear weapons, gain an advantage, and use Ukraine as a battering ram for regime change to remove Putin for a puppet regime. From there, Russia would be looted by Western companies of its natural resources and ultimately Balkanized.It would be like if the US lost the Cold War and the USSR won. The US breaks up and 10 states become their own nation the way Ukraine has. 40 states make up the US successor the way Russia is the successor of the USSR. Then the USSR promised no expansion eastward. Then they integrated the rest of Europe in the Warsaw Pact.  If the USSR tried to integrate Canada or one of the states of the now broken up US, then station nuclear weapons there, that would be a red line for the former US. Losing what?  The Russia-Ukraine war?  Not really.  And Russia's been attempting to destabilize America for years now.  Or weren't you paying attention when Trump asked them *on live TV* to hack the DNC, and they did so within HOURS of the request?  Or their attempts to hack voting machines?  Or the troll farms on Twitter and FB?Then you nothing about war. The Ukrainians are losing badly right now. They've taken heavy losses and the West is running low on weapons. They are about to lose the Donbass and just lost one of their key fortifications of Ugledar just days ago. A collapse in the Ukrainian front is increasingly likely.  Russia by contrast has rejuvenated its industrial base. ---Russia never tried to do any of that. Clinton and the Democratic Establishment had to make up lies rather than face up to their loss in 2016.Notice that all the investigators against Trump never ended up with him found guilty of collaborating with the Russians.It's because the Democratic Establishment made the cynical decision to play dirty.","title":"Mayorkas warns FEMA doesn't have enough funding to last through hurricane season (Mayorkas is a part of the Biden regime in case you are wondering)"},{"text":"Oh, it isn't rational.

Really, there shouldnt. But they do because fiscal conservatism is a form of conservatism, whereas social conservatism is just conservatism. As a subset of conservatism, fiscal conservatism will always have the cultural bend to it. It is a constitutive element of conservatism and thus also fiscal conservatism. Furthermore, fiscal conservatism is a farce. It is economically cheaper, for example, for the US to have socialized healthcare, but the fiscally conservative viewpoint favors the system that costs substantially more because it maintains a societal hierarchy. Fiscal conservatism preaches something radically different than its agenda. American fiscal conservatism is a reaction against FDRs New Deal programs. What fiscal conservatism is truly against is not government spending, but liberal policies (welfare, civil rights, etc.) that are based on equality, instead of social hierarchy that conservatism seeks to maintain. Therefore, fiscal conservatism is more about maintaining traditional institutions, customs, and values to uphold their position at the top of the social hierarchy.

That I think is an important consideration. I also think it's worth considering that the states where abortion is banned also happen to be the states with low voter turnout, due in part to all of the voting restrictions passed by their leadership. So it still feels disingenuous for these states especially to claim they want the people in their state to decide for themselves the laws, when they make it harder for their people to actually participate. Every state that has actually allowed the people to decide has seen abortion rights strengthen, which I think is a testament to how many people find abortion bans to be immoral.","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"Sadly true.

Your version is simply, Oh the power is vested in the people if enough of them support the same candidate, otherwise you dont get a direct choice for the executive. Indeed, you don't get a direct choice for the single person who becomes chief executive because it's a fundamentally flawed idea to have a direct election for a single office because there's only one seat available. That's the fundamental issue. If the chief executive were 150 persons like a parliament, it would work because these persons could be allocated reflectively to what the people want. But since it's only one person a direct election can't ever offer a reasonable approximate reflexoin of the will of the people.So this is why in a parliamentary system, the one person in that position has to at all times maintain confidence from the parliament which is proportionally elected, and do as the parliament says and is not permitted to make up his own politics and policies.  The popular candidate is the one which gets the most votes.And that is not a reflective executive that reflects the ideology of the people. At that point, one simply gets an executive that reflects say the ideology of 25% of the people at best rather than one that reeflects the consensus the country as a whole can live with. In the end someone has to lose and someone has to winIn a pr?sidential system, which is why it's a fundamentally flawed system.In a parliamentary system, there are degrees of winning, which is why it's not flawed. Winning isn't a binary yes/no situation but it's about how much you win and how big you are as a party. Any other system is just a flawed democracy.No, parliamentary systems lead to a chief executive which reflects the will of the people as a whole rather than simply say the will of the 25% that voted on him.I think your issue might be that you perceive a prime minister in a parliamentary system as having similar powers to a pr?sident in a pr?sidential system which he does not have. He's a manager required to follow the will of the parliament, he cannot make his own decisions and the parliament can force him to do whatever it wants on the threat of revoking confidence and intalling someone else.To illustrate this, I live in a parliamentary system where the current prime minister is not a member of any of the biggest parties. He's a complete outsider who wasn't even active in politics before being appointed but a manager of many different governments organizations. This is how much the prime minister is not a politician, but a manager, it's the executive branch, his job is indeed to execute the will of the parliament.","title":"CMV: A UK like system where we elect a Parliament that elects the head of state is the ideal system of government."},{"text":"?isn't?*Vance's*?argument different from the one you are makingNo. Vance is arguing that each state should choose its own abortion policy based on its own decision-making paradigm.He didn't argue on the basis of state sovereignty or the like but rather on the basis of having different views.First, I don't see the difference in your distinction. Second, you can't read Vance's statements in a vaccuum. The entire point is to provide justification for Trump's actions on abortion.The action being eliminating Roe v. Wade.

His policy position is inconsistent with the state sovereignty.It's why he has no problems with Texas, who doesn't make its policy via voting of the people, but also has no problem with Ohio, who has had a referendum process of the people.

Yet, it is the Zionists who constantly identify Judaism and the Jews with their own colonial project and illegal entity. 17) Hamas rejects the persecution of any human being or the undermining of his or her rights on nationalist, religious or sectarian grounds.

States make laws.States can make laws about anything that isn't Unconstitutional (Incorporation Doctrine etc etc). Abortion is one of those things, since Dobbs at least.I'm not OP, but I believe the point they are making is that on the question of abortion, if it is appropriate to \\"let states decide,\\" then it must not be a major moral imperative that we decide one way or another, right? If the argument is that you're indifferent as to whether abortion happens or not within the borders of the US, so then states should choose, then why should it not be an *individual* right to choose, secured at the federal level? Why should state legislatures be able to ban a procedure - or a mix of procedures ignorantly strung together into legal documents - be able to make specific laws restricting the choices of their state residents and other states decide not to do this? This is why it's inconsistent. At least if you're openly pro-life on a religious moral ground, you're being honest about what you believe: that abortion is killing and noone should be able to kill, whethet they live in California or Alabama. If we take the \\"axiom\\" of killing to be true, then this logic makes sense: abortion should be illegal, it shouldn't be left to the states. But if it's left to the states, then we have some problems, because if the argument is simply \\"states' rights\\" but not \\"abortions are murder and should be banned everywhere\\" then the anti-federal government argument breaks down, as the right to choose an abortion or *not* should just be an individual choice. So we either have a very flawed argument on logical grounds, or the GOP ticket is being very dishonest about their stance and policy goals.

Why?I would argue it's because abortion is (a) extremely complex in the causes and motivations involved, and (b) uniquely controversial and personal. A vast majority of people agree that murder is bad and want to live in a society where it's against the law. That can't be said for abortion though. A majority of people are pro choice or believe that there are a whole range of circumstances where it should be legal.Not to mention, the pro choice and pro life stance are not equivalent in the amount of state control that they assert. Pro life folks essentially want to force people to continue pregnancies they don't want to. But pro choice folks don't want to force people to have abortions they don't want to. Their stance is literally to respect people's unique circumstances and beliefs, whereas the pro life stance is to not respect people's circumstances or beliefs.Edit: I'd also like to add that abortion seems to be the one topic where politicians will hide behind state rights rather than being honest about what they think. If you actually believe abortion is akin to murder, then why claim that you want the states to decide for themselves if murder is bad? I don't hear that with any other issue. For example I don't hear Republicans saying that actual murder/homicide should be decided by the states, because we all know that that would be crazy if we allowed a state to make murder legal. But somehow they're fine with this particular form of murder being decided by the states? It all comes across as very disingenuous.","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"\\"I've been thinking about moving into a retirement community in Florida, too, Donnie, and I heard you might be headed to a particularly notorious facility- you want some recommendations?\\"","title":"Biden calls climate change deniers brain dead, warns storms will get worse"},{"text":"Probably the better advice is know the charity/non-profit you are giving to.

The mom said she wished she had another check with her so she could make it out to one of the local churches instead.  The only other thing the Red Cross did while present was try to tell the church how to distribute the stuff that was donated.  The amount of stuff donated was enough for at least 5 times the number of people affected.  So when one of the families came in we loaded them up.  The Red Cross wanted us to only give them one pack of diapers.  We had cases upon cases.

What a false equivalence, lol.Compare against the amount of time spent talking about issues for women, minorities, immigrants, etc.Because issues for those groups are currently much more threatening at the moment compared to men's issues (ie. lack of abortion rights can actually lead to women dying). No wonder Democrats spend more time talking about them than men's issues (it's not like there's an infinite amount of time during speeches or campaign events).And I literally gave an example of a part of Harris's policy platform that would help solve a man-specific problem: removing degree requirements for federal jobs. You can say that men have other problems apart from that too, **but not even women are getting every single one of their needs addressed by the Democratic party platform either** (every demographic needs to realize that the Dems are a big tent party, so they need to cater to a wide range of needs at once).Affirmative action is one -- at one time important and good policy, but one that outlived its usefulness and is only now dying a slow death because right-wing justices are throwing it out.It's funny you mention affirmative action; which arguably is also hurting white women and Asian-American women right now just as much as it's hurting men overall (in terms of AA for college admissions). In fact, there is evidence that affirmative action is actually helping men in certain situations, because colleges have started catching on to the fact that there are fewer male students, and they are trying to make up for it.Do you have evidence of policies enacted by Democrats specifically targeted to address men's issues? Or even an elected Democrat so much as paying lip service to them?Yes, it's literally in Kamala Harris's platform; lmao. Pro-union policies benefit men more because more men are union members than women. Removing degree requirements for federal jobs benefits men more because men are graduating from college less nowadays.I'm not sure it's fair to hand wave away Democratic involvement with broader social movements. Political parties choose with their messaging which issues to prioritize or deprioritize.But grassroots organizations that help women would have still existed even regardless of Democratic messaging. That's because women are taking the initiative at the grassroots level to help each other. Why is it too much to expect men to do the same thing, instead of just raging against a political party?I'm not sure it's fair to link all feminist organizations with the Dem party, just because some Democrats are members in them (they still don't represent the party's platform as a whole; only one very specific component of it).And to be fair to Democrats, women's issues have been pretty dire lately, what with Roe V. Wade being overturned. I'd say they are giving that life-threatening issue the focus it deserves with their messaging.Democrats are losing male voters hand over fist because they make next to zero attempt to so much as acknowledge issues faced by menThey will acknowledge the issues that they actually have concrete policy solutions for (such as the federal jobs thing and pro-union policies that tend to more greatly benefit men).

Elected judges have contributors and a constituency to whom they are beholden.  Last time I had traffic court there was a \\"court fee\\" I was told funds the judges' retirement funds or such. If considering privatizing such a function you have to consider more thoroughly the unintended creation of perverse profit motives. For example, if the court is allowed to charge per hour, is their incentive to swift justice or to drag out every case as long as possible?  If not paid enough, are they incentivized to rush to justice as quickly as possible regardless of time needed to gather all the facts and properly deliberate? Do you want to be at the mercy of a court whose profit motive is stronger than their need to protect your personal rights?I can easily imagine privatizing roads. At least the main highways and thoroughfares. Companies would want to own the big ones with lots of customers.  However, roads suffer the same 'last mile' problem that all utilities, like water, telecom, internet, gas, electric, sewer, etc..... do.  That is, on the side streets and back roads, there aren't enough customers to make any level of investment in such infrastructure profitable. I can dig a well, and a septic tank. I can get satellite TV. I can heat with wood. Really far out in the boonies, I might even have my own solar panels.  But, never could I ever build my own road. Even if it was only dirt and gravel, it takes a lot of heavy equipment to build and maintain one through all seasons. And I'd need easements on all my neighbors' lands between me and the intersection with the corporate roads. That is, if the corporate road would allow mine to connect to theirs, at all. Customers might try to use my road to bypass corporate road tolls, thus making me a de facto competitor for their business. Not gonna happen.The roads and the post office are tightly coupled in the US Constitution, which gave congress the power to create post offices and post roads.  Can't speak to history or details here, but I expect there are many provisions of various US codes and laws that establish the Post Office as the only legal provider of some services. For example, legal notices having to be delivered by Registered Mail.  Which is why, even with many, many competitors in the shipping industry, the Post Office persists.  Not to mention, they solve the 'last mile' problem for postal delivery very well. So, here too, I can't imagine a for profit company stepping up to build rural mail delivery services, ever. So, while I am, in general, a believer in less government and fewer laws, I see a need for government where privatization would erode my freedoms and standards of living far more than the government does.","title":"Some questions from non-libertarian."},{"text":"Jesus said to forgive I'm pretty sure.","title":"Biden administration can move forward with student loan forgiveness, federal judge rules"},{"text":"His personal values are irrelevant to the statement itself.WTF do you mean his personal values are irrelevant?

I gave him the benefit of the doubt in 2016-2020 that despite his mean rhetoric, he would make the right decisions for this country. However, I dislike Trump because I think his leadership style is unstable and he does not set himself as a good role model for the country. From doubting efficacy of masks to nodding to anti-vaxxers about their opposition to the COVID vaccine (which HE and his ADMINISTRATION put funding behind to supercharge their development; I don't think Trump gets enough credit for this!) to calling North Korea's leader a \\"smart cookie,\\" I find it difficult to predict what he wants to do next. Additionally, I don't want someone who has a bad history of allegedly sexually assaulting many women to be in charge of a nuclear arsenal.   \\nMoreover, my opposition to Trump stems from how I think that had he gotten a 2nd term, life would have been more difficult. It's not that Biden directly created inflation (I study economics, so that's not possible) or that Trump held off on the Russia-Ukraine war from happening, but that circumstances post-COVID have been tough everywhere. It would be cool if the U.S. President had that much influence, but the world is a big place and that cannot be the case. Academics (whom I trust, because it seems they are the best that we have) have been saying his economic policies would make the affordability crisis worse, as tariffs would raise food prices for working families.   \\nFor me, my vote is more based on character than policy in this election, as today's turbulent world needs level-headed leaders.

The problem was that all the data to that point was that a disastrously high % of the electorate was going to break with Biden or be de-energized enough to not turn out, and we were heading for a slaughter.I think it spoke very highly of Stewart's integrity to call it like it was, to cover the plain facts of the matter while there was still time to change course, and not just put his head in the sand and pretend it was going to magically turn around on its own. A few other intellectually honest pundits addressed it head-on as well. To me, this particularly stance has proven to be an excellent barometer of intellectual honesty of a pundit and media source - when you are willing to acknowledge an unpleasant truth that ostensibly goes against your own interests, rather than echo-chambering blind support. I was pleased that several of my media sources provided excellent, candid insight, which both placed Stewart in good company for me, and convinced me that he was 100% in the right to call it out.If you're interested in hearing a well reasoned discussion of why Biden absolutely needed to be replaced on the presidential ticket, I'd encourage you to listen to Ezra Klein show from 02/16/24, \\"Democrats Have a Better Option Than Biden.\\" Note this was well before it was a popular or accepted position in the party, and if you don't know him Klein is definitely left of center, but nuanced and honest. A couple of good excerpts, \\"We had to wait till this year  till now, really  to see Biden even begin to show what hed be like on the campaign trail. And what I think were seeing is that he is not up for this. He is not the campaigner he was, even five years ago. Thats not insider reporting on my part. Go watch a speech he gave in Pennsylvania, kicking off his campaign in 2019. And then go watch the speech he gave last month, in Valley Forge, kicking off his election campaign. No comparison here. Both speeches are on YouTube, and you can see it. The way he moves, the energy in his voice. The Democrats denying decline are only fooling themselves.\\"\\"I think one reason Democrats react so defensively to critiques of Biden is theyve come to a kind of fatalism. They believe it is too late to do anything else. And if it is too late to do anything else, then to talk about Bidens age is to contribute to Donald Trumps victory.But thats absurd.It is February. Fatalism this far before the election is ridiculous. Yeah, its too late to throw this to primaries. But its not too late to do something.So then what? Step one, unfortunately, is convincing Biden that he should not run again. That he does not want to risk being Ruth Bader Ginsburg  a heroic, brilliant public servant who caused the outcome she feared most because she didnt retire early enough.\\"Another good piece on the topic of Biden's age and electoral vulnerability was the Atlantic's \\"It's Not Just That Biden Is Old\\" from 03/06/2024. The Atlantic piece was scathing, saying, \\"By running again - despite his age, despite his low approval ratings, despite his poor showing in the polls against trump - Biden could be engaging in one of the most selfish, hubristic, and potentially destructive acts ever undertaken by an American president. If he winds up losing, that's all anyone will remember him for. Bill Maher has said Biden could go down as the 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the presidency.' Or of democracy.\\"Stewart's material on Biden was a much punchier, distilled version of these takes. I prefer the nuance of Klein's piece, giving far more credit where due to Biden while also acknowledging the reality of the situation. But that's ultimately not Stewart's format nor audience. For someone in general alignment with my positions, I'm glad he's principled enough to take the unpopular stand along with some of the other voices rather than just feeding soothing lies that it'll be ok and that this sand feels great to put one's head in.","title":"Republican Liz Cheney to join Kamala Harris at Wisconsin campaign stop"},{"text":"Says the guy whose brother once referred to them both as 'Illegal Immigrants' during Zip2s initial launch phase.","title":"Fact-check: Elon Musk claims Biden-Harris fast-tracking illegal immigrants to vote"},{"text":"Digging into someone's post history over an obvious joke is one of the more pathetic things you can do on this website.","title":"Boris Johnson says Joe Biden told him his family origins were not really Irish at all"},{"text":"Then why are they okay with allowing it in CA, but not their state?

And while I'm not directly blaming the party, the lack of any actual policy proposals to try to deal with men's issues is glaring. Compare against the amount of time spent talking about issues for women, minorities, immigrants, etc.I get that not all outcomes are looking rosy for men right now, but do you have evidence that ties these suboptimal results to actual policies the Democrats have enacted in the past?Affirmative action is one -- at one time important and good policy, but one that outlived its usefulness and is only now dying a slow death because right-wing justices are throwing it out.Do you have evidence of policies enacted by Democrats specifically targeted to address men's issues? Or even an elected Democrat so much as paying lip service to them?The most likely explanation for the imbalance in college degrees is a considerable amount of self-selectionI agree on this rather firmly, but the exact same argument is somehow not valid for gender pay gap, college admissions before the reversal in enrollment, women in STEM, etc -- all of which Democrats have either enacted legislation against or at a minimum advocated for as part of their overall policy.it's difficult to advance legislation when no one is sure about the true root cause of the problem at the moment (ie. is it a neurological difference between men and women, is it due to socialization...etc).Again I agree, which is why I wish Democrats would be advocating for research into what's driving the problem so it can be addressed.I think you're conflating the Dem party with feminist movements or initiatives in general. Most mentorship and advocacy programs for women are run at the grassroots level, including programs to get more women into particular fields. So, this isn't necessarily due to legislation that a political party can push, and certainly not as a result of any particular law or policy the Dems have enacted.I'm not sure it's fair to hand wave away Democratic involvement with broader social movements. Political parties choose with their messaging which issues to prioritize or deprioritize. Literally *all* of the people running those grassroots organizations are Democrats, the same way that nearly all of the gun rights groups are Republicans. Additionally, there is a lot of federal and state funding that goes to standing up these grassroots organizations.Democrats are losing male voters hand over fist because they make next to zero attempt to so much as acknowledge issues faced by men, and instead turn every discussion into an argument about how other groups are impacted even more.

Meaning, for different issues the buck stops in different places.  Which issues fall into which bucket is an open question and things can move and shift around as laws and judgements are passed.  To say that a certain issue should be left up to the states is not to say that everyone should just do whatever they want at all.  Think of a less fraught issue: highway speeds.  States get to determine how fast you can drive on highways in their states and the federal government can't come in and say otherwise.  This makes sense, since highway conditions are different from state to state.  A state like north Dakota might want to have high maximum speeds, since it is a rural state with less traffic and open roads across most of it, while a state like new jersey would probably need slower maximum speeds due to more dense traffic.  Vance is making the point that abortion is an issue best left to individual states, since the people in those states have different needs and different wishes for whether and how to restrict abortion.

No.  It wasn't until Trump lost that he was cornered.  He was going everywhere else, trying to fortify his position, but once Trump lost, he had no choice.

The previous master contract negotiated in 2018 specifies base pay of $20 for new employees, ranging up to $39 for workers with six or more years experience. The union said it is seeking better than a $5-per-hour pay hike per year over the life of the contract.The union also pointed out that members must work six years to reach the top wage tier.USMX also overlooks the fact that two-thirds of our members are constantly on call, with no guaranteed employment if no ships are being worked. Our members qualify for benefits only based on the hours they worked the previous year, making them vulnerable if theres a downturn in work. Despite this, there is no incentive within the progression system for hard-working members to advance faster.

It's often called the \\"death penalty.\\" They balance the right to life against the state's interest in justice in certain situations and the state determined that on the balance, killing a human being is legal. Similarly, we can balance bodily autonomy and the state's interest in protecting unborn children. For rape, where the person asserting bodily autonomy had no affirmative part in creating the unborn child, the people may say that bodily autonomy should trump the state's interest in protecting the unborn child, while if the person asserting bodily autonomy played an affirmative role in creating the unborn child (by engaging in sexual activity known to result in pregnancy), the people may determine that the state's interest is, on the balance, stronger than the person's claim of bodily autonomy. With incest (in particular, where it wasn't a incest/rape situation) allowing abortion can be justified on a public policy ground given the observable genetic concerns. To make it simple - someone, either the mother or the child, is going to be put in a shit situation. The people can decide (a) if the mother was forced into that situation, then the child will be the one in the shit situation and (b) if the mother created the situation, then the shit situation will be on her and not on the child.","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"Yes thats what both sides say about the other.

Isn't this just a roundabout way of saying indefinitely? Most people don't respond to oppression by forming a deep affection for their oppressor. It seems like even the Chinese state recognises this, given their decision to try and forcibly dissolve Uyghur culture and ethnic identity. Or is that what you mean? That the oppression only needs to last until the genocide is complete?The Han Chinese living in Singapore and the USA don't want to be a part of China while the Han Chinese living in Xinjiang want to be a part of China. I'm sure there are few Han people in the US who would prefer to be part of China. If most did, would that justify a Chinese occupation of the USA?If China today stops oppressing Uyghurs, does that mean that Xinjiang doesn't deserve independence?It certainly impacts the conversation. Two of the most generally accepted criteria legitimising secession by a region are the existence of real, serious grievances with the existing state and  a lack of alternative means of redress. If the Chinese state weren't oppressive, these rationales would be less compelling.Why do you think China will always oppress Uyghurs while you think that Uyghurs won't oppress Han Chinese?I don't think the Chinese state must oppress the Uyghurs. I stated that this seems to be a consequence of your reasoning, not mine. But the reality is that the Chinese state is systematically oppressing the Uyghurs right now. It shows no signs of changing that policy and it's goal seems to be the end of the Uyghurs as a coherent, meaningful group. The Chinese government doesn't have to do any of this. It chooses to do so.It seems to me that Han people in a newly independent Xinjiang would probably be far more secure than the Uyghurs are in China. The Uyghurs are a small, poor group on the periphery of a China. The Han in Xinjiang would be a large, relatively wealthy minority, and be a majority in some areas. They would also, likely, enjoy support and security assurances from China, a guarantor with vastly more political and military power than Xinjiang could muster.Why also not take the gamble that China will become less authoritarian? Chinese policies change drastically when every new leader comes to power.Even ignoring the fact that a dramatic liberalisation of China seems pretty unlikely in the near future, that wouldn't eliminate a potential case for an independent Xinjiang, only the urgency for it. In any case, an oppressed people shouldn't have suffer mistreatment while they wait for the moral character of their oppressors to improve enough that they're no longer brutalized.","title":"CMV: East Turkistan/Uyghuristan/Xinjiang shouldnt be independent from China"},{"text":"yes, once this is over we have to make it a LOT harder for it to happen again. this shit needs to get stomped out the first time before it's allowed to snowball into a spectacle like trump","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Georgia Boost as 120,000 New Voters Sign Up"},{"text":"From what I hear, a lot of close in Cherokee and Forsyth County are leaving Blue; its the more exurban areas that are still blood red.

Although the SAVE Plans shortened time to loan forgiveness is on hold while the cases continue, we will keep fighting for those provisions and keep you updated with new developments that impact you. ...

The accounts they have heard match those reported in an investigation by the newspaper Haaretz, which claimed that the chief of staffs office was aware of the practice.The senior ranks know about it, one source said to have taken part in finding civilians to serve as human shields told the paper. Our lives are more important than their lives, Haaretz quoted commanders telling their soldiers.The practice is said to be so routine that Israeli soldiers have a name for the human shields, who are referred to as shawish C informal slang for a low-ranking soldier C and the process was described by several witnesses.Palestinian civilians, mostly young men, are picked up by Israeli soldiers, dressed in Israeli army uniforms, then sent into tunnels and damaged houses ahead of Israeli forces, soldiers told Haaretz and Breaking the Silence.And don't forget that time when a Palestinian was strapped to the hood of an IDF vehicle as they crossed a combat zone. I guess the IDF was counting on Palestinians not being willing to shoot their own.

In other words: they are an organization the provides  in effect  free healthcare. Recently the HHS has celebrated a milestone for the organization:[New Data Show Highest Number of Health Center Patients in Nearly 60 Year History of the Program](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/05/new-data-show-highest-number-health-center-patients-nearly-60-year-history-program.html)HRSA-funded health centers are required to treat all patients regardless of ability to pay, and in 2023 more than 90 percent of health center patients had incomes less than 200 percent of the 2023 Federal Poverty Guidelines. Health centers are now serving one in eight children across the country, more than 9.7 million patients in rural areas, over 6.4 million patients who live in or near public housing, and over 1.4 million people experiencing homelessness. Health centers have also expanded their preventive services, screening hundreds of thousands more people for cancer and infectious diseases and caring for patients with substance use disorders.The Biden-Harris Administration has been quietly, but *aggressively*, expanding this organization over the last couple of years because they likely believe this organization offers a path towards free healthcare in the US.

The idea that in the US the states have a wide-reaching power to self-govern independently of the federal government is baked into the structure of the US government. Vance's argument in this particular case is that states are diverse and legislation at the state level is more practical than legislation at the federal level. That argument has been used disingenuously many times to support bad policies, but the specific logical argument you are trying to use against it doesn't really hold up.When there is a controversial policy, it's fairly common for some percentage of the states to pass legislation supporting the policy and for the rest to stay in opposition. If I think that a state should be able to get rid of their state sales taxes, that does not automatically mean that I think every individual should have the right to avoid sales taxes even if their state decides to collect them. The analogy you make to individual choice is similar, but it's still just an analogous situation rather than a direct result of supporting the general concept of different states having different laws.","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"Oh my goodness!

The core premise of the state being the political actor harkens back to anti-federalism. Their view wasn't about collective vs. individual, but about the primacy of the state as a political being. You do have to zoom out from history.The origin of the states as political units goes back to a proprietary charter between, a company, or a dude, and the king of england. The deal is the proprietor gets to self-govern in exchange for a split of the spoils between the king and the proprietor. So by the 1750s, or so, the first call for the Albany Congress, the states just wanted parliament to fuck off. Their core argument is that Parliament legislating against the colonies violated the English constitution. Even through the second continental congress's olive branch petition, the colonies wanted their own parliament and the King responded by calling them rebels, so they felt forced to enter into the articles of confederation.The premise of the articles of confederation were autonomous states needed collective action. After the war, Shay's rebellion made it clear that a loose collection of states wouldn't meet collective goals, so that's why, with the bill of rights, the states ratified the US constitution.I get that you were trying to tease out the logical structure of the relationship between the feds and states, and apply it to individuals and the states, but those premises aren't analogous to the anti federalist. They would reject the truthfulness of the premises. Basically, people think the Ron Pauls of the world want \\"limited government\\" but he only means limited federal government; he's basically fine with intrusive state government.","title":"CMV: JD Vances logic on abortion policy during the 10/2/2024 VP debate leads to a pro-choice conclusion."},{"text":"Thats not what theyve said previously.

Her campaign website is called KateBarrCantWin.com.Her goal, she says, is to bring attention to the issue of gerrymandering, the process of manipulating electoral boundaries to favour a particular party, candidate or demographic.Republican gerrymandering in North Carolina, she says, has left many voters disenfranchised, because they know their vote won't make a difference. In essence, she says, politicians are choosing their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians. \\"I really believe that people need to see on-the-ground experiences related to gerrymandering,\\" she said. \\"Voters are supposed to be the ones in charge. That's what it means for us to have a democracy. And I would like us to have a representative democracy.\\"...Shawn J. Donahue, a political scientist who studies gerrymandering and voter rights at the University of Buffalo, says this has long been a political issue in the U.S. because, in most states, legislatures are responsible for drawing electoral boundaries. That's different than in many other democracies around the world, where non-partisan, third-party organizations do this work. In Canada, for example, independent commissions routinely evaluate election boundaries at both the provincial and federal level.But when the party in power is drawing the map, Donahue says it's a recipe for trouble....Barr stands out among her colleagues by making gerrymandering the focal point of her run. \\"I'm the only one who's running explicitly as someone who can't win,\\" she said. \\"I'm having a pretty good time doing it, just to tell the truth. I don't know that every candidate would say that, but it's really fun.\\"And despite what her sweatshirt says, she doesn't feel like a loser at all. \\"One of my neighbour's daughters was asking her mom why I was running and saying I couldn't win. She thought it was, like, that I didn't believe in myself or I wasn't trying hard. And so her mom taught her about gerrymandering,\\" she said.The fifth-grader was so horrified by what she learned that Barr says she spent weeks getting people to sign her petition calling for an end to gerrymandering.\\"And, like, that's the mission, right?\\" Barr said. \\"Honestly, I have already won.\\"I love that this person is putting in the work to draw greater attention to this issue, and might even have some fun along the way. Gerrymandering is such a corrosive influence on the electoral system, and should be abolished. Following the lead of other countries that have more or less solved this problem would be a good start: have nonpartisan panels regularly evaluate boundaries based on a number of principles, and redraw when necessary.It would be hilarious and fitting if this candidate ended up winning in the end though.","title":"She's a loser, baby.

Where personal choices have significant effects on everyone else, the granularity of your policies must be limited. This is arguably the case for things like substance control. Effective precautions will often require a general rule with some geographic reach, or else it can simply be circumvented.

Which is super lame.","title":"Biden administration can move forward with student loan forgiveness, for now"},{"text":"Today [October 1st], Vice President Harris announced a series of actions by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Defense (DOD), and Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) to increase pathways for medical debt relief, to address illegal actions by third-party debt collectors, and to improve our understanding of the impacts of medical debt.\\n \\nGetting sick or taking care of loved ones should not create financial hardship for families. Yet, more than 100 million Americans struggle with medical debt. Over 40 million Americans 1 in 5 adults  owe around $88 billion in medical debt in collections, making it the largest source of debt in collectionsmore than credit cards, utilities, and auto loans.That is unacceptable to President Biden and Vice President Harris. Vice President Harris has repeatedly highlighted the negative impacts of medical debt, noting that medical debt can stand in the way of someones dream to own a car, home, or small businesses. In June, Vice President Harris announced the CFPBs proposed rule to remove medical debt from the consumer credit reports of more than 15 million Americans and called on states to take action to tackle medical debt. Following the Vice Presidents call to action, HHS approved North Carolinas innovative program to encourage hospitals to relieve medical debt and relieve approximately $4 billion in medical debt for nearly 2 million working families in North Carolina. Further, American Rescue Plan funds are being leveraged to eliminate an estimated $7 billion in medical debt for up to nearly 3 million Americans by the end of 2026.  \\n...  \\nTo continue addressing the burden of medical debt, today the Vice President is announcing the following actions:\\n \\n**Holding Third-Party Debt Collectors Accountable**\\n \\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released an Advisory Opinion on improper medical debt collections. The Advisory Opinion clarifies the responsibilities of debt collectors to confirm that debts are accurate, valid, and substantiated before engaging in collection actions. Further, the CFPB has stated that they will ensure fairness and increase transparency by cracking down on debt collectors that collect on debt that is not owed by patients.\\n \\nCFPB also released a Consumer Advisory that explains to consumers what actions they can take when they suspect that they have been improperly billed or if they have had improper or illegal collection actions taken against them. The Consumer Advisory suggests actions such as: following-up with their provider if a bill looks incorrect, asking their provider for an itemized bill, negotiating bills if the price appears wrong, reporting to the CFPB if they have been improperly billed, and pursuing legal action if appropriate.\\n \\n**Increasing Pathways to Reduced Medical Bills**\\n \\nThe Department of Defense has proposed a rule aimed at providing financial relief for civilians receiving medical care at military medical treatment facilities (MTFs).  If finalized as proposed, this rule would implement fee reductions through a sliding scale discount program as well as catastrophic cap waivers.  Through these measures, the DoD aims to significantly reduce the financial burden on patients while maintaining high-quality care and expanding the range of complex trauma cases that Department healthcare providers may encounter in both deployed and humanitarian settings.\\n \\n**Providing Transparency on Tax-Exempt Hospital Debt Collection Practices**\\n \\nCFPB released a blog post highlighting billing issues that occur when non-profit hospitals fail to provide financial assistance. Under the law, tax-exempt hospitals are required to offer financial assistance to help offset health care costs for low-income patients. However, the CFPB has previously found evidence that tax-exempt hospitals often bill and initiate collections against patients who have received or are eligible for financial assistance. Todays blog post shines a light on bills wrongfully ending up in collections.\\n \\n**Better Understanding the Impact of Medical Debt on Seniors**\\n \\nHHS is collecting evidence and data to inform future actions to address the burden of medical debt. For the first time, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services added new questions on medical debt to their Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The MCBS is an annual survey of people covered by Medicare to better understand their health care needs. These new questions will provide essential background on levels of medical debt carried by seniors and those with disabilities and the impacts of these debts on their day-to-day lives. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality is also adding additional questions to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, one of the largest sources of data on health care in the United States, to capture more granular information on medical debt. Questions will capture information on the amount of medical debt, ability to pay unexpected medical bills, financial sacrifices that individuals may have had to make due to their health or treatment, and other aspects of medical debt and financial well-being. CFPB also recently spotlighted the legal challenges facing surviving spouses who are pursued for their spouses medical debt, providing insights into the ways debt collectors take advantage of this vulnerable population.Statement from Vice President Harris:No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency. That is why I have worked to cancel hundreds of millions in medical debt to date C part of our Administrations overall plan to forgive $7 billion by 2026 C and make it so medical debt will soon no longer be included in your credit score, said Vice President Harris. As someone who has spent my entire career fighting to protect consumers, I am proud to announce todays new actions to build on our work to reduce the burden of medical debt by increasing pathways for relief and cracking down on predatory debt collection tactics.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Reduce Medical Debt and Address Illegal Medical Debt Collection Practices"},{"text":"Thank you for your very kind comments and concern.My wife and I were in France during the hurricane (we had no idea it would be that bad before we left).

Its much simpler, its because college education increases the likelihood of critical thinking. It's not a guarantee, but it's something that encourages it.

Just graduating college meant that you were much less likely to vote Democratic. If all voters in the 2020 election were college graduates, with a 24 point margin, due to the way the house is set, all house seats that were not R+24 or higher would have gone to the Democrats. That'd result in a 400+ Democratic majority in the house, and 400+ Electoral votes, along with eventually a 60/40 senate.Republicans are against college education, because it's bad for them electorally.

I think it's good to have debates and back and forth about that. The caveat is, it must be in good faith. As it is now, the corporations have infiltrated politics in such a way that some policies/talking points are advertised as being good for people, but through misleading stats and dishonest framing, it's actually truly bad for people.Then for social.

However, so far it has failed to do so, with Tusk?admitting?that differences within the coalition over how far to liberalise the law may prevent them from doing so at all.After todays verdict was delivered, one of those acquitted, Czerederecka, said that, in my opinion, this trial should not have taken place, because we, the taxpayers, will all pay for it, reports news website Onet.Lempart welcomed the verdict. But she also criticised the current authorities for not only failing to deliver on their promise to soften the abortion law, but also for continuing to obsessively pursue abortion activists who she said are still interrogated by the police once a week.","title":"Leaders of Polish abortion protests acquitted of causing epidemiological threat during pandemic"},{"text":"!ping POLANDA court has acquitted three of the leaders of the mass protests against Polands near-total abortion ban of endangering public health by organising the demonstrations during the height of the Covid pandemic. If found guilty, they could have faced prison terms of up to eight years.Additionally, one of the leaders,?Marta Lampart?C the main leader of Womens Strike (Strajk Kobiet), which organised the protests C was also acquitted on two further charges of insulting a police officer and of publicly praising the crime of vandalising churches.Lampart was on trial alongside her colleagues Klementyna Suchanow and Agnieszka Czerederecka.?Prosecutors accused them?of creating an epidemiological threat by organising a?series of protests?in October, November and December 2020.Those came in response to a?ruling by the constitutional court on 22 October?that introduced the near-total ban on abortion. They were the largest protests in Polands post-communist history, with hundreds of thousands of people coming out onto the streets.They also came amid some of the worst moments in the Covid pandemic, with Poland recording the?EUs highest excess death rate?in 2020. The protests took place despite strict lockdown measures at the time banning gatherings.However, in a ruling issued today, a Warsaw court found that, while there is no doubt that the accused were the faces of these gatherings, prosecutors had not documented and proved the causal relationship between the organisation of the protests and the threat to life or health.The court noted that the protests were mass, spontaneous events. Moreover, the accused called on people participating in the gatherings to keep their distance and wear masks that limited the transmission of the virus, said judge Tomasz Julian Grochowicz, quoted by the?*Gazeta Wyborcza*?daily.In fact, said the judge, the polices actions during the protests, such as kettling protesters into small areas, were much more likely to have created a threat of transmitting the virus.Regarding Lemparts?charge of insulting police?by spitting at them, the court found it hard to accept an officers testimony that they had heard Lempart spit while wearing a mask amid loud mass protests.","title":"Leaders of Polish abortion protests acquitted of causing epidemiological threat during pandemic"},{"text":"Americans: \\"Yea that's bad but that won't affect me.

Good news for Democrats?"},{"text":"Some key points below:The equivalence that Vance draws between social-media moderation and Trump trying to stage a coup is ridiculous, but revealing in terms of how conservatives have come to conceive of free speech: They believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored. Walz is simply wrong about the Supreme Court standard for what kind of speech can be outlawed, but the invocation of that archaic test does illustrate how safety can become an excuse for state censorship. It just so happens that social-media moderation is not state censorship, because social media is not the government....The Schenk standard, however, was repealed in Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, a case involving Clarence Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted under a state law that prohibited advocating political change through terrorism. The Supreme Courtthen a liberal court, something that had not existed before and has not sinceoverturned his conviction, ruling that that government can only bar speech advocating imminent lawless action that is likely to incite or produce such action. Stone writes that the Court was trying to tie its own hands to prevent the government from acting under the spell of fear and hysteria that can be brought on by wartime. Its a much better standard than the kind that gets you imprisoned for handing out pamphlets. (Vance, a Yale Law graduate, is probably aware that Trumps speech working up a mob that went on to ransack the Capitol and try to hang Pence could meet that much higher standard, known as the Brandenburg test.)But the fact that the government can put you in prison points to how matters of free speech are different for social-media companies. Social-media companies cant put you in prison, because they are not the government. They can ban users for not adhering to their standards, but this in itself is a form of speech: Just as the right-wing website Breitbart does not have to publish my writing, social-media companies do not have to publish the content of users who violate their rules. Social-media moderation is not state censorship, and it should not be treated as such. Conservatives understand this when the moderation decisions land in their favor, which is why the union-busting billionaire Elon Musks favoritism toward conservative speech and attempts to silence his critics on the social-media platform X have not drawn the attention of the Republican majority in Congress. Nor should theyhe owns the place; he can do what he wants with it. The point is that conservatives fully get the distinction when they want to.Vances implicit position is that conservatives have a state-enforced right to the use of private platforms; that the state can and should force private companies to publish speech that those companies disagree with, as long as that speech is right-wing. Such a policy really would be a form of censorship.Immediately after Trumps disastrous September debate, conservatives, including Trump himself, began calling for ABC News to lose its broadcast license for fact-checking Trumps lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. These threats of state retaliation against media outletsor anyone who speaks out against Trumpillustrate that what conservatives mean when they talk about free speech is a legal right to use private platforms as venues for right-wing propaganda, whether or not those platforms wish to be used that way. That is a form of censorship far more authoritarian than private social-media platforms deciding they dont want to carry rants about COVID shots putting microchips in your blood that can receive signals from alien invaders.Clearly for today's conservatives, what's good for the goose is not good for the gander. In a just society though, one cannot have it both ways and yet this is exactly what conservatives are advocating for in public forums. There must be some form of cognitive dissonance here, but it doesn't seem to be enough to cause people to rethink their positions yet.","title":"What Conservatives Mean by Freedom of Speech | They believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored"},{"text":"They probably have a Private Student Loan arm where they make the bulk of their money.

Shooting people who are clearly surrendering is a war crime.","title":"US Doctors Tell Biden, Harris They 'Witnessed Crimes Beyond Comprehension' in Gaza | \\"A cease-fire must be imposed on the warring parties by withholding military support for Israel and supporting an international arms embargo on Israel and all Palestinian armed groups.\\""},{"text":"Considering we had the greatest slime ball as pres, yes?","title":"JD Vance is the handpicked leader of the anti-democracy movement in the US"},{"text":"Site's blocked on my workplace Internet connection, any specific references to the SAVE plan?","title":"Biden administration can move forward with student loan forgiveness, for now"},{"text":"Facts dont matter to the inbred maggots.

I get that not all outcomes are looking rosy for men right now, but do you have evidence that ties these suboptimal results to actual policies the Democrats have enacted in the past?This isn't to mention the myriad other ways the deck has now been stacked in favor of women, resulting in massive imbalances in stuff like college degrees and general educational outcomes in K12The most likely explanation for the imbalance in college degrees is a considerable amount of self-selection, where men are more likely to choose alternate paths like trade school instead (which can often lead to more lucrative careers compared to the average college graduate).As for K12 education, I agree that this seems more serious. However, there is no real consensus yet on what exactly the reason for this is. The Dems are a political party that need to advance concrete legislation, and it's difficult to advance legislation when no one is sure about the true root cause of the problem at the moment (ie. is it a neurological difference between men and women, is it due to socialization...etc).I'm waiting for the day when the Democratic Party starts to support initiatives to get more men into teaching for example.I think you're conflating the Dem party with feminist movements or initiatives in general. Most mentorship and advocacy programs for women are run at the grassroots level, including programs to get more women into particular fields. So, this isn't necessarily due to legislation that a political party can push, and certainly not as a result of any particular law or policy the Dems have enacted.","title":"What are some ways that Kamala is better than Biden?"},{"text":"I'm voting for whoever increases the output of the apostrophe mines","title":"Boris Johnson says Joe Biden told him his family origins were not really Irish at all"},{"text":"Everything in Christ above all","title":"Donate to Churches.

To be clear, I believe that the IDF and Netanyahu and his government are committing reprehensible war crimes and atrocities. But you keep bringing the conversation back Israel's atrocities while completely denying and outright lying about what Hamas has done. Since when do soldiers (regardless of the conflict, time period, and flag they represent) need an incentive to do terrible things to civilians and prisoners? Hatred, revenge, and even battlefield bloodlust are unfortunate aspects of humanity. Evidence of this is abundantly clear today and goes back millennia. And yes, that even includes the so-called 'good guys' and 'winners' of any given war. And surely you must understand that rape and torture of prisoners goes hand in hand with that, even if it isn't an official policy (though it often is). Pragmatism doesn't come into play at the individual human level and is often ignored by leadership.[Here's an article on UN report from March](https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/un-finds-clear-convincing-information-hostages-raped-gaza-rcna141789), done as independently as possible and without evidence from the IDF on the rapes at the site of the October 7 attack. The article has it's issues, which are described by the authors themselves, but they seem to have done the best they could to avoid interference from the IDF.[And here's an exhaustive article from Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/17/questions-and-answers-hamas-led-armed-groups-october-7-2023-assault-israel#_Toc171593932:~:text=October%207%2C%202023-,What%20violations%20of%20international%20humanitarian%20law%20and%20grave%20international%20crimes%20were%20committed%20on%20October%207%3F,-Human%20Rights%20Watch), with a very detailed and in-depth analysis of what happened on October 7 specifically. It includes their findings on war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Hamas that day. They lay everything out on the table and openly describe their limitations and how they gather evidence. HRW is as unbiased as they come and report on atrocities committed by both sides. Even you can't *honestly* disagree with that - they just released an 80+ report on Monday detailing the atrocities committed by Israel in Gaza. And yes, it's horrifying.I'm sure you have a rebuttal to defend Hamas that includes such tired arguments that it's all part of a global conspiracy. Don't bother. Unless you've got live video of those dead prisoners alive and well enjoying their almost year-long holiday with the rest of the captives.
