Eg, nobody wants to set up a factory in North Korea, even though wages there are probably really really cheap. But broadly correct. In a lot of cases this ends up meaning the nation willing to subject its population to the lowest pay and working conditions 'wins', because they are the cheapest.?Yes. And those workers, who are usually in the poorest nations, therefore get jobs. If tariffs are imposed by developed nations, it offsets at least some of the financial benefit obtained exploiting people who aren't protected by minimum wage or labor lawsIf tariffs are imposed by a developed country on a poor one, then, despite this statement:It probably won't remove the exploitationit will, likely, reduce trade between the countries, removing at least some of the exploitation. But then what happens to the workers in the sweatshops? They were working 15 hour days in the sweatshops for peanuts because that was the *best option available to them*. Now they've lost their jobs, they don't get to go and pick up extra shifts at starbuck, they don't get to file for unemployment. Rather, they go back to whatever it was that was *even worse* than working in the sweatshop. Your tariff imposed on the poor country is actually extremely regressive. This is true even if the tariff is imposed with the sole goal of punishing companies that exploit sweatshop workers. \\\\The only kind of tariff that will be progressive is if the *poor* country imposes tariffs, as a deliberate strategy of boosting a local industry (which they might also subsidise). Eg, if a country wants to start making auto parts, but doesn't have the skill or the facilities, the government might pour a whole lot of money into the local industry, and impose tariffs on foreign competitors. Now their local repair shops find the locally-built car parts are cheaper than everyone else, even though they're still crap. So the local auto parts manufacturers suddenly become viable businesses (which they were not before), and have money to invest in hiring expertise, improving their machinery, etc. Gradually the quality increases, until the country finds they can start to export their (still crap, but less so, and still cheap) parts. This brings in even more money, and gradually the industry develops to the point it can compete internationally on an even footing. This is progressive because it adds a successful industry to the economy of a country which previously could only offer subsistence jobs in sweatshops.","title":"CMV: Tariffs actually (politically) progressive"},{"text":"This is an idea I've been toying with. Tariffs seek to make it more expensive to offshore production or to imprort good manufactured outside the country.This will make it more expensive to import cheap tshirts from Bangladesh. But it will also make it more competitive to hire expensive American labor to make high quality tshirts in America. This can go from extremely low skilled work (making tshirts) to highly skilled work (cars, precision tools, etc).The American consumer will have to pay more. The question I have- with more people working, and more jobs available at a higher wage, will the higher consumer costs be offset by lowering the tax burden of welfare programs? And how many Americans would rather pay an extra 10% on clothing if they know the money was enriching their fellow worker, and not some manufacturing tycoon in Bangladesh?(It will suck for the sweat shop worker in Bangladesh who no longer can make tshirts for the American market, and no longer has a job.

The rich countries have high tariffs and subsidies to their own farmers who run highly mechanised farms. The poor countries can produce food (as it generally doesn't require high technology or highly trained workforce) but naturally they can't compete fairly if they would have to have the same productivity as the farmers in rich countries.","title":"CMV: Tariffs actually (politically) progressive"},{"text":"Its not that antivaxxers think that polio etc wont affect them because they are health conscious, its more that they have been lead to believe that all the successes relating to vaccines are fabricated.

First off, why in God's name would the GOP point to someone voting \\"No\\" against their own Speaker? That would either be: (A) the GOP saying \\"No, we're not bad, one single member voted against our Speaker\\", which admits that the Speaker is bad and that all but one of them were bad for voting for him; or (B) is trying to paint themselves as fractured and disunited, which not only is a poor way to do it, but also **is not a positive thing to add to their image, as it makes them look impotent, dysfunctional, and irresponsible**. Like, electing a Speaker is the bare @#%$ing bones of requirement to function.Secondly, even if it is them somehow trying to use what you believe to be fake dissent to bolster their image, the person they'd be using is... Thomas Massie. A Tea Party Libertarian who votes against welfare (like the COVID aid, which people liked) and disaster relief funding as well being increasingly pro-autocratic regimes (though the whole GOP is shifting that way). He's in no way a good person to hold up if they want to rehabilitate their image. He's not a Trumper per say, but he's not widely likeable either.And third: Did you forget that after the 2022 midterms, it took 15 rounds to elect McCarthy, and then when he got ouster, it took 4 rounds to elect Johnson?Johnson already is losing favor with Trump because he's trying to do the bare minimum to have a working GOP government that is sustainable with voters, which Trump doesn't care about. With the incoming Congress being 219-215 (Gaetz isn't returning), if **just** Massie votes for someone besides Johnson, then it's down to 218-216 (since you need a majority of voting members). That leaves him with the ability to have exactly **one** other person vote *Present* (AKA not vote), and **zero** votes for anyone else.And with Trump seemingly souring on Johnson, it's quite possible Massie will not have entirely unified support. These dipshits are about to wreck their reputation some more by showing themselves incapable of acting. Which, if they don't deal with the government shutdown, will be extra bad, because they'll be fighting themselves like dipshits when the government is literally shut down.","title":"Rep.

One is allowing tariffs specifically to offset race-to-the-bottom dynamics, e.g. having tariffs that match the price difference due to labor law differences and environmental regulations to protect countries with higher standards. Similarly, the so-called \\"Asian tigers\\" in the 90s were able to achieve high economic development through selective tariffs - protecting some industries while opening others strategically.Both those arguments were common in the alter globalization movement in the 90s - 1) we should implement targeted tariffs to incentivize environmental and labor protections, 2) We should allow less developed nations to design their tariffs in a way that advantages them.Both steps, though, do not work on the basis of the US implementing tariffs unilaterally - that will have the opposite effect, since the tariffs aren't targeted to incentivize higher wages, but rather to start a trade war that will depress economic growth globally for short-term gain in the US.Basically - well thought-out policies can be progressive. The policies of a cleptocratic oligarchy is rarely accidentally progressive, it's usually intentionally regressive and accidentally stupid.

Do you have actual examples of this happening for any kind of sustained duration? Lower prices are a win for consumers. Generally, employing price war tactics almost never results in higher profits in the long run since you generally never recover the lost profits from setting ultra low prices with higher prices post-competition, particularly because you're always competing against future competition as well. Whenever you raise prices again, new entrants will come in and force you to lower your prices again.In my country weve also seen rampant inflation in grocery prices, among other things while our supermarket duopoly reports record profits (not revenue, profit).What country is this? Has margins surged? Honestly, at this point, I roll my eyes every time I hear \\"record profits\\". Record profits is not abnormal. Any company that is growing will post record profits. That's literally what a growing company does. Also, during inflationary periods, if a company does not grow at all, or even becomes less profitable, it can still show record profits on paper because those profits have less purchasing power than before. So if a company posts profits 5% higher than the previous record but inflation is 10% during that same period, the company actually shrunk 5% despite posting record profits.Economies of scale is in the incumbent monopolys favour, so even if deregulation removes some barriers to entry for hypothetical competitors, the existing firms can manipulate supply to muscle out the emerging rivals.Sure, but it hardly guarantees dominant market position. Sears was a dominant market player with all of the economies of scale. Now it's pretty much defunct. K Mark was also a dominant player at one time and they are no more. With regulation, the rules of the game can be unfairly manipulated my incumbent firms, or even just by existing, creating regulatory environments that are costly to comply with if you don't have deep pockets. With low regulation, existing firms must outcompete existing and future challengers with price, quality, etc.Is the solution to combine deregulation with Teddy Roosevelt style antitrust campaigns to break up monopolies?Antitrust campaigns largely don't work. As someone else already mentioned, Standard Oil seems to be the benchmark people love pointing to as an \\"evil monopoly\\" but their market share had declined well before the government broke them up. More recently, Staples and Office Depot tried to merge but the government kept blocking their merger, claiming they would have a monopoly if they merged. After being blocked, both chains shuttered a bunch of stores, literally leaving less competition in many areas, because the government agencies failed to realize in their space, Amazon, Costco, Walmart, and Target area all major competitors.Do you believe market forces alone will achieve this?Yes. It literally has and continues to do so. Netscape used to have a dominant position in web browsers. Internet Explorer came along and dominated Netscape. Then Chrome came in and wiped the floor with IE. I'll always remember fondly 3dfx's dominance of the gaming videocard industry before nVidia, a fledgling company at the time, came in and swept the market with their TNT2 and geForce cards. The above examples of Sears and K Mart also hold, here. Same with Standard Oil. US Steel used to be the dominant player in steel, but now has low market shares and has been in the news of its sale to a foreign company possibly being blocked.","title":"Libertarian solutions to harm by monopolies"},{"text":"Can we agree that it's time to shoot some Musky Felons?","title":"I don't Trump is calling the shots anymore."},{"text":"Of course, thats just another lie from the Liar in Chief.

There are people who want to come and contribute to our great country and bring their skills here to participate here, and then there are people who come here and think they're owed money to send back home, don't learn the language, and don't feel the need to participate in our society as well. My wife used to be a public school teacher in a heavily Hispanic district and it's pretty amazing the dichotomy. There are some that came here and are eternally grateful for the country and the school and put in so much time and effort trying to give their child a life they never had. Then there's another subset that sees welfare as their right, doesn't give a shit about their child other than the welfare benefits they bring, and honestly it's fucking heartbreaking hearing some of the stories.\\nActually one of the most amazing stories, this is a bit off topic but I promise ties everything together, is my wife had a runin with a Hispanic child who was super upset a new black child had joined the class. He yelled \\"we already have too many blacks\\" before physically attacking my wife when she was trying to calm him down and explain it's not ok to racially discriminate, who again is middle eastern and not white. When my wife tried to refer this Hispanic child to the office for something that was clearly learned in the home, the white principal reprimanded my wife, because clearly it was my wife's fault that this child has learned anti-black racism in the home, and she hadn't \\"built a relationship\\" with the racist student. When she reached out to her union rep, another white lady, the response was \\"well we can't punish Hispanic child and enable the school to prison pipeline\\". This is what happens in far left school districts. Brown teachers are punished by white administrators by not solving racism, and the unions teachers pay for take the sides of the woke mob. It's fucking absurd, and thank God my wife got out of there and got a private sector job where she's making double what her salary was as a teacher and has a manager who actually gives a shit about her well being and actual performance over the social justice agenda. It turns out when she's actually judged on how well she does her job instead of how well she conforms to the woke agenda, she's really fucking good at her job.

They don't value our citizenship bc they never worked hard for it in the first place. I'm so sick of the narrative that anyone who comes over deserves to be an American, or that they're great people just because they made their way here. A lot of them come here solely to make money, and to take advantage of the benefits. But they have no loyalty to our country, and no respect for us or our culture. They openly talk shit about us while living in our home. I was watching a video earlier today talking about just that. All groups went further right, not just whites, but Latinos, blacks, and Asians all went to the right.

They can still say whatever they want and nobody will restrict their speech but if they knowingly lie about something non-trivial (intentionally pollute the informational commons on which voters depend), and it can be proven in a court of law that they knowingly lied, then they can be assessed fines. The point is to provide significant disincentives for public figures to knowingly lie about non-trivial matters. Opinions are unaffected. Only falsehoods that are claimed to be facts (george stephanoupolis) on non-trivial matters are actionable. Lying intentionally about important public matters by public figures has to be strongly disincentivized by making the risk much greater than the payoff.

The news reports against him are all rejected as lies without any investigation done; or assuming the Dems are equivalently bad.The Dems have not done themselves favors either. Kamala primaried last, and Biden re running and even doing dipshit undefendable moves like pardoning the kids for cash judge is not doing any favors. Him re running alone put the US harshly on track to mafia state governance as he handed an election to Trump; perhaps the most arrogant move in all of politics. So effectively we're trying to win with bland, often pretty bad candidates and meritocracy alone.

Not once have I been name called and looked down upon when I for example point out that I don't support economic protectionism, and although in the short term tariffs and lower immigration may be a positive for workers, it's a lot of what I believe killed Detroit and the US automobile industry, and I don't think pursuing similar solutions will work out any better.\\nBut as soon as I tell someone that due to my economics background I support lowering the corporate income tax, or God forbid that I believe biological men have an advantage over biological women in sports, or that I support gun rights, or that people from extremist Muslim countries tend to have extremist views incompatible with American values, shit hits the fan. I've been called a trickle down Reagan moron (they don't like when I follow that up with citing Regan's reelect numbers), a transphobic bigot, someone who loves guns more than children, and my favorite, an Islamophobe who hates brown people.\\nNever mind that my wife is the daughter of two first generation refugees from the middle east who escaped the persecution that the majority of people who live in those countries support against non-muslims. It turns out my brown wife and her brown parents who escaped an Islamic theocracy also aren't big fans of importing tons of people who were trying to kill her parents for the crime of leaving the Islamic faith either. I'm fine with refugees who want to assimilate to American culture and embrace what this country has to offer, I don't want those who simply want to make more money while continuing to support radical islam, don't try to learn the language or assimilate, and vote to make the US like the country they left.

But apparently I hate brown people because of stuff like that.\\nOh also speaking of Trump supporters, my father in law is a huge Trump supporter.

Much how the Dems told people the economy wasnt bad, when everyone was feeling a certain way about inflation. I think that this is one of those moments where, yes, we condemn the violence, but also take it as a moment of real reflection on why people are feeling this way and change it for the better rather than wait until people get very desperate until they do something wild like Mangione did.For example the media narrative has been to blast messages out that everyone is celebrating this murder, when in actuality people have found the irony of it all in some way cathartic.

How do people not remember all the crap on Reddit, with the power mods having protests, all the Resist! Crap, etc?  They didnt quit then, and they wont now.  This is an ideological crusade to these indoctrinates.They lost in 2024 just like they did in 2016.  They are now going to run another 4 years of doom and gloom (you can already see them going super negative on the economy.  All of a sudden - magically - the greatest recovery ever! is looking like were heading into a recession). You can see them admitting [Biden was too old after all](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/biden-final-days-in-office.html), because they are about to relentlessly rip on Trumps age for the next 4 years.  You can see it in how hard they are trying to limit the rights reach with regards to setting/affecting the narrative (last time they deranked, restricted, banned conservatives on twitter, Reddit, Facebook etc, this time they are trying to *get rid of twitter*, and relentlessly trying to promote/ prop up, the place where they can rule with an iron fist again, Bluesky)They are going to run the same 2016-2020 game plan again.

They've been threatening to do this out in the open. And this agenda is already underway. A potent combination of a unitary executive, broad immunities for the president, executive actions like schedule F, and a MAGA coalition of loyalists that will consolidate power by exploiting Trump's ego to take control of the administrative state and pave the way for a future one party system of government with King Trump at its head.And almost every Trump appointee so far has been picked to help implement this agenda, each one representing a transaction. \\"What have you done for me, and what will you do for me in exchange for this position?\\" They've exchanged their loyalty for a spot within his administration where they can do the most damage.This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been calling a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025. It attempts to strip protections from civil servants whose government positions will depend largely on their allegiance to the president and his agenda. Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will afford Republicans the power to cripple the system of checks and balances holding our democracy together, helping them to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.Project 2025 laid it all out in their manifesto, while heritage foundation members and \\"America first\\" Trump allies have been preparing for this eventuality. People who have already been appointed to positions of power within Trump's new admin.The Unitary executive Theory is another major goal of project 2025, and a proposal that's been floated before by Republicans. Bill Barr was a major proponent, and it's part of the reason why he shot down the Mueller investigations efforts to hold Trump accountable for obstruction. The UET proposes that the president has unchecked powers and complete control over the executive branch.The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive, crippling the separation of powers in the process and giving Trump unilateral authority over the administrative state. These actions will allow The Trump administration to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan civil servants, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field, whose job security didn't previously depend on their loyalty to the president. And come next year, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in years to see this agenda through because they'll have a Trump administration with unchecked powers, a Republican majority in both houses, and a conservative SCOTUS.It might seem a little confusing because part of their goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, and includes every government agency you can think of that's responsible for running and regulating day to day operations in this country.However, the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power for itself and installs Trump as king and useful idiot in chief.Hence, a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"The next Trump administration is also preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a top role in these agencies.From this standpoint, they'll have the perfect opportunity to implement an authoritarian, far right agenda backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists...This is an agenda that will also pave the way for future Republican administrations to continue building a one party system of government, while setting up roadblocks for any progressive, or even populist efforts or movements that may take hold in the future. Because make no mistake, this ain't populism, it more closely resembles an age of modern day robber barons working closely with politicians, or vice versa. Hell, in some cases, they're basically synonymous.Laurence W. Britt, who published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, made a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. This list has become widely shared and circulated. See how many parallels you can draw to the MAGA movement.- \\"Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism\\"\\n- \\"Disdain for the importance of human rights\\"\\n- \\"Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause\\"\\n- \\"The supremacy of the military/avid militarism\\"\\n- \\"Rampant sexism\\"\\n- \\"A controlled mass media\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with national security\\"\\n- \\"Religion and ruling elite tied together\\"\\n- \\"Power of corporations protected\\"\\n- \\"Power of labor suppressed or eliminated\\"\\n- \\"Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with crime and punishment\\"\\n- \\"Rampant cronyism and corruption\\"\\n- \\"Fraudulent elections\\"I dunno about you, but it appears to me that Trump and his MAGA agenda covers almost all the bases here.","title":"Senator Chris Murphy warns of Trump's plan to 'cripple democracy'"},{"text":"He isnt","title":"House Ethics Committee quietly voted to release Matt Gaetz ethics report"},{"text":"House is like 90% to win but senate is another very bad map for us ","title":"US funding plan collapses as Trump makes demands days before shutdown"},{"text":"Man I wish I could take pride in being a dick to people for no reason.Oh wait no I dont because thats fucking sad.","title":"The Trump Vengeance Tour Continues As He Sues Pollster For Being Wrong"},{"text":"But no taxes and cheap stocks.

Aubrey', who says the line, is a textbook example of the stern, but fair leader. This character respects each of the men under his command as a human being. He also understands that discipline is key to any sort of complex human undertaking, the sailing of a ship of war in this case. At one point in the film, one of the sailors fails to salute an unpopular officer who the men perceive as cursed or unlucky, or as they put it, a \\"Jonah\\", as well as cowardly.Cpt. Aubrey has the man flogged, which was British custom, as well as law, at the time. His close friend, a naturalist, surgeon of the ship, and the closest thing 1805 had to a classical liberal, protests, in private, on grounds of morality. He claims the man was drunk on the issued ration of rum, that it was a minor offense, and that flogging is an outdated, barbaric technique. I'm paraphrasing of course. Aubrey responds \\"Men must be governed. Often not well I grant you, but they must be governed\\" (if this isn't 100% accurate I apologize but it's close and captures the idea)This is essentially an argument of leniency against discipline, military discipline in this case. At its core, it's really an argument about the governing body's right to impose order on the individual. On one hand, you have empathy, understanding, and respect for the sanctity of the self. On the other, you have acknowledgment of the cold reality that, without stern law and order, and therfore punishment, no enterprise can succeed, at least not for long. Humans cannot function as a group in any meaningful way without hierarchy. It's not a man made idea, but an unwavering law of the natural world. Every religion has its God, every company its CEO, every ship its captain, every tribe its cheif, every wolf pack its alpha. When left to their own devices, all social structures shake out like this, with few if any exceptions. Man or beast, down to the ants.In the animal kingdom, this law is acted out primarily via instinct, which isn't surprising considering the absence of conscience thought. However, with higher complexity, there comes higher amounts of conflict and therein discipline. In humans, it forms naturally, but it will fail if it isn't upheld with discipline at every level. The alternative is chaotic anarchy, which I simply refuse to acknowledge as a legitimate philosophy. Men must be governed. The alternative is a cruel bloodbath, ruled not by highly evolved, endlessly debated philosophical ideals born of our greatest minds, but by the physical power of the strong. In the absence of the rule of law, those most capable of violence will always rise to the top of the very gory, very bloodstained pile.Men must be governed. To think anything else is childish, and naive.","title":"CMV: The Republican Party needs to dissolve and be replaced by a libertarian party"},{"text":"If the government was *really* interested in doing anything, theyd go after the companies employing illegals.

Even though I might admire the separation of powers in the US to a degree, it's clearly showing cracks in recent years. Having supreme power locked away behind a sovereign genuinely puts a lot of concerns I'd otherwise have in the US at ease. Multiparty elections is also a big bonus. Our Liberals might be collapsing right now, but pressure from both the NDP on the left and Conservatives on the right will quickly set them back on the right course next time around. The Democrats are still struggling to cope with how they lost their election, and new blood struggles to get into the party.Our healthcare and other services also enjoy more stability as institutions. Politicians might do them some harm but no party would ever run on gutting the whole system to save on tax dollars. Canadian culture does differ massively here, with way less libertarian ideas like people being responsible for the entirety of all the situations they face in life.Most social issues are also settled. Parties might make the LGBT community take a backseat but we'd never deal with the possibility of their rights being withdrawn. Abortion is a big topic, sure, but that's also generally considered to be safe under a Conservative government.America has a crime problem that Canada can't match. How many more school shootings have to happen before firearms regulations can be enacted? I believe in a right to bear arms, but the guns owned per capita in America is way too high of a number. Hell, most gun deaths in Canada are a result of a firearm smuggling operation working out of the US.Not a fan of how protectionist the US is. Canada has a free trade agreement with just about every other country on the planet. Meanwhile, Biden just slapped solar tariffs on a good amount of Asia. Trump putting 25% tariffs on everyone is just a reflection of how protectionist the US has been lately, even if it's extreme.I prefer the lack of religious presence in Canada, at least when compared to the US. We're much better at separating church and state here. The only time you'll ever see a Bible or hear a reference to God is during a swearing in ceremony, taking an oath in court, or during a royal ceremony.Wouldn't enjoy what would happen to the French language if Canada joined the US as a Quebecer. Francophones would go back to being second-class citizens just like they were 60 years ago. Plenty of users on this subreddit have said that Quebec should just give up on French and follow the rest of the world in adopting English as if it already isn't the most bilingual province in Canada.If I want money, my retirement savings are already making a profit off the American market anyway. We might be similar in some ways, but the differences between our institutions are obvious. To give all of our own up to become US states is a terrible trade.","title":"Unpacking Trump's latest broadside about Canada as a '51st state' | CBC News"},{"text":"I think society is not very good at recognizing the roots of violence and does many things that really only perpetuate the conditions that make violence possible.

Trump is stupid, but he's not stupid enough to invade his country's closest ally and a member of several important global alliances in a period of relative peace and stability. It would lead to America's relationship with the entire west unravelling. Trump likes to sow discord, but he's not going to throw away America's position in the world just like that, nor would people allow him to. This would be akin to Germany invading Austria, and as much as reddit likes to compare Trump to Hitler, we're nowhere near that level of political escalation yet, and won't get there within 4 years.I believe what he's doing is mostly just bullying and trying to humiliate Canada so they capitulate in the trade war. And if he has any serious ambitions about acquiring Canada, he likely believes he can achieve it democratically by planting the idea and getting Canadians to willingly join the US. Which is stupid, but more on brand with Trump's stupidity than a full on invasion.An actual military invasion of Canada probably wouldn't happen except in the case of resource necessity, such as if they needed our water in the wake of climate change, and in a world where our diplomatic relationship has degraded to the point where we would be unable to cooperate on that.

It's exhausting!The \\"short\\" version of it is this:Trump won all the swing states, yet in those same swing states Democrats won down ballot. Not just a little, by a lot. In North Carolina they won every single important race except the presidency.So, those are facts. Do you know how often a down-ballot candidate, in particular a *senate* candidate, wins when their presidential candidate loses? Hardly ever. It happened maybe 3-4 times TOTAL between the late 70s early 80s and now. Do you know how many times it happened in 2024? 5 times.Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada *all* went to Democratic senate candidates, while Bob Casey lost Pennsylvania by a hair. Meanwhile, those same voters picked Trump to be the president.In each of those presidential races there was a \\"drop-off\\" effect (which you may have heard incorrectly described as \\"bullet ballots\\") in which people voted for a presidential candidate but made no other choices. This does happen in elections, but it's always a fraction of a percent. In 2024, the drop off numbers are staggering and always beyond the margin of victory. [This article](https://smartelections.substack.com/i/152549741/number-of-votes-involved-is-larger-than-margin-of-victory) has those graphs and data sets if you're interested.Could this all be a coincidence? Sure. It's entirely possible. In the same way that an NBA game could mathematically end in a shut out. Or you could play 5-card poker with one draw and be dealt a royal flush. Except that the odds of being dealt a royal flush are 1 in 650k, so you'd actually need to be dealt 5.5 royal flushes consecutively to have the same odds as this election (one data analyst claimed the odds of Trump winning all the swing states while losing those senate seats was 1 in 35 billion).","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"I'm betting that if the government shuts down between now and 2026, he'll blame Biden, and his people will believe him fully.
