Is he stupid?In all seriousness, I don't see these kinds of surface level takes about the perception of Democratic party controlled cities and states hurting national democrats, or the redistribution of population between Red and Blue states leading to redistricting as particularly productive. Yeah it's true that local and state Democrats should govern better, not only for helping national Dems win but to keep their promises to constituents to make their lives better, but that's so much easier said than done. If the national level party had a magic button to immediately reverse the dumb decisions by local representatives and build enough housing to reverse the trends, they would push it. But even if they did, it's not enough. We're losing a war of perception more than anything else. Yes, cities like Chicago, New York, and San Francisco have a litany of problems that Democrats have either failed to address or have made worse. But even if they were magically fixed tomorrow, that doesn't fix the perceptions, because the perceptions are not entirely based on facts. Fox News runs stories every single day about the worst problems in those cities and extrapolates them to pretend that every Democratic governed city is a post apocalyptic hellscape with zero businesses that aren't actively burning down, where every neighborhood is reflective of the absolute worst ones and you're mugged on a daily basis on the sidewalk or shanked every day on the subway, and every street corner has a fentanyl addict rampaging through town. Do you see that kind of sophisticated propaganda operation going the other way? Do you see the \\"liberal\\" media spending several hours every single day on the deterioration of Republican run counties and states? Do you see daily images of people dying from inadequate healthcare, of kids not being able to do the most basic reading or math, of unchecked pollution in rural areas or the meth epidemic in West Virginia and other places? No, you don't. You'll hear about those things here and there, and some journalists will write articles about these situations while trying their hardest to stay \\"neutral\\" and avoid attacking the party responsible for these terrible outcomes, but it's not constant, organized, nor repeated ad nauseum on short form videos on Tiktok specifically aimed at undecideds.

Instead of questioning the elitism of private education or addressing systemic inequalities, it presents individual self-expression as the ultimate goal of education.And about Neil - Keating's approach was incredibly irresponsible. Rather than helping Neil navigate the real constraints in his life or teaching him how to effectively challenge authority, he fed him vague platitudes about following dreams. A truly progressive teacher would have helped Neil understand the power structures affecting his life and find constructive ways to resist them.Real educational reform isn't about charismatic teachers inspiring individual students - it's about ensuring equal access to quality education and giving students the tools they need to create systemic change.

People use it in terms of old people or young people, as they make the biggest headlines, but in every working relationship youll typically have drugs or alcohol in the beginning. From one party or both. Most working relationships have a type A and type B personality. Type A isnt bad or dangerous, 90% of the time, but there are controlling types of personalities out there. Coercive control types. Type A stupidly falls into that category now and can be a woman just as easily as a man. But is usually assumed upon first read to be a man. During the first few years of a relationship, youll have a dominant personality and a submissive. Or theyll split. People who spend a lot of time together, synch their brainwaves, even family or friends, and eventually mimic their partners thoughts and feelings. Type As who are unhealthy in their ideology of opposite sex encourage their partners to do more drugs or drink more alcohol to keep them submissive and under control. Type Bs who are unhealthy in their ideology will do the same to feel safe around their significant other because they grew up with coercive control conditions and unnaturally fear Type A.The rising increase in mental disorders might actually be due to the rising increase of drugs that the FDA has been approving. You see those drug advertisements in America that say they can cause depression? Concentration issues and thoughts of suicide? How many of those drugs that the FDA approved for, say food conservation, do you suppose induce those feelings as well? Then youll go to a mental health professional who will treat you with depression with good old fashioned psychopharmacology. Thats basically legal drug pushing. Because all therapists and psychiatrists are basically instructed to give you drugs first, and the most common drug at that. Which ironically can cause all the issues theyre trying to cure and there is no cure. Depression is a natural state of being that you can learn to live with eventually or you get over, like it was a phase of your life. Unless, that is, youre constantly being attacked psychologically or youre experiencing endless amounts of suffering, like starvation or physical/sexual abuse. Women, especially, are being targeted with psychopharmacological experimentation. Because women are more likely to seek professional services. Men too.There are people who have experienced severe trauma who fall into deep and dark depressions as well. I wish there was a cure. There are medicines out there that do work for groups of individuals. I would encourage people seeking treatment to get a blood test to target the types of medications that are more likely to work for them. I wouldnt encourage people to not seek treatment. Im just saying that its doing more harm than good in a system that only cares about money and brushes aside their own failures as statistics. For anyone seeking treatment for trauma related issues, physical/sexual/psychological abuse falling into that category, I would also suggest EMDR.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"If he ditched the transphobia he might have a point","title":"Dem congressman slams party for losing 'easy' election, ignoring 'real issues'"},{"text":"Did y'all even read the article?

However, almost all the ones who watch CNN and MSNBC had been convinced that he had not shot at winning in a general election.And the entire Democratic Party^TM was aligned against him. In 2016, Wikileaks published all of this information, and in 2020, Obama and the rest of Democratic orchestrated his demise by having every other candidate (except Warren, who they had just forced to falsely accused Sanders of sexism) pull out and endorse Biden.Note that its harder to cheat at caucuses because they don't use electronic fraud-o-matic voting machines (even though Pete's team did its best in Iowa by using a rigged caucus counting application).

But their conspiracy about the UN and the communist scare, ongoing to this day, is going to force countries to stand with or against them. But the CIA infiltrates countries that are neutral, fails 80% of the time and inadvertently creates a new communist regime.On a side note, President Trump has been courting southern Wisconsin a lot. And Kamala Harris. Pretty sure Biden was up in that JBS base of operations too, but people made a smaller issue about his travel plans. JBS also infiltrates police, PTA, government jobs and civil servant jobs. And my local coordinator looks like shes straight out of Russia.Communists are people too. I think its wrong to persecute entire countries because you dont like their leader or their policies. But they are actively attacking us. As you and the main poster said, through psy-ops, the racial divide as actually the largest problem because that will actually lead to another civil war. But how much of it is going to be real and how much will be hyped and done on purpose, like pushing drugs into minority communities and forcing minorities to push those drugs? Its happening in every major city and surrounding cities. Twin cities on the borders of states especially. Easier to move people back and forth to avoid police. Use the police to transfer them too as narc operatives. Truly evil material. FBI or CIA agenda too? Manson was an egotistical freak but if even he could see the agenda and try to throw an accelerant on it, a nobody from nowhere, why is it still happening?Money. Dark web and human trafficking mostly. How? Infiltration. Even JBS started copying what they thought communists from Russia were doing. Racist people had a really good Thanksgiving, Ill bet, and theyll have a really good Christmas too. No family divide there. You need to be a leftist or extreme right, middle class or poor and apparently Caucasian. Even the people they use become racist. Hate them blue eyed devils. Become a tool. Youll get paid really well until they dont need you anymore or they need a patsy.Anyone reading this can feel free to repost with actual information evidence they can find online. Everyone should be warned to avoid doing favors for strangers. I was, myself, targeted for a similar conspiracy. Im not racist by a long shot, maybe a victim of white guilt? Someone asked me for a ride and told me they didnt feel safe at any place he wanted me to drop him off at and constantly asked if I could do him a favor but didnt allude to what that would be. Shows up at my address a week later with a cousin and the favor was holding something for him. Obviously I asked him to leave and warned him that my wife would call the police on him and me. Also, I have two girls and a boy so Id like to avoid jail time and gang wars. Since then, my wife and children, and childrens friends have been followed by strangers and attacked through social media. Mostly targeting females. Constant intimidation tactics. All meant to inspire racial divide. All one can do after a year of constant reminders is think about the one time someone of the same skin color tried to either press one into service or set oneself up for a sting operation. He apparently had/has many friends. And Im a recluse. I have nothing to do with anyone. My kids and my wife are pretty much the same. When you dont put yourself out there, youre left with people who want to approach you or befriend you. Thus, its obvious, although purely circumstantial evidence. And these programs have no oversight. Its a sanctioned criminal enterprise.Again, feel free to repost or rewrite, because Id love to see this kind of information ANYwhere. All the conspiracies I see lately are about Trump, Elon or UFOs. Some about Israel. No one is looking at their own communities or talking about human traffickers. Its scary to see. Because half of it or more is probably misinformation to make people avoid thinking about whats happening to their own family/friends.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"If a problem is identified in a society,..whether it's homelessness or drug-addiction or immigrants or whatever,. shouldn't the approach or primary-question we ask ourselves be:.. \\"How can we solve this in the most positive way possible with the least negative impacts?\\"..... ?Mass Deportations have negative effects in 3 different ways:* the amount of Time, Money, Staff and etc (resources) we'd have to sink into actually logistically doing the deportations (estimated to cost roughly $88 Billion for every 1 million deported per year.. taking roughly 10 years and costing ballpark $1 Trillion dollars. * the disruption to the various job-industries that all these people work in* the reduction in Government dollars (immigrants who pay into Social Security etc.. would dry up and cease)Why would we approach a problem in that way (3 negative downsides).. when we could just simply \\"help these people become legal\\",. since the vast vast majority of them are already here and already contributing ?Nobody seems to have a good response to that (that doesn't seem to boil down to:..  \\"Well, we just don't want to be around brown-people\\")Replying to the below:Whats valid about it that doesnt come off smelling like racism and xenophobia ?The USA has long been described as a melting pot.

Why does it feel like no one else is asking that?I highly recommend the 1952 San Francisco Film Noir *The Sniper*, about a disturbed young man who is shooting cute brunettes like the lovely Marie Windsor (*yowza!*)  There's a great meeting scene in City Hall about half way through.  City and state leaders are wondering what to do about situations like this.  A mental health expert says that it's possible to treat loons like the sniper to prevent them from killing, but it will take a lot more resources than the mental health system is getting from the state.  A conservative tightwad says there's no way the state is going to provide resources to treat \\"those monsters\\" and it's cheaper to let them go ahead and start shooting, and then have the police hunt them down \\"like the animals they are\\".It's pretty amazing that a scene like that made it to the screen.  It's a lot easier to call mass murderers \\"monsters\\" and \\"animals\\" rather than try to understand why they do it and try to prevent others from following suit.I'm a computer engineer and was (mildly) bullied by numbskulls in school as a child.  The message that schools sent is that the most important thing is competitive sports, and being a football star is far more important than math, science, and foreign language.  If football players and other athletes bully \\"weaklings\\", then that's fine.  It'll \\"toughen them up\\".Now, if you have brains you have an advantage since you can lose yourself in Jules Verne novels, electronics, and computer science.  Some become chess players.  But if you're simply a misfit you'll be treated abominably and the sports-oriented school admins really don't give a rat's ass.So some of the misfits finally decide that they've had enough and lash out.  I'm surprised it doesn't happen all the time.  Maybe they're getting enough social contact via the Internet to help them through their middle- and high-school years.Many decades ago I read a very interesting article in the newspaper about correlation between criminal behavior and brain damage.  Some scientists were studying correlation between violent criminals and brain damage by giving standard brain damage tests to violent criminals at a state prison.  As a control, they also gave the same tests to non-violent criminals.  They discovered to their surprise that *almost all of the criminals* had brain damage, both the violent and non-violent.  Furthermore, the incidence of left-brain and right-brain damage correlated with left- and right-handedness in the general population.  They suspected that left-brain damage was caused by children being \\"smacked upside the head\\" by right-handed parents, and vice-versa.I haven't been able to find anything about this on the 'tubes.  Nobody wants to discover that criminal behavior is a symptom of child abuse, because then it becomes a mental health issue instead of Crime and Punishment.  Suddenly we're back to that meeting in *The Sniper*.  Better to treat school shooters as \\"monsters\\" and \\"animals\\" instead of preventing killings from happening by stopping child abuse.","title":"What does the ACTUAL left represent for you?"},{"text":"Uh, well, how do I say this.First, this time next year we will very likely have our own mini right wing in charge.

When they do think, it's to rationalize the way they feel.They feel strongly and presume that means they're just correct.  They don't have to accept new information, understand other perspectives, learn, grow, etc.The whole \\"progressive\\" ideology is about positive affirmation.\\"You are, and I am, great the way that we are.  You/I should not have to improve.\\"This shunts any possible motivation to learn and grow.This ideological coddling is what I call 'matronizing'.  It's condescending like patronization, but it's got that feminine care-taker bent to it, to take everyone under their wing, so, \\"matronizing\\".It is the first step in nurturing, but unlike in nurturing, there is no growth  encouraged.  It's like mothers who want to keep their children weak and stupid so that they always get ran to for cuddling, because that's what the dysfunctional mother likes the most.They're kept under the wing, not for the empowerment or betterment of the \\"child\\", but as a crutch for the mother.This is attractive to some people, they want to be mothered, to be nannied.  They want to permanently be dependents, because that's less work.This is where the ideology always leans into creating the \\"nanny state\\".It's a whole symbiosis.  This can be seen in various cults, like the [Oneida cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community).  They practiced \\"sex positivity\\"(everyone sleeps around, no exclusisvity) and shrugging off subsequent children to the queen matrons(those with an intense need to influence and be loved by children) to raise.  This is why so many leftists are drawn towards being teachers.Once children were weaned (usually at around the age of one), they were raised communally in the Children's Wing, or South Wing.[33] Their parents were allowed to visit, but the children's department held jurisdiction over raising the offspring. If the department suspected a parent and child were bonding too closely, the community would enforce a period of separation because the group wanted to stop the affection between parents and children....Women over 40 were to act as sexual \\"mentors\\" to adolescent boys because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. ... In the decline phase:Within the commune, there was a debate about when children should be initiated into sex and by whom. There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.Can't have that.The authoritative nanny state:Even though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.Just about everyone of age was granted some form of control or title, got to pretend to be aristocrats like I mentioned at the top.Sounds a lot like Benito Mussolini:All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.Leftist centralization.Social regulation:Every member of the community was subject to criticism by a committee or the community as a whole during a general meeting.[16] The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits.That sounds familiar.  Cancel culture, social credit, struggle sessions, etc etc.  A common feature in leftism.Any form of collectivist ideology winds up in similar forms.  That's the only way to build a \\"functional\\" society for people rebelling against western individualism philosophy.  Whatever you want to call them, progressives, postmodernists, leftists, socialists, communists, etc.Despite their often strong in-fighting, they're all quite similar in their ideation, as opposed to western enlightenment which gave us the concepts of civil rights, individual accountability, agency + responsibility, etc.The only big difference:All community members were expected to work, each according to their abilities. Our cultish left is so big they often just externalize that expectation, they can just take what they want, everyone *else* needs to work.  This completes the Aristocrat model.","title":"Why do a lot on the left act as if they're complaining when talking politics?"},{"text":"So their kids go to school for free?

If you live in rural Kentucky and work at an Amazon factory and you are dirt poor what actual power do you have in this country? Voting from Trump and reminding everyone in America that there are a shit ton of poor white people in this country is about all youve got.This is where the contention lives.  These may be educated people, but that doesn't mean they have critical thinking skills.  Remember Ben Carson?  He was a neurosurgeon - that's really hard and requires a lot of brains (ha)!  He also believed the pyramids were used to store grains and would listen to no one, not even experts in that specific field, on the topic. Was he educated?  Yes.  Was he smart within his field?  Yes.  Did he have the critical thinking skills necessary to observe all of the evidence and historical documents and expert journals on the topic and arrive at the correct answer?  No.  Whatever education he had, skipped that critical thinking unit.  Or critical thinking is a super power that simply cannot be taught and is absent in some people.  One or the other.  In the referenced paragraph, your example people that are \\"exercising their power\\" are cutting the nose to spite the face.  \\"Let's become unemployed, lose our medical care, lose our homes, increase all of our bills, all to tell people that we're unhappy\\".  That's not the move someone with critical thinking skills would make.  It would be analogous to soldiers shooting themselves in the feet to make their enemy feel bad, in the hopes of stopping the fight.  This is not a good military strategy.  This is not a good political strategy.  Their \\"protest vote\\" will make their lives far, far worse.  In advocating for quality education that includes an understanding of how propaganda works, how to recognize it, and how to properly do your own research, I am arguing from a personal belief that Critical Thinking skills can be taught.  If that belief is incorrect and that Critical Thinking is an inherent un-teachable quality, then we have a huge problem.  That huge problem would need to be resolved by those that can think critically, and work to provide the best life for all those lacking that skillset, despite their objections.  This would be an authoritarian government obviously.  Thus I advocate for quality education, in the hopes that Critical Thinking is teachable.  Which means I judge the current education to be not-sufficient.  Either they are stupid despite what they've learned and are beyond hope, or something was missed in our educational platform and they can be taught.  The latter is far more optimistic a perspective.","title":"Democrats dont have a working-class problem.

Who cares? It's wrong and it shouldn't be funded because it's wrong. Having those people work on neutrino physics or axiomatic QFT isn't going to magically make them incapable of working on a quantum gravity theory if something promising comes up.The entire idea of quantum gravity is just ideological anyway. There's no reason to think that a theory of everything actually exists. The universe is under no obligation to be well described by a single framework, and most of the story of physics in the last ~40 years is that reductionism has reached its explanatory limits and more is different in ways that you can't just perturbation theory or adiabatic theorem your way out of. No other field of science is bothered by this. Only high energy physics theory.And just to not spam your inbox, your Sabine characterization is very off. She has...heterodox ideas in some places so yes, you can safely call her a crackpot about eg gravitational waves, but she was a legitimate cosmologist with 3 postdocs with good people and a ~14 year professorship at good institutes including Perimeter. While yes, she does have some crackpot ideas and I wish the popular voice for pushback against particle physicists continuing to take a disproportionately huge percentage of science funding was, she gets critiques from three big camps.1. Naturalness. Lubos Motl is the only person I've seen with a cogent actual rebuttal to this which is surprising because it's Lubos Motl and Sabine isn't a white guy. His argument is roughly speaking that natural theories are more likely to be true because they have less free parameters and the free parameters that exist are constrained to a small region. This is true, but it's also not really a refutation of Sabine. She is completely correct in that the universe is under no obligation to be described by the math you like which is what naturalness usually means. It's also true that whatever theory will usually start out \\"ugly\\" and then later become \\"beautiful\\" as mathematicians work through things. Maxwell's equations are a good example here. As formulated by Maxwell it was hellish and doesn't resemble what you see in textbooks now.2. Anti colliders. This is not meaningfully different from Philip Anderson's critiques of the SSC. By far the mode outcome of the FCC is that Europe is out ~$20 billion of funding because it goes overbudget, some Higgs parameters get refined, and that's it. The science case for it is just really weak. Especially with how not well studied neutrinos and how unimportant particle physics is as a field. The field won't die if they don't get a new giant circular collider. Only the most expensive and naive subbranch of it.3. Her social science stuff. I don't know how bad this was because I don't watch her youtube and I don't really care to learn, but this is a fallacy. Being wrong about social science doesn't mean she's wrong about something she's spent 25 years of her career on.","title":"Peter Higgs: I wouldn't be productive enough for today's academic system"},{"text":"\\"Primaries are useless.

This was called the [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy).

He lost in an absolute landslide, but he did successfully pull the electoral votes of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, all of which became core components of the Southern Strategy, and all which voted democrat in the preceding 1960 election.","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden on Russias Attack on Ukraine"},{"text":"And before Googling the word they had no clue.

It makes drug enforcement more difficult. It makes it harder to deliver services to the whole community, not just the undocumented. It also means giving up jurisdiction and control of some key aspects of law enforcement to federal control. If the national guard is used, that's a whole new can of worms.Edit: Meant to also say...

If they don't change soon, someone who isn't afraid of them is going to humiliate them badly in a war.1904: Japan has no historical fear of Russia, and Japan doesn't believe themselves uncivilized. Japan will not be intimidated by Russia's threats and shows of power, Russia won't be able to threaten their way into getting what they want here, they'll have to either back down, which will be embarassing against a power they consider uncivilized, or win a declared war against a near-peer power that they refuse to admit to themselves is near-peer. Dis gon b gud.1857: The recent mutiny shows that company rule in india is unsustainable when even the local elites are turning on us, indeed *british* rule in india is probably unsustainable, if we continue to make absolutely no concessions to accomodate the needs of the locals and continue to perpetuate an extractive economic system that keeps causing famines.","title":"Liberalism at Large: The World According to the Economist"},{"text":"Hell no!Biggest mistake ever.Trump will never deport the Low wage workers, he hires to work in his hotels.","title":"Democratic-controlled cities are finalizing plans to oppose mass deportation"},{"text":"Hmm, who to believe, independent experts in the field or a right wing outfit that explicitly exists to churn out propaganda against immigration? ??https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/center-immigration-studies","title":"Democratic-controlled cities are finalizing plans to oppose mass deportation"},{"text":"To be fair I used to think that.

When you look at the demographic trends in the 1960s/1970s when overpopulation related works like *The Population Bomb* were written, it seemed like the population of any non industrialized country  including India and China would continue to grow exponentially. Then the population would disastrously decline in a sort of Malthusian way where we run out of resources thus basically resulting in a civilization ending global mega famine.What these overpopulation alarmists didnt account for is that pretty much every non industrialized country at the time would eventually industrialize or at least begin the process so the declining birth rate part of the demographic transition would happen in places like India and China. Additionally, Chinas one child policy effectively destroyed the countrys growth rate as they fail to get anything but a negative growth rate in the modern day.Overpopulation has become such a non issue that certain right wing personalities like Musk try to stoke the fear of underpopulation or Africa growing too quickly in comparison to other places and promote a weird misogynistic fixation on increasing the birth rate. The worst part is that while these people are horrible in what they suggest to resolve it, underpopulation is a real issue. An aging population cannot be supported by a smaller younger generation both economically and labor wise. We already see this in countries like Japan that are basically economically stagnant as more and more of their population leaves the workforce. And addressing this has good and bad policy-related solutions. Limiting bodily autonomy, raising the retirement age, or just giving money/child welfare payments to people without changing the surrounding culture have proven to be ineffective while things like increasing immigration and creating a better environment for families with things like good child care and education are more effective.The US is actually one of the countries best situated to do well throughout the demographic transition because of immigration, so in a way people like Musk and JD Vance are self-defeating by opposing actually good solutions to underpopulation.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 29, 2024"},{"text":"Who the fuck walks around with their passport or any other kind of documents?

It's basically like a \\"free money stream\\" for the US Gov. \\"mass deportations\\" is the most damaging and destructive way to fix this. A study from NewAmericanEconomy from 2016 said: https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/issues/undocumented-immigrants/ :* 6.4 percent: Amount the labor force would shrink due to mass deportation.* $1.6 trillion: Estimated reduction of U.S. GDP as a result.* 5.7 percent: Amount the U.S. economy would shrink due to mass deportation.* $400 billion: Direct cost to the federal government.What job fields are all these undocumented workers in ?* Agricultural Workers (All Types) 36.1%* Grounds Maintenance Workers 26.7%* Other Food Preparation and Serving-Related Workers, including School Cafeteria Attendants and Hospital Food Service Workers 25.1%* Textile, Apparel, and Furnishings Workers 23.1%* Cooks and Food Preparation Workers 22.6%* Construction Trades Workers 20.0%* Helpers, Construction Trades 19.3%* Building Cleaning and Pest Control Workers 19.0%* Food Processing Workers 18.6%What would be the positive benefits if we supported a path to Legal status for all these undocumented workers:* $68 billion: Additional state and local tax revenue that would result from legalization within a decade.* $116 billion: Additional federal tax revenues that would result.* $1.4 trillion: Estimated GDP growth due to legalization.By pretty much every metric,.. we'd be better off simply helping these people become legal.

Academia moves at a snail's pace for multiple reasons, the biggest probably being the need for everything to have a fuckin' lit review that regurgitates what the last 793.02 lit reviews said just so the authors can state their research questions. I could give a whole Foucauldian analysis about how lit reviews exist to continually recreate self-contained discourses, but I digress. The other reason it moves so slowly is because even beyond any single publication, you essentially have to have the entire discipline agree, \\"Yes, this is valid knowledge,\\" which takes a long time. This is probably a good thing at the end of the day, as it keeps things like cold fusion or power posing or vaccines cause autism from being adopted as true. But on the other hand the problem is then what filters down into textbooks is often untimely as to what's actually happening in the world. This is fine for a lot of the humanities. An undergrad in their 101 lit-crit gen end course probably doesn't to know the most recent discourse on a post-colonial reading of *Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man,* but it has problems when it comes to applied courses of study, like engineering, allied health, or business. Take human resources for instance. Any student in an HRM or I/O psych program is going to learn about job analysis and they will most likely learn to use ONet to conduct job analysis. But in the real world, actual HRM professionals are doing job analysis through job family leveling with Radford and Mercer frameworks.

The media is owned by billionaires. Those billionaires are not a monolith. Sure, they all agree with Trump on \\"I want more money\\", but they have some wildly different views on how to achieve that goal. Examples would be the TrumpMusk world versus people like Marc Cuban, George Soros (lol), Bill Gates, JB Pritzker, etc.All those billionaires need their enterprises to continue to function to make money, so talk of tarriffs are a problem for them. Market behaviour seems to indicate that it's not very confident that Trump will be able to make good on his tarriff threats.This should make sense, as the vast majority of enterprises will see a profit margin drop from the as-proposed tarrifs. Sure, they can raise prices to match, but that ignores the economic concept of willingness to pay. You walk to the grocery store, you see a Coke for $2. Seems like a good deal. Tarriffs cause the price to go up by 20%, now that Coke is $2.40, but it still seems like an okay deal. At some price point, you're gonna go \\"no matter what, a Coke is not worth $x.\\"This is true of all goods, and percentage-based price increases affects expensive goods worse. So now the foreign-manufactured half-million dollar SEM you were going buy for your private-sector R&amp;D lab costs a cool extra $100k. Shit, that was your researcher budget. Is there a _domestic_ SEM manufacturer that has not profit-followed the tarriff pricing? You better hope so, but history shows this typically isn't the case, firms will not leave profit on the table, they tend to raise their prices to be _juuuust_ under the tarriff-bearing importers. Back to the purchaser, maybe they aren't going to even start that business division now. Congratulations, tarriffs have depressed a local economy. But _both_ the foreign and domestic manufacturers have lost a sale. Rinse and repeat that until suddenly the billionaires lines are going down instead of up.The #1 thing a corporation needs for success is stability. War is bad for stability (outside of MIC, ie: the vast majority of the economy), civil war is worse. In the democratic, capitalistic system, you have to fight the dilution of power. It's one thing when you've got maybe several dozens of aristocrats and business owners you press into oligarchy under threat of seizure or death, as was the case after the fall of the USSR. There are over 800 billionaires in the USA, and over 20 million millionaires (though they are statistically closer millionaires than billionaires). Trump would never be able to purge enough of them quickly enough to establish dominance. Once the consolidation starts, they would balkanize to protect their interests, and thus we've started the corpo wars.This is actually part of the argument in favour of expanding the House. Without the Apportionment Act of 1929, there'd be over 1,400 members of the House. That's a ton more representatives to bribe, with the added caveat that you have to bribe them enough to agree _with each other_, and you're still doing that _against_ other wealthholders. Clasically, this seems to have worked out to a large degree between both parties. But now you've got MAGA on the Republican side, and they bring the opposite of stability and unity to a party that dominated it for business interests, which is one of the reasons we're seeing so much Republican infighting. Federal non-MAGA Republicans understand the levers they have to make money for their donors, but MAGA reps and people further down the line? They have no clue. Good example is that Florida state lawmaker begging Hispanics to keep coming to the state to work AG jobs. They didn't take two seconds to think their stupid policies could be a death-sentence for their business until _after_ they enacted it.","title":"Democracy dies in darkness!"},{"text":"Not everyone but certainly those aware.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"How's no one pointing out the huge conflict of interest?!

I would like to see local Democratic Party clubs create social arms that can be very loosely affiliated with the party--things designed to create third spaces and fill the social calendars for folks, to fight loneliness and build community. To be clear--these would be events for which the only political link is everyone is an active Democrat. Things such as tabling, canvassing, and community litter clean-up crews would be a separate slate of events run by the local party, but IMO there should be no pressure whatsoever for the people going to the purely fun events to join the ones that have work elements.And! At least some of these fun events should be scheduled for Sunday mornings, to give non-Christian folks a place to hang out.The point, IMO, is to try to deliver what church/temple/mosque/synagogue communities and groups such as the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Lions, Toastmasters, etc try to do or used to do.2.While we should be more aggressive about building a federation of left/liberal/progressive/Democratic party media outlets, IMO, we should not deliberately try to come up with 'our own Joe Rogan'. We should try to nurture multiple personalities in the hopes that one or more will ultimately have the reach of a Joe Rogan, but you can't grow that in a lab. We SHOULD try to circulate talking points to all these outlets, so they can sing from the same hymnal, but in their own unique voices.2a.I want to see more of what I call 'functional journalism'.

I'm informed, but I'm demoralized.

The way he is portrayed as some kind of master strategist by the media makes me mentally implode. Trump does not have a strategy and does not have any genuinely held convictions about anything. All Trump cares about is maximizing power and wealth for himself, and running as a Republican just happened to be the most expedient way of accomplishing this. Even his success at manipulating people is not the result of intelligence, its just who he is. Hes a narcissist. Manipulation comes naturally to him. The only reason he is so successful is because he was born wealthy and has had a never-ending supply of greedy sycophants who were willing to debase themselves in order to prop him up and profit from it.

A big reason they lost this year was because of demoralization of their base. Given that Andrew Yang and Tulsi have left the party, I don't see much hope for the party in general. How do they escape the entrenched Clinton gang and their neoliberal policies so that the party can remoralize their base? Bernie is too old. AOC is not intelligent enough to fight her way out of a paper bag.

He has admitted to participating in the shootout that led to their deaths, but there's basically no evidence that he fired the fatal shots and not the other man present (Coler, who was killed by the FBI shortly after the incident). It's sort of an important distinction, because one of the agents was executed with a pistol after having been wounded. Peltier claims he was firing in self defense, and that may be true, but not if he fired the killing shots after the shootout had subsided.At the time of the shooting, the FBI was using some brutal and nefarious means to suppress Native American activism. They clearly violated people's civil rights on numerous occasions and brutally suppressed the movement. While Peltier was definitely involved in the shooting, there was basically no evidence, and the FBI proceeded to frame him. The FBI intimidated witnesses and concocted evidence against him. Peltier's trial was a travesty of justice.The FBI would be pissed for several reasons if he was pardoned. He was accused of killing FBI agents, and they'd take that personally. More importantly, pardoning him would involve acknowledging that he didn't get a fair trial, in large measure because of the FBI.","title":"Biden Should Use His Pardon Power for More Than Just Turkeys"},{"text":"Democrats should have held Trump accountable for his crimes.","title":"Biden Should Use His Pardon Power for More Than Just Turkeys"},{"text":"Sure the people at home could seriously benefit from military surplus.        \\nBtw, what's your legacy going to be?

Also, Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, have complained about the debanking as well, in cases where it was done to Muslim groups on suspicion of terrorism connections.

If Ukraine cannot get sufficient support then it might be best to cede some territory and live to fight another day rather than be slowly ground into defeat.

Let me know what you think about this: # **Tariffs for Dummies: A Simple Study Guide** **Chapter 1: What Are Tariffs?**\\n**Intro:**  \\nTariffs are like a tax that governments put on goods coming into the country (imports) or going out of the country (exports). They make imported goods more expensive, which can protect businesses in your own country but might also lead to higher prices for shoppers. Tariffs are a tool in a countrys economic toolbox.**Key Words:**\\n- **Tariff:** A tax placed on imported or exported goods.  \\n- **Import:** Goods brought into a country from another country.  \\n- **Export:** Goods sent out of a country to be sold elsewhere.  \\n- **Trade War:** When countries keep adding tariffs on each others goods, leading to higher prices and tension.**Think About This:**  \\n- Why do you think some people support tariffs while others oppose them?  \\n- What would happen if your favorite product, like a video game console or snack, had a high tariff placed on it? **Chapter 2: Why Do Countries Use Tariffs?**\\n**Intro:**  \\nCountries use tariffs for a lot of reasons, like protecting local jobs, encouraging businesses to make things at home, or punishing other countries for unfair trade practices. Its like a country saying, Hey, if you want to sell your stuff here, you have to pay a little extra.**Key Words:**  \\n- **Protectionism:** Policies like tariffs that protect local businesses and workers from foreign competition.  \\n- **Free Trade:** The idea that goods should move between countries without taxes or restrictions.  \\n- **Trade Deficit:** When a country imports more goods than it exports.  **Think About This:**  \\n- If you were running a country, would you use tariffs to protect local jobs, even if it meant higher prices?  \\n- How do you think tariffs affect the relationship between two countries? **Chapter 3: The Pros and Cons of Tariffs**  \\n**Intro:**  \\nTariffs can be helpful and harmful, depending on how theyre used. They can save local jobs, but they might make things more expensive for shoppers. Its a balancing act that governments have to figure out.  **Key Words:**  \\n- **Domestic Industry:** Businesses that make things in your own country.  \\n- **Price Increase:** When tariffs make goods more expensive for consumers.  \\n- **Retaliation:** When another country responds to tariffs with tariffs of their own.  **Pros of Tariffs:**  \\n- Protects local jobs and businesses.  \\n- Encourages companies to make products locally.  \\n- Raises money for the government.  **Cons of Tariffs:**  \\n- Makes things more expensive for consumers.  \\n- Can lead to trade wars.  \\n- Hurts relationships between countries.  **Think About This:**  \\n- What would you think if tariffs protected your job but made everyday items more expensive?  \\n- Should a country always put its own businesses first, even if it upsets other countries? **Chapter 4: Famous Tariff Examples**  \\n**Intro:**  \\nTariffs have been used throughout history to protect industries, punish unfair trade practices, or make a point. Some have worked well, while others caused more harm than good.**Key Words:**  \\n- **Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930):** A U.S. tariff that raised taxes on imports, making the Great Depression worse.  \\n- **Trump Tariffs (2018):** Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods to protect U.S. industries and push for better trade deals.  \\n- **Retaliatory Tariffs:** Tariffs other countries put on U.S. goods in response to U.S. tariffs.  **Think About This:**  \\n- Do you think tariffs are more helpful or harmful overall? Why?  \\n- If you were running a business, how would tariffs on raw materials (like steel or wood) affect you? **Chapter 5: Tariffs and You**  \\n**Intro:**  \\nEven though tariffs sound like a big government thing, they affect your life in small ways. From the price of toys and phones to how much farmers and factory workers earn, tariffs can change the economy in ways we dont always see.**Key Words:**  \\n- **Consumer Impact:** How tariffs affect the prices of things you buy.  \\n- **Supply Chain:** The steps it takes for a product to get from a factory to your home.  \\n- **Global Economy:** How all the countries in the world are connected through trade.  **Think About This:**  \\n- How would you feel if a tariff made your favorite item too expensive to buy?  \\n- Do you think its better to buy something thats cheaper from another country or pay more to support businesses in your own country?   **Thought for the Day:**  \\nTariffs are like a double-edged swordthey can protect some people but hurt others. The challenge is finding the balance that works best for everyone.","title":"Liberals are so stupid."},{"text":"Its also important to emphasize that often the items were sending them are old.

Clyburn of South Carolina, and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, signed a November 20 letter to President Biden, which argued for a bolder embrace of the executive clemency power as a tool for achieving justice and saving taxpayer dollars that are now used to incarcerate Americans who were not convicted of violent crimes and do not pose a threat to society:As you continue to deliver for the American people during the final months of your presidency, we urge you to use your executive clemency power to reunite families, address longstanding injustices in our legal system, and set our nation on the path toward ending mass incarceration.Mass incarceration remains a persistent, systemic injustice that erodes the soul of America. Our nation has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with nearly two million people locked in jails and prisons throughout the country. The extreme use of incarceration has resulted in one in two adults having an incarcerated family member.The letter makes a moral and practical case against mass incarceration, arguing,While the most marginalized Americans feel the worst impacts, the entire country pays the cost of mass incarceration.

There's almost no nation in Europe that has a strategy for its defence that isn't \\"Hold out and wait for America to save us\\"The truth is that America has been willing to spend an outsized amount on defence, while countries in Europe have been desperately scrabbling for savings in their budgets, and democracies at peace love to cut military spending.I hope that a Trump presidency will lead to actual European coordination on defence, but I'm not confident. Ultimately, the countries that are underspending understand that their only real threat is Russia, and that the USA won't sit back and watch Russian tanks roll into Berlin or Paris, regardless of what Trump says. They are also, frankly, in political paralysis, and I have low confidence that the French or German governments will actually do **anything** significant in the next 5 years.The UK has some chance of a coherent military strategy, but ultimately our military is now quite downsized and specialised, and designed explicitly to only really work as a part of NATO, which again means relying on American forces to do the heavy lifting.I can see why people here are parotting the 2% number tbh, if you care about liberal world order stuff then seeing EU democracy essentially shackled to an increasingly authoritarian USA is not a good thing.

The people who vote for trump for his policies have already completely forgotten he was president for 4 years and did exactly 1 thing total while he was in power. Specifically he reduced taxes on billionaires. All the other promises he made them were thrown to the side and shat on.Remember when he said he was gonna repeal and replace the ACA in his first week in office? And then 8 years later when he said he had concepts of a plan for how to do that? Republicans sure dont. Or how he said he was gonna build a wall that would instantly fix illegal immigration? Republicans dont. Anything beyond last week may as well be centuries ago for them.January 6th, where he incited a violent mob to attack the capitol, and got 2 capitol police officers killed, and then did nothing to stop it as his vice president was almost hung. The E Jean Carroll rape trial where trump was found liable for raping her. And the subsequent defamation trials that ruled that Trump saying he didnt rape her is clear and obvious defamation. Because he DID rape her.The New York inflated assets trial that stripped him of his ability to do business in New York due to decades of falsely inflating the value of his assets, and fined him 400 million dollars.The 34 count criminal fraud conviction for using campaign money to pay off stormy daniels through michael cohen.The fact that his supreme court picks helped overturn Roe V Wade and Chevron Deference, some of the most important precedents in american law and reproductive rights.The fact that these same supreme court picks gave him FULL IMMUNITY for presidenial acts. Including but not limited to using the army to assassinate political rivals or unrelated innocent americans.The way he has blatantly copied Hitlers rhetoric and constantly praised hitler behind closed doors, to the concern of even his top generals.Being able to make excuses for all of that, or ignore all of that, makes me lose any shred of respect I might have had for anyone who chose to vote for him.

It wasn't about drug decriminalization, it was about police funding being cut. The other thing the other poster didn't get entirely correct is they didn't go on record saying the intent of reducing traffic enforcement was to link increased deaths to defunding the department. They said the intent of the messaging about reducing traffic enforcement was at least in part to \\"cause a stir\\" to get the city council to \\"fund \\\\[the PPB\\\\] back up\\". They said this while also admitting that the messaging may have made the situation more dangerous. Ok, long post explaining my understanding of the situation:  [In 2020, Portland cut the Portland Police Bureau budget by $15M.](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-police-budget-15-million-defund-cannabis-council-vote/) This was at the height of the George Floyd protests and \\"Defund the Police\\" was in full swing at that point. The budget cuts didn't impact the Traffic Division specifically at that time. Later that year, in October, another $18 million cut was proposed by the city council. In response the PPB and it's union, the PPA, basically said that if this was passed the traffic division would go away (among other consequences). The additional $18 million cut failed to pass. Then in late 2020, [the Chief of Police announced a reorganization plan](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/12/portland-police-to-move-traffic-officers-canine-cops-to-patrol-next-year-to-fill-shifts-cut-overtime-and-improve-response-times.html) that was designed to address a $1.5M budget deficit as well as a staffing shortage (the shortage was due in part to a large number of retirements and separations in 2020 as well as difficulty recruiting/hiring new officers and made worse by the budget deficit). Then in 2021 the PPB did something... a little weird. They started publicizing the fact that Portland had very little if any (i.e. one dedicated officer) Traffic Enforcement. This included things like[ this news interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs8sGYiTV18) where they highlighted they were down to just 1 motorcycle officer for traffic enforcement from 19 and this follow up article.  In November, PPB held a [press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgcWqhEyAkg) led by the lone traffic officer where they directly linked the increase in traffic fatalities to the staffing shortages and budget issues. Some thought it was odd that the PPB was so widely publicizing the fact that there was little ability to enforce traffic laws. Between 2022 a new budget for the PPB was passed which brought the amount budgeted above where it was in 2019 so the PPB budget was pretty much fully restored after a 2 year dip. In 2023, they announced the return of the Traffic Division. At the press conference announcing the division was returning the officer was asked what PPB would do in the short term to make streets safer and he said:what were doing right now is trying to be as visible as possible to just try and make ourselves look bigger than perhaps we really are,The reporter who asked that question asked a follow up basically asking why in 2021 they felt the correct course was to publicize how little enforcement they had while in 2023 their main strategy to make streets safer is to overemphasize how much enforcement they had. The officer responded:We needed to create a stir to get some change, to get them \\\\[city council\\\\] to fund us back up. And I mean, thats the honest truth. I know, that could make things more dangerous. I dont know. But at the same time, we needed some change.Some people, specifically the reporter who gave the question, interpreted that the decision to at the very least publicize the downsizing of the traffic division was politically motivated to \\"create a stir\\" that would get the city council to change it's course on funding the department. This was done knowing that it \\"could make things more dangerous\\". [That reporter then wrote up an opinion piece discussing all this](https://bikeportland.org/2023/08/08/portland-police-bureau-officer-admits-no-traffic-enforcement-messaging-was-politically-motivated-377939) which [got shared to the Portland subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/15lqxvs/portland_police_bureau_officer_admits_traffic/) and got quite a bit of visibility at the time.","title":"Democrats win supermajority in Oregon House, Senate, with narrow win in Woodburn"},{"text":"Wood Restoration and Finishing","title":"What's a hobbie and/or habit you started during the pandemic(Ongoing or not)?"},{"text":"Project for the slapping of bass?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"His lackadaisical attitude, as well as all dem party leaders whoops teehee reaction is insanely annoying.
