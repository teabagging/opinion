How will it make the situation even worse, in your view?

Peaceful protestors got teargassed at their own church for a photo op, people walking down the street in Portland got scooped up by unmarked feds in black vans for maybe being at the protest earlier in the day, Trump already said he wants police to shoot protestors \\"in the leg\\" the first time around, and this time there'll be a lot less people willing to say \\"no.\\" We can't assume good faith or adherence to the constitution from the Trump DoJ anymore. Meanwhile, the victims being armed means that it will take a lot more energy and personal risk to disappear them in the night. The enemy is going to be more cautious and less brazen, and thus move more slowly... If we're armed. When we need to keep them moving as slow as possible in hopes that we can retake a legislative majority over whatever fuckery they attempt in 2026 before they can fully dispense with the polite fiction of the legislative process to even begin to salvage it, this is important. The race here is between whether the baddies can dismantle rule of law fast enough or whether we can retake the legislative branch to try and reimpose checks and balances. The people they're trying to repress being armed helps buy us time by dint of making the baddies work more slowly and cautiously.Remember, fascists thrive on normalizing insane things and getting people to look away. A brownshirt tactical team breaking into a dissident's house and having a firefight that wakes your whole neighborhood is a lot harder to normalize than a pair of them knocking on your door and leading your unarmed ass away in handcuffs.The game has changed, we're in early stage fascist takeover territory now. In a normal democracy, guns have no real political purpose, I agree. But we aren't in a normal democracy anymore. There's a reason why dictators always try to disarm their people first, and the reason I'm somewhat optimistic now is how alien the idea of disarmament is to the American culture. I hate how insane it is that I even need to think about this. I want to think that guns should just be a fun hobby, I shouldn't have to rely on their presence to dissuade a tyrannical fascist government. But here we are.

People are willing to accept that they had traded some of their integrity for a larger reward (\\"yeah I did a little white lie but who wouldn't for $50?\\") But people were not willing to believe they had traded some of their integrity for an insignificant reward (\\"yeah I said that for $5, but it wasn't even really a lie, it was basically true\\").I warned about this in November of 2016.

With Trump getting an overall 46.86% of the votes the difference in how much each partys vote total grew one election cycle to the next was only 4.1 million people, or 2.64% of the entire voting population The numbers op posted dont show what he thinks they show, but show virtually prove there was no voting tampering at any scale in 2020 the difference could very easily be explained away by people straight up hating Trump, Trump literally telling people not to vote and that voting by mail, the primary method of voting in that election, was pointless, and the large number of deaths of largely Trump supporting voters due to his mishandling of the pandemic and states being stupid with their policies","title":"The left is shocked that Trump won the popular vote.

Democrats lost margins in every demographic, every racial base, 99% of blue and red counties, and every cross-tab except college educated women (barely). We need to start fixing this now. A lot of these \\"you'll get what you deserve\\" and \\"America revealed it's horrible\\" messages do nothing but deepen the Democratic circlejerk and further alienate most voters. Dems don't need that, they need to win. If Democrats are in power, better social justice will follow. But they need to get in power first.Existing Democratic policies are very popular. More than enough to win elections, as down ballot propositions showed. But the messaging recently has been too entirely focused on the social issues and evils of Trump as a person. This isn't working. The only demographics Dems improved on in the election are college educated women and people making over 100k. The post-covid recovery has been very uneven, and the gap between those doing well and not have widened. Only those privileged enough have the capacity to vote on others' social issues. The bulk of voters vote on their own priorities. We need to speak to their priorities better instead of just lecturing them.I've been doing some exit-poll research. Very few new Trump voters did it to support him. Nobody did it because they want fascism, or want to harm women or migrants or Ukraine.Overwhelmingly, they voted Republican for themselves. We shouldn't be asking \\"how could you support XYZ horrible thing\\" and we should be asking \\"what are your needs\\". We shouldn't be telling them about Trump's latest disgusting behavior but telling them how Dem policies will make their lives better. Interestingly, Trump's turnout and votes from his base dropped a lot since 2020. He more than made up for it with new voters and flipped independents. Those paying attention on both sides are rejecting (or tired of) his hatred and messaging, yet there are a LOT more voters who are simply less engaged who overwhelmingly voted for him. Not because they wanted a fascist, but because they want lower taxes, lower prices, a better economy, and safe borders (related to economy). The Dem response needs to address these issues, instead of focusing on Trump/GOP's negatives (voters are exhausted/disbelieving and won't engage) or protecting marginalized groups (LGBTQ, Trans, Migrants, other countries, Geopolitics, etc).

The year of 2019 was one of the deepest years in movies although Game of Thrones final season did suck. Finances and entertainment were better 5 years ago. Here we go again. Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars will be released while Trump is President. I think 2024 is my best year ever since 2017-2019. And I think 2025 and beyond can match those years or surpass them.2024 Election = best election results ever!!!I love the 2016 election too but even Trump supporters didnt expect Trump to win. That was quite a shock for everyone on both sides. But in 2024, we had expectations he could win and he did. It feels like my Clippers finally winning a championship. Thats how I feel with Trump being re-elected. Great year for me! Trump winning was the icing on the cake.I dont care if my Thanksgiving and Christmas this year ends up being boring which is usually the case since 2009. Trump won and thats all I care about!

The election was decided largely by low-information, low-affiliation voters who have no fucking clue what's going on and voted for what they thought would be best for their wallets. Inflation was up, so they decided Biden was bad for their wallets; Kamala is Biden's VP, so they decided Kamala was bad too (although I'd be willing to bet a good number of them actually still have no idea who Kamala is). Trump was the president when prices were low, so they decided Trump was good. Overall, the vast majority of the American electorate wants to hear that things will be good for them, and Dems failed to reach them with the right message and through the right channels. Some voters are swayed by messaging on abortion and social justice. There's a good number of slobbering MAGA morons who will take everything Trump says as law. But I don't think either of these groups are large enough to decide an election. The play to winning an election is to sway people who don't typically care about politics, and Trump has historically been very good at this. Biden only won in 2020 because the effects of Trump's disastrous pandemic management were very observable to even people who don't care about politics, and it started to affect them too. What I mean to say is that Dems can push as hard to the left as they want, just like Trump pushed as hard to the right as he could without any consequences whatsoever, because most voters literally do not care. In fact, I think pushing harder to the left should have been what Dems did, because trying to play to the center ended up alienating a lot of further-left voters while doing very little to sway voters across party lines. You just have to couple it with an economic message that resonates with your average highly uninformed American.","title":"New York Democrat: Far left has outsized impact in shaping perception of party"},{"text":"Failing to pass and fight for important populist and popular policies should force Schumer to resign in disgrace, and his replacement should be re-elected.

Gabriel here at the Sunday Times.Am I allowed to be solipsistic and start with Britain?

It was a remark which spoke to the mismatch between a) Blair's profoundly felt Catholicism on one hand and b) his aversion to discussing religion on the other. This which was itself a result of Britain's growing secularisation - a trend with has only accelerated since.Trump's situation in some ways resembles the opposite of  the above. He is not a conventional Christian or conservative - nobody would accuse him of that -  but he has consciously and effectively used God, prior to and during this campaign. Meanwhile fewer Americans believe in God than they once did but faith continues to feature front and centre of your great republic's national life.The big recent development seems to be the sheer explicitness with which Trump has cloaked his survival of an assassination attempt in religious language - which, by the way, I am not for a moment saying is not sincere.In 2016, Trump's alliance with the conservative / religious right was one of the big stories - I hope you hold me to account on this, as we are only a couple days after the contest, but my sense is this contest won't be defined by that, but rather the way Trump has deepened and broadened his coalition beyond its 2016 complexion.","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

But I think the \\"deals\\" he will try to strike could be very destabilising and realign regional balances of power in ways that are very unpredictable. A good example - though very technical - is when he tried to do a deal with President Erdogan of Turkey during his last presidency about America's support for the Kurds in north-east Syria. Suddenly a complex situation which had a simple purpose - building an alliance of forces against Islamic State - suddenly got a whole lot worse. There was a brief war inside Syria between Turkey and the Kurds, US troops were stuck in the middle, Russia came in as a mediator and suddenly you had Russian and American troops squaring up in a remote part of the Syrian desert. It sounds like something you wouldn't make up in the craziest war movie, but it happened.   \\nEventually things calmed down, but imagine something similar happening on one of the current conflict lines in the Middle East, or in the Far East...  \\nAs for Israel - this is a really big question. What is Trump's bottom line for US support for Israel? Will he support an expansion of the war to Iran? Again, my feeling is that there is a bottom line, but the idea that there isn't could make the war worse. Of course, as some have suggested, if he really did tell Netanyahu to stop the war Netanyahu would listen to him more than he does to Biden - but whether there would be any incentive to find a longer term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another matter.  \\nRichard Spencer","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

And whether they were directly told that or not, it's easy to see why they might feel like that is the Democratic messaging. I also think this failed with lower income people of color who see the democratic talking points as hallow promises that do little to actually improve their lives. Trump made headways in every single racial group this election and I think a big reason is because people are tired of it.I think the path forward is for the democratic party to focus on improving the economic conditions of lower and middle income people regardless of race. This will include many people of color as well as many white people.

Worse, I think Biden openly telegraphing things like picking a woman for VP, or a black woman for SCOTUS, just further divided minorities and drove the narrative that Dems were playing favorites with certain groupsAnd I seriously mean this has been going on for decades. Take a look at the Clinton Sister Souljah moment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtSifopiL1gSouljah: Yeah, it was wise. I mean, if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?... White people, this government and that mayor were well aware of the fact that black people were dying every day in Los Angeles under gang violence. So if you're a gang member and you would normally be killing somebody, why not kill a white person? Do you think that somebody thinks that white people are better, are above and beyond dying, when they would kill their own kind?AndSouljah: You can't call me or any black person in the world a racist. We don't have the power to do to white people what white people have done to us. And even if we did, we don't have that low down dirty nature. If there are any good white people, I haven't met themYou could literally imagine some far left activists saying that same shit today (oh wait, some do). And that shit gets amplified a million times now with social media, so when the Democrats hem and haw about it, it rapidly becomes portrayed about how the Democrats are actually the racists.So what did Clinton do?

Our policies will help them, but no one is talking to them to show them that. They certainly aren't taking the time on their own to be informed.4. Information bubbles are strong, and until we interject into those bubbles, they will stay.5. How we discuss politics is extremely important. The more we approach conversations as debates/arguments, the more polarized people become, ourselves included.The takeaway is this: We need to devise clear, effective forms of communication with the entirety of the electorate, including the poor and uneducated. We need to help them understand basic public policy paradigms. We need to work on helping people depolarize, and have a vested interest in politics. The 'None of this matters' mantra has to be rebutted, gently. And last, we need them to think their informed opinion is their own and that it isn't being force fed to them (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-political-opinions-change/).","title":"The Democratic Party needs to be rebuilt or replaced entirely after last night.

Best scenario - there's a ceasefire. Worst scenario - the conflict escalates, as does the tit for tat with Iran and Trump supports Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear sites. In terms of Ukraine - best scenario - Biden ramps up support - allocates the billions already promised - and loosens restrictions on allowing Ukraine to fire long range weapons inside Russia. Then Ukraine is in the strongest position possible when Trump comes in and tries to forge some sort of deal. Worst case - Trump comes in and Ukraine is in a weak position (Russia continues its slow grinding assault) and Ukraine is forced by Trump to give up swathes of its territory because he threatens to pull US aid if they don't.

I cannot agree more with Ezra Klein's assessment of what just happened:*Harris was burdened by all that had come before her. The Democratic Party had spent years kicking people out of its tent. I went and listened to the appearance Elon Musk made on Joe Rogans podcast on Monday. It was strikingly right wing and conspiratorial. It wasnt that many years ago that Rogan had Bernie Sanders on for a friendly interview. And then Rogan kinda sorta endorsed him. Rather than celebrate, online liberals were furious at Sanders for going on 'Rogan' in the first place. Rogan was a transphobe, an Islamophobe, a sexist, a racist, the kind of person you wanted to marginalize, not chat with. But if these last years have proved anything, its that liberals dont get to choose who is marginalized. Democrats should have been going on 'Rogan' regularly. They should have been prioritizing it  and other podcasts like it  this year. Yes, Harris should have been there. Same for Tim Walz. On YouTube alone, Rogans interview with Trump was viewed some 46 million times. Democrats are just going to abandon that? In an election where they think that if the other side wins, it means fascism?*Incidentally, Ezra was one of the first voices calling for Biden to not run again all the way back in February. And he was right. This wasn't based on \\"vibes\\" or any policy disagreement. It was right there in the polling. 75% of Americans felt he was too old to run again. His approval rating was underwater. His policy on Israel-Gaza had set off a firestorm of anger among a key voting demographic: young people. Add the aforementioned refusal to engage with anyone we disagree with and you have a recipe for disaster. As Ezra very eloquently puts it: Trump didn't win. We lost.It's time for my fellow lefties to wake up. Crass jokes are crass. They're gross. But it doesn't mean the people that tell them should be written off. We live in a democracy and you campaign with the electorate you HAVE, not the electorate you WANT. I've been saying this since 2016 when people were livid that so many young people preferred Bernie over Hillary. You speak to the people you need to win, making the case for your righteous progressive policies in a language THEY can understand. Not the language you think they should speak.I know there is a lot of anger and fear out there right now. I've felt it too and what's coming for us in a couple months will likely be absolutely terrible. But, BUT, that does not mean we get to spit on those who delivered this result on Tuesday. It's a quantifiable fact that they are the majority. Sorry, that's the reality. Now we must engage with that and do something about it. It starts with reaching out. If that makes you uncomfortable, it's totally natural. But it's also the mature response required and what the future of the country demands.There's a difference between suppressing a reactionary response to the feeling of being offended, and compromising your morals. That lesson MUST be learned. Just because something offends you, no matter how justified, doesn't mean that you get to then completely ignore the person who says or does the offensive thing. That's how a society crumbles.

During his last presidency, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels imported from China - it didn't do anything to stop Chinese domination of the solar panels industry, where it now has 80 per cent of global manufacturing, but it did cause big lay offs in the US solar panel installation industry for a while as prices went up and sales down.  \\nChina isn't shrugging its shoulders about this threat. Trump's said he would impose 60 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from China, and that would be a big blow. China's economy is struggling a bit at the moment (though its 4-5 per cent growth this year is only bad compared to previous years). However,  China has seen it coming - Biden also raised tariffs, and the threat from Trump was always clear. So it's acted to seek out new markets for its products particularly in South East Asia and Africa. You can see that if you go anywhere outside Europe and America - suddenly you see all these car models you don't know on the roads. Look closely and they are Chinese.  \\nWhether Trump actually goes ahead I don't really know. It's quite interesting looking at how close Elon Musk has become to Trump. We tend to look at this just through the prism of Twitter/X and the two men's shared love of the limelight - birds of a feather, if you like. But Musk has clear commercial interests here. Tesla has a massive factory in China, and sold $22 billion of cars in China last year. That's big.

Weve known for decades that when progressive policy is presented without ideological baggage, its overwhelmingly popular. And we see that in these ideologically inconsistent voting patterns.  But it is the allegiance to the in-group identity - and that means voting for Trump and his chosen bag of idiots - that gives the individual identity its validation.  We just had a Hot Labor Summer, with more administration support than any in my lifetime, resulting in rising wages for entire industries, and important conversations about AI and automation, and these issues should have been hammered home to every voter in every speech or appearance.  I agree that watching the Dems once again fall into the trap of talking about Trump at all, and courting the center Right is frustrating, as it doesnt work. Be honest and sell your victories. Be fearless in moral issues, and drag the voters there with you. Absolutely, this cowardice sucks.  But its not why they lost.   They lost because a coalition of the worst fucking people in the world wrapped their whole identities around a malignant narcissist, and fostered an addiction to pwning the libs in this aggrievement/persecution fantasy and fed it relentlessly to anyone they could find through as many seemingly unrelated outlets as possible.  How the least talented member of NewsRadio and a Ron Paul devotee who used to be a third rate Art Bell clone ended up blackpilling a generation of GamerGaters into voting for a theocratic regime that wants to take away their tentacle porn makes no fucking sense.  But here we are. Because its literally a narcissistic identity cult, built out of many smaller narcissistic identity cults that metastasized into a national if not global cancer.  And the institutions charged with preventing this sort of thing did fuck all about it - Trump should have been yeeted from office in the first impeachment but we have bad faith actors who supported the cult over the country. Or the second time. Or from any of his indictments. Or if he had been sentenced to jail for his felony convictions. Or had been forced to give up his actual judgements in his rape case.

Let me begin by saying something journalists probably ought to say more regularly. I don't know. However, my instincts are as follows. \\\\- Trump is self-evidently pro-Israel. You will recall he was the president who caved to longstanding campaign to move the US embassy to Jersualem. And he was an architect of the Abraham Accords which sought to marginalise the Palestinian question in favour of a wider geostrategic realignment against Iran and which was supposed to be Bibi Netanyahu's signature foreign policy achievement when it was unveiled in the Rose Garden.   \\nHOWEVER, Trump is guided by nothing if not self-interest and has no deeper or more abiding instinct than his opposition to costly foreign entanglements. He may be more anti-that than he is pro-Israel in relation to the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. He also has a complex relationship with Netanyahu who was one of the early world leaders to welcome Biden's victory back in 2020. There is a third, newer dimension to the question too, which is that Trump won, and, in his victory speech, celebrated winning, a lot of Arab and Muslim votes this week.For that reason I can envisage a situation where he tells Netanyahu it's time to wrap up the conflict - he won't quibble with the underlying goals or the notion of Israel's right to self defence but may well tell him to hasten its resolution. I'll leave the other bits to my esteemed colleagues.","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

As someone who doesn't belong in their own family. losing that creates mountains of dysregulation. With that said, I don't it's unlimited tolerance. If being around your family creates dysregulation and impairs your mental health, then cut ties. Racist views are on a spectrum. Even people who are well-meaning can be inadvertently racist. I work for Native American communities and you have no idea how many liberals believe in the \\"noble savage\\" theory and think of themselves as allies. That can be expressed by, \\"Oh Natives are one with nature\\" without realizing how racist that is. But the other out range is the people who agreed with \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\"So that's why you'd have no limiting principle and you'd have to cut ties with a lot of people.

It is pretty amazing for someone to be complaining how money and corporate interests are too strong in the Democratic party, abandoning working class people. If you think the Democratic party is too corporate and anti-worker, then I'm not sure what someone would make of the Republican party. President-Elect Trump is famously anti-union anti-worker anti-minority and anti-women.He ran a campaign that was overwhelmingly concentrated on racist, sexist anti-immigrant propaganda and whose biggest supporter is famously a right-wing billionaire and whose VP believes that child-less people should have fewer voting rights. Yet he convinced an historic number of minorities to vote for him.So obviously the issue is that the Democratic National Committee is too corporate and focused on wealthy people rather than the working class. You can go ask almost any Cuban American and they will tell you that people like Bernie Sanders are exactly the reason why they don't vote for the Democrats. I completely agree that the Democratic party has long done a terrible job at outreach to the various minorities instead spending too much time doing performative identity politics rather than trying to actually solve the issues of its constituents. But people voted for Trump because they falsely believed that he was going to be better for the economy, despite almost every CEO and competent financial institution being very clear that his financial and immigration proposals were a recipe for disaster, not to mention his proposals for running the healthcare and missile defense systems.And, again, I am not anti-Bernie but sometimes he really is less than useful.","title":"Bernie Sanders excoriates Democratic Party, calls campaign 'disastrous' after Trump victory"},{"text":"Is it possible that they didnt vote, or changed their mind on how they stood?Serious question, not trying to be a dick in any kind of way.","title":"Where did the missing 15 million Democrats go?"},{"text":"I think you are absolutely correct.

What about states that have enshrined into their state constitutions?HIPAA repealpossibly easy to repeal on surface, but is actually quite entangled in process.Same-sex marriage dissolutionwhat actually happens with something like this when you have millions of people married?

How do they report income differently?Homosexualitywhat actually happens if you make this a form of pedophilia? What resources will logistically be in place to process removal of children?

The management and owners who influence those decisions are all decidedly right leaning, or at a minimum open to currying favor with Trump by putting their thumb on the scale.Harris' campaign was almost by-the-book perfect and beat Trump's in almost every metric and it didn't matter at all. Campaigns do not matter when far right wingers and their sympathizers can exert vast amounts of influence over the channels we use to disseminate information and establish consensus about reality. There is no liberal equivalent of the pipeline that snowballs shitposts into headlines. This is the playing field we need to fighting on, and aggressively.","title":"A liberal technocratic coalition can't win against populism if we don't address the two realities problem."},{"text":" Male feminists have been a huge right wing meme for forever.As a white dude who works in the O&amp;G Industry, and have been reasonably open at work why I think female empowerment in our business is a good thing, the above comment is ?? on point.

This year, the strategy plainly failed, according to exit polls from Edison Research.Harris only received 5 percent of Republican votes  less than the 6 percent Joe Biden won in 2020 when he beat Trump, as well as the 7 percent won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 when she lost to him.

Due to the shift in wealth and resulting income disparity i.e. the wealth gap, since the time of Reagan working class people have felt the squeeze more than any other group. Really poor people get some social safety net benefits and the rich are, well, rich. Working class people feel inflation more acutely than most and wages have not kept pace like it should considering the gains by big business. After Covid and the recession, housing costs, etc , people want change. Radical change. The kind of change Bernie Sanders has been talking about for years. It became obvious after Obama did not usher in the changes people hoped for, and then establishment Hillary was pushed on to the nomination despite her unpopularity, the Democratic Party was not going to get behind radical new ideas. But who was? A con man that would say anything to get a vote. He tapped into the realization that most Americans, particularly low education Americans, are almost solely concerned with their own personal situation and would support him if he said what they were feeling in their hearts. They know he is a con man and an all around piece of shit, and doesnt mean anything he says,  what he does say gives them a kind of hope, and thats what people vote for. Hope. They dont want to vote for him but after Biden hung on too long and then Harris was a take it or leave it candidate, a continuation of the status quo, they  rejected her and went back to their abusive boyfriend. Even though he cheats and lies and generally treats them with distain, there is the small hope that he will shake things up and make it different. At the end of the day, people are just animals that want to be safe and comfortable. Many democratic leaning people who saw the same old same old, sat out. Trump gained ground in every group except black women. Something like 15 million just didnt vote. People are tired and scared and want something better than what the present Democrats are offering.

Here's the sad truth: nazism beats 1% loss of control to populism. Given that choice, the establishment will always pick capital. So, rather than allow a small chance for a progressive like Bernie to win the primary and be the nominee, they purposefully waited til the very last min, shit down their leg, and selected Kamala for their ticket-head in a \\"panic\\" without asking the voters once. Why? Cause progressives have gotten closer and closer to getting the reigns of power in years past and they can't risk that. If they actually cared about democracy, or winning elections, or even opposing the right, they'd champion progressive and grassroot causes, not pick the person who came in dead last behind Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Biden, AND Elizabeth Warren. Even now-Republican Tulsi Gabbard got a pledged delegate from the Dem primary in 2020! And you know who didn't get a single one? Kamala.I remember telling my wife she'd be Hillary 2.0 (the establishment darling) in 2020, was obvious that big money interests and party leaders loved her. Yet again they got their way, and yet again they were wrong. I honestly thot Biden would step aside after being elected and she'd be our first appointed president. Came damn-close to that 4 years later as she was being shoved down our throats. I'm all for women and ppl of color in positions of power, and yes America is plenty bigoted, but skin color and gender are not a qualification, to believe so is racist. Do you take corporate money or do you raise clean campaign money, do you support climate action, Gaza action, prison reform, wall st reform, lgbq rights, education reform, healthcare reform... those are qualifications. So sick and tired of identity politics and the establishment shoving their picks down our throats. That AIN'T democracy so idk what ppl thought they were \\"saving\\".Obviously there's plenty of blame to go around, but the party telling you to preserve democracy by voting for who they selected for you couldn't even beat a fascist felon. They're feckless failures and they'll learn the wrong lessons yet again, get more corrupt, and blame the progressive wing of the party.  Wouldn't be surprised to see them blame the voters too, and Gaza and everything mentioned above, pretty much anyone but themselves. Just the way it goes when you're the Washinton Generals and you're only real job is to make the Harlem Globetrotters look good, get dunked on, dribbled around, and somehow make it all seem like it's a legit competition.

They have no idea what it takes to win because they feel a certain sense of superiority in their futile claims of I told you so,  it would be so much better if you listened to me. They enjoy gloating over the loss of power as if it were a badge of honour, completely satisfied wallowing in self pity of the righteous losers. They should take a page from the book of Tex Cruz who overcame the disrespect shown to his  ugly wife and assassin father to suck up and secure another term in office where he could further restrict female autonomy, voting rights, and workers protections. They should learn from the Republicans who voted for a racist sex offender just to see those liberal tears. They should learn from the conservatives who hate Trump but hate those cat and dog eating immigrants more. They should fucking learn how to win. The challenge for the left is that it is a coalition of diverse, positive motives, which can be inherently weaker than a comition driven by regativity. Its easier to rally around a single negative lssue than to find broad satisfaction in a positive one. Republican voters, for instance, may only need to latch onto one of many targets of resentment to motivate them to vote whether its opposition to LGBTQ rights, immigration, people of color, non-Christians, or womens autonomy. Any one of these grievances can drive them to vote for their party.\\nIn contrast, voters on the left often require not only that their favored causes be represented, but also that there are no significant compromises. Any perceived devimtion from their ideal can lead to disengagement. For example, a candidate may support LGBTO rights, but If thayre seen as too close to corporate interests, thay lose support. They may champion womens autonomy but face criticism for being too permissive on transgender rights. This constant demand for ideological purity and the Inability to accept imperfections make it harder to unify and mobilize left-waning voters.\\nAs a result, the left often struggles with voter turnout, while the rights simplicity of focus generates higher engagament. After a loss, many leftist voters react with frustration, protesting and hoping for an Ideal candidate next time, though this pursuit of utopia is unrenlistic. Ultimately, the left may lack the pragmatic maturity needed for real-work politics, leading to marginal victories at best when they do win. If you cant be arsed to get out and vote for an administration whose President walked the picket line, you dont deserve to win.","title":"Guess I got in trouble for acknowledging the elephant in the room.

She had like one real stumble during the campaign, which was when she said she couldn't think of anything she would have done differently than Biden, and otherwise she was basically flawless in her responses and messaging.

Deny truth and create alternate facts, fiction, or fantasy.? Deny science and substitute religion. Propagandize with false information and conspiracy theories.* Weaponize religious ideology to support the regimes agenda.* Control the courts; bully, delegitimize and politicize the judiciary. Control judicial elections and appointments so only those loyal to the party line become judges; take control of the judicial branch and eliminate constitutional separation of powers and checks and balances.* Destroy the Rule of LawCuse laws to reward supporters and punish opponents; ignore laws not in accord with the party line; ignore court orders, disrespect civil authority. Knowingly enact unconstitutional laws; then blame activist judges when those laws are challenged and overturned.* Politicize the civil service, military and domestic security.* Involve government in surveilling the press, reporters, political opponents and those on the enemies list.* Fearmonger and demonize minorities, LGBTQ+communities, transgender resident, the disabled, immigrants, and the powerless; make them the scapegoats for societies social and economic ills. Weaponize and inflame racial and social prejudices.* Trash civil rights and liberties in favor of partisan and religious ideology.?* Marginalize and bully women; trash their gender-specific rights and needs; empower government to control their reproductive functions; keep them submissive to the patriarchy.?* Disenfranchise voters. Promote spurious conspiracy theories and lies claiming election fraud, stolen elections and voting irregularities. Demand recounts and audits of elections held and certified in accordance with governing laws. Sue on false claims without evidentiary support. Suppress the vote and make it harder and more inconvenient to vote. Subvert election results. Gerrymander and do everything possible to rig the system so that only the party faithful are elected. Empower the legislature to ignore the popular vote and change the results of elections. Hold on to power at all costs and with any tactics.These bastards are highly organized. Everyone has their own part to play. As they bring more trusted people into the mix, theyre able to further divide teams into different approaches to achieving the same goal. Take misinformation.

You can stand outside the sphere and go \\"actually, crime is statistically lower\\" and be technically correct, but that's so dismissive to someone who feels like crime is a problem.For example: A lot of people in right-wing spheres are upset about smash-and-grab retail theft. [Statistically, that crime is not increasing (though media coverage is) and arresting perpetrators of retail theft doesn't actually reduce property crime.](https://justjournalism.org/page/retail-theft)So what's the solution? Do we just tell people they're wrong, it's not actually a problem? No. Even if it's a fringe issue, it's a fringe issue a lot of people care about and it does affect real people. People on the right care about small business owners. We should voice how we're going address retail theft, even if retail theft isn't marginally worse than it was in years past.To flip this around. Trans rights is something this sub is passionate about. Someone outside of our sphere could tell us \\"Actually, trans rights have improved over the past years and they make up a very small percentage of the population.\\" Would we accept that as good enough either? No. Because it's an issue and a people group we care about.Inflation is an even easier example. When people are upset about inflation, they're not upset about the actual rate of inflation. They aren't using it as a technical term. They're upset that gas costs more money. Rather than arguing about the definition, address the concern. How can we make gas more affordable?We have to push past \\"technically accurate\\" and stop dismissing people just because they're wrong.

People that dont have much (or anything) invested in stocks dont care if it goes up, especially when their lifestyle has suffered.Dems dont just need to accept that they feel that way, they need to *focus* on it. If the everyday American thinks that they are worse off than they were 4 years ago (and in many cases its true), they need to focus on how they can help those Americans rather than try and convince them that everything is actually fine and their perception is wrong.","title":"A liberal technocratic coalition can't win against populism if we don't address the two realities problem."},{"text":"https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2019-12-11/joe-biden-suggests-he-would-only-serve-one-term-if-elected-president","title":"Democrats blame Joe Biden for Harris' loss to Trump'if he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place'"},{"text":"How old is he?

Preferably physically get people away from any sources of bad information. The more difficult finding bad information is, the less bad information people are going to get.From the perspective of information warfare, the truth is totally irrelevant. The goal here is to lay the ground work to totally manipulate the what the person thinks when considering a specific goal.

That does not automatically translate into a pandemic. It has to have an R0 of over 1 to actually be able to efficiently transmit and spread on its own. It has to be *well over 1* to be able to turn into a pandemic on par with Covid. Just to give an idea,  SARS had an R0 of *3.5* and we were able to contain it. No flu has ever even come close to 3.5. It is more likely that bird flu is going to become endemic in animals and spread to humans in clusters in poor agricultural regions where people work directly with animals a lot. You might hear on the news every once in a while \\"2,000 dead in bird flu outbreak in tanzania\\" or something along those lines. A combination of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission will enable it to spread faster in those areas. But due to the relatively naturally low R0 threshold of influenza, it will likely not reach an R0 high enough to become a truly global pandemic. You might ask \\"but normal flu transmits just  fine at a low R0!\\", yes, because we take zero precautions against it. Even just very basic barebones precautions such as wearing a mask when you get a little sick or sanitizing public spaces can drop the R0 massively.Pandemic threat #1 is still coronaviruses.

The problem is that workers have abandoned workers.

But, I don't think that means it's time to abandon the Democratic Party in a general sense. Primarily, I think this because there is no viable alternative on a national scale. We need electoral and campaign finance reform, and we need it yesterday. One of the top priorities should be to create more intense pressure to make those things happen. Even small victories for reforming our electoral process will make future victories more achievable. They may not learn the lesson, but with some work, we can force it on them whether they like it or not. It's more important than ever for progressives, either in the party or outside of it, to build power from the ground up. There is a dire need for a viable progressive party, but one thing that makes the current alternatives less palatable is the public perception that they only pop up every four years to try to spoil the presidential election. We need that shit to happen starting from the ground, all the way down in the dirt of hyper-local politics. School boards. City councils. Get independents and open progressives in visible local offices. Get them in the state legislatures. Get them in the House. Get them in the Senate. Get them in the White House. Each tier of this ladder is easier to climb if you've done the work of climbing up the previous rungs. And, if you increase the number of politically involved, local office-holders, those people will, in turn, have a bigger seat at the table when it comes to influencing the local Democratic Party offices. Play the long game. It took 50 years to overturn Roe v Wade, but they did it, because some Republican operatives understand how to build long term, institutional power.Also, I recognize the usefulness of people working within the Democratic Party if they are more friendly toward progressive goals, even if they aren't perfect and they disappoint by occasionally towing the party line. Dragging that window slowly to the left means dragging it through territory that is left of where the Dems are now, but still not where I want them to be. Moving into that territory is progress, and should be celebrated as progress, rather than lamented because they didn't go as far as you want them to. Reward the movement, but then keep pulling.","title":"Guess I got in trouble for acknowledging the elephant in the room. How do the actual leftist feel about the democratic party?

There are a few reasons why people have been duped into voting against their own interests.1. Religion - The party is still seen as the family values party, but in small to mid size towns, churches are also act like a country club for the middle to the lower class. Most people arent going to get on board with something that is going to ostracize them from something that is a big part of their social life.2. You have a lot of people in the middle that feel like they are the only ones chipping in tax dollars and not getting anything in return. All they see are the taxes that they pay and its either going to corporate bailouts or welfare. You have to throw the middle class a bone every once in a while whether its a policy that raises wages, maybe its Bernies 32 hour work week.  But most people feel like theyre like Al Bundy sitting on the couch passing out money to everyone until he looks down and theres nothing left for him.This is why so many would just rather burn it down then listen to anyone trying to fix it.  When you feel like youre part of a society and contributing and dont feel like youre getting anything of the reward you get a bunch of disgruntled people.  This is probably why so many of them are doomsday preppers and dream about living in a post apocalyptic world.3. Guns - they want guns because in the back of their mind they want to be prepared for that post apocalyptic life theyve been planning for and its one thing that stops them from feeling completely helpless.4. Education - Most of these people worry about today, theres no looking two steps ahead or thinking about collateral damage from something that looks like a simple fix. Thats why Republican messaging is so effective they attack something the base hates and pitch it as a simple fix. Then they get on board because they cant even start to comprehend the ramifications.  All they know is they are getting rid of something they hate and its going to fix everything.You cant communicate with them by citing PhD studies or presenting complex ideas.","title":"Democratic Party Elites Brought Us This Disaster"},{"text":"Unity, as long as you fit in the club.

And disenfranchised blacks who where not allowed to vote essentially. (This applies to all of the south).\\nThis flipped with Jfk, maybe southern democrats swapped to Republican just to keep Lbj from promoting more civil rights reforms. \\nAlabama Barely won Carter, that was the last \\"blue\\" vote, and he won by being a fellow southerner. Even Bill Clinton didn't win Alabama and he's an Arkansas native. \\nI'm giving mainly just a cliff notes, because party value swapping is a long discussion, especially since certain important topics change with time. In the 1920s, gay rights and abortion rights was not on either the democrat or republican m.o\\nAlabama had a white supremacist leader who wanted to reverse de-segregation. He threatened military action if blacks even attempted to enter universities that where whites only, (He couldn't actually do that. But he sure acted like he could, and the people believed and wanted him to) he won and led as the governor for multiple terms, ran as an independent during the 68 election and Won the Alabama vote.There where two prior white supremacist third party candidates, Byrd and Thurmond. Who both won Alabama. So since the 20th century, the majority of Alabama has voted and won the white supremacist candidate vote 3 times.

The key difference between a fetus and a baby is that the baby can survive without its mother, if someone else will care for it, but that is not (Yet !) the case with a fetus. So effectively, if the mother does not want to carry the fetus, then the ONLY way to keep the unwanted fetus alive is to use force on the mother to force her to carry the fetus to term, and some legal or police force will be needed to do that, and we Libertarians don't want to use our resources on this task.Stowaways on boats happens all the time, and its sort of a good counter example, but its not the same as a fetus. Specifically, stowaways in almost all cases ARE aware they are stealing a service from the boat owner, and are thus intentionally violating the NAP. The boat owner can't just throw them overboard in the middle of the ocean, because its disproportionate use of force, AND the stowaways are fully viable humans that don't require the boat owner to carry them inside their body, but the boat owner can leave them at any port that will take them, and sue them for payment of the transport cost, maybe we would allow 2x the cost, because the transport was forced on the boat owner (most stowaways have no assets, so there really is no just resolution, without some kind of indentured servitude, which would also require some use of force to compel the service, which most Libertarians don't support).The practical reality of the Mother/fetus combo is that they cannot be separated without the fetus dying, which makes them basically one person and one POSSIBLE person, in the same body, and logically, the existing person with full free will and communication ability, will have to make group decisions for the unit, including the decision to separate. We can't treat the unborn fetus as a person, because it is not capable of surviving without the mother's body. The only way personhood and protection can be bestowed on a fetus is by wielding NAP-violating force over the mother, and that is why you can be pro-life all you want, but you can't force that choice on others.","title":"This is the time Libertarians need to grow."},{"text":"And America has become a misogynist sh!thole because of it.
