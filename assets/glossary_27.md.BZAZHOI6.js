Following my assault (at school, I was 15) I reached out to a teacher. There was video evidence (I was crying during the event and looking towards teachers for intervention) as it was on a school bus. The teacher encouraged me to report it to the principal. I did so, and carefully described what had happened- dnd then had to report it to the counselor. They required the person to send me an apology letter. He further continued to sneak up on me in school and whisper in my ear and occasionally touch me. He bragged about what hed done. I wrote a blog at the time and an author who I admired responded to a post about how I wished what happened was far more violent so it would have been taken seriously. She called my school and demanded it be taken more seriously.This led to the SRO finally speaking to me. I again described the event. He proceeded to discourage me from seeking legal justice because it would be difficult to prove intent. Then he discussed with me a scenario from his friend who was drugged and raped and unable to truly fight back I believe to further discourage me and as I am deeply empathetic the story led me to tears and I began to doubt that what happened to me was significant enough to truly matter.Following the instance I withdrew from peers- thoughts of how they must believe I deserved such things (despite having male friends who never behaved this way towards me) led to deep insecurities and fears that somehow being silly with someone might cause them to think I would want to take things further.For further context- the boy had never held my hand, never kissed me, we were not dating and he encouraged me to sit somewhere where I could not easily be seen nor get away.I was playful with him before this day- which was part of the ruminations and self blame and continued isolation following.As far as how it could have been handled differently no one apologized for what had happened or told me that it wasnt my fault.I was seemingly blamed for not responding better- and realizing as an adult that being backed into a corner triggered a freeze response- not having access to friends or to teachers who could assist with escaping furthered that response.There were tears running down my face, I never responded positively or even made a noise and it did not matter to the person as he was clearly intent on what he desired to do and not on me as a human being.I was able to eventually stop the assault from continuing when he took a moment to raise his hands for a hand check and I placed my hands in a spot where he could not continue. He tried to physically move my arms but thankfully from tree climbing I had excellent forearm strength and he could not.To this day my brain wrestles with the responses.The author Laurie Halse Anderson was the only person in my life who treated me as a human being in that incident. So I would say as far as authorities handling it differently- I would say that it takes incredible bravery for someone to talk about what happened. It should come with an inherent acknowledgement of that fact. Protecting victims from further harm means acknowledging that bravery, not minimizing their experience, offering options without bias, and helping to empower them in healing and in confidence in the future.When victims are treated as if they are responsible for what took place- it sadly puts them in a place to be further victimized in the future. They can panic when met with similar situations and this can lead to further freeze responses. Often times they can develop what I did, insecurity, self blame, self hatred, isolation, severe depression, suicidal ideation, ptsd, rumination and anxiety. Unfortunately people with these traits actively ATTRACT individuals who are predatory. Had I had the support to heal and someone who simply said that they believed me and that they were on my side- (regardless of the outcome legally)- I believe it would have vastly changed my ability to cope and heal from the experience.This experience is not major. It was small compared to many events that others go through.Of my female friends, I know 3 close friends who were sexually abused horrifically from ages so young that it brings nausea to consider. I know one friend who was told by her mother that she could allow her stepfather to continue sexualizing and raping her or her mother would reject her.What Ive gone through is minimal in many ways comparatively.But I think the response to what happened to those whose autonomy was taken from them is more significant than even the experience itself.Having support- having someone help build you up and give you the tools to repel predators. Learning to find a voice and learning to overcome the side effects of what was experienced is far more crucial than even seeing the predator be brought to justice.Ideally, we would see justice happen. But larger than that, ideally we would support victims in healing and finding their self worth as a community.I imagine adopting a little me and helping her to overcome these things.. and realizing that I am doing that and consistently trying to find my voice (albeit often on Reddit) and find the ways to best protect myself and my own children and friends from the risks of being a vulnerable person.So I guess believe victims. Yes, there are liars and manipulators out there. But majorly, there are just people in pain and needing someone to help them find their voice and their strength. Validate those experiences. Even if you dont understand their response. They dont either. Grappling with your entire world changing and sense of safety being destroyed give them a little safety.And if that means a guy gets accused and has to find a new school- maybe that guy ends up on a better path. Maybe that girl feels like what she experienced matters and like she protected other women from going through the same thing. Maybe she avoided the trial and public criticism and was able to heal and find safety because of it.? I dont have a perfect answer. I wish no one falsely accused anyone. But I wish more that no one felt an impulse to take autonomy others without consent and consideration and leaned into it.Best of luck on this, I know my perspective is only one and that there are many others. But I do have hope that society will reach a point where we value individuals for their inherent autonomy. Whether we do or not- thank you for listening.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"I'll be sure to teach my kids that it is called the Gulf of Mexico","title":"Trump to make good on Gulf of America promise with bonkers executive order"},{"text":"When he laid down the most epic smackdown to their faces with a glorious rant that will be remembered and replayed for decades.

But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most mischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those who had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were without influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.\\"- Machiavelli, Niccol.

Bad, rainy, stormy day.

People from all over our tiny town were dropping off cases of water, diapers, food, etc.  In the middle of all this the next big storm arrived.  We were loading up the truck when the town tornado sirens started blaring, phones were going off, and you could fucking SEE the black wall of clouds heading for us.

(the tornado only touched down briefly and passed about a mile behind us)And, I kid you not, this group of women who had just dropped off a bunch of stuff, stood there and checked fucking FOX before they'd go, announcing that you can't trust anything unless it came from them.  I was gobsmacked.  I could not believe they were serious.  But they were.

Indeed, Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and Obama each established advisory commissions in accordance with FACA to solicit advice and recommendations on spending cuts from individuals outside the government While FACA permits the use of advisory committees, it imposes various guardrails to prevent them from turning into vehicles for advancing private interests in the federal decision-making process and secretly influencing federal officials exercise of policymaking discretion. Those guardrails include the requirements that advisory committee have a fair balance in viewpoints represented, that they do not meet in secret, and that their records and work product be made available for public inspection. FACA also prohibits advisory committees from meeting or taking any action until a charter for the advisory committee has been filed, specifying, among\\nother things, the nature of the committees work and duties and the federal official to whom the committee is responsible. As of the date of the filing of this complaint, President Trump has chosen Messrs.

Over the past 100 years, many words in U.S. English have experienced drastic changes in meaning.The word \\"awful\\" once meant \\"full of awe,\\" referring to something that inspires wonder or admiration, a positive term. Today, however, it is used to describe something that is \\"extremely bad\\" or \\"terrible,\\" completely changing its original connotation.The word \\"hacker\\" referred to someone who \\"hacked\\" wood, meaning someone who did rough or unskilled work. Today, \\"hacker\\" refers to someone who gains unauthorized access to computer systems.The word \\"gay\\" used to mean \\"happy\\" or \\"carefree\\", it was used to describe a joyful or lively mood. In modern times, though, it refers to sexual attraction..The word \\"bad\\" meant harmful, unpleasant, or morally wrong. Today, however, it has taken on a new meaning in slang, where it can mean \\"good,\\" \\"impressive,\\" or \\"cool,\\" depending on the context.The word \\"queer\\" originally meant \\"strange\\" or \\"odd.\\" It was used to describe something unusual or out of the ordinary. In modern usage it has become a widely accepted term within the LGBTQ+ community.The word \\"clue\\" used to refer to a \\"ball of thread\\" or something used to find the way, particularly in reference to mythology, like Theseus and the Minotaur. Today, however, it refers to a piece of information or evidence that helps solve a mystery or problem. The dictionary at the time when the Constitution and its amendments were written had meanings that were different from the definitions we use today, so our understanding of the language is quite different from the meanings the framers intended.","title":"Trump executive order will attempt to end birthright citizenship"},{"text":"But you didnt really think Trump would enact progressive executive orders while he is at it with the fascist ones?","title":"Trump to issue executive orders defining sexes, ending DEI practices in government"},{"text":"No it confirms our speculation.Very specifically","title":"Donald Trump's 'voting computers' comment sparks Elon Musk speculation"},{"text":"Democracy.

Youve now added the unaltered stipulation, which is a different question. Protesters were opposing the statues removal. Some of them may very well have advocated to retain the statue but add a plaque which contextualizes it. No, these are precisely the sorts of arguments that are had whenever this question comes up. No, heritage and culture are not universally dog whistles for racist ideas. In fact, people typically tell you exactly what they mean, if you can set aside your own ideological bias for two seconds and actually listen. That rally was certainly not characterized by people who felt bashful about sharing their racist views. The people who felt that way were proud of those views, that was the whole point.

If I accuse you, good luck proving me wrong because by the time you do it, you already lost your job, friendships, relationships... And it's a fucking hard comeback too. So accusing or not, the cancellation is the worst sentence in this situation even before the legal one. So my take is that, first things first, people need to step aside and let justice takes its course. This would simplify things.Another point is that if the victim do not cooperate this whole scenario crumbles apart. So I understand it is a hard situation and traumatizing, but cooperation is need at maximum because: 1. as you help investigators understanding all the clues and takes on it you basically can help them get if you are lying in the process and this is good for BOTH, because it helps you prove you are right and help the accused prove if they are being falsely accused too. So victims SHOULD speak more. Just accusing and vanishing claiming it is traumatizing is the worst scenario possible for both. Besides, if you are on the right then you definitely should talk more! People usually do the contrary and get offended if they are the victim yet people don't 100% believe them in the first place. This should be part of the process.2. if the person indeed doesn't speak up about their case, why say it in the first place? I know it's hard and puts this trauma on a pedestal but it helps taking the power away from the agressor. How can we encourage victims to report their crimes and reassure them that we take them seriously without infringing on the rights of the accused? Is there a way?Encouraging them to cooperate the best they can, really stress the situation trying to get gaps or lies in the process. The victim should understand this is part of it and don't vanish leading to those processes where it's my word against yours because no one can get a single proof of anything. In the meantime, someone is being cancelled in real life.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"I was wrong.

(Note- this doesn't mean 'believe all women' or anything like that. But just that their accusations should be taken seriously.) and/or that the process of investigation will expose them to extreme scruntiny.Well, as you point out earlier, the man (I'll assume a man is accused, and a woman is the supposed victim for simplicity, but the same thing applies to all combinations) is innocent until proven - beyond a reasonable doubt- guilty.  And since many rape cases devolve into 'he-said, she-said', the only evidence is the woman's testimony. So for her testimony *by itself* to rise to the 'beyond reasonable doubt' state, it has to be, for lack of a better word, perfect.  *Any* inconsistency will provide that reasonable doubt.  Thus, her claims must be scrutinized to see if they will hold up.we can and should outlaw questions such as, \\"what were you wearing when this happened\\" or \\"had you been flirting with the assaulter\\" because these kinds of queries only reinforce misogyny and victim blamingI disagree.  'Flirting' is evidence that the person was open to having sex.  If she was open to having sex, then it wasn't rape, as rape requires lack of consent. ('open to having sex'=consent to it)Now, I understand it is not all that simple, and it's not all black-and-white.  Consent can be withdrawn even after explicitly being given, not to mention implicitly being given thru flirting.  But it's still evidence that a jury should be able to consider.It is essential to establish a timeline, to interrogate and reinterrogate the accuser and accused to determine if they are able to keep to a consistent story...Exactly. I'm sorry if that 'extreme scrutiny' is uncomfortable. But it needs to be done. How can we encourage victims to report their crimes and reassure them that we take them seriously without infringing on the rights of the accusedBy doing just that- taking them seriously. But also acknowledging that, in a 'he-said, she-said' situation, only the most 'perfect' of claims rise to the point that he'll be found guilty. And also acknowledging that that sucks for some victims.  \\"Come forward, we'll treat your claims seriously... but be aware that many claims don't rise to the level where something can be done.\\"","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Amazing speech!

Trans women in this situation are sometimes made to dance, present, or masturbate at the correctional officers' discretion.[122]A 2021 California study found that 69% of trans women prisoners reported being forced to perform sexual acts against their will, 58.5% reported being violently sexually assaulted, and 88% overall reported being made to take part in a \\"marriage-like relationship\\".[123] Trans women who physically resist the advances of other prisoners are often criminally charged with assault and placed in solitary confinement, the assault charge then being used to extend the woman's prison stay and deny her parole.[124]","title":"Trump to sign executive orders proclaiming there are only two biological sexes, halting diversity programs"},{"text":"Stop dodging the question.

It has no place in America.And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.In the press conference you cited, Trump does say that he saw two violent sides. What he's trying to do is say leftists groups create violence. I think this passage from the press conference you linked is very telling:Those people C all of those people, excuse me C Ive condemned neo-Nazis. Ive condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.It's the same strategy that the GOP have done since Barry Goldwater. You saw it when Hillary Clinton said Trump attracts \\"some deplorables\\" and the message is spun as, \\"The Dems called us ALL deplorable.\\" What they're doing is making it so it's hard to see any lines between where white nationalism ends and normal GOP begins. They do it so the moderate GOP can have deniability but they keep the far right support. What both groups want is the messaging that liberals - leftists - are the ones causing divide, discord, disharmony, and are the ones prone to violence. Later he says:?I am not putting anybody on a moral plane, what Im saying is this: you had a group on one side and a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left. Youve just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but thats the way it is.Throughout the whole exchange, Trump is trying to pivot away from the Charlottesville incident to talk about jobs/infrastructure. But they keep pressing him because they really want him to say the Unite the Right were filled with white supremacists'. I don't follow the back and forth to mean that Trump ever concedes that framing. I think he's pushing back against the framing. In this other passage he says:and Im not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally C but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.What Trump is trying to say: \\"Leftists, and the media, treat conservatives like we're all Nazis, but non-white-supremacist conservatives just want to feel pride in their history.\\"","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"There it is, he mentioned trans people.

Back in the 1960s and 70s a lot of progress was made by blacks and women. Black peoples could go anywhere white people went including public schools and public pools and enter any restaurant through the same door as whites! Do not underestimate how problematic this was to a lot of white Americans. And women, they could have jobs, get their own credit cards, and control their own fertility with the pill. After progress there is always backlash. It only took a few short years for that backlash to organize itself into the modern Republican Party. It has, since that time, been against any policy that might materially benefit average Americans (because now it included *them*). If it had to be shared equally, then nobody would have it. Whether it's affordable health care, child care, senior care, livable wages, infrastructure. It's the reason we don't have nice things.Not only did Republicans turn against the government they felt had betrayed them, it was also around this time that evangelicals began to develop strong feelings about abortion that they'd never had before. And a 200 year old gun safety and marksmanship outfit, the NRA, turned into a radical gun rights political lobbying group. Meanwhile, the rest of us became a little more progressive with each passing decade. Next thing you know there's a black family in the White House for eight years and Democrats were certain to put a woman in next and gay people can get married now and you're supposed to treat them like normal people!Republicans felt quite rightly that their preferred social hierarchy was eroding away year by year. Then along comes Donald Trump. His open racism and misogyny signal to people that finally someone was going to champion, and perhaps even return us to, their vanishing Way Of Life. MAGA is nothing more than a desire to return to a time when straight white men controlled everything, women and people of color knew their places, and the LGBTQ folks were invisible. And I think somewhere along the line folks began to realize that this wasn't tenable in a democracy. Their ideas weren't quite popular enough to win reliably. So given the choice between white supremacy/patriarchy and democracy... they decided eff democracy. Trump gave them permission to steal the presidency with his cockamamy story about it being stolen from him, and people went with it. It takes a powerful motivation to believe utter nonsense, but their desire MAGA provides that motivation. In 2016 Trump got a huge boost from James Comey and Vladimir Putin, resulting in a very narrow Trump win. He got no such boost in 2020 and he lost. But he got a big boost again in 2024 in the form of post-pandemic inflation and he again very narrowly won.

The presidential memo directs federal agencies to investigate and remedy persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other nations, two longstanding Trump irritants. And it singles out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny, directing agencies to assess Beijings compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, Trumps updated North American Free Trade Agreement, which is set for review in 2026. But the memo doesnt, in itself, impose any new tariffsa momentary relief for foreign capitals bracing for Trump to immediately impose stiff levies. Instead, the trade policy memo is an indication of debates still roiling the incoming administration over how to deliver on Trumps campaign trail promises for across-the-board tariffs on imports, and higher duties for adversaries such as China.?Were spared, at least for the next 12 hours.

People are worried about the economy and jobs for the American people. They blame immigration and say our immigration policy is too relaxed. The truth of that is that companies here will 100% hire people who come here illegally from Central or South America to work because they can pay them WAAAAAAAY less than they would have to pay an American Citizen, plus the company won't have to pay taxes for that employee. These companies theoretically should be punished, but because we live in a highly capitalist society, the regulating bodies are paid off to look the other way. Also, many many years ago, companies were given tax incentives to move production and other parts of their businesses (customer and technical support is a big one) overseas. Again, it's WAAAAAAAAY cheaper to pay the cost of labor in a developing nation than it is to pay a US citizen plus pay the taxes involved with employing them. So again the problem is these companies are screwing us all over in an effort to make the highest margins possible, but we are told to blame it on the immigrants and foreigners. The immigrants wouldn't have these jobs if companies didn't actively seek them out to save money on their payroll.\\nThe people I have spoken too are also concerned about \\"handouts.\\" I personally don't know how much, but some of our tax dollars go to programs like foodstamps, subsidized housing, disability payouts- essentially programs which are in place to help the most disaffected people in our society. There is a discourse that the people that receive these benefits take advantage of them and/or lie to get them, and also that the programs aren't designed to help people out of poverty, but to make people reliant on them. I don't know any statistics so that is where I will end my explanation of that theory.\\nEssentially it's a lot of people concerned that the increasingly unreasonable cost of living and wages and job opportunities that aren't coming through are the fault of other people in a similar or worse socioeconomic situation, and not actually the fault of corporations and laws which benefit corporations and harm people.?","title":"Can someone explain to a European what is going on over there?"},{"text":"Reddit is the next one we need to take a hard look at, its a radicalization platform at this point.","title":"Inauguration Live Thread"},{"text":"Not one former president stood for that shit.

Very briefly on the prosecutorial side, and much, much more experience on defense. I broadly agree that there are a lot of injustices surrounding these cases towards defendants. But, I don't think that it's impossible to deal with them fairly.I think that the entire focus of our justice system as it exists today is skewed. We have this notion that punishment is an end unto itself. I've had many, many arguments on this subreddit with people who are exceptionally certain that, with sufficient punishment, any wrong can be righted. I've seen people on this subreddit who claim that they are *eager* to pull the switch to execute somebody. In my experience, that never really holds up in an actual execution, but that is neither here nor there.If we want to treat these cases fairly, we need to separate two things: the best outcome for the victim, and the appropriate response to the alleged perpetrator. When it comes to the victim, we need to dispense of the notion that somehow seeing through a successful prosecution will deliver \\"justice\\" or \\"closure\\" to victims. In my experience, that never really happens. It's extremely common for victims to, at the end of a criminal trial, feel completely empty. They've made this trial and these events the center of their life for several years, and then it all just...ends. It's not really satisfying, even if the victim gets everything that they want. It's exceptionally anticlimactic.So, what do we do for victims of crimes? We do our level best to put them in as good of a situation as they would be absent the crime. We provide free psychological assistance. We cover medical bills. We offer other forms of support, as necessary, including financial assistance, until the victim can go on about their life as normal.And what do we do about the accused? We perform a thorough investigation. If the facts can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (and I mean a true reasonable doubt, not the sort of bullshit that passes for reasonable doubt on your average cop show), then the accused should be treated in a way that prevents them from reoffending. They should be sent to a prison that has a goal of rehabilitation. They *shouldn't* be prevented from ever having a productive life again, as they are currently.And if those facts cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, no further consequences should accrue.In any dispute resolution system, it's practically impossible to design a system that will always produce 100% just and accurate outcomes. We cannot truly know what happened at a given place at a given time. We can ask people, we can review evidence, and we can make our best guess. But we can't really *know*. Given the unreliability of eyewitness testimony, I'd argue that we can't even really *know* the things that we perceive ourselves. Thus, there will always be the potential for *some* unfairness in any system. Assuming that to be the case, we should treat the parties as I have described, as it will put them all in the best position to live a productive and meaningful life moving forward.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Is Bill on molly or something?","title":"Inauguration Live Thread"},{"text":"So glad your against using EOs instead of legal processes.

Many of them consider the implications of what accusing someone of such things would not only to them, but to the person who assaulted them.I want to add that it not only adds to the extreme pain of the victim when they do confront the abuser - but the pain is frequently exponentially worsened by inquiries against the victims, character and micro, analyzing their story and the evidence.I do believe it is rare for victims to create false stories. But of course, this doesnt mean that its easy to prove what happened and the scrutiny that is applied to the cases makes sense given that these men are being charged with a crime.As someone who has experienced sexual assault - the way it was handled when I was young created a situation where I would not only be extremely hesitant to report an assault- I would consider the extreme pain it would cause to report the assault and then have it be excused due to a lack of evidence or simply not being believed.The burden of proof is often put entirely upon the victim- and while this makes sense legally- it feels akin to a public stoning in the town Square when all is finally laid to rest and often times the victim relive the incident over and over again to no avail and no justice.Honestly, for women  it does seem safer to merely avoid men in the future, which seems to be resoundingly the common approach rather than reporting. Or you see the other side of the coin where women put themselves in extremely dangerous situations to find control that they will never find. The devastation of being devalued as a human being and often times being seen predominantly as someone who deserves such things or was not strong enough to fill them off or good enough at saying the right words were taking the right actions to make it stop.I personally have wrestled with both hypersexuality and with asexuality following my experiences.For the hypersexuality it seems to come with this inherent belief that somehow by being desirable and not bitchy enough, thats somehow how I brought this behavior upon myself and therefore it is what I should accept.Another facet is putting yourself in danger can lead to this really shocking discovery that many men will not actually push you out of your comfort zone or attempt to take what they desire sometimes it makes me wonder what exactly I did differently but often times the answer is not me at all, but that the person did not inherently believe that I deserved autonomy because their desire for me was larger than my value outside of that desire.The people who assaulted me were often times friends who I trust trusted, or who I was establishing trust with. The worst assault experience was from someone I was in a committed relationship with.I dont think its frequently that false accusations occur, and they are actually brought to justice where the falsely accused pays for the false accusations more than the public scrutiny.I think its far more frequent that real accusations occur and justice is never seen. The character assassinations against women seem to be proportionately more harmful, not only for their healing, but also for their future safety and value. This is not a discount that men who have been falsely accused, dont go through extreme difficulties, but that recovering from an assault or rape, and also having to undergo extreme assassinations of character and the lack of safety or ability to really have justice seems so emotionally and physically harmful that victims be more likely to try to suppress and bury what happened rather than to seek support and justice. Women who bring things up years later or often women who did try to cope without seeking justice and found that they were never able to overcome the emotional pain of the experience.For me, it seems more likely that people would report an assault or a rape if they had no experience doing so before.Sadly, it seems common that victims of assault are often revictimized later. Sometimes it feels like theres some kind of lightbulb on my head that only fucked up people can see where they are keenly aware of my damages and how to offer comfort and support to make it seem as though they are compassionate when really they see a target.Nonetheless - it is unlikely that women will really truly be safe to seek justice.And it is unlikely that evidence will 100% prove what actually happened.Well, it is understandable that the assailant has inherent rights  it feels very much like the victim does not.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Don't think either of the Clinton's have been held civilly liable for rape, dumbass","title":"Biden, in final act in office, issues pardons to his family members, due to 'unrelenting attacks' from Trump and allies"},{"text":"WELCOME BACK SIR ?","title":"Donald J Trump is now the 47th President!"},{"text":"The adults are back in charge","title":"Inauguration Live Thread"},{"text":"I'm here to witness the tears.","title":"Donald Trump sworn in as 47th President of United States"},{"text":"Why does she look like the hat man?","title":"President Biden and Jill Biden greet Donald and Melania Trump with a 'welcome home'"},{"text":"Yep, people who dont think critically need this shit in their faces, just like Fox News","title":"Time for a Trump \\"I did that ??\\" sticker"},{"text":"Hallelujah!!!!

So indeed, they can't \\"overrule\\" the Constitution -- they just say that, in their learned opinion, the Constitution actually says something different than what it appears to say to us lowly dregs, and other courts either go along with it and try to make it work or ignore the ruling (at which point it's just a free for all).In other words, the Supreme Court *is* the Constitution as far as anyone else is concerned.Consider for example that the Supreme Court decided that the insurrection section in the 14th amendment doesn't actually prohibit oath takers who engaged in insurrection from holding office, even though the words in the Constitution say that.In that case, they just decided that that section of the amendment didn't mean anything unless Congress *also* passed a law making what was done illegal. Which is not written anywhere in the amendment and isn't a requirement for any of the other sections of that amendment (for instance, equal protection under the law can be brought to court under the 14th amendment directly, without the need for a corresponding law).It's on par with the government shutting down a newspaper in Chicago, suing for violation of first amendment protections, and then losing and being told that Congress hasn't passed a law specifically making it illegal to shut down newspapers in Chicago, so it doesn't count.And they can easily do the same thing with birthright citizenship -- they can just make up some extra requirement that the protection supposedly hinges on and that disproportionately affects the people they hate. Or hell, maybe they just say that undocumented immigrants are essentially non-uniformed enemy combatants in this invasion of the US, and as such are specifically excluded (birthright citizenship does not include children of foreign invaders who happen to be in the US during the invasion). This would be particularly appealing to MAGA, because it would essentially make them all terrorists and exempt them from pretty much all laws and legal protections...which is what MAGA really wants.Unless you are a straight white male property owner, you should not be counting on the law to protect you. It's lucky if you happen to sneak by, but the people who are now in charge of interpreting and enforcing the laws believe straight white male property owners are superior to everyone else, and you should expect them to reflect that in how they apply the law, and have a plan to get by without the legal protections you should be entitled to.","title":"Trump executive order will attempt to end birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Idiot commie.","title":"Pope Francis condemns Trumps alleged plans to deport illegal immigrants.

I think it is important to clarify up front that to me you dont seem to be distinguishing between criminal justice system, civil court, and university disciplinary hearings (which are the three main bodies hearing these complaints in the US). So Im going to focus on criminal justice first. Regarding the first point, I agree with you in that I wish it to be so, and it should be the single most important outcome to prevent in our criminal justice system.  I think I can address the second point. In our criminal justice system, the prosecutor ultimately decides whether or not to bring charges. A good prosecutor is one who can effectively assess if a case is likely enough to succeed in court to warrant the cost of pursuing it, including the trauma caused to the victim and if any of the evidence could exonerate the accused. Moreover, nowadays with our ability to collect physical evidence, it is more feasible than ever to determine the facts and make the appropriate decision. So yes there are abuses, but I hope you would agree that the problem is not inherently insurmountable. In the civil court system, individuals can sue each other for injuries. If a sexual assault victim sues the perpetrator in a jurisdiction with the appropriate injury defined, then a court could hold somebody liable for sexual abuse. This option might be pursued if there were not enough evidence to convincingly determine that rape had occurred as defined by the law, but something clearly bad had happened. No jail time but possibly financial penalties. Abuse in this system is limited by the fact that falsely and maliciously bringing suit is itself an injury that could lead to a counter suit. Very bad outcome. Finally there are the university disciplinary hearings. I imagine your complaint is largely motivated by these. The procedures are fairly arbitrary, set by individual institutions as their best effort to respond to directives from federal regulators about the latest interpretation of Title IX and other applicable laws. Generally there are ways in which these seem unfair. There seems to be no way to remedy the situation if a false accusation is made. Reputational damage is done with all that comes with it. No penalty applies to the false accuser and the only entity the accused could try and hold accountable is the university, which is doing its best to follow the law. So sure it seems vulnerable to abuse. Can it be fixed?I do not know why universities are in the business of adjudicating these sorts of matters. Perhaps the appropriate venue for any sexual abuse allegation is the court system, which is designed to pursue fairness and clear recourse exists. Until universities can get it right I think this is the way to go, and recent US Supreme Court rulings may undermine a lot of this.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Show us his response when you told him who really said these thingsAlso, not satire- give him a promo code for Better Help we gotta start getting these people resources.","title":"My father in law hates MLK so I sent him some famous quotes"},{"text":"But there are people born with characteristics of both sexes.

If true, this will be a disgrace, because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill. This wont do! This is not the way to solve things. Thats not how things are resolved."},{"text":"What you're getting at here is that in some circumstances, a criminal sexual assault allegation is just a \\"he-said, she-said\\", with absolutely no other evidence that might tell us who's correct. In that case, in the US where I live, courts are exceedingly unlikely to convict the accused, as guilt in a criminal trial must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.And that's true! But it would be exceedingly rare for a prosecutor to bring a case like that, with zero additional evidence, to trial! Typically, they just wouldn't bring charges in such a case. That happens all the time.Typically, in sexual assault trials, there's some combination of evidence: [video or audio evidence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/florida-teen-forced-to-collect-her-own-evidence-to-prove-she-was-sexually-abused), [multiple accusers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_cases), [witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner), [friends who were told about the alleged attack](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/friend-testifies-e-jean-carroll-called-minutes-alleged-trump-attack-rcna82437) immediately after it happened, a [confession](https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/kenner-woman-records-man-apologizing-for-raping-her-police/article_5502ac0c-1068-521a-afc5-228b140755bb.html), a rape kit, etc.So I think you can be correct that there has to be some looking into evidence - but that's generally what happens already!One note on this statement:\\"People who are trying to hide the truth or to cover up a lie often have trouble retelling a sequence of events.\\"We should be really careful about using inconsistencies to conclude that an accuser is lying. It's actually extremely common for witnesses or victims to get details of their stories wrong, even when they're telling the truth. It's also common for investigators to believe incorrectly that a victim isn't acting \\"naturally\\" and must be lying, even when they're telling the truth. See, e.g., [this \\"unbelievable\\" story of rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Unbelievable_Story_of_Rape), in which a young woman reported a rape that really happened to her, but police decided she was lying about it because of her demeanor and small inconsistencies in her story.So, you're right, we should look at all the evidence - we should have a \\"period of inquiry\\". But we don't have to make that inquiry \\"painful\\" in the sense of pushing the alleged victim really hard and trying to find and press on small inconsistencies in their story. E.g., if she says she was wearing a brown sweater when she was raped, then later says it was blue, that's not a good reason to bring her in for 6 hours of grilling to try to show that she was actually lying all along; it's just evidence that her memory for small details cannot be fully relied upon.(Edit: a couple extra examples)","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Because it CAN take effect.

So, do you see how #2 prevents #1 from happening, a lot? The bar for a sexual assault conviction is high. I'm not saying innocent people don't get wrongfully convicted, I'm just saying that that's so rare and probably happens with the same frequency of wrongful convictions for other crimes as well. \\nTo encourage women to come forward, we must stop allowing a platform for rapists &amp; stop brushing over sexual assault. Can't tell you how many Diddy jokes I've seen. And also, in the United States, our new leader has literally been found unanimously liable for sexual assault. This encourages rape culture. If rape is a funny thing, and not a deal breaker, why would women feel safe coming forward? \\nSecondly, police officers need better training in talking to sexual assault victims. Most of the time you get an advocate that helps you through the process when you're filing a report. However, as you briefly touched on, some of the questioning is intense, harsh, and shifts the blame onto the victim. Even if the police officers believes the woman and doesn't fault her, it's easy to use wording that is hurtful and easy to misinterpret. Maybe more women in law enforcement would help this issue as well. \\nBut also, if a victim doesn't want to come forward, more power to them. That's their choice, no one else's (unless victim is a child) No one should be forced to feel violated again getting poked and examined for a rape kit, go through uncomfortable intense questioning, months or years of waiting, just to most of the time hear that there's insufficient evidence. Do I agree and hope that more women will come forward? Yes. But I also respect their right to not go through the trauma of a rape investigation.

One of that principles is public justice (i.e. proceedings are public in default). But as every principle even this one has its exceptions.

Now bearing that in mind in law exist something called \\"proportionality\\" which basically means you have to somehow (based on ideas like freedom, equality etc.)  ballance protected interests while there is protected interest to person (usually women) bodily integrity on one side there is also interest of accused one to be protected against defamation. Without diving into much of theory you get the idea. Possible protection to both protected interests in this manner is making procedure private/secret (non-public). At least in my country there is also sentence by \\"judgement publishment\\" where those accused may be exposed to public when accusations are found to be true while protecting those who are inocent.
