I haven't seen any compelling arguments as to why we should continue entertaining discussions on a 2 state solution. A lot of people want to point to the idea of land swaps and settler evictions, but the only plans that have been put to me have no institutional backing by either side. The closest someone got to a compelling argument was a 2 state deal plan put forth in 2020 by a non-profit (try and think if there's been any significant events since 2020 that should probably be taken into consideration in any 2-state deal,) and even it proposed a land \\"swap\\" that would give 3.9% of prime West Bank land to Israel in order to preserve 400k settlers but still evict 150k. 150,000... more than 15 times the previous highest settler eviction. And no analysis as to how many Palestinians who live within that 3.9% would have to be evicted, or how they'd be treated if they weren't...and again, no comment from any official source as to so much of an impression of this plan. It's the best articulated plan anyone has presented here in these threads and it's still just fanfiction.Anyone can draw a map of the West Bank and say \\"well maybe it'd work like this?\\". That's not a compelling reason to keep entertaining the 2 state solution as if its viable in serious discussion, especially as the on-the-ground reality of apartheid gets more and more entrenched. We might as well talk about 3 or 4 state solutions for all the good it does (which has been proposed in this thread as well btw).At the heart of it, I do want my view changed because a 2 state solution compromise (in the abstract) has significant support around the world. I don't want them to be wrong, I just don't see how it would work given the on-the-ground reality, plus I do feel that it gets dangled as a carrot by certain cynical actors who know it's not going to happen and are just stalling for time.

Because if you did, jews are pretty clear in an existential war here.Plus the security concerns, if Israel annexes Gaza and controls the region entirely and the Palestinians who live there are either dead and gone, that means no more threat of rockets or other attacks.Entirely true, with very little evidence to suggest that the Israeli population as a whole supports it.  For context, you are talking about killing/removing around *50 times more people* than have already died.  Even right after Oct7, the majority opposed annexing it.  \\nUp until Oct 7th Israel was pretty comfortable with the status quo of having power over stateless people, they were on the road to normalizing relations with their Arab neighbors.Continuing from the prior statement: they weren't.

I suppose it is not surprising since a society is simply many individual people. I dont agree with the angle the statement is coming from. Whether or not one person thinks society needs radical change is inconsequential. Think of yourself in the same way for a moment.How many times do people say they need to radically change? That there is some defect that they need to get rid of or positive element they need to add to their lives. How often does someone radically change? I would argue never since you cannot change yourself; your environment simply becomes too misaligned with you experiencing it and a change suddenly happens. I personally rarely see someone just change by their own will because environment is always a huge factor. If someones environment becomes inhospitable for too long, that is the only time I see radical change.The alternative is someone matures and grows up. They make the same mistakes over and over again; so many times you wonder if they are even paying attention. They try things out, they learn what they actually want, and they put systems in place to get there.Now take this and extrapolate. Society will change when the environment becomes too inhospitable for the people experiencing it. Or it can change naturally as things progress. The former will have severe consequences since people are not ready for change. You are attempting to change the system before the people have changed. The latter will be much smoother. The best thing to do is to simply wait, watch, see what you can notice about yourself and the system. Differentiate what struggles are stemming from society and which are stemming from you. The opportunity for radical societal change will present itself, with patience.","title":"CMV: Society does not need radical change"},{"text":"Swear there is no saving folks like this, they're too far gone at this point.","title":"Trump Flips Out With \\"Dumb Woman\\" Rant After Kamala Harris' Interview On 'The View'"},{"text":"Sad part is they dont know why.

When Trump claimed the election was stolen, he committed an act of stochastic terrorism. Trump had a recourse to contest the election by legal means. Judges, including the ones he appointed said that he didn't have enough evidence to bring a case. When he failed at that attempt he initiated a coup via a violent mob that would pressure Mike Pence into signing off on fake elector certificates. This isn't a matter of opinion. There's been evidence presented in the January 6th committee which included some Republicans that have a spine. That's a threat to democracy. Trump said that he would be a dictator on day one. He also said that we should suspend the Constitution. He said it should be easier to sue journalists to keep them quiet. He said that the news networks should be shut down because they've drawn his ire. He suggested that people who criticize the supreme Court should be thrown in jail. He's called his political opponents vermin, animals, and whatever other offensive shit.All of this gives the green light to his followers to commit violent acts against his opponents. Just like he did on January 6th. All I need to do is go off of his own statements of what he's said he will do and the way he talks about us. So please save me from the propaganda that's brainwashed me. Note that when someone actually does piss Trump off his followers, they send them constant death threats and SWAT attempts. He knows that happens but he never has denounced it, not once. They've been telling lies about Nancy Pelosi for years, but we're going to pretend that didn't cause the hammer attack on her husband? Oh by the way, Trump laughed about that. I will tell you I was not a Democrat before Trump, I simply recognize where we're at at this current juncture. Nor do I consider the Democratic party to be my savior. So yes, Trump is a threat to democracy. He's a piece of s rapist, con man traitor. Traitor I don't give a s throw it all in there. I love my country and I love my people and I don't care whether they're Republican or a Democrat. Telling the unfiltered truth isn't inciting violence.

I also can't name one person who makes these claims without acknowledging that China and India are far and away leading the way in green energy deployment. There's also the question of how bad climate change actually is.Which scientists say it isn't bad and we don't' need to do anything about it? There have been many epochs where the earth has had much warmer, more carbon dense atmospheres.Yes, the main difference being those temperature changes occurred over tens of thousands of years and not a few decades. A primary falsehood peddled by science deniers is the claim that previous instances of temperature increases are comparable, despite occurring on a geological timeline in the absence of a meteor strike or major eruption. The Jurrasic saw temperatures some +15 Celsius of what we see today, and there was zero ice on the poles. Yet life thrived in those conditions.Life that had millions and millions of years to adapt *and indeed evolved* under those conditions. Complex life is not capable of evolution in a matter of decades, or even centuries.There's an apocalyptic doom-saying element in the climate community, because that's how you get people's attention, shit like The Day after Tomorrow.There's a misinformation and dismissive element in the science denier community because acknowledging overwhelming scientific consensus is not something everyone is capable of. Instead we'd see migrations of people away from the equator and towards sub-arctic areas, places like Siberia and the Yukon would become heavy population &amp; agriculture centers.You say that like people crossing borders en masse isn't considered an existential threat to people within those borders and won't cause any serious problems and that the global center becoming uninhabitable isn't a problem. People are already fleeing the global center due to ecological collapses. You'd see Canada and Russia become more powerful and important on the world stage, as they farm other nations for skilled labor.What nations? The global center is uninhabitable by that point. What makes you think Canada and Russia will somehow maintain cooler temperatures as the heat continues to rise after the rest of the world has become uninhabitable?

Coral reefs are the bedrock of life in the oceans and they protect and maintain significant carbon sinks. More than a billions people depend on reefs for survival. A quarter of ocean species rely on coral reefs for food, shelter, and breeding. Reefs also protect shorelines from erosion. Many societies wouldn't exist without reefs. The death of the oceans themselves would be the end of human civilization. If ocean temperatures rise to the point where phytoplankton can no longer effectively photosynthesize, then Earth loses its largest carbon sink and we have no way to sequester excess carbon, even if we stopped burning fossil fuels altogether.The fact we have the ability to care about tertiary issues like that, instead of basic survival, is evidence of how good we have it.No, the fact that you can dismiss it as a tertiary issue when it is a matter of survival to more than a billion people and a quarter of all ocean life is evidence of how good *you have it.* That you can ignore the importance of reefs to the overall health of the ocean and the importance of the ocean to the basic ecological functions of the planet also shows how good you have it. It also explains why these issues won't be solved - because the people with resources don't take them seriously *because they can use those resources to mitigate their personal losses.*Like the average coal miner in 1900 wouldn't have the time to care about environmental issuesWhich just proves why these issues are paramount. The average person doesn't care about them so they are not addressed. The average coal miner in 1900 didn't have time to care about black lung either, despite being an existential problem for them. People are short sighted and unwilling to make adjustments for issues that won't affect them for a long time. Remember asbestos? How many people said \\"it takes decades for the stuff to hurt me, so I'm not worried?\\" Obviously we have issues to solve, but destroying society isn't how we solve those problems.Correct. Society being destroyed by failure to address those problems is how they will be solved. The difference being the destruction that is imposed on us by nature will be less predictable and more destructive. If we made the changes ourselves, we could do it in a more measured, predictable, and controlled way. But we are incapable of making such changes just like the 1900s coal miner was incapable of leaving the mine due to concerns of silicosis.  The reason we care about these things is the robust and progressive, humanitarian societies of the west.Maybe that's why *you* care about them (to the extent that your privilege insulates you from their effects.)

It doesn't mean blowing up the system - it means looking at the soil, instead of the flowers.?\\n(Obvi it's used in different ways politically, but the modern American understanding of radical is based in anti collectivist propaganda, and deserves to be challenged by incorporating the historical tradition - especially as the GOP co-opts old socialist phrases like Draining The Swamp, and QAnon develops as a decentralized phenomenon acting, basically, as communism for anti-Communists - \\"where we go one, we go all\\", and the belief that NESERA/GESERA exists and is coming to save them)\\nOverall wealth has increased, but income inequality is increasing faster. 30 years ago, the middle class, collectively, had twice as much wealth as the top 1% - as of 2020, the 1% now holds more. Home prices have more than tripled in that time. (source is fed data, gathered here: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/12/06/top-1-american-earners-more-wealth-middle-class/71769832007/)\\nMore people are educated, technically, but quality of education and resources directed to it are declining (or not keeping pace with inflation, which is functionally the same)?\\nAs a queer person of middle age, I sort of have more rights, technically, but my day to day life quality has absolutely tanked under the pressure of visibility, and while I am no stranger to weird looks, I was never interrogated about my genital shape whilst trying to pee, until recently, and labour law hasn't really kept up in terms of material protections against discrimination.

It also seems to me that the positive examples you gave are not so certain. I have heard that in the last decade life expectancy and child survival have started to deteriorate, this may indicate that despite the big leap in technology new negative factors have appeared, because in previous years the trend has been constantly improving. It is also worth noting that in terms of these indicators the USA is not in the world top, more far behind. When it comes to wealth it seems to me that it depends on interpretation.  Certainly, on a global scale, citizens are earning more and more, but the problem is that this does not translate into an increase in the possession of fixed assets such as housing, or goods/investments that do not deteriorate quickly in price, such as gold. This is due to the fact that the value of $ on the domestic market is decreasing, so in reality people gradually have less and less wealth.It is true that more people are getting an education, but also because so many of them do not cause a sudden increase in income, but its still good factor.When it comes to improving the climate, I often hear opinions similar to yours, but no one can indicate how this would be done. Recently, there was a lot of talk about the 3-degree catastrophe, everyone was sounding the alarm, drastic changes were proposed, but it ended with proposals. You claim that we can do it within this system, can you then present some outline of the plan?  in my opinion, after familiarizing myself with the limitations proposed by climatologists, I am of the opinion that repairing the climate by their implementation is something that will burst the current system and it is certainly a radical change.","title":"CMV: Society does not need radical change"},{"text":"Its going to get so much better.

Debating if I need to open my horizons and options more ??","title":"Kamala Harris' 'world salad' response on 60 Minutes edited out by CBS"},{"text":"I'll argue against this in two ways.\\n?First - let's pretend we could quantify how \\"good\\" the world is as a simple number (it's obviously more complicated). Saying the world is consistently improving, therefore, we don't need dramatic change - means that, while it might take longer, you'll get to a given \\"good\\" point eventually. However, this is not necessarily the case, because your growth rate is not fixed, because there are other factors that can change the growth rate.?\\n?For example - computing was like this for a while. For several years it followed Moore's law - computation kept doubling in speed every few years. At this point, however, we're hitting atomic limits. If chips get any smaller than they currently are, electrons can jump from one side of a gate to another, because the \\"wires\\" they're travelling on are no longer thick enough to form insulation. So, the entire field of computing had to change - shifting towards parallelism, instead of making a single processor go faster.\\nClimate change can be one such cliff. As it stands, with *all* measures combined, green energy accounts for ~30% of all energy produced. If the \\"better\\" line moves to slowly, such that we run low on fossil fuels, or the worst effects of climate change come to pass (massive natural disasters, changing farm conditions), we might see a downward cliff when fossil fuels run low - water wars, murder for oil, etc. So the *rate* at which things get better is important, so that you don't need to deal with such cliffs.\\nThe other part of this touches on the US centric piece. The status quo in the US is, all things considered, quite good. But the US also accounts for ~= 40% of the world's emissions, and only a small fraction of the population. It's prosperity is bought on the backs of people who live miserable lives - children mining cobalt, working 10+ hour days in hot fields for cocoa, war and bombs ravaging villages to keep oil prices in check, etc. Even if things are fine in the US, we still need radical change, because the status quo that if you're in the imperial periphery, you are subject to awful life conditions, isn't an acceptable state for things to be.","title":"CMV: Society does not need radical change"},{"text":"I'm not holding my breath.

You dont have the same feeling of everyone doing their civic duty together that you do when you patiently wait in long lines and keep a good attitude and encourage each other on Election Day, but it is faster and feels much safer in these times of heightened threats. In Georgia where I am, you can go to ANY voting location anywhere in the county to early vote, where you have to go to your assigned precinct on Election Day. If you avoid going the first day or last few days of early voting, you will likely have little to no wait. Ive tried different places and Ive found that a local library or community center early in the morning or in the middle of the day is the fastest and easiest. There are more often lines of at least some length at places like local government offices all through the early voting period. So if you are nervous, I definitely recommend going for early voting if you can. Also if you go early vote when its not very busy, the poll workers are super glad to have anyone to help and have more time to walk you through the process and you wont feel like you are holding things up or feel like people behind you are frustrated and impatient.I really hope you are in a location where you have lots of early voting options, it makes the whole thing easier for both people who opt to vote early, and the ones who wait til Election Day as the lines are at least somewhat shorter.","title":"I live in a small racist town in a red state and I'm scared.

We need to completely reshape how we think of education. We still have a stigma around starting vocational training at 16 versus finishing high school and going to a four-year college. We still have a stigma around 2 year degrees, and skilled labor. There's tons of examples we can look at in OECD countries of different models of education that provide a pathway to a career without having to take out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loans, and most of those models start at age 16 or 17. 2) Federal regulations need to have built-in expiration dates to force a discussion about whether they're still doing what was intended or if they need to be reworked or scrapped altogether. Additionally, there needs to be an easier mechanism for the voters to challenge the regulations that doesn't involve lengthy and expensive court battles.","title":"CMV: Society does not need radical change"},{"text":"You know, at first I was hesitant, but this has won me over.

That's it. What's even the point of having people to certify an election if they aren't able to make judgement calls about the reliability of the election? And all that happens is the election isn't certified, and the normal legal procedures get followed to verify the election's integrity. On both of these issues, you're trying to pretend they're something they're not. These are *entirely* normal procedural things, that effectively just make the existing process more formally stated. That's literally it. Vance has singled out a person and his plan and that plan includes stating US is a failed experiment and should be replaced with a Monarchy.Funny how you never point to The Plan?. Given that, and the fact that I can't find anything about this, I'm going to assume it's because you're lying about how close these ties are. I seriously doubt Vance has pointed to a plan to turn the US into a Monarchy, and said \\"yes, we're going to do that.\\" All you have is that he's involving a guy who has argued in favor of that on an *unrelated* plan.Do you have anything besides unhinged hyperbolics and purely imagined fearmongering? We should not ignore them just because you happened to like all republicans (you probably don't even know the republicans in Arizona nor WV that put this forward) and Vance.Okay, fine, you have ad hominems too. But pointing out how entirely baseless everything you're saying is doesn't mean I blindly follow all Republicans. It just means I can actually read, and don't live in terror of the boogeyman that you've invented.","title":"America dying if Democrats are elected is crazy, top comment is about how America will die if Republicans are elected"},{"text":"This is just newsweek autospamming nonsense.

The campaign has stopped trumpeting its fund-raising totals to keep Democrats from becoming complacent.By Shane Goldmacher and Maggie Haberman\\nOct. 9, 2024\\nUpdated 2:00 p.m. ETVice President Kamala Harris has raised more than $1 billion in less than three months as a presidential candidate, according to three people with knowledge of her fund-raising haul, a remarkable sum of money that has remade the race against former President Donald J. Trump.The $1 billion haul, which encompasses money raised for her campaign and affiliated party committees, including the Democratic National Committee, is being spent on a wave of television and digital advertising and an expansive operation of offices and staff in the seven battleground states and beyond. The historic sum does not include money donated to allied super PACs.The Harris campaign declined to comment. The campaign has yet to announce how much it raised in September, partly out of concern that bragging about the gush of donations could diminish donor interest in the races final weeks, people briefed on the strategy said. The Harris campaign also remains concerned about the ability of billionaire-funded Republican super PACs to impact the race.The federal reports detailing the fund-raising totals for September are required to be made public later this month.The $1 billion threshold is more than Mr. Trump has announced raising in all of 2024. He has raised around $853 million this calendar year in concert with the party, according to a tally of his campaigns public statements.Past presidential candidates, including Joseph R. Biden and Mr. Trump four years ago, have raised more than $1 billion together with their parties. Mr. Trump announced surpassing that mark in July 2020 after he had been raising funds for his re-election for multiple years.It is the sheer speed with which Ms. Harris has reached that mark that is notable. No presidential candidate is believed to have ever raised so much money so fast after entering a race. Of course, no one in modern political history has replaced a partys presumptive nominee in the middle of the general election.She is expected to easily double the $160 million that Mr. Trump raised in September. She raised $72 million in just three events late last month:$27 million at a single event in New York and then $55 million across two California events.The sums are so large because both candidates are raising funds into jumbo committees that can collect checks of more than $900,000 by including state parties nationwide and the national party.Ms. Harris hit the $1 billion mark in less than 80 days, according to the people with knowledge of her haul, who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.After she replaced President Biden as the de facto Democratic nominee on July 21, the outburst of online donations was organic and enormous. Ms. Harris raised $200 million in her first week  more than Mr. Biden had raised with the party in the last six months of 2023.In fact, Ms. Harris has raised so much money that, in an unusual move in early September, she directed her joint accounts with the party to send $25 million to other party committees focused on down-ballot races for the House, Senate, governor and event state Legislatures.Much of the funds have come from online contributors.In the 80 full days since she declared her candidacy, the Democratic donation platform ActBlue has processed about $1.5 billion in contributions to Democratic candidates and causes, compared to $587 million ActBlue had received in the preceding 81 days, according to the sites online tracker.Ms. Harriss fund-raising has been led by the same team that had been previously raising money for Mr. Biden.Colleen Coffey and Michael Pratt are her finance co-directors, focusing on raising money from larger donors.

Israel has engaged in talks for a two state solution multiple times before, the Palestinians refused to accept the 2000 Camp David offer and refused to accept the 2008-9 Annapolis offer for statehood. Netanyahu also engaged in two state solution talks himself in iirc 2013-14. But Palestine doesn't want a two state solution, they want to destroy Israel. Any acts of goodwill towards Palestine by Israel are taken advantage of, we saw this when Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza and then Palestinians elected Hamas and they took over in Gaza and used the territory to attack Israel repeatedly for the past nearly 20 years. We saw this when Israel let in Gazan guest workers and then Hamas used guest workers to infiltrate Israel to pull off October 7. We saw this when Israel gave the PA autonomy in parts of the West Bank and the supposedly moderate PA continues \\"pay for slay\\" to this very dayIsraelis didn't just get up and decide to refuse a two state solution out of nowhere. They were pushed to that by extreme Palestinian refusal to be even remotely reasonableI want a two state solution but if one is to ever happen, Palestinians are going to need to be the ones to turn away from the psychotic constant war against Israel, and will need to make a massive effort to convince Israel that they are truly willing to come to the table in good faith and negotiate for a state that Israel can actually feel safe existing alongside.","title":"Antisemitism Drives Democratic Jewish Voters Towards Republicans: Poll"},{"text":"Lmao Jewish voters are most certainly not being driven towards republicans.

OK, they operate from Lebanon. You going to occupy Lebanon next? We've seen this program before -- at some point, you have to draw a border. You can argue that it's safer to put that border far from your own people, but the further out you go the more opposition you get, the more troops it takes, the more money it takes, the more international condemnation it drives, the more it fuels the narrative that creates the terrorists ... it's better to heavily defend a border close to home then indefinitely extend the border in the hopes that it'll make it more defensible.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

People who identify as conservative reinforce that identity through conspicuous consumption.

It's hilarious to actually get to talking about values with these people, because their actual personal values are typically quite liberal. But the liberal brand, for them, is pY-whipped soy-boy beta brand, so they can't bring themselves to accept the reality of their own values. Freedom is a liberal value. The conservative brand lays claim to freedom, but the concept was invented by liberal thinkers in the 17th century. Conservatism, at its inception, was explicitly anti-liberal, which meant it did not care for individual freedom, limited government, or free enterprise. It was about ensuring the \\"social fiber\\" remained in-tact, and limiting threats to the tapestry of society. Individual liberty is a threat to this.","title":"Opinion: Trump is no conservative.

It doesn't say a single thing about that. Here's the full text of the amendment, which for some reason you didn't include.It effectively just reiterates that Arizona is going to follow?*the US constitution*, and that the legislator is required to be in session so it can fulfill that duty.\\"A few people\\" being the elected representatives whose?*job*?it is to certify elections. This isn't a case of \\"just throw the election out if you don't like the results, and then pick someone else.\\" It's \\"don't certify the election if there's credible evidence of fraud.\\" Then the election process would be reviewed through the existing legal channels, to determine if the election even should be certified.How many times are you people going to play these games? Find someone who's once said something you disagree with, and then find?any?link, no matter how tenuous, to someone on the ticket. Even you can't pretend like he's planning some insidious overthrow of democracy with Vance. The best you have is that Vance has discussed plans with him to remove some government officials, which is a perfectly normal function of government. People get replaced all the time.It used to be, and still should be a deal breaker to take plans from someone pushing the idea that our democracy is a failed experiment.  Vance is not only not avoiding this person he is naming him as someone he would trust to implement the plan.  This is not a weak or any link - VANCE has singled him out as the person who has the plan to rip and replace anyone that disagrees with them inside the beaucracy.  The plan VANCE referenced not only suggested that democracy is a failed experiment but that we need to replace it with a Monarchy.    That is not a weak link.  That is VANCE pointing towards that plan and saying this is how we will do it.  He didn't limit the plan to only the parts he liked .. he pointed to it and said .. that guy knows how to do it. So, to recap, here's the \\"scary\\" stuff you're pointing to. Arizona?*might*?say that they're going to follow the US constitution. West Virginia?*might*?say they won't certify the election if they think there was voter fraud that affected the result. And Vance has worked with someone who doesn't like democracy, but only on issues relating to the perfectly normal function of government.No - the scary stuff in Arizona says they will put forward the electors that the state legislature thinks is right and could and will completely ignore the voice of the people. The West Virginia one says if a few key people say VOTER FRAUD loud enough they don't need to go through courts, through evidence they just need to think it. Vance has singled out a person and his plan and that plan includes stating US is a failed experiment and should be replaced with a Monarchy.   We should all be against these bills and against he idea of a Monarchy.  We should not ignore them just because you happened to like all republicans (you probably don't even know the republicans in Arizona nor WV that put this forward) and Vance.  Vance propping up someone and stating that guy has the plan we will follow is dangerous enough.  But the fact that plan that he points to as the way to fix the government includes a shift from a democratic republic to a monarchy.  How on earth are we ok with him pointing to that as the plan?","title":"America dying if Democrats are elected is crazy, top comment is about how America will die if Republicans are elected"},{"text":"I agree.

Making it water tight is expensive- would require all new windows/doors that are flood proof, and sealing the exterior so water cant get in (all new siding). So the cheapest is to accept the fact that your house will flood, and ensuring things that are on the lower levels wont be damaged when that happens. Things like moving electrical outlets off the floor, using water proof flooring (no wood/carpet), etc.. This last option is the most economical, and what people generally have to due when they cant sell their house due to flooding risk.Honestly might be better for a hurricane/flood to completely destroy the house- at least rebuilding you would have more options to mitigate the risks- will still cost more than what insurance will likely pay out.","title":"CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years"},{"text":"This is bullshit.

Today, Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman announced that USAID will provide more than $190 million to the Securing Power, Advancing Resilience and Connectivity (SPARC) project, which will provide urgently needed energy assistance to the Government of Ukraine (GOU) over five years. This project will focus on improving the resilience, reliability, affordability, and security of the electric power, natural gas, and district heating sectors in Ukraine and provide critical technical assistance, reform support, and equipment and services to maintain energy supply...USAID has dedicated nearly $1 billion in energy assistance since the onset of Putins full-scale invasion, building short and long-term resilience for the people of Ukraine. This includes over $475 million in emergency support provided during the last two winters to help Ukraine repair and maintain its energy infrastructure. This equipment includes autotransformers to ensure electricity transmission to communities across the country and mobile boiler houses to heat critical facilities like schools and hospitals. This support is helping Ukrainians achieve the future they envision for their own country C one in which Ukraine is prosperous, democratic, and independent.

Strengthen Building Codes (Months 1-3)**\\n   - **Description**: Implement new state-wide building codes to ensure all new constructions and renovations meet higher hurricane-resistance standards (e.g., stronger roofs, impact-resistant windows).\\n   - **Cost**: $5 million (primarily for administrative and regulatory updates, training inspectors, and public awareness campaigns).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Reduced property damage in the long term, lowering insurance claims.\\n   \\n**2. Expand Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Months 1-6)**\\n   - **Description**: Inject additional funding into the state-run insurer, Citizens, to handle policyholders left behind by private insurers. Establish reinsurance partnerships with private insurers to reduce state liability.\\n   - **Cost**: $500 million (to bolster reserves and offer competitive rates, reducing reliance on the state as the last resort).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: More stable insurance market, reducing the need for future taxpayer bailouts.**3. Initiate Legal Reforms (Months 3-6)**\\n   - **Description**: Enact tort reform to cap legal fees, reduce frivolous lawsuits, and streamline the claims process. Adjust regulations to limit the potential for abuse in property insurance claims litigation.\\n   - **Cost**: $2 million (for legal and administrative costs of passing reforms).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Significant savings on legal fees for insurers, which could reduce premiums by 5-15%.**4. Launch Home Hardening Grant Program (Months 4-12)**\\n   - **Description**: Launch a state-funded grant or rebate program incentivizing homeowners to strengthen their homes against hurricanes. Grants would cover upgrades like roof reinforcement and storm shutters.\\n   - **Cost**: $300 million (offering grants/rebates of $5,000 per home for 60,000 homes initially).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Reduced claims in the aftermath of storms; homeowners could see premium reductions of 10-20% with these improvements.**5. Cap Insurance Premium Increases (Months 6-12)**\\n   - **Description**: Regulate and cap insurance premium hikes. Insurers must justify increases with detailed risk assessments, ensuring affordability for homeowners.\\n   - **Cost**: $3 million (administrative and regulatory oversight).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Preventing runaway premium increases, potentially saving homeowners thousands annually in premium costs. **Year 2: Market Stability and Expansion*6. Establish State-Backed Reinsurance Pool (Months 6-18)**\\n   - **Description**: Develop a state-run reinsurance program that helps private insurers offset some of the risk in providing coverage to high-risk areas. This reduces the need for private insurers to purchase expensive reinsurance.\\n   - **Cost**: $1 billion (capital investment to establish the pool and insure against catastrophic losses).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Lower reinsurance costs for insurers could reduce premiums by 10-20% in high-risk zones.**7. Attract New Insurers and Specialty Firms (Months 9-18)**\\n   - **Description**: Offer tax incentives, regulatory flexibility, and risk-sharing arrangements to attract new insurers and specialized companies to Floridas market. Focus on encouraging smaller, regional insurers to increase competition.\\n   - **Cost**: $100 million (in tax incentives and reduced regulatory fees).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Increased competition could lower insurance costs by 5-10%, especially in specialized markets like wind and flood insurance.**8. Expand Federal Partnerships and Relief (Months 12-18)**\\n   - **Description**: Collaborate with federal agencies to increase access to disaster relief funds, particularly through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Push for more federal subsidies to reduce exposure for private insurers.\\n   - **Cost**: $10 million (for lobbying and administrative coordination with federal programs).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Reducing insurers exposure to flood risk would decrease premiums for coastal and flood-prone properties.**9. Regulate and Monitor Reinsurance Markets (Months 12-24)**\\n   - **Description**: Establish state oversight on the reinsurance market, ensuring that reinsurance prices remain fair and competitive. This prevents runaway costs for private insurers, which pass those costs on to homeowners.\\n   - **Cost**: $5 million (to create a regulatory body or commission focused on the reinsurance market).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Stabilizing reinsurance costs could reduce insurance premiums by 5-10%.**10. Public Education Campaign (Months 12-24)**\\n   - **Description**: Launch a large-scale public awareness campaign to educate homeowners on how to mitigate risk and reduce insurance costs. Provide resources on home-hardening techniques, available grants, and the importance of adequate coverage.\\n   - **Cost**: $25 million (for a statewide marketing and outreach program).\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Reduced claims through better preparedness could lead to lower premiums for policyholders. **Estimated Total Cost Over Two Years**:  \\n**$1.95 billion**  \\nThis plan represents a significant investment, but it aims to stabilize Floridas insurance market, reduce premiums for homeowners, and mitigate future disaster-related losses, potentially saving billions in claims costs long-term.","title":"CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years"},{"text":"I am not sure who the experts are here ... or what your comment is referencing?","title":"America dying if Democrats are elected is crazy, top comment is about how America will die if Republicans are elected"},{"text":"is there some sort of precedent for previous presidents being petty not providing aid relief to areas that have constituents or a governor that are of the opposite party after a natural disaster? otherwise he's just doing his normal job and it's nothing to be applauded.the only one I can think of is the Puerto Rican governor withholding supplies of her own people to make Trump look bad, but that's a different thing altogether and has nothing to do with the president","title":"What has Biden done well?"},{"text":"by collapse, I mean values drop 30-50%. this is the commonly used definition.","title":"CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years"},{"text":"60 Minutes should air that 2 and a half minute segment they did documenting how Trump was scheduled to appear and then backed out at the last minute again.","title":"'IMMEDIATE APOLOGY!': Trump Demands 60 Minutes Be Investigated Today"},{"text":"What's with her hands?","title":"An Exclusive picture of Kamala Harris creating hurricane Milton"},{"text":"Real wages are up over what they were at in Q4 2019 before the pandemic.

This one empowers the state legislature to ignore the will of the people and appoint electors as they see fit. No need to care if or who the people voted for.No it doesn't. It doesn't say a single thing about that. Here's the full text of the amendment, which for some reason you didn't include. Whereas, the United States Constitution, article II, section 1, clause 2 states that, \\"Each state shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress.\\"; and Whereas, it is the responsibility of the Arizona Secretary of State to certify elections, including elections for President of the United States, but the sole authority to appoint presidential electors is granted to the Legislature. Therefore Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring: 1. That the Legislature shall remain in session during years in which presidential elections are held; and 2. That the Legislature, and no other official, shall appoint presidential electors in accordance with the United States Constitution. It effectively just reiterates that Arizona is going to follow *the US constitution*, and that the legislature is required to be in session so it can fulfill that duty. They don't need a set of facts, they don't need evidence, they just need a few people in WV to believe what they read on the internet.\\"A few people\\" being the elected representatives whose *job* it is to certify elections. This isn't a case of \\"just throw the election out if you don't like the results, and then pick someone else.\\" It's \\"don't certify the election if there's credible evidence of fraud.\\" Then the election process would be reviewed through the existing legal channels, to determine if the election even should be certified. JD Vance has close ties to a gentleman by the name of Curtis Yarvin.How many times are you people going to play these games? Find someone who's once said something you disagree with, and then find any link, no matter how tenuous, to someone on the ticket. Even you can't pretend like he's planning some insidious overthrow of democracy with Vance. The best you have is that Vance has discussed plans with him to remove some government officials, which is a perfectly normal function of government. People get replaced all the time.So, to recap, here's the \\"scary\\" stuff you're pointing to. Arizona *might* say that they're going to follow the US constitution. West Virginia *might* say they won't certify the election if they think there was voter fraud that affected the result. And Vance has worked with someone who doesn't like democracy, but only on issues relating to the perfectly normal function of government.","title":"America dying if Democrats are elected is crazy, top comment is about how America will die if Republicans are elected"},{"text":"But you'd essentially have a risk each year that it could get destroyed.

Reinsurance rates went through the roof.  The issue is that insurers are extremely risk averse, especially reinsurers.  If they cant accurately calculate a risk, they throw on risk factors to make sure they dont lose money.  When I was working, reinsurance rates were often 3 year payoff, ie if you were taking the $100-200 million traunch, the rate was $30 million/yr.  Rates that high were unheard of at the time for reinsurance.  Reinsurers dont want that level of uncertainty, its simply not the business theyre in.  Theyre sitting on stacks of investments &amp; the reinsurance is just icing on top.Rates are going up after this year, if next year has more hurricanes, &amp; the year after the reinsurers flip their shit.  Reinsurers leaving the market en masse is not outside of the question.  Florida cant reinsure itself, the risk is too widespread, &amp; the rest of the country will not be eager to subsidize beach houses.Maybe next years not bad, but it is a gamble.

Voters elected a tied senate, where the Dems only got the tiebreaker vote due to the constitutional quirk of the VP acting as tiebreaker. And voters elected a technical sort of majority where the Dems would not have any majority at all if it weren't for Manchin. And Manchin never campaigned as a liberal, he campaigned as a hardcore moderate who literally ran advertisements shooting Obama's proposed legislation with a gunIn other words, it makes no sense to say we elected a liberal majority, when we elected a majority that numerically 100% relied on a guy who openly isn't a liberalguys this is what he has to do to get elected in WVThe only democrats getting elected in places like WV are moderatesDo you guys feel entitled to have moderates not really be moderate, and instead just pretend to be moderate while then flipping and rubber stamping staunch liberal policy whenever it matters? Because that wouldn't be moderateIt turns out that the sort of folks who may be necessary to win in these areas are, like, **actual** moderates, not just liberals playing pretend. They are going to do what they think is right, rather than what liberals sanctimoniously demand they do. still doesn't vote for CTC or much needed climate legislation or getting rid of the filibusterThe climate stuff was one of the few things he actually retained in the IRA from the BBB. Using that as an example for the \\"Manchin man BAD\\" argument is nonsensical. Bear in mind he also did various other things liberals like, like voting for infrastructure, for Biden's liberal judicial and cabinet appointments, for the big stimulus that helped the economic recovery, for the expansion of ACA subsidies, increase in taxes, reforms of prescription drugs, and so on. He didn't give liberals all of what they want, but he did do some things, including the big climate spending which is vital for helping secure the futureAnd if we had a gop majority, we probably wouldn't have gotten any of that, not even the bipartisan stuff Biden did, because Mitch would have no reason to put those things to a vote in the first placeAs for the CTC, too damn bad. Liberals can't get everything they want when they need to rely on moderates. But they had the opportunity to pass a partial CTC extension expansion. Manchin took issue with the CTC due to fears that parents would use the money to shoot up with drugs (an understandable concern for someone from one of the states hardest hit by the drug epidemic) but he also offered a compromise to add a work test requirement to the CTC. Considering that, and his $1.5t spending limit, Dems could have written up a bill that did the climate stuff (which ended up being more like $1t all by itself but at the time on paper was just $350b) and the full 10 years ACA ($200b), and then had $950b left for a partial CTC expansion extension. With the full CTC expansion extension being around $1.5t all by itself, they'd have needed to cut out about a third of it. The work requirement could have shaved off some spending, and considering the high income cutoffs for the original proposal (iirc something like 85k and 150k single/joint?), they had plenty of room to cut off some spending from the higher earners while still keeping most of the benefits aimed at lower earnersBut the party refused to do that, instead spending a months long tantrum acting entitled to having Manchin move from his 1.5t limit, and they ended up with less than that limit. They could have tried for a \\"climate, healthcare, and partial CTC\\" bill, but just... chose not to even *try* to take Manchin seriously, instead pissing him off to the point where he just took his ball and went home. Dems are lucky he came back to the table at allAs for the filibuster, again, moderates are going to be moderate and aren't always going to be lock step with liberals. And Manchin is sort of vindicated there anyway, liberals were hysterical suggesting a \\"Jim Eagle\\" inability to win the house unless voting rights legislation was passed for gerrymandering, but in the end the maps that were drawn ended up advantaging the Dems rather than GOP anyway - Dems lost the popular vote by around 3 points but only lost the tipping point district by around 1 pointand Manchin decided he wanted the spotlightSo no, he just stood for the moderate ideals he had always stood for. That's how moderates work. Again, if we expect \\"moderates\\" to be secret liberals, that's just not how things work. And we can't win with liberals alone. So either suck it up and learn to love the Manchin or get GOP majorities that will do far less than what Manchin allowed. It's that simple. There is no alternative.","title":"Bidens push for child care failed.

Fast forward people are wondering where it went. The story is of course not what Trump said. MAGA you may want to stop reading now, turns out Trump spent $600,000+ from FEMA on this stuff. Some of it from companies on sanctions list (he knew that as it was treasury that paid) and a lot of the ventilators were the ones catching fire. The ventilators were under priced which is another head scratcher. About a month or two after America paid Russia and Trump went on TV to praise Putin for the supplies (late May or early June 2020) they were asked if they had any issues with the ventilators and how they had been dispersed to the hospitals in NYC and the response was that COVID was stable and therefore those supplies were sent to a warehouse in NYC and not sent to anywhere. Let that sink in there was nothing stable about mid April in NYC deaths aside PPE gear was stretched thin. We sent Russia $600,000 of FEMA money at the start of COVID for stuff to sit in a warehouse likely because NYC is liberal.","title":"Kremlin confirms Trump sent COVID-19 tests to Putin during pandemic"},{"text":"Now that their jobs may be on the line is when they decide to listen to their constituents?

The facts on the ground haven't changed in a meaningful way, vis a vis a two state solution; it remains a question of political will. Let's address your points in turn.The Israeli government isn't going to allow the dislocation of these settlers and turn them into refugees, and any theoretical Palestinian government will not continue to allow them to stay.Of these \\\\~400K settlers, 8 out of 10 are within the so-called \\"consensus blocs\\", which are close to the Israeli border, long-standing, and heavily populated; they're essentially inexpensive suburbs of Jerusalem, and incorporating them into Israel could be done via land swaps while maintaining the same amount of land for Palestine, a territorially contiguous West Bank and adding \\\\~20,000 Palestinian citizens to Israel. So you're talking about moving about 80K people, [about half](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140412-poll-half-of-settlers-would-evacuate-settlements-in-exchange-for-compensation/) of whom would evacuate voluntarily for compensation. Can Israel forcibly evacuate 40K people? Of course. Can it find a way to house and compensate 90,000 people? Yes, of course -- it found a way to do it for a *million* people in the 1950s. So you're essentially back to the same question from the 1990s: Israel can pick two of three things, being a Jewish-majority state, a democratic state, or a state that includes all of ancient Judea. It can't have all three. Overwhelmingly, Israelis prefer maintaining the first two over risking either to achieve the third (despite the opinion of a vocal minority on the far-right, who have exploited Israel's parliamentary system and Netanyahu's corruption to find an unprecedented place in the current government).Yes, it would be politically difficult to move 90K voters against their will. Yes, it would be expensive. Yes, it would be unpopular. And yes, it would be no guarantee that the independent Palestinian entity in the West Bank would be peaceful, or democratic. But it *is* something that Israel could do unilaterally, and it is far simpler to focus on border security than to try and keep a minority of hostile settlers safe, spread scatter-shot across a large foreign population; it would be cheaper, it would be safer, and it would be more moral. On the other hand, Israel *can't* create a \\"one state solution\\" unilaterally. It would have to a) overcome the Israeli far-right's desire for a Jewish nationalist state (which is necessary for a 2SS) ... but would then *also* have to overcome Arab nationalists' desire for an Arab state, *and* Islamists' desire for a Muslim state, and then convince the rest of the Jews and Arabs that it had successfully accomplished A, B and C, *and* somehow create the capability of maintaining peace between these groups while not maintaining borders between them, *and* create a functioning democracy between these groups.So I can understand why \\"2SS\\" might sound like a cynical ploy to you, but understand that to many Palestinian Arabs, a \\"1SS\\" sounds like a cynical ploy (\\"Trust us, being part of Israel is better than an independent Palestine! Trust us, you'll get equal rights!\\") and to many Israelis, it *also* sounds like a cynical ploy (\\"Your enemy promises that, if you just hand him your weapons first, he'll put down his afterwards and welcome living in peace with you.\\")","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Sometimes it will be a specific discount like your building has a fire suppression sprinkler system, that has a 10% discountOther times it will be more subjective to the underwriter. Underwriters have some level of adjustment capability to account for non-commonplace things. There isnt a this property owner has a YouTube channel where they set things on fire in their house factor. So the underwriter might increase their rate to account for that higher level of risk.The way insurance works though is you need a lot of people to pay into it so the insurance company can cover losses from a small portion of the people. Because floods affect so many people frequently, most insurers just dont write flood insurance. So even if you have loss prevention in place, they still wont do it because they need a few hundred more people to buy insurance.In short, if you can already get flood insurance without any loss prevention measures in place, adding in loss prevention measures will almost certainly make it cheaper","title":"CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years"},{"text":"Fair and reasoned take","title":"Antisemitism Drives Democratic Jewish Voters Towards Republicans: Poll"},{"text":"Trump speaks their language.

A company can fire you at will and you can leave a company at will. If you leave a company, you should be allowed to work wherever else you want. Non competes keep employees from moving laterally across their industry and is generally anti competitive. Theyre really popular in tech and finance and as a software engineer I hate non competes. If I work at a company that does X, and find another company that does X but is maybe better organized, or has better tech, or better benefits, and I get an offer from that company to go work there, then its a simple calculus - its in my best interest to leave my current company. But with a non compete issued by my current company, it prevents me from being competitive in the labor market and ultimately protects the weaker firm.On the flip side, the non compete ban was overturned in a federal court I believe on the grounds that non competes protect company assets, and the staunch capitalist in me understands that a regulation such as this can be anti business (or open up a vector for attack via corporate espionage and allow a bad acting company or foreign corporate adversary (think Bytedance in China) to steal your tech). Additionally, you can just simply choose to not work at companies that have non competes. Though that makes it difficult to get into certain industries like fintech. Almost every fintech company has non competes to prevent their competitors from buying up talent.But I still think the ruling that overturned the ban was a pretty weak argument. We have NDAs to protect trade secrets as well, and NDAs are legally enforceable and allow a company to sue you for breach of contract. A non compete ban is definitely pro worker and makes companies have to work for your talent instead of gag ordering you for choosing to exit.","title":"What has Biden done well?"},{"text":"If 60 Minutes was cool, they'd reply:??*Sorry.

Like Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, which already exists as Florida's insurer of last resort? Here's my take: - More and more Floridians will have to rely on Citizens, as private insurers pull out. - In order to stay solvent, Citizens will have to increase rates rapidly year-over-year, like they're doing now. - State-backed insurance will start to get really expensive (though below market rates that take the full risk into account). - Florida voters will vote for funding (via bonds, taxes, etc) to keep Citizens afloat- The cost of state-backed insurance, along with the taxes and such to keep it solvent, will make home ownership much more expensive in FL - The backend cost of insurance (and fear of disaster) will cause the real estate market to cool, as real estate in FL continues to be a risky investment - An equilibrium will happen where lower home prices cause it to make economic sense to buy a house outright and forgo insurance, and the market will appeal to a narrower segment of people While the end result is a depressed real estate market and pretty fucked populace, I think it'll take a lot longer than a handful of years as people try to prop up current structures as long as they can. Also there's the possibility that technological solutions (like better building codes, better materials, etc) will make the risk more manageable in the long run.

Generally, partners like (allegedly) Emhoff are protected by their firms. As long as someone like this keeps bringing in money, the firm will?terminate anyone who even looks uncomfortable with their behavior and, while doing so, force them to sign extremely regressive non-disparagement agreements as a condition for something called \\"website time.\\" During website time, you continue to work for the firm on paper and the firm maintains your profile on the website. This allows you to easily lateral to another firm before your official termination; which the conventional wisdom says is necessary before being terminated to keep your career. In other words, if you complain about inappropriate behavior, the firm will frog march you out the door, but not before forcing you to sign an agreement not to say anything at all negative about them first (and declaring that you don't know about any bad behavior of course) by?holding your career hostage, or at least appearing to.\\nOver time, you learn to ignore bad behavior.

The reason floods arent covered in insurance is less because the insurance company doesnt want the risk, and more in order for the insurance company to collect enough premium to cover flood losses, the insurance would be extremely expensive.

The problem with floods is if you have a chance of getting flooded, you probably will be in the near future. Probably multiple times. Floods affect a lot of locations, cause a ton of damage, and are relatively frequent.Wildfires and earthquakes dont really operate that way. Yes they can be catastrophic, but they dont happen multiple times a year at a huge scale like floods.I think you can argue wildfires will approach flood levels of frequency with climate change, but still, wildfires dont typically affect large populated areas like floods do.","title":"CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years"},{"text":"The point is not specifically to elect Trump, it is to cause chaos in the United States and inflame divisions.

It also ignores the fact that a LOT of the shifts in dynamics among majority Muslim Arab-run states began to shift toward other Arabs (Mizrahim.)There's a big shift in the mid-20th century where Arab Jews and Iranian Jews began to leave their countries of origin for Israel, which shifted the dynamics in the region completely. It wasn't JUST the Palestinian Arab populations that had a balance with the Jewish populations, it was the entire region's Muslim populations that did. The big shift in attitudes toward Jews in the region started with Ashkenazi settlement in the area, but really accelerated as the Mizrahim (Arabs) left their regional homes.And frankly, I think a good case can be made that a lot of the hardline politics of 21st century Israel (Likud and its allies) were driven by the Arab Jewish population, not the Ashkenazi. It's common wisdom that Likud and the right wing were driven by Arab/North African Jews, not by the earlier waves of Ashkenazi.

We will never get anywhere with this blatant double standard if we don't call it out when it happens. And similar to the Hunter Laptop story, if it is accurately reported by the press it will allow the voters to better form their opinions and affect how they are going to vote. It might not switch a ton of votes from Kamala to Trump, but it has the potential for voters to just not vote for Kamala and turn to 3rd party or do a write in. After the 2020 election they performed a survey, and it came out that roughly 13% of Biden voters said they would not have voted for Biden if they had known about/known the laptop story was legitimate. Now would all 13% change their vote to Trump or a republican ticket in general, no, but 13% in such a close election would have changed the outcome. This story has a similar chance to change the outcome. Especially because Kamala's whole campaign has been she will \\"fight for women and represent them\\", but it turns out she's married to a man who has slapped women around and sexually harassed them in the office, if the allegations are to be believed. That has the potential to turn voters off and either have them vote for Jill Stien, write in a candidate, or hell some could potentially switch to Trump.

When you look at most colonial enterprises, the European invaders left decades ago. That's not to say state creation in this case was simple, but it is easier without Europeans around. In this case, European invaders had been coming for decades with no intent to leave. Instead of leaving at the same time as other colonizers, the European marauders decided that they were going to stay and create a state of their own, aka Israel. Not only, that, but the area attracted even more European marauders who were tired of Europe. At that time, the only solution was for any person who came from Europe to British Palestine to be placed on a ship back to Europe, and for any future ships from Europe to be denied with force. What makes it different today is unlike back then, most of Israel's citizenry does not have citizenship elsewhere, so international law means that we will have to somehow work the first ever peaceful solution between the descendants of European invaders and locals who have lived there for centuries. This is a task that is decades long and not centuries long.","title":"CMV: A vast portion of Arabs/Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza have no idea what Palestinian \\"statehood\\" is; for them \\"statehood\\" is merely the absence of Jews"},{"text":"Hallelujah and Amen","title":"Diddy is a distraction"},{"text":"He was the leader of our political enemy and, until we stepped in post-9/11, the leader of the organization that ruled Afghanistan.

I've managed to only find one news agency reporting it, Fox (not a surprise).[Fox Business - FEMA untapped funds](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mayorkas-says-fema-has-no-more-disaster-funds-ig-report-says-agency-sitting-billions)In an response to the OIG's draft report (found within the same audit report), FEMA justified the large quantity of untapped funds on the recoveries efforts of hurricane Sandy (around $4.5 billion of that $7 billion to be precise), and that they further stated that of the $9 million, they managed to recover around $5.7 million, for example, but you'd think that's something that would show up in their monthly report as \\"funds from previous disaster declarations,\\" or something else that sounds more vague, or convoluted. They submitted that response to the audit draft report on June 20th of this year, so I've been looking at reports as early as June, and the reports don't even mention monies that were directed back into the DRF. A summary of the what goes in and out of the DRF budget in those reports look like this:Carryover From FY 2023 - (funding)FY 2024 Appropriations (funding)FY 2024 Additional Appropriations (funding) FY 2024 Recoveries (funding)Actual Transfers to DADLP (money taken out)Actual 6% for Predisaster Mitigation per DRRA (money taken out) Actual Transfers to OIG (money taken out)Anticipated Transfers to USAID (money taken out)Obligations (money that's already earmarked for some form of disaster relief)I mean those funds can be transferred over without going through the appropriations process, which is what this report includes. It might involve some congressional consultation (with committees for example) but that's about it. So, where can see where that money went? We can't. We (the public) don't know if that money was really put back into the DRF or not.

So many of our problems stem from unfettered capitalism and greed, which exists mostly because of deregulation. We wont thrive in a society that puts profits over people. Right wing policies are very pro deregulation of the private sector, which is eating us alive. Capitalism is a tool we need for society but its only half the equation.  We cant privatize everything. We need social programs that put people over profits. Socialism paired with capitalism is crucial to a balanced and thriving society. But were not getting that in America. Whats considered left wing here is very centered in other countries who have universal healthcare/education, paid-time leave, food and safety laws, etc. Were so afraid of our government that we wont consider letting it evolve to be something better for our society. A lot of what youve said in the comments are progressive ideals. We want to try things. The key word is try. We cant say no to everything just because were against big government and scared of taxes. If we taxed the ultra wealthy and did better about regulating what we do when on we could fund these things. And we both agree that we need watchdog systems to monitor government spending. But switching from a very heavy capitalistic society to a balanced society only benefits us. And it doesnt hinder innovation. People who create and chase new innovations dont do it solely for the money. Investors do it for the money. So we need public investing for most cost solutions. And while youre frustrated with taxes, most of your hard earned money is being used on overpriced goods and services for egregious profit margins. Everyone else has made points about why we disagree with conservative policies. The demonizing your feeling is because were jaded. Because things wont change unless we progress and try something different. So were frustrated because it feels like your fears and distrust of this potential evolution of governing and society is whats holding us back. Weve done it the small government, pro capitalism, deregulation way for decades. And it hasnt worked. Its actually made life much much harder. So why not give liberal policies a chance. And I mean real liberal policies. Not centered left like weve gotten the last decade. Change takes time. It wont happen over night. But we need to push for it to happen. And the more people who align together the faster we get there. A lot of your stances show that some conservatives are shifting more left. Not far right conservatives. But those close to the middle. Were talk more about gun control laws. Were embracing lgbtq communities. We want to take money out of politics, etc. But again, were jaded. we can be abrasive because weve also experienced bad conversations too. We all want to feel heard and understood but political and cultural bias keeps us from gaining any ground. You are trying to bring more to the conversation which is meaningful and should be welcomed. But weve had our fair share of MAGA conversations that tend to ignore logic and reason for the sake of owning or contrasting the libs. But I agree we need civil discourse. People wont  adapt to new ideas if you call them idiots or evil. We have to get better about seeing people on a spectrum of political ideals. It cant be black and white. Just because you lean right doesnt mean were as far off on policy as someone whos far right. Either way, thanks for engaging us in a conversation and giving us your thoughts on what you stand for. Dont be discouraged from progressive policies just because progressives can be abrasive at times. Again, were just ready for something new.","title":"Openly Conservative"},{"text":"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/10/04/prominent-latter-day-saints-urge/","title":"Why Mitt Romney  no fan of Donald Trump  doesnt plan to endorse Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"Yeah.

Not that we should get complacent and we still need to vote... but...I just don't get how we can have so many groups across the political spectrum turning against Trump (even if they aren't voting for Harris, they may not vote for Trump, which would still be a win). Trump is losing votes everywhere - Evangelicals, white men, older folks, all have shifted towards Harris (though Trump is still get a majority of them). Trump can't afford to lose any votes... so how is it still a \\"statistical tie\\"? I get that the EC means that Harris could landslide the popular vote, but in the states \\"that matter\\" (PA/GA/NV/MI/WI/NC), how is it \\"closer\\" than it was in 2020?We're also seeing special elections and other elections since 2020 show a good shift towards Democrats (see the mayor election in Alaska, which Trump won the area by 15% but they just elected a Democratic mayor). We're seeing that over and over since 2022 (post Roe). Even when Democrats don't win, they still shift the electorate by a good bit.Honestly what I expect to see is that the polls will be \\"correct\\" but only because of the margin of error. Most polls have a plus or minus 3% margin of error, which means a \\"statistical tie\\" could mean Harris winning by 6% (+3% for her, -3% for Trump). So a 50/50 becomes 53/47.

This heats up the planet slowly but surely. The heat mostly goes into the oceans, and we are now seeing record setting ocean temps for years and years. You can see the graph in this article so notice just how high ocean temps are now, setting records year after year. https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68921215Those high ocean temps then create more evaporation which creates more rain, thus more flooding. We saw that with Helene. And the heat from the ocean also feeds hurricanes, potentially making them more common and more severe. We are now seeing that with Milton.

Give it time and I bet Israel would go for them too though imo.You might need a history lesson. Israel controlled Sinai. All of it. They controlled it for almost 20 years. And they have it back.Israel is not going to take the Sinai. Israel is not at all likely to annex Gaza. Killing 2% of a population in a year is pretty substantial, actually.I didn't say it wasn't.

Trump has a unique speaking style that translates best to his audience in live speeches, and it is often very difficult to translate what he says into the written word. He often speaks in very long, meandering sentences that end suddenly or jump between topics, and turning them into a news story that makes sense to someone who wasn't watching the speech requires quite a lot of paraphrasing or using shorter quotes. We could only write stories about how his speeches can be bizarre or rambling, but I don't think that helps readers understand what policies or arguments he is making. Reporting on him does involve pulling out specific ideas or language and interpreting it, which is not an ideal way to cover politics but sometimes the only option.  \\nThat said, we also try and cover the wackiness of Trump's speeches so readers get a flavour of what they are like. Kamala Harris can also speak in rambling sentences and we write about that too, because readers do still care about candidates' presentation style. When Joe Biden was still in the race, his speaking style and gaffes were one of the major issues we covered because of what it suggested about his age and mental state. Having covered many speeches on both sides, I can say that succinctly explaining Harris's core message using her quotes is a lot easier in a news story than doing the same for Trump.","title":"I'm The Telegraph's US Editor, Tony Diver and I'm here to answer your questions - Ask me Anything !"},{"text":"And the Nobel Prize goes to ...

The Telegraph is primarily a UK outlet, and it's quite difficult to track British conservatism onto US politics. Defining a \\"true\\" conservative is also quite tricky. On the surface level though, there are obvious similarities between what we think about as the small-c conservative preference for lower taxes and Trump's platform. Trump also talks about shrinking the size and power of the state, which gives him credibility as a conservative, although arguably he did not do particularly well at implementing that desire when in power. I think the greatest divide between Trump and conservatism is on foreign policy -- the kind of liberal interventionism we came to associate with conservatives in the US in the back half of the last century is now so far removed from the Republican Party under his leadership that he doesn't get top marks from conservatives on that front. On your second question, I think sometimes being economical with the truth is a hallmark of politics on both sides of the Atlantic, but I think it would be harder for a politician with the legal history of Trump's to succeed in Britain.

I am British, and I previously covered UK politics from Westminster before moving to the US.I think there are some similarities between politics in both countries, largely driven by similar challenges they face. Illegal migration has become a much more salient issue in the UK over the last few years, and dominated the most recent UK general election in much the same way as the southern US border has dominated this presidential campaign. As in the US, Conservatives are generally viewed as taking a tougher approach to border security, and Labour's more technocratic solution is more analogous to Biden's border plan. Domestic debates about energy and climate policy in the UK have also followed a similar trajectory, with Conservatives more likely to push for fossil fuel extraction over the huge green energy investment pledged by the Labour Party (and inspired by Biden's industrial policy here).The major difference is there is no British Trump. US politics is so driven by the character and policies of Trump, and his preference for an America First foreign policy is not really replicated by any major UK party. That is obviously due in part to the fact Britain doesn't have a presidential system, so the individual personality of party leaders is marginally less important in UK politics than it is in the US. The rhetoric of American politics is much more direct and divisive, and I think that filters down to the way that people talk about politics in their daily lives. There is not really an equivalent to the level of passion that Trump inspires on either side of the debate in the UK, and although politics at home has become more divided in the last decade or so. Britain also doesn't have some of the major issues that inspire such strong feelings here; both gun control and abortion for instance are considered settled issues in Britain and have been for decades.","title":"I'm The Telegraph's US Editor, Tony Diver and I'm here to answer your questions - Ask me Anything !"},{"text":"Probably heresy, but honestly I love it here.

Some proposals go further, but they all use that as a baseline.And my point is that they've all failed. First of all, the \\"1967 borders\\" is itself a misnomer. The more accurate name is the 1949 armistice line, a boundary that was supposed to be temporary. It was simply where the armies stood at the time and was intended only to last until a finalized treaty could be established.The line literally split towns and cities in half in many cases. It was never sustainable and negotiations that ignore that fact are unlikely to ever succeed. Also I get that some people want to treat Gaza apart from the West Bank, but almost all discussion in this arena binds them together. Most proposals have provisions for a highway that would connect the two...there's a reason it's not called the \\"three state\\" solution.The question isn't about what has been done though, but what is possible. A highway to connect the two is hardly the most feasible and seems more like a pipe dream to me. The design, construction, and management of such a thing would be a nightmare. Israel absolutely has interest in annexing Gaza, they just don't want to deal with the people living there at the moment. It's miles of beach/dock front property, there's been open real estate auctions where people are auctioning off speculative parcels of land in Gaza, there's oil and gas reserves.So all this means that Israel must be planning to annex it? If that were the case, Israel could get all of that in far greater amounts by simply annexing parts of the Sinai, which notably lacks the people issue Gaza does.There is no serious support in Israel for annexing Gaza. You can cite the extreme views all you want, but that's about as intellectually honest as saying the US wants to ban fracking because a handful of politicians have said as much.And let's be frank here. Israel's war in Gaza is doing absolutely nothing to get rid of this \\"troublesome population\\" you describe. A year of war and the total death toll is less than 2% of the population, emigration is practically nonexistent, and birth rates are actually estimated to be higher than the death toll from the war. There is zero chance of the war as it is being waged ever reducing the Gaza population by any statistically significant way.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

It seems to me that for Palestinians, the mass arrival of Jews to Levant, especially during the Fifth Aliyah, was threatening at best. Palestinians were so detested by the presence of Jews and the fact that, one day, there might have emerged an *independent Jewish state next to them* (or that they themselves would be incorporated in such a state).I cant say for sure what the motives of Palestinians were, but I think theres an alternative explanation that you hint at in the parenthetical at the end of this quote. Maybe the problem that Palestinians had wasnt the mere presence of Jews, it was control and governance by Jews that presented a problem for them. I think it was pretty clear prior to Zionism that Palestinians were mostly okay with the presence of at least a small number of Jews. After all, there had been a Jewish minority there for millennia. So your hypothesis seems to be that once there were a lot of Jews Palestinians realized that they didnt want Jews around anymore. I think the number of Jews was probably not the only thing they were reacting to. Zionists arrived in Palestine to exercise self-determination so that Jews could control their own fate. The way they thought they could achieve that was through a state controlled by Jews. But how could that be achieved in a territory that was occupied primarily by Palestinians? I see three ways: (1) they could form a state on a tiny sliver of Palestine that had a large Jewish majority and ensure that the Palestinian population did not increase; (2) they could form a state on land with a large Palestinian population but not let them participate in governance; (3) they could clear the Palestinians out and form a state on a large piece of the land that had been cleared of Palestinians. I think you can see how the arrival of people with this goal would have been a problem **even if Palestinians were perfectly fine with having Jews around** in other circumstances. Consider an alternative history where Jews immigrated to Palestine for safety and sought to co-exist in a state with shared governance rather than Jewish governance - do you think theres a possibility that that wouldve ended differently?","title":"CMV: A vast portion of Arabs/Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza have no idea what Palestinian \\"statehood\\" is; for them \\"statehood\\" is merely the absence of Jews"},{"text":"Shes the empty candidate, versus Trump?Seems your calibration is a bit off","title":"Kamala Harris' 'world salad' response on 60 Minutes edited out by CBS"},{"text":"Just popped over there to take a look and one of the first comments I read was basically I cant believe this incompetent person is polling ~50/50 with our super competent, amazing candidate.

Theres a reason for this, theres a reason education sucks, and its the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. Its never gonna get any better. Dont look for it. Be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. Theyve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they dont want: They dont want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They dont want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. Theyre not interested in that. That doesnt help them. That's against their interests. That's right. They dont want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly theyre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They dont want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now theyre coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? Theyll get it. Theyll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you aint in it. You and I are not in the big club. And by the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people -- white collar, blue collar, it doesnt matter what color shirt you have on -- good honest hard-working people continue -- these are people of modest means -- continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who dont give a fuck about them. They dont give a fuck about you. They dont give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all -- at all -- at all. And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on; the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday. Because the owners of this country know the truth: it's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.\\"George Carlin","title":"Diddy is a distraction"},{"text":"Haven't most Democrat Presidents had at least one Republican in the Cabinet?

They supported the Gazan government, *even as it attacked them*, off the premise that a stable government would stop attacking Israel to govern.  In 1978 Israel forcibly removed settlers from Sinai and demolished the settlements.  In 2008 the Israeli supreme court forced the government to explain why it wasn't taking down a settlement.  Israel has halted construction of settlements at times for improved relationships with Arab countries.  There is political will in Israel to take down settlements and some do get dismantled.  But then violence happens and more get put up because they become afraid and it becomes that much harder to take them down again.To me it seems a one-state solution is an inevitability, and it's just going to be a matter of whether or not Jewish citizens get preferential treatment and Arabs are treated as second-class citizens; whether or not it'll be a Jewish supremacist apartheid state, or a secular democracy and no longer a Jewish ethno-state.I think what you are missing is that no one wants this.  There is no interest in a state that combines Palestinians and Israelis from either side, and few jews are interested in joining a state where they return to being a hated minority.  \\nThink about discussion in the US about immigration.  Imagine that all the stories about Venezuelans taking over apartment buildings and gangs sending their rapists over (the Trump quote, can't recall it exactly) were actually true.  Immigrants do want to come here and kill people.  The great replacement theory?  Fact.  A week ago a couple of Mexicans shot up a bus station and killed 10 people and Cuba has been launching 4 rockets a day at Florida for 10 years.  How would the US public react?That is essentially the reality Israelis (not just the jews) live in.  None of that is to say the response is justified or correct or anything along those lines, but recognize that the fear that leads to settlements is something addressable if neighboring countries would just stop trying to wipe them out and return to peace talks.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

I don't know if this sentiment is truly sincere or rather they hear that I don't hate Trump and refuse to agree with me on anything after that. Elon's drawing of how far the left has shifted since 2016 is pretty accurate, IMO. You seem to be pretty understanding and willing to discuss differences of opinion, so that is refreshing.In what specific ways do you believe the left has shifted? To me this is the stark opposite of what's been going on  especially in regards to party politics. Hell, Kamala Harris was literally just endorsed by Dick fucking Cheney who would have been considered an *arch* conservative just a few years ago. Mitt Romney was the Republican nominee for president in just 2012, and he's now considered a RINO.Yes, there is a big portion of the left well to *Kamala's* left (largely because, again, she has policies that are apparently palatable to the likes of Dick Cheney), but if those are the people you are referring to, then I'm curious what specific beliefs you think they have which have changed and why you disagree with them.I have empathy for most people that are struggling in life (always a few exceptions) but I also feel we really need more to enforce accountability again. Look at Chicago and New York. People are committing assault and being released with little to no bail.I would certainly agree that our criminal justice system needs reform, but the idea that crime is some sort of a major issue that's gotten particularly acute in recent years just isn't borne out by the actual statistics. Yes you can pick out individual areas that are problematic (people always pick Chicago because it's in a Blue state, but there are far more dangerous municipalities in red states like St. Louis or Memphis), but you are roundly safer in America today than you would have been at pretty much any earlier point in living memory. Hell, in regards to New York specifically, this is something I've seen with my own eyes. Ask pretty much anybody directly familiar with that city and they'll tell you they feel FAR safer walking down the streets today than even in the 90s or early 2000s.Also, Chicago has some of the strictest gun regulations in the country and has one of the highest gun violence rates. I also know that a lot of people say they just go to neighboring states and purchase them there. This really isn't accurate as they still perform the same required background checks. It wouldn't really be financially viable for someone to legally purchase firearms and then sell them on the black market, you'd lose money and likely be caught within a few months. I mean, it's pretty clear that if we wanted to go that route national gun restrictions *would* work. Numerous countries around the world have shown this to be the case. Like I said, though, I for one would rather address the issue at its root causes anyway. Medicare for All, universal pre-k, or national housing policy to build out large quantities of high quality, mixed income social housing would save far more lives than pretty much any gun control ordinance.In terms of immigration, I know that we'd take a significant economic hit if we start enforcing immigration laws but we have to rip the bandaid at some point if we want a legitimate immigration system. If the world knows we don't actually enforce immigration laws we will continue to see compounding rates of migrants and have to decide if/how we'd provide them with the same healthcare and financial protections guaranteed to legalized citizens. Our funding is already stretched as is. First off, undocumented immigrants are a net *contributor* to our tax base since tons of them end up paying payroll taxes they'll never benefit from and are already ineligible for most state and federal assistance. The Social Security admin even estimates that it takes in *billions of dollars* annually in such contributions  so the idea that they're somehow a drain on public coffers just isn't at all true.Secondly, we don't need to \\"rip off the bandaid\\". Amnesty programs have worked perfectly fine in the past (another area where conservatives have moved far to the right of their former positions as evidenced by support for such programs by the likes of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush). Give us that and a reasonable pathway to citizenship and we'd have a much more workable system that would free up ICE resources to go after people who are actually causing problems rather than the VAST majority of the undocumented immigrant population who are here to do honest work and by all accounts are hugely beneficial to our economy and statistically actually *less* likely to commit crimes than ordinary citizens. I brought up Ukraine mainly because of the amount of money we've provided for years now. I have mixed feelings about Ukraine, personally. Frankly, I suspect we've been stringing them along to try to bleed out Putin and Russia when we should have either stayed out or given them enough to hit back hard and fast enough to actually win. That said, it is pretty much a legitimate war of defense against a fascist piece of shit and I have trouble saying we should just remain neutral there.I don't disagree that we we should stay out of the Israel conflict, but we should have also responded with the same sentiment right after the attack. We were more than willing to assist Ukraine without hesitation, so where is the consistency?For one thing, the Biden administration at least absolutely *has* backed Israel from the moment of October 7, but for another, these things aren't really comparable. Israel was attacked by a group of people from within its own area of control living under extreme oppression and apartheid, not a far larger neighbor looking to expand.I have no issue providing funds to foreign nations but we don't have a limit, which is the issue. Why is it up to us to fund 80% of any NATO conflict and our allies cumulatively contribute the remaining 20%? NATO is actually one of the few areas I pretty neatly agree with Trump on. Europe can deal with Russian aggression perfectly well on its own.To summarize my beliefs, I strongly feel we need significant reform to our social programs to better assist those who are struggling but also realize we have to cut the finding from somewhere.Yeah not seeing how Trump or the conservative movement gets this for you. All I've seen from that cadre my whole life has been tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich while exploding the deficit along with repeated attempts to *undermine* social programs.Seriously, have you spent much time listening to anything Bernie Sanders has to say? If not, I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd agree with.

Ottoman corrupt bureaucrats, and their friends, used the law to claim land that they had no connection to.  Palestinians largely didn't jump through the hoops of the Ottoman land rules unless they bought or sold land.So, the Ottoman land rights records did not recognize the ownership of people who had lived on the same land for many generations.  The British inherited these property records, and didn't fix the problem.When Jews fled for their lives from Europe in the 1930's, they would buy land in the Palestinian mandate legally.  This sometimes meant purchasing from the descendants of the corrupt bureaucrats and their cronies, and evicting the people who had lived on land for generations.Jordan inherited these property records, and has taken steps to recognize the land ownership of the descendants of palestinian peasants.But, Israel is ruled by a majority who wants to favor newcomers over longtime residents.  So, there is a lot of incentive not to address this problem.This was a big political fight under the British in the 1930's.  And it continued to be a source of conflict in the 1940's.If you look at the 1940's, the interests of Palestinian peasants who had lived on the same land for hundreds of years and Zionists who wanted to welcome and find land for Jewish refugees from around the world were in conflict, in a way that isn't directly related to religion or religious animosity.The reason for the need of such a refuge for Jewish refugees was antisemitism.  But, worrying that the incoming government would cling to corrupt land records to favor newcomers and being antizionist over that wasn't inherently antisemitic.","title":"CMV: A vast portion of Arabs/Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza have no idea what Palestinian \\"statehood\\" is; for them \\"statehood\\" is merely the absence of Jews"},{"text":"I do not understand these people who say they dont support Donald Trump, because they know firsthand just how dangerous he is, but cannot bring themselves to do the one thing that will keep him out of the Oval Office.

The situation hasnt improved in the last 20 years. In Gaza, the inhabitants were prevented from fishing or traveling outside the tiny region.

Hamas has all the guns and controls the Gaza side of border as well as the smuggling tunnels while Israel and Egypt control their side of the Gaza borders these facts make a revolt even harder to pull off when revolts are already very difficult to successfully pull off.\\nGazans actually wanted the previous ceasefire hold(63%), wanted Hamas to pursue peace talks with Israel(50%), and support for Hamas has remained steady at 52% throughout the war.Support for Hamas itself remains steady from prior to October 7th 52% in Gaza and 64% in the West Bank, there was a 11% drop in the West Bank on whether or not Oct 7th was a good thing/support for it, Gazans support the idea of the PA under Abbas taking control of Gaza more than those in the West Bank, but both prefer Hamas and expect Hamas to keep control, Marwan Barghouti from Fatah has the most support for President of the Palestinian Authority with I won't vote being next followed by Ismael Haniyeh from Hamas, and Abbas is last and in single digits.I will make this prediction: If Hamas ends up being seen as the winner of the war it started on October 7, support for Hamas among Palestinians will only increase. But if Hamas is seen as losing the war  its military and governing capabilities shattered  support for Hamas among Palestinians will decrease, perhaps sharply. To be clear: If it turns out that Hamass invasion of Israel and multiple heinous atrocities have brought Palestinians nothing but hardship, that will not cause Palestinians to embrace Israelis. But it may cause Palestinians to reject Hamass strategy of terrorism and genocidal war. ?Cliff May, FDD Founder and President\\nhttps://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/03/22/poll-hamas-remains-popular-among-palestinians/Pre-war poll\\nhttps://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

If your home was built 1940-1960, there's a good chance it still has these pipes. The main issue here is they go out of round quite often and have root issues once in a while. Overall, they aren't the worst, but they are very difficult to repair and usually just get replaced when there's a major issue.Vitrified clay is slightly more modern, and is common in 1950-1980ish build home. It's not bad generally, but the joints between pipes have a habit of letting roots in that clog up the pipes. It can also shatter and completely collapse, or just crack/fracture. These are EXTREMELY common, and not TOO bad to repair. I'd say 50-75% of my work involves these, but there's a confirmation bias at play here in that we only get called out to problems.....and we get called out to these a lot. There's just a lot of them in the ground, and they are all 40+ years old.Next up is Abestos Cement. Has all the same issues as clay....but also Abestos....so yeah. Disposal sucks. These are a little more modern, probably 1965-1980? But there's a lot of overlap with clay installed in the same era.Lastly we have PvC plastic pipe. These are typically in 1980 or newer builds, and the issues with these are almost all \\"Someone installed them badly\\". Again, they aren't THAT old, so we aren't seeing a lot of issues with them aging out.

You can't really be a republic and an empire at the same time. You can be an empire that has republican (lowercase-r, yes) and democratic (lowercase-d, ditto) tea parties to placate the babies you're in charge of.POTUS is an imperial figurehead with tremendous power for as long as he's actively serving in that role, and so long as the military behind him continues to voluntarily exercise restraint. While SCOTUS' recent decision was wrong and terrible, it was a shitty handout to failed ex-Presidents; sitting Presidents didn't really need one. If a sitting POTUS decides to speed-run the end of human civilization as we know it, either the military stops him or it happens. If POTUS commits a bunch of crimes while in office, either Congress or the military removes him or it's whatever... and if the military doesn't step in, those crimes could include taking out Congress and the judiciary, which would obviate the worry of ever becoming an *ex*-President.When you reframe the issue that way, you basically lose 50% of the population that was nodding along with you when you were somewhat-disingenuously talking about how \\"the President is not above the law!\\" Suddenly that imperial-civilian intuition kicks in. *Oh, right, right... imperialism is why we're so privileged.

Particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, it isnt based in any reality of historical relationships between Muslims and Jews in Muslim dominated societies in the region, given that Jews were almost always important members of Arab societies. If whatever state is created is actually equitable and does not crest separate justice and living systems based on religion,race, or ethnicity, there isnt going to be religious retribution on any societal scale. What OP is saying is that there are essentially two real solutions here: 1) a single state that treats peoples of all races, religions, and ethnicities equally as participating citizens or 2) a state built on the supremacy of one religion (right now that being Judaism given Israels leadership) which will necessitate the extermination of members of other religions as long as they refuse to be subservient. I think OP has not done enough to clarify the complex ethnic as well as religious differences between Arabs, specifically Palestinian Arabs, Arab Jews, European Jews, etc etc, but I think that is the core of their argument, and I tend to agree. The vast majority of pro-Palestine protestors advocate for equality, not extermination of Jews in favor of Muslims as the media generally portrays the debate.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

But you are correct about the settlements making a two-state solution less and less feasible, which of course is their goal.  Israel won't accept a one-state solution either, they could have already done it, but that will water down their \\"ethno-state\\" as you say, and they have no will do that.For any two-state solution Israel would have to abandon the settlers, maybe with some \\"guarantees\\" of their treatment. The settlers themselves will not accept it and no one can guarantee their reaction, so it is inevitable that someone is going to get hurt or killed, which could and probably would derail the entire process. This is by design.  Any two-state solution would have to be prepared to literally abandon the settlers, and Israel shows no signs it is.This is all speculation on my part, I have no first-hand knowledge and I'm not particularly well informed. But just as a thought experiment of two people groups who hate each other living in the same general area, there has to be separation, a type of separate but equal situation, which is impossible if one side controls the other, the only way to be \\"equal\\" is to be totally independent from the other, and even then, one state will undoubtedly do better than the other making them be or seem to be unequal. There is no way a Palestinian state would have the same level of investment as Israel does, so any 2 states solution is going to take a while to work out, but I think that is the only long term solution possible.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

The Israeli government isn't going to allow the dislocation of these settlers and turn them into refugees, and any theoretical Palestinian government will not continue to allow them to stay.A valid point, which raises the issue over why a Palestinian government won't allow a Jewish minority to remain. That said, you seem to be speaking under the assumption that a Palestinian state can only exist upon 100% of the territory beyond the 1949 armistice line, which may be limiting your ability to envision other possibilities. I think Israel recognizes this, which is why it appears they're culling and dislocating as many Palestinians as they can and trying to get them all to move into Egypt so that when they annex Gaza; whoever is left will be a small and manageable minority.Israel has zero interest in annexing Gaza. They pulled out the entirety of the Jewish population almost 2 decades ago, for better out worse, and are in no hurry to deal with the people still there if they can avoid it. They'd gladly let it become part of Egypt if Egypt were willing to take it, which they aren't.But no one is being dislocated to Egypt. Egypt has actually sealed their border and made it harder to cross. Frankly it seems rather jarring how you moved to the topic of Gaza when it is in no way connected to your previous position. Yet somehow Israel's actions in Gaza are motivated by issues that have nothing to do with Gaza? I'm not following your logic here.What's happening in Gaza is entirely disconnected from the issue of a two state solution being complicated by settlements and Jerusalem. One has nothing to do with the other. Gaza could become its own separate state and the issues in your opening paragraph wouldn't be impacted in the slightest. What I see as the most feasible long term solution at present is that Gaza be placed under international management that aims to transition it towards statehood of its own. Within the rest of the disputed territory, I think a Palestinian Arab self governance with no full statehood is the only remaining option.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Lots of us were sounding the alarm when they were wargaming event 201 before covid was released, and continue to warn about agenda 2030. They even demolished the Georgia guidestones last year because too many people noticed.By having complete control of the world's media, they can cover up anything they want and have no fear that the majority of the population are too propagandized to notice what they are doing. This is why they are trying to go after the 1st amendment and suddenly repeal section 230 after spending years controlling all of big tech. Hillary Clinton even said the quiet part out loud the other day when she said they will \\"lose total control\\" if they don't clamp down on social media (namely twitter and rumble).

I think it's really hard to justify terminating a life if it could have been prevented. I've never been in that situation but again, it's hard for me to justify terminating a late term pregnancy. And I'm not sure I follow your point regarding conservatives not supporting a nuclear family. Conservatives encourage getting married and having families. This would cut down on the need for abortion if mothers know they have financial and emotional support from a spouse/partner.
