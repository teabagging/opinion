Shes worried that with the restriction republicans state they want to put on birth control measures, that she wont be able to change it in 2028, so shes going in soon to get it replaced now. So back itll be good until past 2030 (when hopefully reproductive rights arent being attacked). Another example for her is, she works for a major health research center at a university. They mostly work to bring free healthcare to uninsured people with limited access across our state (via mobile health clinics). Their funding is largely based on grants from major health institutions (CDC, NIH, other universities, etc). With some of the proposed cuts republicans want to make healthcare funding, theres a very really chance that her center will cease to exist, meaning dozens of people will be out of a job and the thousands of people they are able to help per year for free are worse off as well. Not to mention, they have published multiple papers about the success of their mobile health clinics, which other health centers are starting to adopt. Without the roadmap their success provides as well as the funding for it, we are looking at potentially tens of thousands of people who should be getting help, not getting that help anymore.","title":"Can anyone explain to me how any American citizen's rights are actually in reality in any way different based on the election results?"},{"text":"The lack of self-awareness is astounding.","title":"Congress could try barring Trump from office under 14th Amendment, but it likely wont"},{"text":"I think a lot of subs are just copy pasting the anti Trump people ban info","title":"wtf kinda horseshit is this?"},{"text":"The market thinks they are going to get the deregulation and someone will talk Trump out of the tariffs.

It is certainly not the common person.\\nWe ALL benefit when leaders of countries and nations have civil, non-adversarial relationships and discourse. We should be in competition with other countries and nations, not on enemy status.\\nBut..but..he sent him covid testing equipment..what a *traitor!* In reality, even a small gesture of friendship like this, at that particular time was more effective than a thousand diplomats.\\nEvery government in the WORLD began shoring up for the potentiality of WWIII by March of 2020. This included everything from new security agreements between countries, war and air ship sales, weapons and ammunition sales, food and goods stockpiling, etc. That they navigated through that first year without the public at large recognizing how fearful every government was and how tenuous security was, is a miracle.\\nIn large part, this is exactly WHY all talk of the origin of the virus was tamped down at the national security level. Wisely, they chose not to assign blame so that they could maintain a level of non-confrontation, globally.\\nThe world is still extremely tense. Conflicts will still break out, as they always do. Exacerbating all of this, is the arms and space (AND space arms, lol) race that all of the major powers are presently engaged in.\\nIs WWIII off the table? Only God knows.

That being said, Im a lifelong democrat, and I dont give two shits where you come from as long as youre a decent human being. But this is my quick psychological evaluation about Trump supporting Mexican Americans with a similar background as me. I have many aunts, uncles, etc who support Trump so I have to hear about this shit over and over.So many people do not take the Gadsden Purchase/Treaty of Hidalgo into account. After those were said and done, the border now crossed into what was Mexico. People in that area automatically were granted citizenship (someone correct me if Im wrong). They didnt cross the border, the border crossed them. Going down the road 3, 4, 5 generations later, many Mexican Americans no longer have immediate ties to Mexico and consider themselves your average American more than anything. When they see a Mexican migrant, they dont see themselves at all and dont relate to them. They (generational Mexican Americans) look down on illegal immigrants especially because their own ancestry can be traced back multiple generations to what used to be Mexico. Again, in their head, theyre thinking, We didnt cross the border, the border crossed us. WE were here first.

I said some women were keen on using the movement to punish men.  How is any of that evidence that the movement is working?  This is the second day the movement is even being discussed.  There is no evidence yet of implementation in the US on any scale, nor its effects.  You appear to think left-leaning men would not be punished, while women are discussing abstaining altogether.  This does not jive, and further points to the lack of unity in the movement itself.2) I doubt I need to address the weakness of anecdotes in an argument.  It is interesting you think liberal parents wouldn't create more liberal children on average.3) Fair enough.  We'll just have to see how long that lasts then.  But once again, men will just find women elsewhere.  It's not difficult for Americans.

He said that officials in Washington, D.C., would be reaching out to The Daily Wire.After publication of this story, a FEMA spokesperson told The Daily Wire it was deeply disturbed and horrified by the employees actions, and that it has taken extreme actions to correct this situation.While we believe this is an isolated incident, we have taken measures to remove the employee from their role and are investigating the matter to prevent this from happening ever again, the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The employee who issued this guidance had no authority and was given no direction to tell teams to avoid these homes and we are reaching out to the people who may have not been reached as a result of this incident.This is a matter that we take extremely seriously and we are doing everything we can to make sure all survivors receive support from FEMA. To date, we have helped over 365,000 households impacted by both Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the state of Florida and have provided over $898 million in direct assistance to survivors.We are horrified that this took place and therefore have taken extreme actions to correct this situation and have ensured that the matter was addressed at all levels.

But the median member of the working class views \\"class\\", at a subconscious level, as a matter of taste and behavior, of \\" virtue signaling\\" if you will. So when they imagine the rich people who exploit them, they invariably imagine them as possessing elite tastes, and to be fair, most of those rich people do indeed have elite tastes ! But what this MEANS is that when they see a rich person displaying VULGAR tastes,( i. E Donald Trump) that person BECOMES ABSOLVED from belonging in the oppressive capitalist class. They see someone like Trump and they say \\" oh he is not like the other rich people. He is not using the money that was extracted from my labor to  put his name on art museum buildings. He  behaves like  I behave.\\"The evidence that Donald Trump does not oppress them is HE BROADCASTS THAT HE SHARES THE SAME TASTES AS THEM.Also remember that in our country, EVERYONE WANTS TO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE. That is in fact, the ultimate dream for the overwhelming majority of Americans. Thus they do not see GREAT WEALTH AS INHERENTLY BAD. Don't get me wrong, they all agree that they are being exploited by rich people, but it cannot be that the exploitation is inexorably linked to THE PROCESS BY WHICH THEY BECAME RICH because all these people also want to become rich, and very few of them, in this fantasy, see themselves as having to oppress people to get there. Therefore, they conclude, there must be something else that is LINKED to being Rich, but IS NOT \\" BEING RICH\\" ITSELF that causes the rich people that exploit them to, well, exploit them.The genius move here the GOP has made is to make \\" non vulgarity\\" into the marker of the exploiting capitalist class. If a rich person is VULGAR in their behavior and affect, then they are immeadiately ABSOLVED from membership in the exploiting capitalist class. Whereas an economically middle or even working class person who has educated affectations and beliefs ( for example anti-racism) becomes suspect as perhaps being an agent of the exploiter.How do we solve this? Only way I can think of is to make non vulgarity near universal, which would mean sending the overwhelming majority of americans through university at no cost to them. Something that is clearly politically impossible in the foreseeable future.?Or, and this is probably the key, finding a way to? vulgarly express ?concepts such as?  dont be racist and  women are not destined to be your property that right wing propaganda has successfully ?coded as beliefs held only by the capitalists that exploit you.","title":"I dont understand how Republicans became the party for the working class"},{"text":"A superteam","title":"Team Trump Gets Ready To Take Over"},{"text":"0-65.. thats an impressive record to have for election fraud cases.

See the children of these people went to college, and their children went to college at a higher level still etc. So while economic mobility has gone nowhere in this country over the last 50 years, the number of people obtaining higher education has gone up.What does this do? well in many cases it strips you of your vulgar tastes.Moreover the economic stagnation of the last 50 years meant that many of these highly educated people did not see any increases in their standard of living. However the non educated saw their standard of living , and in many cases their lifespans, plummet.So we are now in a point in  time where the struggle, as seen by the median american is NOT between the rich and the poor, but between the VULGAR AND THE NON VULGAR.The vulgar resent the non vulgar, and they view being not vulgar as the mark of the elite. Essentially the elitist view that the tastes of the masses were to be exterminated has been turned on its head. Now it is the tastes of the educated that are viewed as the enemy of the \\" real american,\\" so anything that smacks of non vulgarity ( for example, not being racist) is coded as elite behavior.THIS IS WHY DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT CODE AS ELITE to these people. Because he is an extravagantly VULGAR human. And THAT is the marker that matters in America today. When you hear him described as a \\" working class billionaire\\" this is what is meant. He signals he has vulgar tastes, not elite tastes. Thus he represents the \\" common man\\" in the classic literal sense, in a world where common and elite are based not on wealth but on behavior and taste. An adjunct college professor stitching together jobs at three college campuses to make 50k a year is working class economically, but she is INFINITELY MORE ELITE than Donald Trump, and Conversely, Donald Trump is INFINITELY MORE WORKING CLASS than her, using the definitions of those terms that actually exist within the mind of the median american voter.That is it, That is the root of it.

The VULGAR class.Don't downvote. let me explain.The term vulgar literally originally meant \\" of and or relating to the common people\\" ( common people being called Vulgus in latin.) see also the term \\" plebeian\\".This set up a dichotomy, one set up by the elite in Roman Times , in which the tastes of the common person was viewed as crass and wrong. Because of this, one's mannerisms and modes of behaving became class markers, and so they remained until extremely recent times ( and by recent I mean the change STARTED in the 1960's)The key difference here, is that, before about 1960, it was commonly understood that the working, vulgar, class would aspire to imitate their \\" betters\\". Thus the media would for example, often broadcast opera and symphony orchestral music over the radio, not because this was popular but precisely because it was NOT popular. It was to show the vulgar masses what they should aspire to become etc. It was a paternalistic and elitist world view, and one that had existed for millennia. As you moved up in life, your tastes had to change. This was a truth universally understood.What changed? Mass Media, and World war 2. In the 1950's thanks to strong unions, the fact that the United States was the largest industrial area in the world that had not been turned into rubble during the war, and in the case of white people, massive housing subsidies leading to the american suburbs, much of the \\" vulgar\\" class was economically elevated into the middle class.Again this happened over a period of maybe 15 years. So their tastes did not change because that would take a lot longer . All of a sudden you had a bunch of people with vulgar tastes but middle class purchasing power. Then in the 1970's the economy stagnated. No new members of the vulgar class were being elevated into the middle class, and they haven't really been at any point since then. Gradually, many of those who had been elevated into the middle class slipped back into poverty, a process that continues to this day.","title":"I dont understand how Republicans became the party for the working class"},{"text":"Soon to be a Hallmark Special Feature.","title":"Trump-Musk bromance is a love that cant last"},{"text":"The problem is that I don't think Trump supporters truly believe that the people here seeking asylum are here legally.

Later that night, my best friends of 5 years sat me down to tell me I had white privilege and I need to acknowledge I dont have to struggle etc blahblahblah. Even though they know my family had less money than theirs, I had plenty of friends in other races and they were my friends because they knew I was a kind empathetic guy. Yet they insisted I was racist for not acknowledging my white privilege, on top of that they explained the patriarchy and how white men are keeping everyone else poor yadayadayada.

I was much more curious than upset because I love dystopian sci fi books and movies and we had JUST read 1984 by George Orwell in class TOGETHER.

First you convince people they are broken. Then you offer them a cure, but not a permanent one. You have to string them along for life. Then you do this tens of millions of times and make a profit. You use that money to buy politicians. When the fabricated crisis is big enough the government steps in and takes over the healthcare system in order to care for the citizens. Along side of this you take away their ability to fight back or challenge you. You take away their ability to revolt. Any of this sound familiar? This is the step we are stuck at now. One group trying to break the system another trying to reform or save it. All while telling you that guns are bad and preaching against violence while they themselves increase the vitriolic rhetoric to incite violence against anyone or everyone. Going forward: The government uses increased tax dollars (raised from anyone who refuses to be broken and still works) to pay an increased cost for the cure for all of the broken people. Government lackies skim off the top to keep contracts going and raise taxes all under the mantra of the common good.  They do whatever it takes to stay in control lest someone new try and change things. Eventually you have 3 classes of people. The dependent class, the decreasing working class and the government. But now that the government controls who is deemed worthy and who isnt, your access to any cures, they can decide who gets them and who doesnt. You dont have the means of fighting back. If you dont stay in line you can just be cut off and die. Eventually, regardless of whether you stay in line or not, they start cutting you off under the guise of saving society and the planet. Reduce the population. Only the chosen survive and continue to perpetuate the system while those at the top reap all of the benefits, you are simply allowed to live as long as the bureaucracy decides it benefits them.

I used to work at one of Turkeys top dailies,?*Sabah,*?when it was taken over by the government in 2007, marking the beginning of a decadelong struggle for Erdogan to take control of the media landscape in the country. But it wasnt easy. To silence?*Sabah*?and other newspapers, Erdogan had to use the tax authority, the courts, call for public boycott of newspapers and threaten individual journalists publicly  eventually forcing media owners to sell off. After?*Sabah*, the Turkish government focused on other distressed media holdings, provided the financial support for cronies to buy them, and over the years passed anti-terrorism legislation to stifle free speech. In 2017, Erdogan finally held a referendum on expanding his presidential powers and consolidated power.Even in an imperfect democracy like Turkey, it took a full decade from 2007 to 2017 for Erdogan to gain full compliance and transfer media ownership to his cronies. Similarly in Poland, the recently ousted Law and Justice Party tried to reshape the media landscape after they took power in 2015 by turning state broadcasters into partisan hacks  but made only incremental progress during their eight years in power. That kind of takeover is doable in the U.S. too, but it would take longer than four years.Another major hurdle that will slow down Trumps path toward dictatorship is the emergence of cities as liberal strongholds, with younger Democratic governors and mayors as opposition leaders. Democracies that have experienced an illiberal transformation have all seen big cities emerge as strongholds for dissent and liberal values, with charismatic mayors often becoming the public face of opposition. Ti have concerns.  principally, i would be more comfortable if he had also looked at how putin suppressed all dissent in russia after invading ukraine.   and china during their most recent post-pandemic lockdown protests.  i assume erdogan and hungary did not have the support of techbros the way that trump has.","title":"Trump Cant Be Dictator on Day One  Or in a Second Term.

As someone who nearly fell into misandry, I DO think there was a mishandling of the rage from the victims of men that turned pretty hateful, especially given how men are so deeply isolated by the world despite privilege. There are RIGHTFULLY people upset and disappointed and angry at men. But the response to the not all men movement was not handled with care. It also translated into a lot of sexist excuses and transphobia towards trans men. It is often SO LONELY being a man. You do not have the emotional equipment to handle other peoples aggression, nor are you given the tools to process how your actions can hurt others, and the expectation for you to have your shit together is very, very high while simultaneously the bar is on the floor. On top of this, there are abusers who are 100% trying to take advantage of your isolation for their own political gains. Thats exactly what is happening to Gen Z right now. A lot of people processed the trauma caused by men while giving that trauma back, and now there are simply a lot of men finding their only community spaces are online games, manosphere podcasts, andrew tate, and nothing else. That is of course, you are one of the lucky ones, and do have good examples of masculinity and manhood and how to even have femininity or whatever else you wanna engage in. It all comes down to community.

It is difficult to grow up as a teen boy when all you hear is that men are the problem and men need to stand aside and the Dems dont think men need to have a seat at the table.  Whether its true or not, this is what they hear.  We as a society failed these boys because we werent able to protect them from toxic messaging.  It turns out they needed guidance on masculinity and a seat at the table and it seems America didnt provide it for them.  There are so many mixed messages like they have to be sensitive and vulnerable, but also, its a turn off.  And women should totally make more money than the man, but also women dont date down, so if you dont make a lot of money, you have no value as a mate.  We need DEI so white males are now second class citizens because of past infractions from their ancestors so they get passed up for hiring and promotions in favor of DEI candidates.  So they grow up with this and hear this day in and day out in high school, college, and TikTok and as things get outrageously expensive and they dont get a single call back from any of the fucking ghost jobs listed on LinkedIn, what hopes do they have?  No wonder they jumped over to Trump.  Tate and Petersen are con-men who played on this confusion.  They gave them guidance and something to aspire to, outside of this environment that made them feel bad.  This is why gangs were popular in the 70s, 80s, and 90s when black dads were getting thrown in jail and their kids didnt have a role model at home.  Gangs filled that void and gave them a sense of belonging.  This is the same shit.  You abandon the kids, they will find someone to guide them, and its not always the right person.  The best thing that could have kept them, even if they were gulping down Tate content, is put more money in their pocket.  As dumb as it is, that transcends the bullshit.  Give them universal healthcare.  Fix costs of staples.  Give them scholarships.  Make them feel equally appreciated and give them the opportunities to succeed, or at least make them feel like they have them.","title":"Opinion: Turns out Gen Z wasn't completely sold on Harris.

This is really not a lot. The US economy grew 2.3% in 2017, **so 1 year of decent growth could pay for sending the US economy into complete autarky, in perpetuity**! \\n Did they get something wrong in their calculations? *One can argue with many of the details, but the order of magnitude has to be right*. **Simply put, despite its openness to trade, the US import share (8%) is one of the lowest in the world. So the gains from international trade to the United States cannot be that large**.  Belgium, a small open economy, has an import share of above 30%, so there trade matters much more. This is not so surprising. The US economy is very large and very diverse, and therefore capable of producing much of what is consumed there. \\n Moreover, a lot of consumption is of services (everything from banking to house cleaning) not typically traded internationally (yet).\\nEven the consumption of manufactured goods involves a significant share of locally produced services. When we buy an iPhone assembled in China, we also pay for US design and local advertising and marketing. The phone is sold in shiny Apple stores built by local firms and manned by local tech lovers.\\n We should not be carried away by the US example, however. Large economies like the United States and China have the skills and the capital to produce most things at a very high level of efficiency somewhere in the country. Moreover, their internal markets are large enough to absorb production from many factories in many sectors operating at the appropriate scale. They would lose relatively little by not trading.\\n **International trade is much more important for smaller and poorer countries, like those in Africa, Southeast Asia, or south eastern Europe**. Skills there are scarce and so is capital, and the domestic demand for steel or cars is unlikely to be big enough, given that incomes are low and populations are small, to sustain production at scale.

I continue to be curious about that fact that people don't seem to understand one can provide a take without being emotionally invested. Even so, people can feel \\"triggered\\" by misinformation or manipulative tactics, none of which make those arguments valid. Your second point that sperm can be donated is unrealistic to a large portion of the population. Reproduction through IVF and sperm donation often requires substantial financial resources and support systems, which are not accessible to many women.The point was to show that TECHNICALLY women don't necessarily need to have romantic or sexual relationships with a man even if they want to have children.An ad hominem fallacy involves an attack on one's character. I didn't attack your character, I merely pointed out your unjustified outrage as evidence that the movement is working on you. 1) In the context of left-leaning women using 4B as punishment for people that voted Trump into office, this is counterproductive. 42% of men voted for Kamala. So already a punishment would be applied to 42% of men that are on the women's side. It is more than likely the case that a left-leaning women will be with a left-leaning man, further compounding left-leaning men being punished.I love how you keep framing this as a 'punishment', as if men are entitled to have sexual and romantic relationships with women. Again, this is just more evidence that the movement is working and necessary. You would be surprised how many left-leaning women will happily fall for a conservative man, especially men who are good at hiding their political beliefs early on. Furthermore, left-leaning men aren't really punished because many of them like myself support 4B and it's not like left-leaning women who are already settled in long term relationships with left leaning men who support them are suddenly going to ditch them. 2) If left-leaning women are the ones abstaining from sex, then their birth rates will fall even shorter compared to right-leaning women. Thus, creating a future of children more likely to be right-leaning.From my own experience, I would argue that conservative parents tend to create more liberal children. 3) Abstaining from sex until marriage is exactly what hardcore conservatives advocate for. So they would be playing right into the Republican playbook.Do you even know what the 4 B's or \\"4 no's\\" are?? One of them is no marriage, so this isn't really a valid point because there is no \\"until marriage\\" anywhere. It's meant to last until there is more gender equality and certain specific social issues are addressed. 4) Left-leaning men, in some proportion, will be pushed away by left-leaning men. Thus, leading to looking for right-leaning women, who could sway the man's ideals. On top of that, more people such as myself, will look outside of the US for a less-hostile life partner. Thus leaving the movement hardly effective.\\"In some proportion\\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. As a left-leaning man myself I fully support 4B. 5) There are already women debating with each other vehemently all over Reddits, even on left-leaning subs. Many support other women doing this, but are asking that women not hold them to the same standard. The momentum and unification simply is not there.Ultimately if a woman chooses not to participate in this, that is completely fine. What is not fine is getting angry at those who do and accusing them of \\"punishing\\" you for choosing to opt out of some social norms. Even if only a small fraction of women participate in this, as there currently is, it is still provoking a strong reaction from men like you who feel threatened, which proves that it is working and necessary.","title":"4B Movement Surges in U.S. Interest After Trump Wins Election"},{"text":"\\"Assistant Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life\\"   \\n  \\n  \\nThey should abolish his job.

I was talking to a Trump supporter on Facebook about tariffs today. He doesn't even know my political leanings. I told him Trump raised the tariffs in 2018 and the businesses passed it on to the consumer. I said you can easily look up this information. They said no, he did it to bring jobs back here instead of China, etc. Then he said everything on Google is fake. He kept sending me anti-Kamala videos he got from Facebook that came from a weird account on Instagram that had nothing on it but these short anti-Kamala videos. I saw an account on here with 100s of similar posts about how Kamala was going to bomb Pakistan. I am pretty sure both of these were Russian troll accounts.   A lot of Republicans are constantly being fed biased, false information and don't question it. I think some other reasons are fear, ignorance, racism, religious beliefs, and sexism. They think migrants are being given all these free things and committing crimes. The Bible tells them abortion is wrong and they either aren't hearing about the deaths from forced births, don't care about it, or think it is fake news. I have heard people say a woman is too emotional to be president and isn't strong enough. There are a lot of sexist memes going around about Kamala. Some falsely believe things were better under Trump because of something he did. The economy actually got better since Biden was in office and we were in a recession under Trump. Prices have still been high under Biden so they think it will get better with someone else as President.  Some people think the party has focused too much on the woke stuff instead of the economy, jobs, wages, and healthcare. This one I agree with. I still voted for Harris but don't think she would have made a lot of changes. I consider myself an Independent but my beliefs lean left. In my state, a lot of people switched from Democrat to Independent this election. I still voted for Harris but I know what was on the line and quite a bit about politics. There are a lot of people out there who don't pay attention to current events and politics and who don't care about these issues. I think we are currently living in an Oligarchy where the Democrats work for the wealthy much more than they do for us but are the lesser evil. The gap between parties has been shrinking for some time and it is like voting for the right or voting for the center/right. Some people look at the party and they see that they work for corporate interests and at the same time only care about social issues. We need a new party if the Democrats aren't willing to nominate someone like Bernie Sanders who will work for us instead of the wealthy and wants to fix the things all of us care about.  I know someone who liked Bernie but voted for Trump because they didn't like Hillary. My father who is Republican seems to like him quite a bit too. Maybe a part of that is because he isn't being fed a bunch of misinformation about him though.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

Let me break it down. Humans are a concept called fallible. It means we can be wrong about things. Honestly outside of STEM fields most things are. We are no exception.Humans enjoy following trends. I dont think I have to establish that. It just is human nature. We base a lot of our societal cultural on these trends.Humans prefer the path of least resistance in most scenarios. This isnt a shortcoming of humans. We are persistence predators. Part of that is the conversation of energy between meals, as most predators and omnivores do. Humans prefer to be safe and comfortable. Again this isnt a shortcoming of humans. This is part of how our body maintains whats known as homeostasis. Which is our bodies desire to be in a certain comfort zone that is optimal for biological function. This same function drives you to seek warmth if youre cold, or food if youre hungry. All of these factors combined form a collective society that still functions on these principles. We are currently in difficult times. No one can doubt that. It is human nature to seek an immediate solution to their issues (path of least resistance, homeostasis) that is appealing (following trends) and commit to that (ignore fallibility to stay committed to their choice. See sunken cost fallacy) This leads to popular decisions that ultimately produce the opposite result because they were chosen on impulse. Unfortunately democracy is still the best system. Because it distributes the risk of a single point being wrong in the decision making process. But it, as a human structure is also fallible. So its not a perfect system. This is why we need checks and balances. Which have been removed. Which means unfortunately the popular decision may be the equivalent of your drunken friend saying check out this awesome idea to get us rich and ending up blowing up the house. It doesnt mean democracy is wrong. It just failed because the mass populace decided to try to make a decision on a field they were wildly uneducated in, and one out of their control. So again.

In the age of the internet, where you yourself can witness videos of history first hand. People didnt bother to google the videos with unbelievable Trump quotes. Those who did, half didnt believe their eyes. I have a veryindoctrinated family member. In 2020 she was whining about the very fine people hoax and how she couldnt believe Id support someone who called nazis very fine people. So I stopped her, asked if she saw the video. She said yes. So I pulled up the transcript on my phone and asked her to find me where he said that. She couldnt find it. Rather than realizing she was believing liesshe decided that source wasnt real and she knew exactly what she heard. No self reflection, no realization, nothing. Thats the moment I realized, some people just want to believe lies and others dont.  I think what happened was, the DNC adopted Karl Rove tactics and no one noticed.  I started to question and point these things out to the people around me and what I got in return was vicious attacks, name calling, and a refusal to look at the evidence. \\n^^^^ yep. To finish the story she continued attacking me for daring to support Trump. Even though her own eyes just proved Trump never called nazis very fine people. She also claimed Trump never condemned white supremacyyet in that same speech Trump condemned white supremacy. Cant make it up.

As others have stated, Covid lockdowns and restrictions meant a lot of people were at home doing nish, so voting by mail was a great option. Gave them a chance to get out and do something. This year people are busy dont have time or cant be bothered. People also didnt like trumps mishandling of covid so they probably voted against him.Arguably the lower iq of the population vote for trump (Im not saying thats all that votes for him but I mean the out in the sticks hills have eyes never seen a school type) and when hes gearing them up for 4 years that the dems are 100% going to cheat unless they vote otherwise they will be performing sex change operations on their children these people will queue and wait and if theres a bomb threat they will return later or go to another place because they have to vote.

Boxer"},{"text":"Project 2025, Trump's tariffs, deporting millions from the labor force, and all the other idiotic policies are going to slap the low-information voters that allowed us to get here in the face and get them to finally pay attention.This election was won on too many voters thinking the economy is bad but was better under Trump and that grocery prices are too high. It was won by too many people thinking Project 2025 was fear mongering and not a real threat. They are not going to take the resulting price hikes of suddenly cutting out everything that makes our prices as cheap as they are lightly.Nor are they going to respond well to Project 2025 mandates restricting their freedoms. We have to realize this was a very close election when we look at the projected vote totals (votes are still being counted), it only seems much worse because of the EC making specific states more important than others. We may be looking at a 1-2 million difference. This is still a contested country with millions of voters that barely pay attention to politics until election time comes, and who vote party line because they always have. This stuff is scary, but we also need to be realistic. Trump voters are not all the crazed MAGA people we see at rallies. Some of them just vote for the not-Democrat. Many of them just voted based on groceries being more expensive than during Trump. These people are still reachable.We need to look at the polls and focus groups and keep a clear head with this. American voters have been woefully uninformed for every election until now, that is nothing new. Those undecideds and those that thought Project 2025 was just fear mongering are going to get a cold, hard smack of reality real soon.Contraception, pornography, department of education, NOAA, and shit ton of other things they didn't realize were on the ballot being banned or disappearing because of the government? That's not going to go over well. It shouldn't have come this far, but Americans historically are not nearly as politically engaged as any of us spending our time talking about politics on reddit are. Conservative Evangelicals who would support this stuff are very loud but they are not the majority. We're going to see the clash of those who pound their chest about American freedom and those who want to enforce a specific life style.It seems like they overlap a lot, and as a rural midwesterner there is a lot of overlap, but they are also going to be at odds like never before. I'm positive my neighbor voted for Trump. I also know he and his wife like their porn (don't ask). I HIGHLY doubt they knew what they just voted for.We also have tons of polling data on specific issues. Project 2025 mandates are wildly unpopular among voters regardless of party. Issues like abortion access are favored by the majority nationally. Multiple Trump-won states voted in favor of abortion access in this election. They're not going to take it well if Trump's administration overrules their state's rights to enforce a total ban.Maybe I'm just coping hard, but everything I have heard and seen makes me firmly believe Americans did not realize what was on the table and MAGA Republicans think they have won an ideological battle in this country that many of their voters are not going to take well. We cannot underestimate the power of our two party system and voters that are checked out until election season where they vote party line because they always have. All this is to say, yes they are going to make it much more difficult. But the policies they think they have support for now, when in reality it is just support for the Trump brand, are going to piss a shit load of people off by taking away freedoms they took for granted and low prices by means of cheap labor and imports that they took for granted. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic here, but I think the resulting backlash from what this government is planning to do is going to be far too strong to suppress.To think of it in much more imaginative terms... Republicans only care about things when it affects them. This is about to affect all of them regardless of if they are MAGA church goers or not.It's going to be rough, it's going to suck. But we need to keep our heads up because we have the opportunity to turn this around once this stuff is put into action and non-MAGA Trump supporters are forced to look at the results of their vote in the face.","title":"Guys remember what Biden said setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable"},{"text":"\\"No, you are!\\" Typical Trumplet response.","title":"Not Christian but hear me out - why does no Trumper think Trump is the Antichrist?"},{"text":"That is too long term thinking.

I mentioned an article I read about whether the Democrats should have a policy platform for guys. Dems campaign on abortion rights, gender equality, stopping racial discrimination, making sure underrepresented folks have a fair shots, etc. But the article talked about having a policy platform that you could pitch to any young guy. My first thought was I was unsure how big the young men shift to Trump would be. Young men dont vote that much, is this just preemptively blaming minorities and women for the loss?But I thought they could be onto something. I shared this with a more progressive person, and she thought it was crazy. That voting to protect women and people of color should be good enough. She explained that it felt like she was back in 2010 explaining to the boys in her high school friend group why feminism helped society. Fast forward 14 years, she felt like she would be doing the same thing all over again.  So its tricky. But at the end of the day, and seeing how the election went, I do think Democrats should simplify. We should have a shorter message that resonates with everyone. And every self-serving voter (which is everyone, and thats not evil) should feel theyre benefitting from our platform. Telling people to vote to save democracy or do it for women or well you see how Trump treats minorities  that is not a positive message. It is true, but thats inherently a negative campaign against the other guy. We should start by running a positive campaign with simple short wins for everyone. Then maybe we could actually win the White House again :(","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

If you think not being able to get laid impacts a males health, I need to inform you that that is utter lunacy. Women sure seem to do just fine with their vibratorsu/flown_south Do you think lots of young women felt lonely and depressed back when they had to stay home and pump out babies and do all the housework and couldnt open their own bank account and couldnt easily get divorced? Huh? Or are you only going to pretend you have empathy when it has to do with men? White men go through a tough time for once and instead of seeing that they brought it on themselves you resort to such whiny dramatics. Public health crisis my fucking ass. Men can be friends with each other all they want, IT IS NOT WOMENS JOB TO CATER TO MEN AND BEFRIEND THEM AND FUCK THEM AND DATE THEM.

Even in my left-leaning IRL friend groups (and I live in Seattle, one of the few places that DIDN'T have any measurable lurch right this cycle), the worst examples of it lead to eyerolls and derision. Let trans identity in movie and video game characters go back to being a thing that gets debated in Tumblr posts for a bit. Quite frankly, Hollywood's attempts to normalize trans rights and identity are turning into a \\"you fed the trolls\\" moment, where every trans character they add to a game, just turns into extra rage bait for the right-wing media machine.

Reproduction through IVF and sperm donation often requires substantial financial resources and support systems, which are not accessible to many women.The rest of your argument can be addressed by my \\"myriad of reasons\\":1) In the context of left-leaning women using 4B as punishment for people that voted Trump into office, this is counterproductive.  42% of men voted for Kamala.  So already a punishment would be applied to 42% of men that are on the women's side.  It is more than likely the case that a left-leaning women will be with a left-leaning man, further compounding left-leaning men being punished.2) If left-leaning women are the ones abstaining from sex, then their birth rates will fall even shorter compared to right-leaning women.  Thus, creating a future of children more likely to be right-leaning.3) Abstaining from sex until marriage is exactly what hardcore conservatives advocate for.  So they would be playing right into the Republican playbook.4) Left-leaning men, in some proportion, will be pushed away by left-leaning men.  Thus, leading to looking for right-leaning women, who could sway the man's ideals.  On top of that, more people such as I have, will look outside of the US for a less-hostile life partner.  Thus leaving the movement hardly effective.5) There are already women debating with each other vehemently all over Reddit, even on left-leaning subs.  Many support other women doing this, but are asking that women not hold them to the same standard.

In Perots case, he drew votes from Clinton and Bush; in Naders case, its not obvious how many of his voters would otherwise have stayed home.Furthermore, even in rare cases where there was the damage, the losing parties did not heed the defecting voters: the Republicans did not become notably friendlier to urban workers after Weaver, nor did the Democrats become more notably anti-corporate from the perceived threat of Nader.\\"https://medium.com/@cshirky/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-protest-vote-c2fdacabd704","title":"Dont dare blame Arab and Muslim Americans for Trumps victory"},{"text":"Define wokeness","title":"Exit Right.

Unfortunately, that argument goes both ways - if less than 1% of the population is trans or genderqueer, are we really worth specifically appealing to when our ideals already align in so many other areas?However important they may be (they are to me), its clear that identity politics have become the single most isolating factor of the Dems platform. I dont think abandon is the right word, but we really do need to rethink how we are messaging these things and acknowledge how confusing and complicated certain issues are to most voters. Most people do not care about trans issues because they dont know any trans people. Most of them likely never will. So when it becomes such a loud platform for such a small minority, I do understand how confusing and isolating it can be for anyone on the outside looking in.

Meta turned off the feeds that reporters and academics used to track political activity last August, so we dont have a clear picture of just how bad it got.

With TikTok, the political stuff was just as bad as the more well known challenges to post videos like slap you teacher, steal a car, choke yourself until you black out. Lots more people engage with this stuff than with Fox News and its ilk.And the echo chambers on social media only enhance it, steering people to engage with only what gets them riled up and with ads that are targeted to people wholl respond to them.

Laws get created but dont take effect until years later. Take Obama Care for example. Many of the legislation didnt start happening until Trump was in office. Its a slow burn, not an immediate flip of a switch. Plus, when there are results like this years election, it allows for local politics to be influenced. I bet you a dollar that newly elected city mayor is going to operate with the mindset of, see, people want conservative values. So Im going to go ahead with this plan to cut school spending and support the police more.Its also a matter of compromise. While we most likely agree on social issues, we may not agree on other stuff. Even though we voted for the same candidate this year we would still need to compromise on policies that we can all agree with. Its far better to convince others to join your cause than it is to force that cause onto people who dont understand or dont want it. Again, another slow process that requires everyone to communicate with each other on what they want and why it matters. On the flip side, we have to listen to the opposition and take their concerns into account. Make people on the outside feel welcome. Obviously, this isnt an easy task. Again, it takes time. The fact is that the POTUS is in charge of a lot of daily nonsense that many people do not understand. Trump was POTUS years ago, but the Justices he elected are going to be around for decades. Again, a slow burn that people wont see the outcome of until Trump was out of office. While politicians are not entitled to our vote the people should still make their choice heard. If you have to pick one person out of those who made it onto the ballot, pick one. I dont care if they didnt deserve your vote,l when the outcome could be far worse. Its better to move the needle forward in the right direction than it is to throw your hands up and scream that no one is perfect.

Because Im an American first of all, said Garcia, 70, whose great-grandparents emigrated from Mexico to the U.S.**Garcia grew up poor in San Antonio. And for 40 years he poured his life savings into a retirement fund.**When Biden came into presidency I lost $80,000 of my investment, but thats OK, Im looking for rosier times, he said. I know that Im going to do good with Trump.**Trumps economic populism and promises to make America great again have deeply resonated with some Latinos who turned sharply right on Tuesday amid concerns over inflation, the border and safety. They brushed off anti-immigrant language and backed him by 46%, compared with 2020 when he received 34% of their vote.**In some of the most heavily Latino corners of the country voters came out roaring for Trump. In Starr County, Texas, along the U.S.-Mexico border, where 98% of the population*?[*is Latino*](https://data.census.gov/profile/Starr_County,_Texas?g=050XX00US48427#populations-and-people)?*and immigration is in their frontyard, Trump*?[*pulled in 58%*](https://results.texas-election.com/county)?*of the vote. In the heavily Latino*?[*Miami-Dade County*](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election-results/article295134234.html)*, Trump won 56%.**What were witnessing is Trump ushering a major realignment in American politics, when it comes to the Latino vote, said Alfonso Aguilar, Hispanic engagement director at the American Principles Project and a Trump campaign surrogate.**Latinos certainly werent the only demographic that voted in droves for Trump, but what was striking was how Latino men embraced Trump compared with the last two elections. They favored Trump 55% to 43%, according to Edison Research. Four years earlier, Biden won Latino mens votes by a 23% margin. In 2016, Hillary Clinton pulled in 63% of their vote, while Trump got 32%. It was an *[*extraordinary shift*](https://www.edisonresearch.com/latino-male-voters-shift-toward-trump-in-2024-election/)*, as pollsters put it, and a sign of the changing views of a Latino population increasingly distanced from the immigrant experience and more focused on pocketbook issues. But it also signaled the stronger showing of men among Trump supporters.**But resoundingly, Latinos, who make up a wide spectrum of cultures and people, felt they struggled more economically during the Biden administration, experts say. The COVID shutdowns  which began during the Trump administration but were the most strict under the governors of blue states  kneecapped the economy and gave way to inflation. Working families scrambled to find work as housing prices jumped. These factors dovetailed with historic immigration highs, said Mike Madrid, a strategist who co-founded the Lincoln Project, a Republican anti-Trump political action committee.**One in five Hispanic men work in the construction industry, he said. They enjoyed low interest rates under the first Trump administration and lower housing costs, whether those had anything to do with his policies or not. If youre one of the Latino men who work in the construction industry, you were quantifiably better off under the Trump administration.**And it wasnt just Latino men. Trump also picked up support among Latinas, at 38%  up from 30% in 2020.*","title":"Why Latino men voted for Trump: 'It's the economy, stupid'"},{"text":"Trump needs to take a very close look at the Department of Energy and visit ALL of their facilities.","title":"This is why I voted for Trump!"},{"text":"This comment deserves it's own subreddit.

This book, published in 1997, outlines a strategy for Russia to reassert itself as a global power and often discusses the idea of undermining Western influence. For those that can't read: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22The+Foundations+of+Geopolitics%3A+The+Geopolitical+Future+of+Russia\\nLet's see how far we've progressed since that was all swept under the rug as \\"Witch Hunting\\". Many analysts and scholars have observed that elements of Dugin's ideas have manifested in Russia's recent foreign policy actions and broader geopolitical strategies. Since the publication of \\"The Foundations of Geopolitics,\\" we have seen several developments that align with his theories:Aggressive Foreign Policy: Russia's military interventions, particularly in Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014 and 2022), and Syria, reflect Dugin's advocacy for expanding Russian influence and protecting Russian-speaking populations abroad. These actions are often framed as part of a broader strategy to reassert Russia as a global power.Anti-Western Sentiment: Dugin's anti-Western rhetoric resonates with the current narrative promoted by the Russian government, which portrays the West as a threat to Russian sovereignty and traditional values. This narrative has been a cornerstone of state propaganda, especially in the context of military conflicts.Eurasianism: Dugin's concept of a Eurasian geopolitical bloc has found some expression in Russia's foreign relations, particularly through partnerships with countries like China, Iran, and various post-Soviet states. This strategy aims to create a multipolar world that diminishes Western influence.Cultural Traditionalism: The emphasis on traditional values as a counter to liberal democracy has gained traction in Russian society, with the government promoting conservative social policies that align with Dugin's vision.Strategic Use of Information Warfare: Dugin's ideas about undermining Western democracies through disinformation and cyber tactics are reflected in Russia's approach to information warfare, including interference in elections and spreading propaganda.Support for Populism: The rise of populist movements in various Western countries has been interpreted as a validation of Dugin's belief in the decline of liberal democracy and the potential for alternative political models, which some see as aligning with Russian interests.While not all aspects of Dugin's vision have been realized, many observers agree that the geopolitical landscape has shifted significantly since the early 2000s, often in ways that reflect his ideas. This connection has led to increased scrutiny of Dugin's work as a framework for understanding contemporary Russian behavior on the world stage.","title":"Trump hires a corporate lobbyist as his Chief of Staff"},{"text":"You have to find a doctor that will, especially for young people","title":"Americans stockpile abortion pills and hormones ahead of reproductive apocalypse under Trump"},{"text":"Also despite what has been false claimed , the majority of illegal migrants pay in to taxes but do not receive the majority of benefits that citizens do.

We don't have a really good, ubiquitously watched, TV/streaming network (Fox is running on TVs 24/7 in stores / waiting rooms all over, hell, even on US military bases). We have a bunch of little pieces here and there, if you know where to look. We've got MSNBC, which has some good shows and some meh shows. CNN stopped being very left-friendly a while ago. There are some good streamers on YouTube (Beau of the Fifth Column comes to mind), but, again, its drips and drabs here and there, rather than one service you can continually stream.Rupert Murdoch put together a media empire with the express purpose of, well, getting to here, where a (near?) majority of people watch its lies and believe them, and elect Republicans to office (who then proceed to help the billionaires like Rupert Murdoch, rather than the people that elected them).If we can't make Fox go away, we need a very strong answer to it. A well-funded media service that attracts viewers because it tells the truth, pulls no punches on the about the right (like the endless sanewashing of Trump's speeches or the recent pattern of incessantly saying Biden was too old, but then forgetting that talking point the moment Trump was the oldest candidate), and while we're at it, offers editorial content / opinions with left-based viewpoint. I want a channel that has Rachel Maddow, and Chris Hayes, and Mehdi Hasan, and John Oliver, all in one place, and constantly hammering on every outrageous and illegal thing the right does, not letting things slide, because there's going to be an awful lot of fresh material over the next four years, at least. And, yeah, not *just* the right, call out bad things on both sides, as they happen (it's just that the right side of the aisle does a lot more that is illegal / unethical) - call out corporations that do bad things, whatever their persuasion (take a look at the wide variety of topics that John Oliver goes after - there's plenty to call out all over the map).AP reports mostly the news, from a fairly neutral viewpoint, but there's scant analysis, and no biting commentary to keep it interesting and focus attention on the outrageous bits. MSNBC has the commentary, but overall its content can be a bit hit-or-miss.At this point, I'd happily pay $10/mo just to have access to a livestream of MSNBC (with its flaws, its better than nothing). What I won't do is pay $50-$70/mo for cable TV (or one of the streaming equivalents), to get 80 channels, where *one* of them is MSNBC - and that's the only way it's available right now (they have apps on all the platforms, but it only works if you log into your TV provider, which I don't have). I think there's a market out their for an... \\"antidote-to-Fox\\" network. Build a reputation for it being honest, factual, rigorously fact-checked, and *also* entertaining (and sometimes enraging because of the material being reported).","title":"\\"Misinformation works [...] There is NO candidate that can change this.

In 1928 and 1929, tariffs were reduced in almost all developed countries.[25] Additionally, the SmootCHawley Tariff Act was signed by Hoover on June 17, 1930, while the Wall Street Crash occurred in the fall of 1929. Milton Friedman was of the opinion that the 1930 SmootCHawley Tariff did not cause the Great Depression. Douglas Irwin writes: \\"Most economists, liberal and conservative alike, doubt that Smoot Hawley had much to do with the subsequent contraction.\\"[26] William J. Bernstein wrote:[27]\\n  Between 1929 and 1932, real GDP fell 17% worldwide, and 26% in the United States, but most economic historians now believe that only one A minuscule part of that huge loss in both world GDP and US GDP can be attributed to tariff wars. ... At the time of SmootCHawley's passage, the volume of trade represented only about 9% of world economic output. If all international trade had been eliminated and no domestic use found for previously exported goods, world GDP would have fallen by the same amount: 9 percent. Between 1930 and 1933, the volume of world trade fell by between a third and a half. Depending on how the drop is measured, this equates to between 3 and 5 percent of global GDP, and these losses were partially offset by more expensive domestic goods. Thus, the damage caused could not have exceeded 1 or 2 percent of global GDP, or even close to the 17 percent drop seen during the Great Depression... The inescapable conclusion: Contrary to public perception, SmootCHawley did not cause, or even significantly deepened, the Great Depression. From wikipedia but I'm skeptical of free trade so I will find things that support my biases.","title":"Trump advisers, Congress discuss tariff legislation.

You are already wise beyond your years for that reason alone. I think everyone can agree that Trump isnt the smoothest talker. He himself even acknowledges that he goes on what he calls weaves aka tangents. But hes said if you keep listening, hell always come back to his points. This makes it really easy for liberals and media to take clips of what he says out of context, because they dont show the whole clip. So that contributes to a lot of the hate. One of the best things he did on this election was going on long form podcasts. This helped so many people see the real side of him. In the podcasts, you see hes actually really funny and you realize he makes sarcastic jokes. Hes not perfect by any means and hes made mistakes like all of us but hes not the monster the left/mainstream media makes him out to be and he has done some really nice things! Like did you know he charted a plane for Nelson Mandela in 1991 when no one else would? He also donated $100k to help train dogs that would go to help veterans - he admitted he isnt a huge dog person, but his daughter in law is and its something shes passionate about so he wanted to help her. He paid $10k to a bus driver who helped save a suicidal person. He worked with Kim Kardashian to release a lady, Alice Johnson, from prison who was serving a life sentence for a first time drug offense. Hes done so many nice things that the media doesnt show- its quite sad. I recommend watching the podcasts to see him and hopefully thatll help you see a different side of him. To me, he just seems like a loving grandpa who talks too much and still has his humor lol. But outside of that, you know hes tough and a straight shooter which is why other countries respected us more when he was in power. You need that sort of toughness to run a country. Here are some of the podcasts-Maintaining with Tyrus https://youtu.be/nwQil7tcImI?si=D045LRqLWn0zYTEl-Joe Rogan https://youtu.be/hBMoPUAeLnY?si=KgJ-XItRQ466zQ3q-Theo Von https://youtu.be/vC5cHjcgt5g?si=cfiJ1-wyy7aCyhBtHe went on a lot more so you can google them I dont want to overwhelm you!Also just in general, I recommend watching the last 5 or so episodes of Joe Rogan (Im a female and I just started listening since the trump episode and Rogan is great!

I have no data on how many voters were actually missing meals in 2019 vs. 2024, but the safe response on motivation was perceived economic hardship.\\nIf we are speaking honestly, any current hardship felt is the tail end of the Biden recovery policies. A recovery effort rooted in the disastrous Trump response to the COVID pandemic. \\nThe current economy can be best understood by looking at the Trump policies reacting to the pandemic and the Biden policies reacting to the Trump policies. Outside of these factors are the actions taken by the independent Fed.The Trump COVID response, or lack thereof, resulted in unemployment peaking at 13% and the largest GDP contraction in 20 years. Globally, the price of oil crashed to approx. $16/barrel. \\nIn his last year, and largely in response to profit loss in the Oil &amp; Gas industry, Trump negotiated a huge production cut with Russia &amp; OPEC. This had the knock-on effect of raising the price of oil from $16/barrel to a peak of $118/barrel by 2020. (it has since dropped to approx. $70/barrel , or about 2018 levels) \\nIn response to the Covid crash, the Fed did what the Fed does to stave off a full collapse and keep us from falling into a recession.  As an independent actor they aren't fairly judged in political terms and are mostly unaffected by political pressure. To note, under the current leadership the American economy is the only economy to have pulled off a \\"soft landing\\" after Covid.  And so starting in 2020, we had to recover from high unemployment, low GDP, rising Oil &amp; Gas prices and rising interest rates. Biden's initial polices focused on getting the nation tested and vaccinated and jump-starting the economy with business loans and personal stimulus checks.\\nlike it or not, the Biden administration had to hit a magic number with the stimulus policies. Too little and the economy drags on in the gutter, too much and inflation starts to take hold. In an ideal world, he could have put it to a national vote and in a way, he did by leaving it to congress to pass the American Rescue Plan.\\nSafe to say, the American Rescue Plan juiced the economy and combined with previously listed factors (gas prices, interest rates,) inflationary influences started to set in. But at least people were back to work, and the economy was out of the ditch.There is an outlier in all of this that needs to be considered: Fox \\"news.\\"  While both parties engaged in rage-baiting social media, there was no larger misinformation agent than Fox \\"news\\".\\nRunning 24hrs a day, Fox led the major messaging of the covid era, often in close coordination with the Trump campaign. Starting with Covid being no big deal and can be ignored and vaccines are not only pointless but may be harmful, to there was widespread election fraud, and ending with Biden is wholly responsible for high inflation. (we can leave out the \\"Haitians eating your pets\\" and their other daily racist nonsense.) \\n[To note, out of their 24hr programming of misinformation, they have really only been held accountable for the election fraud lies.] (TLDR)Trump policies are as much to blame, if not more so, for the current public economy. The Right-Wing misinformation machine was a larger factor in the Trump win than a few thousand Latino votes.","title":"Why Does No One\\nUnderstand the Real Reason Trump Won?"},{"text":"/r/sterilization if you need logistics or information.dr list in the childfree sub wiki to find a doctor who won't say noInsurance is required to cover vasectomies with no cost sharing in the following states: Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and California.","title":"Americans stockpile abortion pills and hormones ahead of reproductive apocalypse under Trump"},{"text":"Unconditional hostage release","title":"Hamas calls for \\"immediate\\" end to war after Trump election win"},{"text":"Not even sworn in yet and he's 1000x better than Biden.","title":"Migrant caravans turn back around after Trump wins election."},{"text":"No Senate is going to confirm a SCOTUS appointment before a new Admin. , full stop.","title":"Justice Sonia Sotomayor faces pressure to retire ahead of Trump taking office: report."},{"text":"I'm sorry man, they scrubbed the info, they control the information.","title":"2024 Election was stolen."},{"text":"Ah yes, right wing media didnt exist before 2020","title":"Why Does No One\\nUnderstand the Real Reason Trump Won?"},{"text":"By now , you will be thrown out a window ruzzian style and the scotus will approve it.","title":"Fed Chair says he won't resign if Trump asks him to"},{"text":"There's only one glaring reason why trump won: russia.

Califroina has always been an expensive state, and will likely always remain as such, but in recent years its become unbearable. This affects people in other neighboring states as well, since price out californians are able to sell their homes for a million dollars and push out local families in Arizona/nevada/or oregon which makes the COL more expsnive for locals who must compete with local wages and who cannot afford downpayments on homes anymore. Elon is right, one state is pushing policies that cause massive harm to the other 49. Say what you want about Red states, but their abortion bans do not affect you if you live in a blue state, California policies fuck everything up for their neighbors though.","title":"Trump tears into Newsom over special legislative session"},{"text":"Hopefully a bunch of maga idiots","title":"Millions at risk of losing health insurance following Trump's victory"},{"text":"We taking bets on the over under of how many months it takes to fuck us?

His job over the past few years has apparently been the wonky bits of making Project 2025 shovel-ready for Day 1.Centre for Climate Reporting - Undercover in Project 2025 ([Article](https://climate-reporting.org/undercover-in-project-2025/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/PY_chqyaRHo) 9:51)[Russel Vought]  is the founder and president of the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank he described to his hosts as the Death Star, which alongside the Heritage Foundation has been at the heart of Project 2025.Vought said he is overseeing the drafting of hundreds of executive orders, regulations and secretarial memos, to help make the US conservative movements radical goals a reality. These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there. The trust level will be there.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.","title":"Trump Allies Suddenly Feel Safe Touting Project 2025"},{"text":"I think you're in the wrong sub, this is for conspiracies....","title":"Why isnt Alex Jones going nuts about 'new world order' tweet by Musk"},{"text":"Have them sent to different pharmacies, use GoodRX and pay cash.

This played out in 2016-2020, where those on record denouncing Trump do a 360. It will now play out again from 2024-2028.","title":"Janelle Bynum wins race for Congress, flipping U.S. House seat from GOP to Democratic control"},{"text":"So shortly after the whole thing went down, the Democratic House started impeachment proceedings. Since Trump was already on his way out, Mitch McConnell used that as an excuse not to complete the impeachment in the Senate. No meaningful reason was given, but we all took it to mean 'what are you gonna do about it?'.So then came the evidence gathering step, which was stalled, blocked, delayed and hamstrung time and time again by Republicans in various House Committees who were tasked with gathering said evidence. Since its the House's job to do it, and those committees need to have representatives from both parties, the Republicans on those committees abused their power as much as possible that it took two entire years before the cases even started up in late 2022.So when that started, then you had the legal system, which Trump is notorious for abusing by delaying progress as much as possible, with trivial procedural matters, by finding the absolute bottom-of-the-barrel lawyers he can find, who will endure censures from the court system for wasting their time, in his defense.By now its late 2023, and suddenly the Supreme Court decides to step in. Trump's lawyers made the bold-faced claim that the President is immune to prosecution (like, at all, not just for official acts). Any reasonable person might think that this would be a tacit admission that Trump had done exactly what Jack Smith was accusing him of, and that he would only use this argument when cornered, but we'll just pretend to ignore that part. The Supreme Court looks at this absurd argument and thinks \\"Yeah, sounds a bit dicey, and an important thing to discuss, so let's schedule that for 6 months from now, knowing that we won't have to provide a resolution until at least 2 months later, which is our typical turnaround time\\". Weirdly enough, despite the extremely weak arguments put forth by the Trump legal team, who had to be coached through to providing proper legalese answers by the conservative Supreme Court Justices multiple times (something that *never* happens), they finally made their decision after 3 months of deliberation. Why the extra month? I dunno, I think someone lost some paperwork somewhere and they had to get new copies from Trump's team or something. You know. Shit happens.By July the Supreme Court had thus ordered Jack Smith and team to go back to the beginning and decide exactly which pieces of evidence could be used in a new superceding indictment, now that they'd finally come to a decision that 'presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts, but we're not going to tell you what those official acts are, and make you do all of the work figuring that out, oh and if you do include anything in that indictment that we don't think is an official act, we'll have to intervene again. Sorry about making your workload so much bigger right now, but we're just really so busy ourselves'.And so, months later, after finally being given his marching orders, and the Supreme Court had played defense for Trump and his legal team for the better part of a year, Jack Smith revealed his supersceding indictment. Oh, but wouldn't you know it, now we're stuck in election season and we *cannot possibly* accelerate the legal process, or strip away the will of the people, for this particularly unique and important case. Aw shucks.And there you have it. Blatant quid-pro-quo, corruption and sycophancy provided to an undeserving man by your House, your Senate, your Supreme Court all so they could all retain power.","title":"Special counsel Jack Smith seeks pause in Trump criminal case to assess unprecedented circumstance"},{"text":"Oldie but a goodie.Ill always love how the womans perfectly okay with being disrespectful to the people around her.
