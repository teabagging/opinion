The truth is he is a creepy weirdo who you would never leave your kids with, and pantomimes Minnesota values and behavior because has has no clue how to do them genuinely.Walz was previously a popular politician because he was the one who signed the funding bill for US Bank Stadium (Minnesota Vikings current Stadium). The truth is that bill passed the state legislature when others didn't was because the Wilf brothers (majority owners of the Vikings) agreed to contribute $400 million to the project via the franchise itself and NFL backed improvement loans. Walz became unpopular during the pandemic because of his handling of lockdowns, the George Floyd situation,  and him actively promoting riots. In the 2022 midterm elections the DFL (Minnesota Democrat Party) got a single vote majority in the state congress and with Walz backing have essentially run a victory lap on the state. They have passed every far left bill they can manage. It got so bad that a couple of the left congressmen voted against a couple of far left bills, which prevented them from passing.

I've been looking into this more over the last day &amp; I'm now pretty dead-set on voting in NY, but I'm still struggling to figure out how to switch.

But that's certainly not government-issued &amp; I don't know if it'd fly.  \\n  \\n2) My legal address on most records I can think of is certainly still in NJ. I can't find reliable info on how I'd go about updating it, or where said address needs to be recorded to be considered official. I think I could get proof from the college that I've been living here since mid-August, and I have some prescriptions with a NY address that's likely recorded in my psychiatrist's / pharmacy's respective systems. I'm not sure how helpful that is, though.  \\n  \\n3) I'm finding conflicting info on whether I need to cancel my NJ registration / how to do so. The NY application I have specifically prohibits \\"claiming the right to vote elsewhere\\" so I'm worried about legal consequences even if I only cast a New York ballot.

You say \\"If they see a name or a picture that suggests this is a black applicant, they will immediately throw their resume in the trash\\".  That's an example of a racist *person*, not a racist *system*.  A racist *system* would be one where HR has a rule for hiring that says \\"No black people\\".Now, it can be tough to differentiate between the two sometimes, but the key to keep in mind is 'Is it the *person* doing it, or is it *the system*?' In your example, a different hiring person would *not* necessarily do the same thing. Thus, it's a 'person' who is racist. But if HR had a rule of 'no black people', then *anyone* doing the hiring would have to follow the rule, making it racist *system*.You later say that \\"systemic racism exists because racist people exist, and those racist people can work their way up to the top... to make sure their racism is implemented very covertly in policy\\".  If they indeed create an actual policy, then that's a racist system, as the policy is part of the system.  If they just make racist decisions themselves, that's just a racist individual.  It seems to me you kinda blur the line between the two.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"Actually, Fabrizio is Trump's main internal pollster.

Vance sends the message that MAGA isnt a movement tied to Trump and that theres a younger generation of politicians ready to carry on the torch after Trump, win or lose. Walz? Much like the Harris for Biden pick, Im not sure what the intent there is. Hes an unpopular politician from a struggling state with a horrible political and military record and multiple DUIs while being a teacher. Im not sure what the angle is. In genuinely think if Harris picked Shapiro the election would be as good as locked up. PA would 100% go to her and it would send a message that despite the loud Palestinian wing of the party, the DNC is willing to put a Jewish person in the White House and willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel.

Once it was known that Al Qaeda was behind the attack, the drumbeat for war wasn't just coming from the WH, they were banging pretty damn loud from the chambers of Congress as well (Dems included). Bush and Cheney definitely pushed to go after Iraq from the beginning, if Gore had acted differently than I think then sure we wouldn't have gone to Iraq. Just don't get the sense he'd go to war over something he and the Clinton administration thought of as a law enforcement/international terrorism issue rather than a 'military' one needing the full might of the US military and its allies to combat. And no, I don't think he would have just sat on his hands. I think Gore would have tried to take a more measured approach like try to get the Taliban to hand over Bin Laden or impose more sanctions. Looking at the Clinton Adminstration's strikes against Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, most were done to hurt Bin Laden financially (they sent cruise missiles to destroy a tannery owned by Bin Laden), to remove capability to produce things like nerve gas, or to stop attacks in planning. Rarely did they go after Al Qaeda's bases in Afghanistan or Bin Laden himself. They didn't want to send 'expensive missiles' against the training camps because the generals advised that they were primitive and cheap. Clinton and others like Gore didn't want to hit Bin Laden directly over fears that missing him would enhance his stature and attacks in Afghanistan might lead to claims of 'a bomb-happy US govt'. Diplomatic efforts were mostly stymied, but they kept trying them in lieu of actually going after Bin Laden/Al Qaeda. Some of this was due to Saudi Arabia, some because of concerns of how it would look if we took sides in the Afghan civil war between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. Gore might have given a green light to take covert action against Bin Laden, but I don't think that would have been enough at the time based on the mood in Congress or a good bit of the country.  A source on how the Clinton admin handled things w/ Al Qaeda and Bin Laden: [https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report\\\\_Ch4.htm](https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch4.htm) It's all pure speculation of course, we're living in a world where Bush was elected.","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Remarks on Federal Response to Hurricane Helene Before a White House Press Briefing"},{"text":"Tale as old as time - Democrat takes blame for Republicans mess and doesnt get credit for cleaning it up.","title":"'Admire you so darn much' | President Biden delivers birthday message for Jimmy Carter"},{"text":"You should cite the author of the quote about inactive responsibility, Ijeoma Oluo.

This is the \\"color blind racism\\" argument - to go deeper, I recommend the book \\"Racism Without Racists\\" by Bonilla-Silva. It's this process where policies that promote racially disparate outcomes can be intertwined at all levels of decision-making within an organization.There's four components to the framework.* Abstract liberalism (e.g., \\"equal opportunity\\") as a means to oppose policies that expressly aim racially equal outcomes. Think of the most commonly accepted reasons to oppose affirmative action: \\"Let's be color blind.\\"\\n* Naturalization - this means that racial phenemona are \\"natural\\" occurences. Such as \\"people like to group to like people.\\" This is the thought of \\"that's just the way things are.\\"\\n* Cultural racism - this is where narratives about groups can form that explain differences as inherent in cultural values of the group. This is the whole \\"you just gotta work hard\\" with the implication that not getting ahead means not working hard. \\n* Minimizing racism - this is the argument that racism isn't a central factor affecting minorties life chances. This is the counter argument where whites say trying to rise awareness of racially disparate outcomes is \\"playing the race card.\\"What Bonilla-Silva provides is that you don't need all four frameworks, but there can always be a combination of frameworks at practice. To tie this back into your framework, you can have a CEO who has a race-neutral set of policies. Even if shown that there's racially disparate outcomes, could say, \\"That's the way things are\\" or \\"That's just the way they are\\" or whatever. I am trying to come up with an example; maybe working from home privileges but you require a dedicated home office may have a racially disparate outcome if there's race differences in ability to have a home office or dedicated high speed internet. Maybe this means people with a home office can get 1 more hour of productivity and start outcompeting peers who are stuck having to use public transportation.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"I like Goldblum, but I've noticed that he's become more of a caricature of himself as he's gotten older.

Black peope are 13% of the population they make up 20% of presidents this century, 22% of the current Supreme Court, 25% of the presidential cabinet, 12% of the House, and 8% of the senate. In the most upper echelons of power, placed there *by the people*, black people are slightly *over* represented.Black people are also fairly significantly over-represented in media / movies in 2024.Oh, and Nigerian immigrants are the richest ethnicity in America followed by Indians (who are often black passing).So now your evidence of systemic racism is unequal outcomes in less powerful but still high prestige positions - like tech workers or doctors or pilots.But like its not exactly clear to me how you expect there to be an exactly representative number of knowledge workers when black people graduate, graduate at top of their class, and go to universities and lower rates.A lot of the early education can be traced *rather directly* from to poverty and single parenthood rates. Like its not *racism* that causes black men to abandon their kids at high rates, and its not racism that causes black communities to not prioritize education for the same degree as others, its not racism that makes black kids join gangs. Those are unfortunate realities that exist in black communities before we get into any other externality.You can of course trace that poverty back to institutional racism decades ago but you kind of have the problem that Asians and Jews had that same institutional racism of the 60s and 70s and have since overcome.Yes, many black areas have issues - but those issues are a combination of (lack of) economic opportunity and some really problematic cultural issues from within. Which is really no different than poor white people in Appalachia.To suggest its the result of ongoing racism is a major misdiagnosis.Thats not to say there is zero implicit bias among humans anywhere, of course theres some. Implicit bias also works in the other direction - most CEOs want diverse photo ops of their staff, and often prioritize diversity as a tiebreaker (and sometimes even take diverse over more qualified, like Harvard).But thats not the bar for systemic racism.

First they claimed that she was a combatant actively involved with fighting. Within an hour the narrative that she was throwing stones was being injected simultaneously by numerous different users, like within the same minute as opposed to spreading like viral information usually does. The message immediately had the claim she was throwing bricks added to it when it became apparent that thrown stones offer no threat to soldiers in full body armor.  Shortly after that series of narrative injections became widespread reports came out that she wasn't actually in the crowd, and in fact had been pretty far away. In fact, she was 0.2km away when she was shot in the back of the head. The narrative injection immediately shifted to her using a sling to throw stones at the soldiers since no human could throw a stone or brick that far, but that didn't gain much traction because slings require a great deal of practice and skill to be useful. Of course new injections began pointing out the world record for sling-thrown projectiles, implying that if a world-class athlete trained to use a sling could throw a stone that far, then so could this young woman who had zero history of being involved in any competitive sports. Ultimately they flooded the zone with so much misinformation and shineys they accomplished their mission, which was to prevent focusing on the actual facts long enough for her murder to slip off the news cycle and be replaced by the next story in the queue. The facts have always remained unchanged: She was at the protest of settlers stealing Palestinian homes and lands at that location, the IDF fired one or more teargas canisters into the crowd, she and the others dispersed and ran away, the IDF fired one round that ricocheted off something metal like a dumpster and struck a young Palestinian in the leg, and the second shot struck Ms. Eygi in the back of the head from a distance of around 0.2km away, roughly 660 feet. She was killed instantly, though pronounced dead at a local hospital. She wasn't a threat to anyone, especially any of the IDF soldiers on the hill that killed her. The fact she was shot in the back of the head from a significant distances away is very reminiscent of the way the IDF murdered Shireen Abu Akleh. The Israeli government has expended large amounts of effort to protect the soldier that murdered Shireen, and I suspect they'll do the same for the soldier that murdered Ms. Eygi. As an aside, two of the parallel narrative injections being made as part of the firehood of falsehoods was that she wasn't an American citizen, and that she was in a warzone and thus \\"accidental\\" killings in war zones should be accepted. Of course, she's a US Citizen by birth, and the West Bank is not a war zone. Neither narrative injection point gained any traction and within hours were discontinued.","title":"Congress members press Biden for intelligence briefing, independent investigation of Seattleite's killing by Israeli forces"},{"text":"Between that and taking care of the lawn.","title":"Hillary Clinton Warns of 'Concerted Efforts to Distort and Pervert' Kamala Harris"},{"text":"If these examples were systemic racism, they would be much more egregious than the concept is usually intended to mean.

Some have very deep voices, etc. There are a lot of different types of actors.The fact that Goldblum excels at characters who are whimsical and somewhat disconnected just means he has a type, not that he is a bad actor.But watch the latest Kaos series on Netflix.

In my understanding, this couldn't be further from the truth.*Sexual objectification: Sexual objectification is the act of treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire.*In what way is porn not inherently sexually objectifying? I don't care about country statistics. In the countries you listed, women are treated like *private* property. In the west, women are treated like *public* property.Porn does not make people commit sexual violenceI have enough personal anecdotes to prove otherwise. The whole world has enough anecdotes to prove otherwise. Porn itself already contains an insane amount of sexual violence. The hub is full of CP, drugging, assault. Porn *promotes* sexual violence because more often than not, it *is* sexual violence.You keep mentioning other countries like India as if digital porn wasn't invented only a few decades ago. What do you think the west looked like back then? It didn't look like fucking India.There is simply no clear correlation between the availableness of porn and sexual violence towards womenWe have turned sexual strangulation into a common sex act. It can take only seconds to do irreversible damage. It can lead to death. Literal teenagers are doing this to each other because they saw it in porn, not knowing how to do it \\"safely\\". Of course, there is no safe way to do it, but when done wrong, it can go *very* wrong. *A*?[*survey for the BBC*](https://comresglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Final-BBC-5-Live-Tables_211119cdh.pdf)?*in 2019 found that in a study of 2,000 young women aged 18C39, 38% had experienced unwanted slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during otherwise consensual sex. And a similar proportion of men admit to choking or strangling a partner during sex without their consent.*There are enough (non-religious) studies that reveal how pornography usage not only increases male sexual aggression, but also that there is a correlation between pornography usage and intimate partner violence. Porn primes women to expect violence and desensitizes men into adopting these aggressive behaviors.Conversely, there is nothing natural about having a constant desire to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol or snort cocaine.External stimulus == internal reaction. That's any addiction. Nicotine stimulates dopamine release. Cocaine stimulates dopamine release. Alcohol stimulates dopamine release. *Guess why porn is addictive?*IT STIMULATES DOPAMINE RELEASE.As living beings, our evolutionary purpose is to procreate. The reason we procreate is because sex is really fun! It's a built-in drug that gets released into our system as a reward for trying to procreate. *Of course* it's addictive. Biologically, no addiction makes more sense than a porn/sex addiction. But like any addiction, tolerance is built. Death-grip syndrome is one such side effect. The biggest issue is apparent when we look at mainstream porn. Instead of regular, \\"boring\\" sex, we now see women getting beat up, slapped and choked, making weird faces, making weird noises- the whole thing has become a pathetic caricature. But for our society, it's considered peak sex. The industry also knows this and openly talks about this. It has to keep evolving because the demand for more is never-ending. Porn is just skibidi toilet sex at this point to keep the viewers occupied and satisfied.If I watch porn on a regular basis, that doesn't mean I am addicted to porn; it just means I enjoy appreciating things that are beautiful and emotionally moving.How do you know that the people you're watching aren't coerced? Drugged? Minors? How do you know they consented to having their body shown to the world? How do you know they *still* consent to it? How do you know they're not groomed into the industry? How do you know they're enjoying themselves? How do you know?You don't.The chance of you enjoying someone being raped is insanely high. Let that sink in. Why would you enjoy someone being raped?

Systems may be crated by racist people, and while they actively avoid racist language, but they can still have racist consequences.  Jim Crow laws were systematic racism - the laws single out policies that were different for black people.  Redlining is systematic racism - new housing was not to be sold to black people.Here's a specific example of systemic racism is criminal justice:  [Black students, in particular, are more likely to attend middle and high schools with higher concentrations of police officers than mental health professionals.](https://robertsmith.com/blog/examples-of-systemic-racism/)  This results in more Black students being arrested than White students.  There is nothing in the laws or policies that say that Black students should be treated differently. However, the very presence of police *inherently* increases the likelihood of an infraction being punished by the justice system.  Black students are at a disadvantage to white students due to a set of actions that can't be explicitly tied to race.  If there is a policy that says \\"black schools get more police\\", that is systematic.  If there is a policy that says \\"schools in high crime areas get more police\\" that can be systemically racist if the high crime areas are in black neighborhoods.The important part is that systemic racism can persist long after racists leave the system.  The problem is that whenever you try to discuss systemic racism, you have people getting indigent and saying \\"but I'm not racist!\\".  No, you aren't.  The system is racist.  This mess is complicated by the prevalence of people misunderstanding and misusing the terminology (including in the source I reference above).  This is more clear if you look up the definition of systemic vs. systematic, without the word \\"racism\\" attached.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"Republicans were mad at Obama for asking for mustard on a burger.

That's what makes it more difficult to fix - you have a bunch of people who aren't being racist participating in a system that still puts POC at a disadvantage due to the consequences of the actions of racists in the past.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"So tell me what the c40 agenda is for 2030?","title":"Remember when I told you about C40 and 15 minute cities years ago and I was downvoted, coz yknow, this is a conspiracy sub, now all the podcasters are talking about it"},{"text":"I agree with this.

His unrelenting expansion of the **Ulez** ultra low emissions zone in August faced down *major* criticism from affected businesses, disadvantaged citizens and vigilante vandals. Khan is showing no signs of slowing down: this week, **plans were unveiled to lower the speed limit to 20mph** on a further 40 miles of roads in London, the capitals largest-ever rollout to date.Bureaucrats are sidestepping political mandates:This is the radical vision of a net zero future dreamed up by **C40**, a global collective of city mayors chaired by Sadiq Khan, **which advocates extreme measures to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030** and limit global temperature increases to 1.5C. Since December 2021, **he has led C40**, which is made up of the mayors of 96 cities from six different continents. It spends its time conducting research, holding conferences **and drawing up climate action plans**Heres the kicker:It merged the following year with a similar body set up by former US president **Bill Clinton**, and its current board president is Michael Bloomberg, the US billionaire. **Its website lists the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office as a major funder**, among several other governments, charities and multinational companies. So it **is** the British establishment that's leading the charge on this beastly climate change system. As for Clinton, given the \\"green kings\\" initiative\\n... 'birds of a feather flock together'.In Khan's own words, you can read it for yourself:https://www.c40.org/ Like Ulez or the 20mph speed limits, he's a power unto himself, he can enact the will of his masters without impediment or oversight.

They want less US intervention and a reduction of the war machine. They want the US to stop meddling in the foreign affairs of countries especially brown countries and to stop taking brown lives for its nefarious goals. But they never reach the catch 22 of this logic. Isolationism, reduced Middle East bases, a refusal to intervene militarily or with aid packages it REDUCES the influence of the US abroad. And while they want that they also shut down streets and campuses claiming the US must stop Israel from XY and Z. Well, if we live in a world 15 years from now where the US has fully divested from Israel. And whatever other countries. We have no bases in Iraq/Syria/Qatar/Turkey then it doesnt mean the world is more peaceful. It just means when a country is going to do something that is against global or US influence they have no reason to even pick up the phone when we call. Putin in Ukraine could be 20 other countries. Countries will go to whoever they can trade with and will provide protection or services. Currently the US is losing Africa to China and Russia. China is building infrastructure in Africa in return for influence and trade. The US withdrawal from these nations hasnt resulted in peace and prosperity. Its resulted in the deployment of Wagner forces. Wars. And instability brought out by other countries influences. Im not here to say the US is perfect. But I can assure you the women of Afghanistan wish we hadnt left. And that the more places we disappear from the more dictators or people like the Taliban or Muslim brotherhood or ISIS will sweep in to fill the vacuum.

Classical actors study how to control their voices, expressions, and mannerisms to create a character. Masters of classical-training have a chameleon quality, able to take on a range of diverse roles. Meryl Streep and Daniel Day Lewis are classically trained, as are performers like Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, and Anthony Hopkins.  These actors can inhabit very different characters and play them convincingly. Method actors focus less on the outward mechanics of performance and concentrate on the internal experience of the character. They are able to give moving, emotional performances and expose complex motivations in their characters. Think of actors like Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Hillary Swank. They are very identifiable as themselves in every role, but they bring a level emotional intensity and complexity to their characters that is hard to duplicate. Of course, these categories aren't written in stone, and all actors use techniques from both schools along with more unconventional or personal systems. Some just favor one system over the other. Goldblum is a method actor, and his skills have born some extremely memorable characters in *The Fly*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Independence Day*. His recent protrayal of Zeus in Netflix's *Kaos* series is incredible. The fact that he is personally recognizable in these roles, or that the characters are similar to one another does not negate the fact that the roles are fantastic in themselves and the characters are perfectly placed in their stories.   \\n  \\nWhat is the art of acting, if not that?","title":"cmv: Jeff Goldblum is a bad actor.

Martley Habitat Bank is part of eight Environment Bank Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) sites covering 500 acres secured under conservation covenants. Leading BNG provider, Environmental Bank has announced a collection of BNG Habitat Banks secured under a conservation covenant so they can be added to the national register. The Martley Habitat Bank covers more than 17 hectares of land near Worcester. Environment Bank will transform the existing arable fields into a diverse mosaic of wildflower grassland, mixed scrubland, traditional orchard, hedgerows, and ponds, 'providing some incredible opportunities for native wildlife to thrive'. The site is strategically located near to pockets of ancient woodland, providing vital connectivity between the Habitat Bank and the surrounding landscape. The enhancements Environment Bank is making to the landscape will be instrumental in improving the quality and structure of the soil which is deemed particularly important as the Habitat Bank falls within a flood zone.  Soil enhancements are considered essential for increasing the lands resilience against the worst effects of climate change. This is one of eight BNG sites, created and managed by Environment Bank in partnership with rural landowners, that cover almost 500 acres (almost 200 hectares) in total. The purpose of these sites is to transform low-yielding farmland into nature recovery sites and improve biodiversity. BNG not only contributes to national biodiversity objectives but also offers landowners a way to diversify their income streams, enhance their natural landscapes, and build business resilience for their farms. Catherine Spitzer, CEO, Environment Bank said: Working alongside local farmers and landowners, Environment Bank has 25 Habitat Banks already live, generating over 4,000 Biodiversity Units. Securing legal agreements for these sites is the final step in unlocking the supply of Biodiversity Units. \\"With developers required to ensure their projects benefit nature overall, this marks a significant milestone in the implementation phase. Now with supply unlocked, we can meet growing demand. This is a really positive step in helping this fledgling market thrive. Conservation covenant agreements with a responsible body are one of two types of legal agreements to secure land for Biodiversity Units. The other is a planning obligation (section 106) with a local planning authority (LPA). Developers are required by law under the Environment Act 2021 to ensure that all significant developments must deliver a minimum 10 per cent increase in biodiversity, and they can do so by purchasing Biodiversity Units from Habitat Banks created off-site.[Zoo plants 19,000 trees in unused field](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrm6d4ye6do) A zoo has said it has helped create a new sanctuary for UK wildlife by planting nearly 19,000 trees in an unused field. Chester Zoo has planted a new area of woodland across nine-hectares of a low-biodiversity silage field in Upton, Cheshire. The attraction said it was their biggest habitat creation project to date and one of the largest tree planting projects to take place in the county in several years. Jennifer Kelly, Chester Zoo's head of sustainability, said the new woodland would provide a \\"lasting legacy for future generations\\". Woodland once covered large areas of Cheshire but has disappeared from much of the county, the zoo said **'Wildlife can move safely'** The initiative, which forms part of a wider wildlife corridor across the region, has seen a diverse mix of UK native broadleaf trees species, including oak, beech and hazel, planted to provide high biodiversity benefits and resilience to climate change. It has been funded by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) through the Nature for Climate Fund, and delivered in partnership with the Mersey Forest. Dr Simon Dowell, director of science and policy at the zoo, said the woodland, once established, would provide a \\"richer and more diverse habitat for a range of species\\". He said it would help to bring in species including green woodpeckers, badgers, harvest mice and butterflies such as the speckled wood. \\"Its location was carefully chosen to link two existing but much smaller woods, forming a continuous woodland which spans almost 13 hectares in total,\\" he said. \\"With hedgerows adjacent to the woodland edge, it'll enable wildlife to move through the landscape much more safely.\\" He added: \\"This really is an amazing woodland for the future.\\" The zoo's tree planting project contributed to Cheshire West and Chester's Nature Recovery Strategy, a plan to help wildlife thrive, improve the ecological network and target investment in nature in the region. Tree planting is a key part of the UK government's plan to combat climate change and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a target to plant 30,000 hectares of new woodland every year by 2025.!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I don't know about this case specifically but they're starting to say \\"baseless claims\\" and the like whenever he lies, basically anytime he speaks.

Even in FL which has a ton of people the state level Dem party leadership are horrible. I can't say some of the things I've seen over the last decade but you'd be shocked that a major \\"swing state\\" with a lot of electoral votes, tens of millions of registered voters, etc. were so poorly run. I assumed the state level leaders have people vetting candidates and ideas, a lot more people under them doing important things, and just far more control over stuff like the GOP has on point and vigorously exploit the extent of all rules. The Dems barely participate.As to the logistics of Dem/GOP voting fairness protocols, yes that was the same I saw repeatedly. During elections, I would go to county hq, get instructions and then a list of 5-6 precincts that I would visit ask questions of poll leaders, answer anything from them or the police on scene, provide answers, then go back to HQ make sure those assigned precincts got all their votes in properly and then that the counting process is properly staffed (which would be another dozen plus attorneys as well). I remember getting to HQ around 5:30AM and then leaving there around midnight and it was very physically draining. They officially paid me but where I'm usually billed at around $500/hr (not nearly the ballpark of what I actually earn) the $22.50/hr or whatever came in the mail a month latter was laughable. It's a \\"volunteer\\" position and I did it for the county supervisor who asked not because of the state party or anything and we're lucky our local election supervisor took a huge paycut and she's running against some crazy MAGA guy who claims he's going to fix all the voter fraud.","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"I think in acting, there is a world of difference between the top 5% and the top 1%, and then again another world of difference between the top 1% and the top 0.1%.

They may not be 'immortal giants of the silver screen', like Marlon Brando, Meryl Streep, or Jack Nicholson, but they still do **good** work.JG has a unique (!) screen presence, which is a tough feat to achieve. He has memorable performances, often with great comedic timing. He plays heroes and villains, as well as smart and stupid people alike, and yet he remains likeable and interesting in all roles. What does that make him if not a good actor? Consider an analogy. JRR Tolkien has only written fantasy fiction (and his academic work). He is not versatile like Shakespeare or Thomas Mann. He has never written a comedy or a theatre play. His poetry is mediocre at best, if I may say so, due to being incredibly (and deliberately) anachronistic. Does that make him a *bad* writer?

Climate Change:Quote: \\"Together, these form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity. This industrys mission emphasis on prediction and management seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.\\"Page: 675Explanation: This quote critiques the government and various industries involved in climate change initiatives. It suggests that the efforts to predict and manage climate change are based on the flawed assumption that these complex environmental issues can be controlled. The document sees this as damaging to the future economic prosperity of the U.S.Quote: \\"The Biden Administration has incorporated its radical climate policy into every USAID initiative...The aid industry claims that climate change causes poverty, which is false. Enduring conflict, government corruption, and bad economic policies are the main drivers of global poverty.\\"Page: 257-258Explanation: This passage criticizes the Biden Administrations approach to integrating climate change policy into global aid efforts through USAID. It challenges the idea that climate change is a primary cause of poverty, arguing instead that other factors like corruption and poor governance are the main contributors.2. National Weather Service (NWS):Quote: \\"The National Weather Service (NWS) provides data that private companies use and should focus on its data-gathering services. Because private companies rely on these data, the NWS should fully commercialize its forecasting operations.\\"Page: 675Explanation: This quote suggests that the NWS should shift its focus to gathering data and leave weather forecasting to private companies. It also calls for the NWS to commercialize its operations, implying that private-sector involvement would enhance efficiency and innovation in weather forecasting.Quote: \\"Review the Work of the National Hurricane Center and the National Environmental Satellite Service...Data continuity is an important issue in climate science.\\"Page: 676Explanation: This passage highlights the importance of reviewing the National Hurricane Center and satellite services in maintaining consistent and reliable data. Continuity of data is considered crucial for accurate climate science and forecasting.3. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):Quote: \\"FEMA is the lead federal agency in preparing for and responding to disasters, but it is overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\\"Page: 153-154Explanation: This quote points out that FEMA is stretched thin due to the high demand for its services and the insufficient disaster preparedness at state and local levels. As a result, the agency is often in debt, implying that FEMAs resources are being overused and that state and local governments need to take on more responsibility.Quote: \\"Under the Stafford Act, FEMA has the authority to adjust the per capita indicator for damages, which creates a threshold under which states and localities are not eligible for public assistance.\\"Page: 154Explanation: This quote refers to FEMAs authority under the Stafford Act to set damage thresholds that determine whether states and localities qualify for federal disaster aid. By adjusting the per capita indicator, FEMA can manage the distribution of resources more effectively and ensure that only those in greatest need receive assistance.","title":"Biden angrily responds to Trump on hurricane response"},{"text":"Great drawing, and so chillingly accurate.","title":"Do You Want a President J.D.

If they could it'd be like a ballot or two.\\nThe problem would be in any polling place that by demographics, coincidence, or scheming had only MAGA poll workers. It'd still be hard because the votes themselves are in the machine AND on the paper ballots but humans are sneaky.\\nThe other problem I noticed - and this is a real, actual concern that needs to be addressed - is polling places political representatives. They're supposed to have an official representative from the Democrats and Republicans working the polls. When ANYTHING out of the ordinary happens, especially a poll worker handling a ballot, both representatives are supposed to supervise it, or the representatives have to work together where one does the thing and the other representative watches. The assumption of course is that the representative of one party is extremely motivated to make sure the other party doesn't cheat.\\nThe only thing was there was ZERO *anything* to ensure the \\"Official Party Representative\\" was even a member of that party, let alone official in any capacity, and a big part of that failure falls on the parties themselves for not arranging them, especially at \\"contentious\\" polling places.\\nI know this part of the system can easily be abused because when the Official Party Representatives had to Officially certify themselves and their commitment to their position, they had gathered everyone around and asked who would be the Democrat Official Pary Representative. Well I was the only Democratic poll worker so guess who the Official Dem Rep was. Thing is I'm registered as a Republican. \\nSo that part of the system where the party representatives are responsible for supervising the other part representative could be totally nullified by a bad actor being designed the official Representative of the opposite party. But the party allows this shit by NOT arranging Official Representative poll workers.\\nI don't remember what exactly I was responsible for at the end of the day (I was absolutely goddam WRECKED. The other poll workers were all 95 and they were as fresh as if they'd just had their morning coffee. It was bullshit.) but as the official Dem rep I had to supervise and sign off on the tally and correct procedure of a decent few things (which I wasn't necessarily ever trained on) that involved all the votes and that's definitely a big weak spot in the system.\\nIt's important we have Dem poll workers, especially in rural and diverse polling stations where the workers might otherwise be all MAGA.","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"Certainly true with regards to those in power right now, sad part is people wont realize Harris is a complete fraud until like 5-6 months after the election if she wins when we kept screaming dont be under any illusions about her, Trump worse or not, and the media is lying to you about her like they did with Biden in 20.","title":"Feels like this is getting buried, but a founding trustee of the Heritage Foundation, the same Heritage Foundation that concocted Project 2025, endorsed Kamala Harris recently"},{"text":"Biden should have given Trump grief for doing that.

She's also going to lose the sun belt, and at least Michigan. Her odds of winning are infinitesimally small given all of the escalating crises she owns along with Biden.

But I don't see your numbers as being accurate at all.Her polling is nowhere near Biden's.  Real Clear Politics, on the day when Biden dropped out:  [https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden#polls](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden#polls)Trump had an average 3.1 point lead:  Average 5.8 lead in AZ, 5.6 lead in NV, 2.9 lead in WI, 2.1 lead in MI, 4.5 lead in PA, 5.4 lead in NC and 3.8 lead in GA.  This was (at the time) the 5-way, and it's almost impossible to think that RFK later endorsing Trump would have helped these numbers for Biden.Today's RCP polling:  Trump up an avg. of 2.0 in AZ, Harris by 1.3 in NV, Harris by 0.8 in WI, Harris by 1.4 in MI, Trump by 0.2 in PA, Trump by 0.6 in NC and Trump by 1.4 in GA.So Harris has gained 3.8 points in Arizona over Biden, 6.9 points (!!!) in Nevada, 3.7 points in Wisconsin, 3.5 in Michigan, 4.3 points in Pennsylvania, 4.8 points in North Carolina and 2.4 points in Georgia, and that's despite Kennedy giving Trump whatever bump he gave him.  I'm not sure what the margin of error is in some of these states, but raising the AVERAGE POLLING by 3.8, 6.9, 3.7, 3.5, 4.3, 4.8 and 2.4 points is pretty massive when the last two elections came down to a few thousand votes in a few states.Also, the trajectory of Trump and Harris seems to largely be \\"neck and neck\\" after she gained enough ground to tie him.  The trajectory of Biden's last month was \\"trickling negative\\" in state after state, with no positive forward momentum at all.  He hadn't risen above 39% in approval rating in the last 9 months of his campaign, and that's an awful rating.  Harris is at 48.3 (to 48.0 negative), making her only one three current national politicians in the country with an above-water approval rating, the others being Bernie and....Tim Walz.  So yeah.  A polling error in Trump's favor and he probably wins all 7 swing states.  There's reason to believe this may happen, because it happened in 2016 and 2020, but Dems have also outperformed some polls in recent years in non-presidential elections.  There's no reason to definitely bake in a polling error that definitely will help Trump.The war could hurt her.  The strike could hurt her.  Republicans pulling their money out of the lose-cause Robinson race in NC could help her.  Biden is already so unpopular with his Israel policy that there might not be any further he can fall, so that might not hurt her.  To the extent that I think Trump is the favorite, it is like 55-45 or 60-40, and could definitely change.  It's nowhere near a certainty.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is going to lose the 2024 election"},{"text":"That tag would be on just about every posting","title":"Kemp praises Bidens Hurricane Helene response amid Trump criticism"},{"text":"So what, Trump will just claim 10 million people cross the border every hour, and nobody will question it","title":"Migrant border crossings at lowest level in four years in boost to Kamala Harris"},{"text":"They have a patch on their uniforms which has a map of Israel that covers a lot of other territories.

The latest figures show the lowest number of crossings since 2020.Illegal migration has become a significant dividing line between Ms Harris and Donald Trump, who has pledged to immediately deport up to a million people if he wins the presidency on Nov 5.Ms Harris, who was once asked by Mr Biden to handle border control, has struggled to convince voters she has a plan to bring the numbers down. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have talked extensively about border control on the campaign trail.The figures came as the Biden administration said it was making asylum restrictions at the southern border tougher again.The new rules, which toughen the June restrictions, say the number of migrants trying to cross the border must be lower than 1,500 for more than a month before new asylum applications will be accepted.The government is also counting all children towards that number for the first time. Previously,?only Mexican children?were included in the figures. The new rules come into force on Tuesday.On Friday, Ms Harris visited the border for the first time since she began her campaign when Mr Biden dropped out of the race in July.**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/01/migrant-border-crossings-lowest-four-years-kamala-harris/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/01/migrant-border-crossings-lowest-four-years-kamala-harris/)","title":"Migrant border crossings at lowest level in four years in boost to Kamala Harris"},{"text":"And they had to actually distribute less to the people and shut down some distribution sites temporarily.Yet another case of Trump making things worse age taking credit for those who are actually doing the work.

Then the take over of the Republican Party by the far right, and really pushing their propaganda, and Fox over the last couple decades positioning themselves as basically the only source a huge portion of republicans considered conservative news, giving fox the ability to largely dictate the narrative of things to them, which is fear and paranoia of the left. The poorly educated believe the propaganda and see trump as a hero fighting the deep state and the communists that want to ruin the country, the religious conservatives vote for him because even if he isnt a good Christian person he has followed through on overturning Roe V wade and fighting liberalism.

But it does mean this \\"vote Democrat so fewer people get hurt\\" line of thinking is not based on facts or evidence, and only makes sense within a western supremacist worldview which does not consider non-western lives to have equal value to western lives. If you don't have such a worldview it's immediately clear that there's no evidence-based reason to believe voting Democrat leads to a reduction of harm throughout the world.There's not actually any way to know which presidential candidate would do more harm if elected, because they're both so obscenely awful and murderous and there's no way to predict how their awful murderousness will manifest in foreign policy during their time in office. All you can do is draw an imaginary line between \\"foreign policy\\" and \\"domestic policy\\" and compartmentalize the two away from each other, and then say \\"well this candidate makes my feelings feel nicer on domestic policy so they are therefore better\\" while ignoring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the abusiveness of US presidents happens outside the borders of the United States.The real harm reduction would entail ending the systems which make you choose between two murderous warmongers, and it would entail dismantling the US empire itself.

And off topic, theres so many local private pilots risking their lives and equipment to help airdrop supplies to these folks. FEMA showed up this morning.

Head of DHS has been involved and monitoring. Biden comes Wednesday. Blackhawks were dispatched day 1 to rescue people stuck on roofs.  Local communities have sent in tons and tons of donations and resources and thousands of volunteers have stood up. Appalachia folk are strong-headed. We will help one another and get past this.

I don't know for sure about this bill as much as previous bills, but the majority of the money doesn't go to the country but to pay for the arms sent to the country.  For example in Ukraine provided arms and vehicles otherwise set to be decommissioned or disposed of and sending it to Ukraine actually saved the US taxpayer money because it is expensive to decommission explosives.The rest goes to the MIC for factory upgrades (to produce more shells which we need even if we didn't send some from old stockpiles) or new weapons to replace old ones (like ATACMS is being replaced by PSM and the ones sent are old shorter range ones the US doesn't really use anymore).In Israel, well most of that is just paying for weapons they use, but I am less versed in the bill specifics.  Like I said in the past the US pays for supplies/vehicles to the US MIC and then gives it to Israel and there may be some technology transfer in exchange, however, I don't think that is true and the US is in a large aid deficit to Israel.There is a bit of info/reasons why the US does this and how it can make sense from a certain point of view (aid is an extension of US foreign diplomacy and economic/military blackmail), but is beyond the reason for this post.On the Tennessee NG deployed to the ME, I don't know the specifics on this case, however deployments are decided many months before actual deployment.  While it doesn't look good for them to be sent in the event of a natural disaster, but it wasn't decided after (only to follow through).  Also, I doubt 700 soldiers represent a large percentage NG in TN and they are under the command of the Governor until being turned over to feds when they deploy.","title":"Just in the past 7 days.."},{"text":"You're right, they think it's communism ?? ?? ??","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Remarks on Federal Response to Hurricane Helene Before a White House Press Briefing"},{"text":"Is this the wife that was also his cousin?","title":"Rudy Giuliani's daughter Caroline endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Having incompetent enemies is so sweet sometimes.

There is no \\"the system\\" here, I'm just talking about specific systems that I've mentioned and the ways in which racist individuals can implement their racism in policy, covertly, within each of these systems. It looks different depending on which system you're looking at. For example, medical students are not taught in medical schools how to treat black skin differently from white skin. For example, a Pulse Oximeter isn't going to get a good reading on dark skin, so you need to use other means of measuring that patient's SpO2 levels. Since medical students, nursing students, etc. aren't taught about this, black patients are negatively impacted as a result. That's the whole system of medical school that needs revamping to include people of all skin tones, as opposed to teaching that \\"white skin is the default and you don't really need to know about anything else\\".","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"So what you're saying is that she's consistently been opposed to the harm caused by conservative policies and rhetoric for her entire adult life.","title":"Rudy Giuliani's daughter Caroline endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Yeah, I'm talking about tying that bullshit in with today's lie about Biden, as the prior commenter brought up.","title":"Kemp praises Bidens Hurricane Helene response amid Trump criticism"},{"text":"Go read the top comment.","title":"Democrats Sue Over Georgia Requirement That Ballots Be Counted by Hand"},{"text":"This dumb moron don't realize when making these false claims, it's pure Projection, want to know Trump listen to his jabs at his enemies.

We've had decades of increasing pressure for schools to admit and employers to hire \\"diversity candidates\\" to counteract that alleged tendency to disqualify blacks just for being black.  It spread everywhere.  Every college and virtually every employer adopted diversity policies and hired executives to ensure that blacks got at least an extra nudge and often benefitted from quotas that earmarked a certain number of seats for them.We've been at this long enough to observe some results.  We damaged the mental health of a lot of black kids by admitting them into schools where they weren't qualified, causing events like the Evergreen takeover.  Simultaneously we've denied Asian kids with much higher test scores.  And we've allowed schools cover to run big legacy admission programs, making sure dull kids of wealthy alumni get admitted.We've forced black professionals to build their careers under a shadow of suspicion that they didn't really earn their positions.  Even as we've demanded companies hire diversity candidates, no one wants to be thought of as a diversity hire, for good reasons.It happens that our institutions are for a variety of reasons suffering a competence crisis.  When doors fly off planes, inevitably one of the usual suspects is too big a commitment to \\"diversity\\" and not enough to tightening bolts.

The bible shows that there is \\"the good\\" which is determined by who God is (not simply by what he decides).? But this good is applied differently depending on the surrounding context. That's why Moses gave the law twice: one in Exodus as the people go through the wilderness, one in Deuteronomy as they're about to enter and settle in Canaan. The second revision has alterations from the first to suit the new situation. Jesus himself also makes this idea clear a number of times. For instance, some Jews thought it was ok to divorce their wives for any reason, Jesus says the Jews' law for divorce was given because of their hard hearts, but that marriage was not actually designed to ever break; the law was given as a consolation, but the actual \\"good\\" is different to the consolation.\\n I used these scriptural examples to make the case that porn is no more obscene than the Bible. If porn ought to be banned because it is obscene and promotes moral degradation, then the same applies to the Bible.\\nI take your point here, but the difference is in the motive.

And frankly, Ive seen those users recoil at a lot of aspects of the current government and realize as well that Poilievre is certainly not our Trump. I and a few other users have also come back to challenge some misinformation being spread by the aforementioned partisan users.?As a result of this, Ive had 5 people block me. One of them tried to explain that Chrystia Freeland has balanced the budget every year since 2015 and that they only chose to spend in excess after achieving balance. Yes, you read that correctly.

I remember graduating college at that time, and I was lucky to have a job as a cashier at a grocery store. Are houses and rent expensive?

It was rough and people had to \\"start over\\", not getting back to more stability for years.Everyone who seriously thinks back to 2008, and then we say a worldwide pandemic that shut down the globe, jacking up every supply chain, and killing over 1 million Americans is coming.
