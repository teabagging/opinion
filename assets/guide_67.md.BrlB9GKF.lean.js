Then they say to get rid of fractional reserve banking laws, which are the actual laws that limit that.See how it really works is that if you put $1 million in deposits, then the bank can lend out that $1 million. So they *did* only lend it out once. But then, what does the person who received the loan do? they're not walking out with a suitcase of money, they ... deposit it in a bank account ... so now there are $2 million in deposits in the system, but only $1 million in loans, so that means there's an extra $1 million to be loaned out, and you still have more deposits than loans. If you do it this way, the same $1 million goes around and around, and can in principle generate *infinity* dollars in loans and deposits. A fractional reserve law states than you can only lend out some amount less than the deposit, so for example a 10% fractional reserve requirement means you can accept the $1 million but only loan out $900,000 against it. A 10% fractional reserve law means each $1 deposit can generate up to $10, due to the math of geometric series. The reserve law is actually the only thing preventing banks from just minting infinity dollars. So rather than saying \\"they should only allow each dollar to be loaned out once! Get rid of fractional reserve banking!\\" they should be arguing for a higher reserve requirement. But that would cause a very rapid contraction in the amount of money in the system, so i'm sure it's not something you'd want to just push a button on.","title":"Trump threatens 100% tariff on the BRIC bloc of nations if they act to undermine US dollar"},{"text":"That was always allowed.","title":"Liberals are Getting Vasectomies in Record Numbers After Trump's Victory"},{"text":"Not shocked.

Given they campaigned on \\"Biden's failing economy,\\" spending like drunken sailors is not what a fiscal conservative does. Ultimately the cries of \\"hypocrites\\" are just brushed of as rhetoric, but if the new administration thinks it has a blank check, they are mistaken.And luckily, the GOP majority in the House has ended up being razor thin. They can only afford to lose one vote to get anything passed into law.Gridlock may save us.The Pentagon does not operate the Armed Forces at the behest of the President. Generals can refuse orders they find to be criminal or illegal if they choose. There is no real precedent for a General taking flak for refusing to carry out orders. In this way, the Armed Forces will not be employed by Trump as domestic law enforcement (that includes the Army Corps of Engineers). Using them as such is also unconstitutional. Even if Trump declares a National Emergency in an attempt to take direct control of the National Guard, they are a state entity, not a Federal one. States can refuse, or sue.When Trump says he'll \\"cut funding for states that don't cooperate,\\" good luck with getting that done. States will sue, and rightfully so, with a solid case for exclusivity and abuse of power.As with every Administration that comes to D.C. to \\"change the system,\\" this one will find out very quickly that they are in over their heads, and lack the competency to even set wheels in motion that won't be met with competently staged lawsuits by competent lawyers. Given Trumps usual tactic of \\"stall stall stall, by any means necessary,\\" again; gridlock.If Trump really tries an outright coup of some kind, or a Tonkin Gulf type event to give him cause to take extreme action, the Pentagon leadership is obligated to protect the Constitution, not the President. He will not get far. The Pentagon actually has a blank check, and they don't want to lose it.With all of this to consider, also remember that even a strict reading of the Constitution by SCOTUS does not side with Trump's vision of consolidating Executive power. The three branches are equal and check each other. SCOTUS has ruled against him and his plans before. They will continue to do their duty, which is solely to determine if something is Constitutional or not.It doesn't matter if every MAGA throws a hissy fit, or even assaults the Capital again; illegal is illegal -- gridlock is representation stalling the legislative process through disagreement among themselves (and yes, even with a majority, the GOP has been a herd of cats the past 40 years, with very passionate factions tripping over their own dicks). Trump can do nothing about Congress, or SCOTUS slowing the pace; or stopping outright, his extreme plans -- Just like any other preceding administration.","title":"The Future of the Executive Branch | The Trump administration has plans to overhaul the federal governmentbut how will the president-elect and his allies actually bring about this radical change?"},{"text":"No, hes Prime Minister until at least the next election.","title":"Trump has dinner with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"**Musk:**  *We must make it unacceptable to not have childrenAlso Musk:** *Our policies are going to create financial hardship for America.

Which is why BRICS started this.","title":"Trump threatening economic war against BRICS, directly challenging Putin's ambitions"},{"text":"Another fun story about the Danish resistance:Early in the war, Niels Bohr (who had previously sounded the alarm about the Germans' interest in atomic power) was still living in Copenhagen, running his institute, even though it was already occupied by the Germans. The resistance tipped him off that the Germans were planning to arrest him soon, so he decided it was time to skip.The resistance smuggled him out of Copenhagen and got him on a small plane where they flew him to neutral territory. From there he made his way to the US. He had with him a bottle of heavy water that he had painstakingly collected. He didn't want this to fall into German hands, because heavy water is incredibly rare and difficult to obtain in significant quantity, and it can be used to help refine weapons-grade Uranium.When he reached safety, he realized that he had screwed up. The bottle he was carefully transporting across multiple continents was not, in fact, heavy water, but a bottle of beer.Realizing his mistake, and knowing that he couldn't let the Germans get their hands on his bottle of heavy water, he got a message back to the Danish resistance. They broke into his house, retrieved the bottle (the right one this time) and had it transported to Bohr in the US.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 30, 2024"},{"text":"This shit will undo them","title":"Meta AI BiasThey hate us cause they aint us."},{"text":"And Dem Colleagues play at going high when they go low, still.

The horror.The right also ran for years on shes too naive to make a difference. Sure she has ideas and cares about people, but nothing she wants to do is achievable. Like, how dare she try to help everyday Americans or make an impact on climate change. Honestly I think it just shows theyre so fucking scared of her and what she can do. Shes truly authentic and consistently promotes legislation that can positively impact everyday Americans. I hope she leads the Democratic Party. She truly is the next generation of political leaders if Nancy and the old guard could just gracefully step aside for even a minute to let these other legislators shine.Also looking at Jasmine Crockett and Hakeem Jeffries.

It also has a statorory process to follow which takes about a year and is subject to judicial review.The two emergency routes either require a declaration of war against Canada or a declared state of emergency which then requires congress to confirm the tariff within 90 days (inaction blocks it). by the DOC, rightCBP. DOC publishes the schedule to CBP. He is going to have them very busy with both mass deportations and tariffs.","title":"Canadian team told Trump's tariffs unavoidable in short term in surprise Mar-a-Lago meeting"},{"text":"politically, he (his handlers) felt he needed to push the idea of a \\"vaccine\\", but I never recall him forcing mandates for anyone to take them. he actually told people about Ivermectin, HCQ, Fenben &amp; Zinc treatments.this way, he left it in the hands of THE PEOPLE to either take the \\"political\\" vaccine or the tried &amp; true methods of the treatments mentioned above.as i've said in other posts about this, Trump was trying to play both sides, for politics, optics, whatever you want to call it.the people that were going to take the poison jabs were always going to take them &amp; those of us that were never going to, never were going to take them, no matter who told us to.

Orange man a racist and a dictator for wanting them to jab, mask and do lockdowns.2. Get the Democrat candidate into office and low and behold! Liberals are fully on-board. Not only that, liberals were weaponized. Their ability to collectively protest and display righteous indignation dwarfs anything conservatives could ever hope to muster. Now, it no longer \\"your body your choice\\". Now it's you should lose your ability to work, privilege to travel, and you should cease to exist if you don't get vaxxed and wear your F'n mask! There is some PTSD associated with all that. Living overseas, it seems like the masses are ready to snap in line for the next go-around.3. Liberals were not bothered one bit that the Country would seem to be on auto-pilot if the office of President was so important to cause the meltdowns it caused when Trump was put into office. Completely blind to the Biden character being just about completely incapacitated. Conservatives were given a pillow they could punch and make fun of for 4 years. It almost seemed like it was a psyop to see how blind to the obvious bs they could make at least 50% of the US. I remember when MSM lost their shit for days when Trump had a small stumble once down a inclined walkway. Liberals got right in line and parroted the MSM line.

Until this year.??Callahan, 67, cast his ballot for President-elect Donald Trump because of concerns about rising costs of living and fears that Democratic leaders didnt have a plan to fix the economy.?A longtime resident of Lynn, a suburb just four miles north of the liberal enclave of Boston, Callahan said he isnt sure whether Trumps policy proposals will lower prices at the pump, or in the grocery aisle. But hes hopeful the former president will at least make a change.Everything was too expensive. What we had wasnt working, Callahan said, as he stood on a cracked sidewalk lining a row of local take-out restaurants and convenience stores in the suburbs downtown.As the dust of the 2024 election settles, the rightward bent of voters like Callahan in historically liberal-leaning states has laid bare the sweeping nature of the Democratic Partys problems with its once trusty base of working-class voters.?Those challenges, felt predominately in the blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan in Pennsylvania after the 2016 election, have now emerged in hundreds of former union and Democratic strongholds across the country, even in places like deep-blue Massachusetts.\\"This is the opening bit of the article, and it's pretty weird that, while the article talks about Dems losing the \\"working class\\", it starts out talking to a guy who lives in some suburb outside of Boston and tells us exactly nothing about him...including whether he is even working class, or what the article understands \\"working class\\" to be.They never fill in any details about this guy later in the article, either. They never come back to him. They do mention this brief bit about Lynn, MA:\\"Lynn saw a more than 11% increase in support for Trump. Roughly 15% of people in the 101,000-person city have a college degree, significantly less than the 48% of people across the whole state who hold a bachelors degree or higher. \\"Are we supposed to assume this guy is working class purely because of where he lives (ie a suburb outside a city)? Because there are *lots* of ways a suburbanite might not be working class.Are we to assume that \\"working class\\" means simply that a person didn't go to college? Did this guy not go to college? He lives in a place that has low college graduation rates, but they don't say whether he did. Also, whether or not you went to college has *nothing* to do with being working class -- a lot of local business owners don't have college degrees, for instance.The problem with this is that I do agree the Dems have problems attracting the working class...but *I* understand \\"working class\\" to be people who get the majority of their income from selling their labor. It has nothing to do with whether they did or did not go to college, or where they live.And if the Dems and their sympathetic media hear the term \\"working class\\" and interpret it to mean \\"suburbanites without college degrees\\", they are going to learn the exact wrong lessons.Because a lot of \\"suburbanites without college degrees\\" are actually rich boomers in McMansions living off pensions from unions they are actively undermining and/or the sale of houses at fortuitous times during the market/rental income and/or small business owners (landscaping companies, car dealerships, etc).?And there's nothing working class about them -- they make their money by owning things, not selling their labor, and their material incentives are in direct *opposition* to the much more numerous people who *do* sell their labor. They are *owners*, not workers.And focusing more on accommodating them is the *opposite* of \\"embracing the working class\\".This is a disturbing sign that the Dems have so thoroughly forgotten the material working class that they don't even know who they are, and don't even talk to them.","title":"Democrats lost working-class voters to Trump D even in this blue bastion"},{"text":"There 100% is a fertility crisis.

If we bring manufacturing back here, we incentivize it, we create jobs and increase labor participation. Or if our people are too stupid and lazy to work, which is the globalist's position, we promote *legal* immigration and tax their earnings like is designed.","title":"Trudeau Flies to Mar-a-Lago to See Trump Amid Tariff Concerns"},{"text":"Say you give a nine-year-old boy a nerf gun and tell him to not shoot it at your face (spoiler: he will anyway).

I think goal is to do this via legal means. But I think some backup solutions exist as well. For example the early election victory speech where Trump says he's going to send troops to South America to fight cartels. This gives Trump the mandate to mobilize troops within the US.  He may or may not use these troops to raid  California tech companies should court proceeding drag on for too long.  While extreme , the threat alone can expedite the legal proceedings. Focus right now for tech companies would be to  destroy as much electronic evidence as possible , in case things turn sour.Thats what I would do.

Any bets?"},{"text":"As a trans woman I wanted us to frame the issue as something medical and that we simply need to be able to get treatment so we can coexist with everyone else somewhat normally. Unfortunately the approach by some seemed \\"all or nothing\\" in that they wanted to push for trans women in sports even though it was super controversial. The bathroom thing also kind of rubbed people the wrong way - if we wouldn't have said anything about it and not brought it up I don't think it wouldve been a problem. Just look and dress the part, get hormones, invest in surgeries, work for the thing you're after so you can fit in seamlessly instead of disruptively. Then use the bathroom when you have too. In four years I pass pretty well if i wear the right clothes and no one bats and eye when I use the bathroom.People didn't really want to compromise on it or attempt to frame it as what I believe it to be: a hormone and identity issue that required work and patience to fix. People have changed their gender for a while now, but only recently has it caused people to target us. Why? Because certain people were too outspoken about it and too aggressive. Rightwing fascist pundants like Shapiro used these as ammunition to convince regular conservatives and even some liberals that all trans people are evil or ridiculous. Now people are calling for us to be killed or detained or have our medication made illegal like in Russia.I've worked tirelessly on my transition and Ive been kicked out of lgbt circles for expressing these opinions. The fact is, by trying to bring attention to the issue and presenting people who haven't worked that hard on passing as our spokespeople, they created a general perspective of trans people as irrational by giving the far right ammunition. Maybe if we simply wouldn't have engaged in such an outspoken position and just ignored it all, simply tried to remain hidden and/or willing to coexist and harmonize with society it would have made right wingers look insane for attacking transgender people.Many transgender people in my opinion need to work on their foundations as individuals such as health, finances, work, relationships etc before diving into transitioning. Transitioning is a lot of work and to do it well you have to get surgeries, especially on your face. Unfortunately, many people have unrealistic expectations and can't handle the work load of all of these things. So when they look overweight and masculine with a beard shadow how can they begin to expect to be treated as a woman? I know it's crushing to be misgendered when you think youre passing, but you have to take it on the chin and just realize you aren't where you want to be yet.Lastly, trans people can exist in somewhat conservative spaces like churches or certain hobby communities. I have done it and, after some time, I earned their respect and they gender me correctly. Never once have I ever corrected one of them when they misgendered me in the beginning. I simply showed them my best self and they began to see me for me. I know its hard, but the path forward is through hard work - not just on your transition - but the foundation of who you are. I have issues like everyone else, one can argue my issues (not related to transitioning) are far harder than most other people given the situation I am in. I break down often and I feel somewhat cheated that other people who are less qualified have attempted to speak for me about who I am as a trans woman. I wish to heaven we could just be left the hell alone. I wish this wasn't an issue and that more right wingers could simply see what we deal with as a hormonal medical problem that we are doing our best to navigate to reduce suffering and so also we can feel connected to others as who we really are. But we will not get there by screaming at others to call us by our preferred pronouns - we have to *show* them that we deserve them by our actions.I feel betrayed in a way by a lot of people who are democrats. I feel really let down by them. Quite frankly I don't respect the leadership of the party in the slightest (except for Pete buttigeg). They let everyone down by trying to win through being more passive and \\"honorable\\". Their entire strategy was to sound bite Republican officials for saying controversial things when all that did was give them more publicity.We need to pass more. We need to focus on passing more and looking attractive. It needs to be you can just look at one of us and be like \\"yeah that's definitely a woman\\". That should be our goals, not forcefully shoving someone born as male into a womens swimming league. What was the fucking point? You can still participate in swimming: coed marathon swimming, coaching, personal training, blogging, making videos. You don't have to give up swimming, you don't have to give up who you are. But that really turned people off - it turned me off and I know these issues on a deep personal level.","title":"Sanders Says There Is No Choice: 'We Must Defeat the Oligarchs' | \\nThe U.S. Senator from Vermont is asking big questions about how to achieveeven in the face of Trump's returnan \\"economy and government that works for all, not just the few.\\""},{"text":"You missed the /s twice dog...","title":"Trump picks hardline loyalist Kash Patel to head FBI"},{"text":"Dems must get younger and much more aggressive","title":"Trump official says do not underestimate AOC as some insiders push for her to lead Democrats"},{"text":" Patel once proposed closing the FBI headquarters and reopening it as a \\"museum of the deep state.\\" In case anyone doubts you, here's the video:https://x.com/shawnryanshow/status/1858955333533921459?s=46","title":"Why Kash Patel May Be Trumps Scariest Pick Yet"},{"text":"Spending quality time with his couch.","title":"Where is JD Vance?"},{"text":"Nope.

But calling whatever it does as 'fervent religious nationalism' is ignorance at its best since history often answers why the nation is like it is today.I am using the US as an analogy since most of this subreddit contains US citizens. Imagine 25% of the US population is made up of non-Christians. (I may specifically use Muslims for historical accuracy but I won't because I am trying to identify the problem beyond one specific religion). Now they became the part of the US society in whatever manner you can think of (Forced/at will/coerced). They begin destroying everything that was once a part/identity of the US all the while establishing themselves as the new Natives. You live with them, deal business with them and share everything that is common with them but at one random point they decide to chip away the common territory on the basis of their own religion (mind, one of the most fertile/economically productive regions). Hypothetically the whole Midwest into a separate country. But not all non-Christians go into the new country. Some do remain back and are now 15% of the new US demographics. Owing to the past these are now given special civil laws and separate legislation based on their religion. And although most of them are trying to lead honest lives, some of them are involved in truly nefarious activities trying to chip away even more parts away or worst case scenario openly calling for the MidWest to take over the remaining US. This may be the loud minority but the majority non-Christians are just silent and letting it happen for decades. Then comes a party (be it Democratic or Republican, doesn't matter) which basically says let us focus on the US first, and people who feel wronged all these years elect them successively for multiple elections (although the strength wanes, because that is not the only thing they want)Now let's come to REALITY. None of this happened and there is no credible threat to the US based on any religion.  Yet the US actually voted in for Christian Nationalism. In Majority. Identity politics happens from time to time across different cultures. If your whole identity is threatened (real as in India's history/Imaginary as in US) People come out to protect it somehow. When other countries make their culture/language/tribes as its identity, India makes its religion its identity. Because it is diverse enough in all those other attributes. It is ignorance if not disingenuity to reduce it to religious nationalism.

On this front, Trump has two major things in mind, Dan Balz explained last night: transforming how the executive branch works and significantly cutting spending across various federal agencies. He has his eyes on trying to radically transform the executive branch  in a way he was never able to do in his first term, Balz said. He sees the executive branch as resistance rather than being part of his team.This discussion is worth watching (or for readers out there reading the transcript) to see this particular piece of prognostication on the near future of governance with the new president and administration.One comment from Jonathan Karl:I think if you look at what Trump is doing here in his -- arranging his White House staff and his cabinet, is he wants to have people and he is going to have people who he truly knows and who are personally loyal to him. What does he not want to do? He doesn't want to have a Jeff Sessions or a Bill Barr or a Jim Mattis or a John Kelly anymore in his cabinet.These were people who, you know, he believes got in his way, ended up, you know, being harshly critical of him, but more importantly stood in the way of what he wanted to do. I mean, Jeff Sessions allowed the Mueller investigation to go forward by recusing himself from that. Bill Barr refused to use the Department of Justice to help him in the bid to overturn the election. Those were his two confirmed attorneys general. Now he has Pam Bondi who was there on the campaign trail with him, and who was there with him, trying to challenge the election results four years ago.It's already pretty evident through who he's looking to nominate for key positions in the administration that the president-elect is looking more for personal loyalty to him than for any kind of expertise or knowledge about what it is they are going to be working with. Though unsurprising, this will still present challenges to how the government functions.","title":"The Future of the Executive Branch | The Trump administration has plans to overhaul the federal governmentbut how will the president-elect and his allies actually bring about this radical change?"},{"text":"Chris Wray could've done so much more to fight against the insidious cultism of Trump's Republican Party.

They've been threatening to do this out in the open. And this agenda is already underway. A potent combination of a unitary executive, broad immunities for the president, executive actions like schedule F, and a MAGA coalition of loyalists that will consolidate power by exploiting Trump's ego to take control of the administrative state and pave the way for a future one party system of government with King Trump at its head.And almost every Trump appointee so far has been picked to help implement this agenda, each one representing a transaction. \\"What have you done for me, and what will you do for me in exchange for this position?\\" They've exchanged their loyalty for a spot within his administration where they can do the most damage.This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been calling a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025. It attempts to strip protections from civil servants whose government positions will depend largely on their allegiance to the president and his agenda. Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will afford Republicans the power to cripple the system of checks and balances holding our democracy together, helping them to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.Project 2025 laid it all out in their manifesto, while heritage foundation members and \\"America first\\" Trump allies have been preparing for this eventuality. People who have already been appointed to positions of power within Trump's new admin.The Unitary executive Theory is another major goal of project 2025, and a proposal that's been floated before by Republicans. Bill Barr was a major proponent, and it's part of the reason why he shot down the Mueller investigations efforts to hold Trump accountable for obstruction. The UET proposes that the president has unchecked powers and complete control over the executive branch.The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive, crippling the separation of powers in the process and giving Trump unilateral authority over the administrative state. These actions will allow The Trump administration to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan civil servants, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field, whose job security didn't previously depend on their loyalty to the president. And come next year, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in years to see this agenda through because they'll have a Trump administration with unchecked powers, a Republican majority in both houses, and a conservative SCOTUS.It might seem a little confusing because part of their goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, and includes every government agency you can think of that's responsible for running and regulating day to day operations in this country.However, the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power for itself and installs Trump as king and useful idiot in chief.Hence, a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"The next Trump administration is also preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a top role in these agencies.From this standpoint, they'll have the perfect opportunity to implement an authoritarian, far right agenda backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists...This is an agenda that will also pave the way for future Republican administrations to continue building a one party system of government, while setting up roadblocks for any progressive, or even populist efforts or movements that may take hold in the future. Because make no mistake, this ain't populism, it more closely resembles an age of modern day robber barons working closely with politicians, or vice versa. Hell, in some cases, they're basically synonymous.Laurence W. Britt, who published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, made a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism.

That's connected to the U.S. dollar as for trade: it makes things the U.S. wants to buy cheap and what it can sell too expensive.To make up for that, the U.S. has been taking on increasing debt since the 1980s. It can do that because the demand for the dollar is high, and it needs to take on more debt to spend more.Meanwhile, the same countries have become richer because they were selling to the U.S. and saving. And because the U.S. has been using its military and financial \\"aid\\" to coerce them and keep them weak, they've been trying to move away from the dollar.Given that, Trump has put in tariffs for several reasons: to threaten these countries who earn by selling to the U.S. while offering tax cuts to the public. In short, he's moving from an income tax to a consumption tax regime, which means more income and less spending.But to earn more the U.S. has to sell more to other countries than it buys, which is something it hasn't done since the 1970s.

Here are five detrimental effects:1. Lack of Competence\\t?\\tLoyalists may lack the necessary expertise and experience to effectively manage their responsibilities. This can lead to poor decision-making, inefficiency, and suboptimal outcomes in critical areas such as policy development and implementation.2. Echo Chambers\\t?\\tA cabinet filled with loyalists may discourage diverse viewpoints and constructive dissent. This creates an echo chamber, where only agreeable ideas are entertained, potentially leading to groupthink and flawed decisions.3. Erosion of Public Trust\\t?\\tAppointing loyalists over qualified candidates can be perceived as prioritizing personal allegiance over merit, leading to accusations of favoritism or nepotism. This undermines public confidence in the administrations integrity and fairness.4. Poor Crisis Management\\t?\\tIn times of crisis, unqualified loyalists may lack the skills to handle complex and high-pressure situations effectively, leading to delayed or inadequate responses that could exacerbate problems.5. Reduced Long-Term Success\\t?\\tPolicies and initiatives may fail to achieve their goals due to a lack of expertise, resulting in wasted resources and missed opportunities. Over time, this can harm the administrations legacy and the welfare of the population it serves.Balancing loyalty and competence is essential to building a strong and effective cabinet that can navigate challenges and deliver results.","title":"Trump picks hardline loyalist Kash Patel to head FBI"},{"text":"I never said anything about my family.

So trade volume will get reduced, which isn't good for a heavily export-oriented economy like China. If tariffs are used the way they were originally intended, that would benefit either domestic producers or favored countries that are not subjected to high tariffs. Russia and India probably don't care; I don't think India exports much to the US compared to the size of its economy, and Russia (at least for now) is so heavily sanctioned that it exports even less. One problem is, there's no one else to pick up the lost trade volume from China, so some things might just get ridiculously expensive. Another problem is, at some level of attempted bullying China will decide that their national sovereignty (such as the ability to decide which currency to use for trade with third parties) and pride is worth the economic hit and that they can just as well try to sell their stuff to the rest of the world and don't absolutely need the American market.","title":"Trump on BRICS"},{"text":"Honestly?

Basically, when Ireland left the United Kingdom, the UK decided to give Ireland special status so they wouldn't be treated the same as any other foreign country, which included the right to travel and work in the UK without visas or passport checks. They also gave Irish citizens the right to vote in Westminster elections if living in the UK. But many decades later, some British residents in Ireland complained that this was unfair, because Irish citizens living in the UK can vote in Westminster elections but British citizens living in Ireland can't vote in Irish national elections. So Ireland held a referendum to decide if they should have that right, and in 1984, Ireland voted to pass the [Ninth Amendment of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland), with a whopping 75.4% voting Yes, to allow the State to extend the right to vote to non-Irish citizens.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 30, 2024"},{"text":"r/brandnewsentence","title":"Corporate America Launches Unorthodox Campaign to Gain Trumps Attention"},{"text":"Is it me or is his left eye a little off center? ?","title":"Trump Nominates Kash Patel for FBI Director"},{"text":"Hes going to make the military great again.","title":"Pete Hegseth's mother called son 'abuser of women' in email blow to Trump's defence pick"},{"text":"Well if that's the case that's a shame.

They've been threatening to do this out in the open. And this agenda is already underway. A potent combination of a unitary executive, broad immunities for the president, executive actions like schedule F, and a MAGA coalition of loyalists that will consolidate power by exploiting Trump's ego to take control of the administrative state and pave the way for a future one party system of government with King Trump at its head.And almost every Trump appointee so far has been picked to help implement this agenda, each one representing a transaction. \\"What have you done for me, and what will you do for me in exchange for this position?\\" They've exchanged their loyalty for a spot within his administration where they can do the most damage.This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been calling a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025. It attempts to strip protections from civil servants whose government positions will depend largely on their allegiance to the president and his agenda. Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will afford Republicans the power to cripple the system of checks and balances holding our democracy together, helping them to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.Project 2025 laid it all out in their manifesto, while heritage foundation members and \\"America first\\" Trump allies have been preparing for this eventuality. People who have already been appointed to positions of power within Trump's new admin.The Unitary executive Theory is another major goal of project 2025, and a proposal that's been floated before by Republicans. Bill Barr was a major proponent, and it's part of the reason why he shot down the Mueller investigations efforts to hold Trump accountable for obstruction. The UET proposes that the president has unchecked powers and complete control over the executive branch.The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive, crippling the separation of powers in the process and giving Trump unilateral authority over the administrative state. These actions will allow The Trump administration to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan civil servants, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field, whose job security didn't previously depend on their loyalty to the president. And come next year, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in years to see this agenda through because they'll have a Trump administration with unchecked powers, a Republican majority in both houses, and a conservative SCOTUS.It might seem a little confusing because part of their goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, and includes every government agency you can think of that's responsible for running and regulating day to day operations in this country.However, the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power for itself and installs Trump as king and useful idiot in chief.Hence, a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"The next Trump administration is also preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a top role in these agencies.From this standpoint, they'll have the perfect opportunity to implement an authoritarian, far right agenda backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists...This is an agenda that will also pave the way for future Republican administrations to continue building a one party system of government, while setting up roadblocks for any progressive, or even populist efforts or movements that may take hold in the future. Because make no mistake, this ain't populism, it more closely resembles an age of modern day robber barons working closely with politicians, or vice versa. Hell, in some cases, they're basically synonymous. Much like the American right, Orbn has gone out of his way to stoke division by spreading fear about racial diversity and demonizing immigrants.  When Orbn came to power in 2010, some of his first acts took aim at the independence of Hungarys judiciary and news media. Orbn and his allies have also tightened their grip over Hungarys electoral system. Theyve changed laws to rig the system in his favor and keep him in power in perpetuity. Orbn and his party have also passed laws prioritizing patriotic education, tightened control over Hungarys state universities and passed laws banning LGBTQ+ content in schools and on childrens television.Yes, this all sounds very familiar. And make no mistake, as long as Republicans have the power, they'll have the motivation to take it even further.Laurence W. Britt, who published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, made a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. This list has become widely shared and circulated.

The people who would cut the throat of a person in front of their families if they were told it would save them $0.05/gal of gas for the rest of their lives. (An analogy I saw in another thread and appreciated)I think theres some more nuance for the majority of his supporters though. Yes, theyre angry about the things theyve been lead to believe are true. Things like inflation, crime, trans people, etc most of those things ginned up into controversy to keep people mad, no matter what the facts are. Then they *truly* believe that their team can fix it. Which is natural, their inputs tell them that the other team isnt offering solutions to the problems they see. And yeah, theyre not, because the facts on the ground are that what the conservative mind is mad about *isnt happening*. They have a worldview which isnt manipulated, its literally a fabrication; but its the truth they know, so trying to fight it with facts doesnt work. It would require literally rethinking how the world works. If irrefutable science came out today indicating that gravity is an illusion, I gotta say, it would not believe it. I would eventually come to accept it, and do research to figure out what the hell that means for my understanding of the world, but I read at above a 6th grade level, I have no kids, and I only work one high-paying job that allows me to have purchased a home and never worry about my mortgage. I am privileged in that way, and many Americans arent. The idea of having the time to reevaluate the ENTIRE way you perceive the world isnt something everyone can do. Nor is everyone born/raised to have significant empathy. I dont know, in many ways I *get* why people can easily have their world view completely wrong. If their information diet is stuff that sounds right and meets their preconceptions, its gonna fit in neatly, and then the cognitive load of evaluating that information no longer needs to be a problem. If you live in that headspace, like basically all humans, its very very difficult to accept things that dont gel with that. And thats how you get an I alone can fix it from Trump being an appealing mindset. Its factually incorrect, but someone is doing the work/thinking *for you* so you can keep on doing everything you need to survive. People arent stupid (generally). They just dont have the capacity and tools to critically evaluate information. If they did, they wouldnt act/vote like that.

Fewer people buy them, sales fall, some manufacturing plants fail to start up because of lower revenues, and only the biggest companies can get up and running. Lower earnings lead to job losses in both America and in the exploitative supply chains. Then local manufacturing comes online and let's say with more automation the new product is only 15% more expensive to produce (very generous). The nearest competitor is forced to be 25% more expensive so may as well up the price to match.When you look at this as phones it's easy to think of it as a luxury expense. Trump has talked about tariffs on EVERYTHING. Food. Building supplies. Parts for things assembled in the US. Sales on all of these drop as prices rise due to both tariffs and on increased demand for local goods that do not have the supply ready. Leading to job losses everywhere.Well they can just work on the farms that all the illegals are about to be kicked off, right? If the US places tariffs, then you'd better believe retaliatory tariffs will kick in as well. This will tank the export market as well. The US exports a lot of food. All those farm jobs start to go as well.The US has built its empire on free trade. The whole system relies on it.

Frankly he switched parties because he KNEW he would get laughed out of any democratic primary.I say all of this to say that the republican party has lowered the bar so much that a con man was able to come in and suborn the entire party's leadership.  That combined with the right media that has literally created an alternate reality where up is down and criminals are patriots and at least the third of the US is victim to misinformation and this is what you get.
