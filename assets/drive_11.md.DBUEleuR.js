But it can't be expected that the Russian military industry will find many new customers for exportYou are right there - their current customers are lost. However in the case of a China US war, China will want to buy anything they can get their hands on. Also China and Russia have inter-dependent military production. China is better at mass production and simpler ground weapons. Russia inherits from the Soviet union better abilities in aviation, especially jet engine production so they will have great sales to China. China alone will have great difficulty defeating America to take on Taiwan, however if they ensure that the war stays local and close to them so they can use land weapons *and* they have Russia's military support their chances are quite reasonable. They just *will* have the ability to send enough missile spam that it should be possible to gain a local advantage. That war will be incredibly profitable for Russia. They will be providing not only weapons but also oil and food which China needs.

You also have stuff like their LA chapter (a city with 621,000 Jews) not understanding the correct way one is supposed to write Hebrew.  The Atlanta chapter (a city with 120,000 Jews) deciding to hold their Passover Seder two days before the start of Passover (and on Hitler's birthday to boot).Heck, one of their administrators is allegedly located in Lebanon.

The only reason the war is continuing at the moment is because the soldiers are sourced from minority communities and the far reaches of the country. Which means the majority of able bodied young men are in the Russian heartland, the place where Putin is actively working to avoid conscripting from. Reasonably you would want to wait a good amount of time for your easily accessed manpower to recover. This is of course not focusing on the already existing demographic crisis in Russia that will only be looking much worse on the other end of the war.Beyond that as soon as the territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia ends Ukraine is going to enter NATO. Full stop there's no reason for them to not join NATO and once they do who would Russia have as a military target. The Baltic Nations, Finland, and Turkey are all unacceptable targets due to NATO. Poland as well. Central Asia isn't exactly worth the effort, and Belarus is already a Russian Puppet.China is more likely to invade Russia to take back outer Manchuria than Russia is to invade China.It is also important to remember that this was has been significantly more costly than the Russians originally expected. They're fighting a country that is almost completely reliant on foreign aid, and they're struggling to deal with them despite the many advantages Russia has on paper. So long as we avoid a total annexation of Ukraine it is unlikely the Russians are going to look for more conflict this decade. This would give Russia's economy plenty of time to slowly return to a non war composition.Truly the most likely outcome is a settlement with minor territory concessions to Russia followed by Ukraine joining NATO and Russia serving as a major arms exporter for the many future Climate Change based wars in Africa, and the Middle East who are expected to see the worst effects. China and India have massive populations, and Russia would be best served as a seller to either of their armies who are likely to use similar military strategies. China and India would be happy to buy Russian weapons because they're likely to be cheaper to use and maintain as well as more numerous than their western counterparts.","title":"CMV: If peace is achieved in Ukraine now, it can be expected that Russia starts another war within a few years"},{"text":"Like I said, I think its just young people who dont actually remember the Bush years.?","title":"CMV: Republicans have nowhere else to go but right and if Trump loses in 2024, Nick Fuentes will end up being the nominee later down the road and the same people that miss Bush and Cheney now will miss Trump."},{"text":"And how is the left Marxist?

Last year, he became the first president to join a picket line, speaking to striking United Auto Workers members.\\n \\n Biden had been tracking the strike since September and directed his team after a Sept. 26 meeting to tell both sides to negotiate in good faith. Brainard, Su and Buttigieg began working with the parties involved, with Brainard liaising with management and Su in closer touch with the union, said one of the people familiar with the matter.\\n \\n The Wednesday before the deadline, the alliance filed a federal charge against the union with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the longshoremen of failing to bargain in good faith and seeking an order that they come back to the table. It was an unusual tactic for an employer in a labor dispute; it is more common for unions to accuse managers of acting in bad faith.\\n \\n That Friday, Sept. 27, the presidents aides met with USMX board members at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House and stressed the need for them to provide a fair deal to dockworkers, one person familiar with the matter said. Brainard made clear to the board members that the president would not be using Taft-Hartley to end the strike, the person said. Biden was briefed later that day on the lack of progress, and Zients began convening Brainard, Su and Buttigieg multiple times a day to keep tabs on the strike.\\n \\n Ships almost immediately began piling up offshore. The queue would grow to include 59 container vessels by Thursday, according to data firm Everstream Analytics, stranding hundreds of thousands of containers.\\n \\n Biden doubled down on putting pressure on the shipping firms over the following days. The White House repeatedly hammered shipping profits since the pandemic. On Wednesday, Biden tried increasing the pressure by saying publicly that failure to reach a deal could exacerbate the impact of the hurricane.\\n \\n To get in one raise what it took you in the past six years to achieve is monumental, Riley said. The administration played a key role here in bringing the parties together and defending American workers and the union workers against foreign giants.\\n","title":"How Biden helped end a port strike that threatened Democrats in November"},{"text":"The only way she wins is through massive corruption","title":"People are stupid if they actually think Harris is going to win."},{"text":"He thought he could get boosted by Trump, because trump would need him to be the figurehead and bridge to white power, extreme right racists.Trump doesn't need Fuentes. he already appeals to the racists.

You can look at places like California where the Republican Party is almost completely non-viable as a statewide party, but their nominees for statewide states aren't Nick Fuentes types. They've tended to be weirdos but not outright white supremacists. Nick Fuentes has no audience except the excessively online right ring weirdos. Also California didn't end up with a \\"true left party by international standards\\" (which is kind of a myth btw, and California tried to pass statewide healthcare and it failed). California is a Democratic Party majority state but there are north/south factions in that party.You can also look at New York where the Republican Party is still kind of viable, despite the state being solidly blue. New York is also kind of strange because they keep electing weirdos from both parties. It's really difficult to make definitive predictions where either party is going to end up, because historically they haven't had a stable trajectory on either side for a very long time. \\"No more wars\\" is the weirdo right wing stance now from a party that was debating how many countries should we invade four years before Trump got elected.","title":"CMV: Republicans have nowhere else to go but right and if Trump loses in 2024, Nick Fuentes will end up being the nominee later down the road and the same people that miss Bush and Cheney now will miss Trump."},{"text":"And Democratic politicians will be praising the bravery of Donald Trumps kids in the Senate who give half-hearted criticisms to President Fuentes surprise use of the F-word while cutting the ribbon at another new concentration camp.Presidential candidate Gavin Newsom will say it is unpresidential to swear so close to the sacred mass death chambers and America needs more effective leadership to stop the dangerous uncounted hordes of communists who have obviously moved into caves and break into our homes to drink the sweat off our toes each night as we sleep.","title":"CMV: Republicans have nowhere else to go but right and if Trump loses in 2024, Nick Fuentes will end up being the nominee later down the road and the same people that miss Bush and Cheney now will miss Trump."},{"text":"Suburban college educated former republicans","title":"CMV: Republicans have nowhere else to go but right and if Trump loses in 2024, Nick Fuentes will end up being the nominee later down the road and the same people that miss Bush and Cheney now will miss Trump."},{"text":"The only situation I could see Trump be useful in.

I don't think any soft solutions will work: we humans cannot give up our consumerism, we will riot if we even have to give away 3% of our luxury.

They are people that claim they always vote for democrats but then their voter history says otherwise. They usually don't vote or have always flipped flopped. The hyper focus on these voices happens every 4 years and we act like they're new but the black vote has never been 100% dem so it isn't shocking they exist. We're not going to see the black male vote drop 10-15 points to Trump this year though. It is not happeningI think there definitely has been some movement in the black vote and with minorities in general. Trump does appeal more to people of color compared to your average republican, but I would argue that it won't actually matter at all this cycle. For example, the senior black vote dominates in places like Fulton and DeKalb, they're solidly behind Kamala, and the broader youth vote and woman vote is so blue that the black Trump and black swing voters don't impact the result. The swing voters that tip the scale this cycle are suburban white women.From my personal experience, though, most of the minority movement to Trump is from the focused appeal to the \\"manosphere\\" and endorsements from \\"conservative\\" Christians.

They knowingly put unacceptable terms into their deals, such as trading dead hostages instead of living ones. Another example of Hamas pretending to want peace is before October 7th, Gaza/Hamas and Israel were peaceful with increased work permits which is partially why Israel didn't expect the attack. \\nHamas knows how to turn the West against Israel; they're really fucking good at it.

This includes up to $5.7 billion for climate-smart practices, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, which is part of President Bidens Investing in America Agenda and $2 billion in Farm Bill funding. This is more than double the amount available last year and the most conservation assistance made available in a single year in U.S. history for popular USDA conservation programs.Through changing temperatures, precipitation patterns, drought, flooding, and increasingly more severe extreme events, such as hurricanes and wildfires, climate change is affecting the livelihood of USDAs stakeholders. Innovations in adapting to such changes will be central to the future success of working lands. USDAs Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) received more than 156,485 applications for its conservation programs in fiscal year 2024. While NRCS accepts applications year-round, interested agricultural producers can now apply for fiscal year 2025 funding through NRCS at their local USDA Service Center.  \\n...  \\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate and conservation investment in history, invests an additional $19.5 billion in NRCS oversubscribed conservation programs over five years, which began in fiscal year 2023. This year through the Inflation Reduction Act, producers can apply for $2.8 billion through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), $943 million through the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), $472 million through the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), and up to $1.4 billion in the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). This is in addition to the $2 billion available for these programs through the Farm Bill, including $860 million for EQIP, $600 million for CSP, $450 million for ACEP, and $250 million for RCPP.This assistance through the Inflation Reduction Act also helps advance the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain climate, clean energy and other federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. These investments also advance President Bidens America the Beautiful Initiative, a locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration effort that aims to address the nature and climate crises, support working lands conservation, improve equitable access to the outdoors, and strengthen the economy.Since implementation began in 2023, this climate smart conservation assistance has helped over 28,500 farmers and ranchers apply conservation to 361 million acres of land during the past two years. These funds provide direct climate mitigation benefits, advance a host of other environmental co-benefits, and expand access to financial and technical assistance for producers to advance conservation on their farm, ranch or forest land through practices like cover cropping, conservation tillage, wetland restoration, prescribed grazing, nutrient management, tree planting and more.*Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Activities*NRCS recently released an updated list of Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Mitigation Activities eligible for Inflation Reduction Act funding in fiscal year 2025, which includes 14 new activities. NRCS also released the NRCS Conservation Practices and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Information dashboard sharing the expected mitigation benefits and science-based estimation approach for listed practices.These in-demand activities are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or increase carbon sequestration, as well as provide other significant benefits to natural resources like soil health, water quality, pollinator and wildlife habitat and air quality. In response to feedback received from conservation partners, producers and NRCS staff across the country, NRCS considered and evaluated activities based on scientific literature demonstrating expected climate change mitigation benefits.These activities will also help producers mitigate the risks of climate change, including drought and flooding from extreme weather events such as the recent hurricane. Agriculture faces significant exposure to the physical risks of climate change. The USDA estimates that due to increased drought fueled by climate change, the Agency could see up to double the number of ranchers seeking assistance under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program by the end of the century compared to today. This corresponds to an increase of more than $800 million per year in Federal expenditures by the end of the century.*Conservation Easements*NRCS is accepting applications for ACEP for fiscal year 2025, which includes $472 million in Inflation Reduction Act funds for this year. ACEP helps producers conserve and protect grasslands, wetlands and farmlands. Producers interested in Inflation Reduction Act funding through ACEP should submit their applications by the next two ranking dates, Oct. 4, 2024, or Dec. 20, 2024. Any ACEP application submitted to NRCS that was unfunded in fiscal year 2024 will be automatically re-considered during the Oct. 4 funding cycle.  \\n...Statement from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack:Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administrations Inflation Reduction Act, Americas producers have additional funding available to them for conservation programs and climate-smart practices. We continue to see record demand for these programs, and were confident that we can continue to get the support out to conservation-minded producers, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. This funding will be used to maximize climate benefits across the country while also providing other important conservation and operational benefits, which will lead to economic opportunity for producers, and more productive soil, cleaner water and air, healthier wildlife habitat, greater connectivity, and natural resource conservation for future generations.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Makes up to $7.7 Billion Available for Climate-Smart Practices on Agricultural Lands as Part of Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"Why do places that make good rice serve pass out such awful plastic silverware.","title":"President Biden made a good joke"},{"text":"You're messed up","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Stuck on Repeat in Teleprompter Glitch"},{"text":"Robinson taking the big tent approach pretty seriously.","title":"North Carolina governor race swings significantly to favor Dem AG Josh Stein over scandal-plagued Mark Robinson"},{"text":"They are not legally allowed to vote, but what checks are there that actually catch or deter it?

I loathe Trump more than almost any other human on Earth, I hate his baggadocious demeanor and the way he uses it to conceal his cowardice. I despise his dishonesty and his lack of honor. I think he is a spoiled and self-serving brat who spent his entire adult life escaping responsiblity for his unsavory actions.All that being said, there's one thing I cannot critique him for. He is not a hawkish politician. He does not want to deploy the US military on foreign soil, and he opposed his own generals who pushed him to do so. I read Bob Woodward's first book on Trump \\"FEAR\\", and in it Woodward describes a meeting Trump had at the DOD with the secretary of defense and a couple of generals who wanted Trump to increase the US troop presence in Afghanistan. Trump expressed an unwillingness to go along with it, and only aquiesced after sitting through a long meeting where the generals spoke about the threat to American soldiers if he said no. After the meeting Trump expressed anger towards himself for going along with the DOD plan, and woved he wouldn't put one more American soldier into Afghanistan during the rest of his term.When I came home from Afghanistan I was thoroughly disillusioned with our politicians. For most of the war there was no justificition for our presence in Afghanistan, and there had never been one for our presence in Iraq. I read every news article I could find, I read every leak on wikileaks, I studied the senate torture report, the 9/11 commission report and every piece of information simply added to my disgust with the cause I had worked to serve for so long.There are three people I loathe more than Donald Trump.

This is due primarily to people with health risks not living as long (healthcare for the elderly is exceptionally expensive), as well as reduced spending on pensions, income from sin taxes, etc.. In the US there are 106.4 million people that are overweight, at an additional lifetime healthcare cost of $3,770 per person average. 98.2 million obese at an average additional lifetime cost of $17,795. 25.2 million morbidly obese, at an average additional lifetime cost of $22,619. With average lifetime healthcare costs of $879,125, obesity accounts for 0.99% of our total healthcare costs. https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesityhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1038/oby.2008.290We're spending 165% more than the OECD average on healthcare--that works out to over half a million dollars per person more over a lifetime of care--and you're worried about 0.99%?Here's another study, that actually found that lifetime healthcare for the obese are *lower* than for the healthy. Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDFFor further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdfOne final way we can look at it is to see if there is correlation between obesity rates and increased spending levels between various countries. There isn't. https://i.imgur.com/d31bOFf.pngWe aren't using significantly more healthcare--due to obesity or anything else--we're just paying dramatically more for the care we do receive.","title":"CMV: Curing obesity will actually cost the healthcare system a lot of money"},{"text":"You mean like at Camp David?","title":"Arab American leaders urge Harris to show distance from Bidens Israel policy during private Michigan meeting"},{"text":"As someone who's been voting against Scott since 2010, it's been so aggravating to see him squeak past the post by razor-thin margins again and again.Let this be the year Skeletor is finally vanquished.","title":"Obama endorses Mucarsel-Powell: This is your chance, Florida"},{"text":"But 2016 was Hillary not Biden right?

And something socio-psychological that democrats have in common, that I have noticed, is that they are ideological. The belief that the thought image that forms in their minds must be doable because it's GOOD. Or harmless...without any thought as to what happens on the path to reach it, and the real world consequences. Because theoretically it can be done, that it can actually be done. And that we, as conservatives, stand in their way somehow. The Roe v Wade thing is really their flag, though. To be told what to do with their bodies. They honestly feel a child life inside them belongs to them, because they own the vessel, apparently. It's a partly biological block of rationale and reason. The power to kill what belongs to them is somehow more ethical than killing an unborn child. And they'll spin it anyway they can to get others to buy into it. It's the idealism that is the construct of their socio-psychological makeup.    And yes, it's difficult the manage, as you love your sisiter. I get it, too. My ex-wife and soon to be ex are both liberal feminists. Liberal college-educated: The seed planted. Watered.

We can have equality and still be different. I'm finding that to be problematic in establishing a foundation for diplomacy.

From the beginning they turned down exchange deal after exchange deal because killing Palestinian children was more important to them.When you say nonsense like this it really undermines your point. Israel's goal in Gaza is to ensure that Hamas can never take hostages or harm its people ever again. A ceasefire does nothing to further that aim. Only the absolute destruction of Hamas can achieve that goal, just like how Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany had to see total destruction to change their ways. Up until now it's been half measures where Israel succumbs to international pressure from ignorant fools like yourself and then the conflict reignites after a few years. The onus is on the Palestinian people to pick leaders who will pursue peace instead of using them as tools for a delusional jihad against Israel; until then, any bloodshed or innocent casualties from the conflict are 1000% on Hamas'/Hezbollah/Iranian Proxy #12312321 's hands.  Also, no Palestinians do not enjoy anything like full rights in Israel, as the US State Department reported in 2022: https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/israel-west-bank-and-gaza/#:~:text=Significant%20human%20rights%20issues%20included,privacy%2C%20family%2C%20and%20home%3BI guess you aren't aware that there are Palestinians that actually live in Israel with full citizenship, not in the West Bank or Gaza?

While he was a KGB operative for much of his life, I do not think he really cares about whether or not Russia is Communist, but whether or not Russia is powerful. When you have a society collapse in the face of its ideological adversaries, you *must* change the script for the nation to be successful. Which is what Putin has done to hitch his ambitions upon; if Putin is dead, then it is depends on whether his successor wants to carry on Putin's vision for the entirety of their administration or if they will change. My honest prediction is that, in the event of Putin's death, he will have a short-lived successor to carry on his policies albeit *much* lower-key followed by a successor who will either: change directions entirely *or* ratchet up the war-mongering to at *least* Putin's level. * **The desire of the Russian people to be in support of further warring:**  the acceptable narrative for Russian citizens to express is that the wars have been good and well-reasoned in their rationale - how earnest that narrative is held is not entirely known. If the Russian people express a marked and increased dissatisfaction with the war, then you can be sure that Putin will have to crack down on his citizens.  That will definitely require a de-escalation to the war in Ukraine and a pause on future wars. In the event of Putin's death, his successor could score approval with the Russian people by allowing the narrative to shift and then acting as if he his upholding the people's will. I wouldn't argue that future Russian-initiated wars *won't* happen, I would argue that they aren't *guaranteed* especially in the time-frame you are talking about. 3-5 years?

With no guarantee of the US diplomatic umbrella for escalating, Netanyahu had to ceasefire within weeks versus Biden's \\"unconditional support.\\" A policy resulting in a year and likely more of this ongoing conflict.Obama in solidarity with the President publically supported his 2023 policy even though he never publically repudiated, or even regretted his own 2014 policy of refusing to enable Israel.Harris has done the same as Obama. She will not entertain discord in the party's messaging.But as speculation, she is closer to his age than Biden. She also hails from California, one of the states much less dependent on dim religious voter concerns in its politics. Younger Democrats in general are better attuned to the fact that the voters who make Israel relevant to us, christian \\"Holy Land\\" pearl clutchers, are both in decline and veering right. There's less and less of a reason to bother catering to them for re-election, and thereby less and less of a reason to treat Israel as a special relationship.

Yes, China (or some other actor) theoretically COULD use generic infrastructure accesses to find your porn habits and blackmail you, but that's (to my knowledge) generally not what they do (ESPECIALLY with a 'regular Joe'). Now if they are going after a *specific person* (i.e. someone with sensitive accesses in the IC or a defense contractor I could see it). But more reasonably it's them gaining access for both traditional 'spying' in the national-security sense; pre-positioning accesses in US critical infrastructure in case we have a direct confrontation and of course the continued massive theft of US Intellectual Property. Worry less about them seeing your  PornHub selections and more about if have SCADA access to your local power grid or stole the prototype designs for components of the next-gen interceptor missiles some US sub-contractor is making.Their OWN population, well, they DEF watch what their own people are doing online!","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"One of the most effectively modern lies ever told to the American public was that conservatives in this country are ignorant rubes, or that liberals are coastal and metropolitan elites.  It was an offensive reduction of political identity that only seemed to serve to more easily dramatize politics while also dividing people with shared interests and keep them from organizing.  Conservatives are not stupid.  The professional strategists play long games with effective strategies that have the sole purpose of limiting the freedoms of certain classes of Americans while fortifying the wealth and wealth acquisition for their donors.  They are some of the most effective propagandists and con artists I've ever seen and their dedication to their ideology is impressive.  For them it's a way of life.The era of the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus I think was the start of their peak and progressive decline into the Trump-o-sphere, all of which was a product of the decades of rhetoric they pitched grooming people into increasingly radical positions.  The era we're entering into now is the era of subversion.  The Democratic Party has regularly made space for center and even right of center \\"blue dog\\" democrats and conservatives have likely quietly been migrating into that space and other traditionally liberal spaces in the hopes of eventually pulling them in their direction.  They'll repackage their beliefs with language that seems more palatable to liberal minded people, or go so far as to suggest that one goal (like environmental protection for example) is impeding another (like housing), but their desired outcome and their priorities wont change (in the given example a weakening of environmental regulations while also granting publicly funded financial benefits to wealthy developers).  They'll pick and choose their battles, but you'll start to see people \\"innocently\\" questioning more liberal priorities, or expressing \\"concern\\" that including them will make the party less appealing to the boarder electorate.  All while conservative organizations will continue to churn out propaganda though anyone that will take their money or host them.Liberal, social, and progressive minded people need to have an equal dedication to their causes.  It needs to be a way of life where everyone is pushing gently and progressively forward, rather than what has traditionally been a reactionary response that seems to almost always include debilitating compromise.  Democrats need to learn to set firm boundaries and to more steadfastly resist the conservative goal to kneecap the 99%.","title":"30 million student-loan borrowers get bad news after a Trump-appointed federal judge officially blocks Biden from carrying out broader debt cancellation"},{"text":"You voted for a dementia patient and consume media sources that told you he was sharp as a tack until his brain literally melted on live tv after his first unscripted public appearance in like a year.

If they attack more of georgia, is it a new war or the same one dragging on?Russia claims NATO and EU expansion threatens them, which they use to justify invading Ukraine and Georgia. That concern is valid, but their response is completely wrong. They throw in nonsense excuses to make the war sound legitimate, but its about blocking the West. I doubt theyll start another war unless Azerbaijan wants to join NATO or the EU.Russia has the landmass and (natural) resources to thrive without war. The collapse of the petrodollar and the rise of BRICS give them the chance to shift to an authoritarian, China-like modelrich, powerful, and censored. To me, a european in the union, Thats more dangerous long-term than endless \\"small\\" wars, and seems like a more likely outcome.Russias fear of the unions border expansion doesnt justify mass murder.

The leaders of Emgage Action are expected to participate in the meeting, according to one of the sources.\\n \\n CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment about the meeting.\\n \\n Absent from the guest list were leaders of the Uncommitted movement, which sprung up during the Democratic primaries this year in opposition to the Biden administrations policy on the war in Gaza. Harris interacted with leaders of the group in early August during a photo line at the Detroit airport.\\n \\n The group has called on the vice president to hold meetings with families affected by the war after her campaign and national Democrats denied the groups previous request for a Palestinian American to speak during the Democratic convention in Chicago this summer.\\n \\n Uncommitted leaders have since announced that their group?will not endorse Harris, though they also warned against a vote for?Donald Trump?or, in states where they might appear on the ballot, third-party candidates.\\n \\n Uncommitted movement co-founder Abbas Alawieh, a former Capitol Hill staffer, confirmed Friday that his group was not invited to the meeting with Harris.\\n \\n In a?social media post, Alawieh said he was glad our pressure is helping yield more engagement. What we need right now is for the?@VP?to specifically say that as president she will respect international humanitarian and U.S. law and stop sending the Israeli military weapons for war crimes.\\n \\n James Zogby, a co-founder of the Arab American Institute and a Democratic National Committee member for more than 30 years who addressed the Uncommitted movement during the Chicago convention, told CNN he turned down an invitation to Fridays meeting with Harris. He cited growing frustration with what he described as a campaign more concerned with optics than addressing the anger and anxiety among Arab American voters.\\n \\n Zogby was part of a Wednesday call with Harris national security adviser Phil Gordon that the White House described as a virtual gathering with Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American community leaders to discuss the latest developments in the Middle East.\\n \\n There was no ground broken. I wasnt quite sure what the intent was other than to just say  that they met with leaders. There were no leaders, Zogby said of the Wednesday conversation.\\n \\n That call and other communications with the Harris campaign, and Bidens before that, have irked the longtime Democratic pollster. And Israels escalation in Lebanon has also turned up the heat in states like Michigan, where Lebanese Americans have made up a major part of the Democratic coalition.\\n \\n With Lebanon in flames, theyve got a bigger job. And I dont think theyre ready to handle it, Zogby said of the Harris campaign. Its sort of like trying to sell a car to somebody with terminal cancer. Whatre you talking for? I have bigger things on my mind right now.\\n \\n Abed Ayoub, the national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said there have been many meetings with both the campaign and administration. They know our concerns and demands.\\n \\n Our position and work is focused on bringing an immediate ceasefire, and an end to the genocide in Palestine and the war on Lebanon, said Ayoub, who noted that his group has nearly 130,000 active voters as members, including 7,500 in Michigan.\\n \\n This week, Harris running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, took the campaigns pitch to Emgage Actions Million Muslim Votes: A Way Forward summit.\\n \\n I know the pain of this community is deep. Our hearts are broken. The concern of the vice president and Harris and I - its on our minds every day. The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families fleeing for safety, over and over again, Walz said at the virtual event.\\n \\n Harris has?occasionally been disrupted?at campaign rallies by pro-Palestinian protesters. In those moments, the vice president, who has?spoken about the devastation in Gaza, has stressed that the administration is working toward a ceasefire deal.\\n \\n Zogby said Friday he desperately wants Harris to win but is concerned about the campaigns efforts to stage-manage the issue.\\n \\n They have to say something about the issue thats on peoples minds, Zogby said, and they just dont seem able to bring themselves to talk about it.\\"","title":"Arab American leaders urge Harris to show distance from Bidens Israel policy during private Michigan meeting"},{"text":"They only have a stranglehold on some big politics subreddits: this one, r/news, r/worldnews, r/Ukrainecombatfootage, and a few more.

Obese patients are prone to a whole host of different acute and chronic health conditions, from rashes in skin folds and sleep apnea to weakened/fractured bones, diabetes, gallstones, liver and kidney failure, and cancer. That's right, obesity is actually linked to *a higher rate of cancer* earlier in life. Plus, treating obese people for *anything* is also harder and more complicated. Lifting, wheeling, or weighing an obese patient takes extra people or specialized equipment. Physical checks and surgery are much more challenging, because all the extra fat is physically in the way and has to be managed. Anesthesia is trickier, medication dosage is trickier, and every kind of body-sized equipment from blood pressure cuffs to casts and wheelchairs need to be modified. And all of this functionally costs more money.And finally, I'd like to offer this argument: What if curing obesity *did* end up costing more money? So? Saving lives often costs money. If we wanted the healthcare system to save money, we should just stop trying so hard to keep everyone alive, from neonatal babies to accident victims to the sick elderly. But we don't, because we (by and large) value human life and wellbeing over monetary costs.

Democrats do occasionally slip up and do good things but the majority of the time, they're terrible.","title":"CMV: Democrats should be amplifying Vance's Feb 2020 remark that \\"Trump thoroughly failed to deliver\\" on his economic promises"},{"text":"Now that AI is a thing, I should be able to ask my browser to find the original clip of something.

He does not.  He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress, Pelosi said July 28 at a press conference.The President cant do it. So thats not even a discussion. Not everybody realizes that.

I personally eat meat, and I am aware of and despise inhumane treatment of animals. So, I think Im one of the gigantic hypocrites. Its not like I havent tried to eat vegetarian. I have had many many instances where I think, yeah I dont need meat. But invariably, I find myself eventually getting some chicken dish because hey, at least factory farmed chickens arent as bad for the environment as cows. I am probably not alone, and I think people crave meat because it tastes good and our species evolved to eat a varied diet maximizing calories. All types of meat (chicken, cow, pig, fish, etc.) have great levels of protein and healthy fats. So my question is, what is your goal here? To convince hypocrites that they should stop eating meat? Or to change the system so we can eat meat without animals being tortured? Because those are two very different goals. Its like telling people to bike instead of drive to individually help alleviate carbon emissions versus holding large corporations accountable who are responsible so the vast majority of carbon emissions.

After the war, many companies will want to get into Russia cheaply. Chinese ones especially, probably backed by the CCP to expand their influence in Russia, will jump at the chance.?\\nAlso I don't understand the second part of that sentence. Puntin's government is an oligarchy, it exists to make money for the top people. They would love lots of foreign investment, as long as they get their cut, which companies already know and give them. Putin might be more of a war monger, but the rest of the oligarchs want to make money.?\\nThe second point is this one:?\\nBut it can't be expected that the Russian military industry will find many new customers for export\\nYou should look into Viktor Bout, he's sold insane amounts of weapons for Russia (and probably other counties) to war torn countries, rebel groups, militias, ect. all over the world, especially in Africa. The US just traded him back to Russia, I'm sure he would love to help them start selling their weapons again. Russia is heavily involved in African conflicts and is cozying up to Iran, who has many groups around the middle east that always needs weapons... not to mention the middle east being on the brink of a much wider war. There would be no shortage of people for Russia to export weapons to.?\\nBetween fuel exports to Europe restarting, foreign investments from China and international companies, and selling their arms, Russia could easily get the money it needs to refocus its economy on peace time money making for the oligarchs.?","title":"CMV: If peace is achieved in Ukraine now, it can be expected that Russia starts another war within a few years"},{"text":"crap, did that still come across as a single thought?

I can assure you, people across the spectrum in Texas were *furious* about that. I know in some ways that episode was just bad optics, and, really, what could a US senator do on the ground in that situation? That said, its seriously stuck with him amongst folks, and itand his mealy mouthed explanationreally encapsulated things people on both sides of the aisle dislike about him. Also, fun side anecdote about that event that Ive heard from first hand involved people: his trip down to Cancunduring the state wide natural disasterwas initially, in part exposed by a parent of one of his daughters school friends (and presumably, someone Cruz and his wife would have considered a friend). All the parents of the kids in this group, who all attended St. Johns in Houston (a very elite private prep school) were part of a group text thread. Some portion of them texted that they were planning to go down to Mexico with their kids to wait out the storm. Cruz said he would be joining.  One of the mothers in the groupperhaps recoiling in disgust at the prospect of seeing Ted Cruz in a bathing suit and flip flopsleaked screen shots of the group texts. Notably, those leaked texts disproved Cruzs excuse that he was simply escorting his kid down to Cancun and always intended to come right back. Now, you might grumble at *anyone* bailing out of state for a nice Caribbean beach trip while the rest of the state froze. However, 1) none of the other people were elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents and act as a leader in times of crisis; 2) if youre going to intentionally be as big of a PoS as Ted Cruzyou should remember that you very likely have no real friends, and your friends *will* throw you under the bus.

And so I'd ask if you find yourself equally objecting to that? When it comes to clothing or technology or chocolate, do you find it equally abhorent since it can likely involves slavery and child slavery specifically. Its not just convience that causes them to ignore it. We all ignore how our products are made, the connection between the production and the product is severed. When you see a phone, you don't see child labour, you aren't connected to that part. It doesn't really connect meaningfully to object, and theres a lot of huge moving parts that make this so. One person can't stop this tide. Because I buy a phone doesn't mean I'm not sincerely agaisnt child labour. It means I'm operating under the system given to me, I'm influenced by the world I'm in and put in a situation in which one person cannot break out of by themselves, it takes a huge upheveal.On your last sentence you'd (to not be hypocritical) have to apply it to all production. Participating in nearly all buying of products means you lose your ability to sincerely hope for something better? To want the bigger powers to take steps to make it better? Are you pro-slavery, are you pro-child labour, are you pro-destroying the enviornment? All of those things I guarentee you have brought products that directly connect.","title":"CMV: Most people who eat factory-farmed meat are gigantic hypocrites"},{"text":"Every time you focus on rodeo clown Taylor, youre not focused on how dumb and weird Trump and Vance are and how they want to strip women of their rights because women are too smart to vote republican.","title":"??

investigate how the virus is not the killer and aids is a condition caused by an overly toxic situation, a culmination of several unhealthy lifestyle habitsoverall i do feel its important if one

little stuck in a society what is hard wired on sadistic domination and worshipping the chemical industry while blaming the viruses and bacteria for the wrongs human beings do to themselves so yes, i

lovingly prepared at home is the single best medicine a human being can give to itself beside investing time into harmonious relationships with fellow human, animal, plant, elemental beings and enjoying moderate joyfull exercise in the fresh air outdoors provided by trees and moving natural watersthe human being does not need anything what comes from a factory or a laboratoryfor every situation where the human body is not at ease, there is a physical therapy such as immersing oneself into natural waters such as rivers, lakes, ocean, spending time around an open flame like a candle or a fire, feeling the wind on skin, exposing the naked body to the elements, there are so many plants what offer themselves as helpers and need no laboratory or factory to be prepared but ages old techniques such as drying them and drinking an infusion of them as herbal teabut the greatest medicine of all i understand is to live a life of freedom what means for me to live free from being dominated by others and free from dominating otherstherefore i regularly propose to my fellow human beings how we the people alive today could at any moment release each other from all societal demands by simply allowing each other to leave the coersed association to the state and with it release 2000 m2 of fertile land or 1000 m2 of fertile land and 1000 m2 of forest from immoral state control so that everyone who would want to do so could sustain oneself on such land owned by no onegrowing ones own vegan foodstuff in the garden, building a natural home from clay, hemp and straw, growing hemp to burn its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree would get killedto live and let livethe human being not demanding anything from a fellow human beingthe human being

You inherently assume that we need some government or ruler to tell us what to do. And that's why you can't understand my view. When people work together they don't need someone to govern them. They can decide among themselves what needs to be done. You don't need someone to tell you whether you've had enough yet or not. Why would you want to have more than others? Try to answer that question for yourself. Because you don't want to be poor? What if there were no poor? If everyone had the same, would you still want to have more than them?This wouldn't even discourage anyone from trying to achieve anything in life. An oppressing regime would do that but not a society where people are working together. You might have some goal like bringing people to Mars. So you share it with others, some of which might decide to work together with you towards that goal. Does there have to be some monetary incentive in that case? Can't you just do something because you feel like it, because it motivates and inspires you? Because it might improve everyone's life?It always seems to come down to people being afraid of losing everything when someone criticizes our great capitalist system. But who are really the only ones who would lose anything? Those who have too much. Those who care only about themselves and so exploit everyone else to get what they want. If everyone was able to live a nice life, if we all were working together towards that goal and there was no one exploiting others for selfish reasons, give me a reason why you think we could not accomplish that.Planned economies are very flawed for obvious reasons. And again you seem to be stuck seeing no other alternatives. As if there was no other options besides the communist or the capitalist model. I'd encourage you to open your mind and think a bit outside the box. If you were to rebuild the world however you see fit, how would you do it? If you could make it perfect, how would you go about it? Would you still cling to all those old ideas that you already know haven't worked? Or would you look for new, better solutions?Do you think that there could be no better way because our smart politicians haven't discovered it yet? What if they never had any intention to do so? What if their goal is mainly to preserve the status quo while filling their pockets? If the people don't wake up and start coming up with their own solution, no one else will. That should be clear by now. We are living in a democracy, aren't we? So I'd say it's about time that people started governing themselves. Our politicians have more than proven their incompetence at this point. And even if most people seem to doubt it, humanity is capable of a whole lot more than people like to think.

But I'm not gonna try to convince you otherwise. Maybe it makes you feel better about yourself to put others down. But here's a suggestion: Try to consider growing up in the worst possible environment. No, not in a ghetto surrounded by people who want to get out of there. But surrounded by people who think they're stupid. And that you are, too. That they cannot accomplish anything in life and so on and so forth. You know what I'm getting at.How would your life have turned out under those circumstances? Would it have been your \\"human potential\\" that would have limited you? Or your believes about it?As for the shareholders, I don't see what your comment has to do with anything. If everyone still had slaves to serve them, would that be perfectly okay? What makes it okay to \\"invest\\" in a company by buying shares, and then expect to get payments from it year after year? If you saw a business as some machine that just generates profits out of thin air, then that might be fine. But if you see it as a bunch of people working on it and producing the goods, then that means that you're taking money away from them. Why? Do you contribute in any way? Through that one time payment? Those people are working there every day. And what do you do? Throw money around and magically more appears?And what if there were no shareholders? There'd be no pension fonds? Hm, that would be bad. Or would it? If there was no one leeching money out of companies the workers would get payed more. And that money they could put into their pension funds. All the shareholder system does is again make people dependent on corporations. So that even if you retire, you're still reliant on them.As for your last point: What motivates people? Money? Is that all? Are you such a basic creature or is there more to you? If a friend or family members asks you for help, do you do it? Do you ask for payment? Or expect a favor in return? Maybe if you're not a selfish person you might do it for free without expecting anything in return. So why do you do it then? Because it's the right thing to do? Because it makes you feel good to help others?Humans have survived for a long time before there was money or rulers to tell them what to do. Your views just show this attitude that has been instilled into the people since ancient times by rulers. These feelings of inferiority. \\"You couldn't possibly do anything by yourself. Let me tell you what to do. I know the way forward.\\"If only people believed a bit more in themselves instead. But society has never encouraged that and it never will. But this top down structure is what it's always been about. Hence why I said in my post that people need to wake up and realize their potential.

There's people on all levels managing things. A well managed company can operate very well without a CEO for quite some time. The only reason why it couldn't forever is because every other company has a CEO that is trying to win against them. But if you got rid of all CEOs, there'd be nothing to prevent it.Your view is based on the assumption that people can't govern themselves. Most people are just morons who need someone to lead them. That view has been perpetrated by those in power since the dawn of time. And sadly everyone has just accepted it as a fact.Maybe take a look at some of the most prosperous countries in the world today. No, I'm not talking about countries like America with a huge economy. I'm talking about countries where people are doing well. They tend to have the highest happiness index. They even have free health care and stuff like that. They also tend to treat prisoners as people who need help, instead of as deviants that need to be punished. There's a reason why US prisons are overflowing while in other parts of the world people change after going to prison and start a new life afterwards.But whatever you expect from people, they tend to fulfill your expectations. So if you'd like to think that people couldn't survive without you because you're so smart and they need you to guide them. An attitude extremely prevalent today in folks like Bill Gates. Well, too many folks believe it and act accordingly. And since our education system is mainly designed to teach people obedience and to follow the rules, and the media are constantly scaring them into submission, what else are people supposed to think?

I mean each and every noble house was founded at some point by a regular person; none of them were eternal. Through service, military prowess, friendship, marriage and the like, people born into obscurity could die higher than they started, with their kids climbing higher still. Being knighted, catching a noble bachelor's eye, these were very real ways that common folk became the progenitors of significant houses.Of course, the social mobility was minute, most people died in on the rung on which they were born, and arbitrary, at the whims of those who already have power. But. How different exactly is that to what we have today? Most people die in the same wealth band they were born into, and most breakout successes received funding, investment, or just help from wealthier people.Now, I'm being a tad hyperbolic. I don't believe modern society is _as_ rigid as feudal society was. And there's another large difference, ownership. One of the defining features of feudalism is that the nobles own everything, the peasant class merely have lease to use things. That having been said, I think an inevitable trend of prolonged capitalism is a slow hut genuine progression (regression) to neo-feudalism. I mean, we're speeding towards a similar \\"you will own nothing\\" state. I think the issue with capitalism is not that it's evil, but that it's unstable. In that, if allowed to persist, it will, by necessity, become something else. Like how prolonged anarchy can't really exist because anarchy allows someone to claim power which in turn, undoes anarchy. And feudalism is capitalism's nearest stable state.","title":"CMV: Capitalism assumes an inherent inequality between people, even though according to the law in most first world countries we are supposed to be all equal"},{"text":"Yep.

The government turns around and loans that $20,000 to somebody at 6% interest for their college. That 6% interest covers the 4% interest the government has to pay on their bonds plus the administrative costs of the student loan program. That person pays back $30,000.That person pays back $25,000 in interest and $5,000 in principal, which means the government has also probably only paid off $5,000 of the $20,000 in bonds that they issued. The rest went towards interest on those bonds and administrative costs, so they haven't really made any money on this loan. The government stops collecting money any more money on that loan.The government has to continue paying interest on the $15,000 in bonds that they haven't paid off yet, and they're aren't receiving payments to offset that cost any more once the student debt is forgiven, so that causes the national debt to increase going forward. Can you explain how loaning out $20,000 and being repaid $30,000 means that the lender has lost $15,000 instead of making $10,000?The $15,000 in bonds are a liability for the government while the $15,000 they've loaned out is an asset, so they're at net $0. Forgive the loan they gave out, and they still have the liability, but no longer have the asset, so they go to -$15,000.","title":"30 million student-loan borrowers get bad news after a Trump-appointed federal judge officially blocks Biden from carrying out broader debt cancellation"},{"text":"2036 election: centrally planned global economy vs far right historical revisionist Nirvana interpolation parody song Save Europe","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No. They just care deeply about them all.

Snowden was granted Asylum in Russia.  There are huge signs from 2007 onward that the SVR RF recruited Snowden in Geneva..  Snowden may also had contact with the SVR when he was stationed in New Dehli.  Snowden most likely got his contract job with Booz Allen Hamilton for the NSA at the insistence of the Russians..  Snowden's role was to archive the daily feeds of the huge data that was sucked up by the NSA like a drift net.Most of the documents (around 1.5 million files) didn't pertain to huge data storage of Americans, but documents pertaining how the US acquired and process the huge drift net of Globlal Telecommunications, which Foreign Intelligence services would like to know..Snowden gave the information to the Russians.  It is better PR to portray Snowden as a Civil Libertarian than as a controlled Russian Spy, but Snowden was most likely a controlled Russian Spy..Snowden wasn't going to go to Ecuador, or Iceland.. Both Countries have extradition treaties with the US, Iceland is part of NATO, which has further security agreements with the US..  Snowden was heading to Moscow, his popping up  in Hong Kong after a month's absence from his job, was most likely no fluke either.. After Snowden's US Passport was revoked in Hong Kong, the Russians went out of their way to give him a Russian Visa..(Snowden spent his 30th Birthday at the Russian Consulate in Hong Kong)  The NSA has been acquiring information of pretty much all telecommunication between the US and other countries since the 1950s, first tapping transatlantic cables, (Which the US used this expertise to tapped Soviet cables in the Pacific and Atlantic in the 1970s, that the Walker Spy Ring exposed to the Soviets for a price).  In the 1960s, things became a bit easier with Satellite Telecommunications, which was a focal point for global telecommunications..  The building of the 1970s super computers like the Cray, were tailored to process and stored all these communications.  Was the NSA going overboard and poking holes in FISA Act? Yes it was. The US Gov't decided to put is huge foreign telecommunications surveillance onto the Domestic US during the 2000s, and after 9/11/2001..  Hence why there was hand wringing by many Bush Administration Officials, including then DOJ Deputy Attorney, James Comey..  Snowden most likely lived in a compound for elite retired Russian Agents.  He had handlers tied to the elites of the Russian Government since his arrival to Moscow..  Snowden's relationship with the Russians did not start in 2013, it most likely started years before, when Snowden got the interests of the Russians in Geneva..  Snowden will find out as other US defectors to the Soviet Union and Russia, that Russia is a tough place to live.. Snowden left his US Police State for a Russian Police State.","title":"CMV: Edward Snowden is an American hero w/o an asterisk."},{"text":"And yet, most of the people in my life think Google is spying on them because of the one occasion in every ten thousand where the ad is oddly pertinent","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yes, but they use those cities to more than offset the rest of the state that tends to vote Red.

And plenty of obese people have numerous procedures and long lasting health complications for a span of years before they die.I suppose what you'd have to find is the average lifetime healthcare cost of an obese person vs a non-obese person.

And why wouldn't they? The CEO doesn't contribute anything to the running of the company. Most CEOs are only concerned with endless growth and maximizing profits.I work in startups. In most successful startups, the founder(s) build and distribute the first version of the product. A small number of startups outsource, but they tend not to get very far because that outsourcing indicates a skill gap in the founding team.You can get pretty far with this model, and as you do, you slowly give away your jobs. Technical founders go from engineers, to engineering managers, to architects, to technical strategists as the company evolves. Commercial founders go from salespeople, to sales leaders, to strategists. Every time, the giving away of a job looks like finding the right person to capture that part of the business. It takes real to recognise real, and so being great individually is necessary to hire the right talent to fill the role most successfully.That founder spirit - the boots on ground, in the trenches spirit, can often become a limiter as the company grows. The hallmarks of a startup CEO not giving up their job are horrible unstable qualities: the tendency to march around the halls critiquing and slashing at delegated work not being done to the standard that they would have done it; the tendency to insist upon being the final point for decisionmaking; the tendency towards radical action out of frustration. All of these qualities are natural qualities of an effective, hardworking person who cares about producing good work, but at a certain scale they start to work against you. This can happen earlier than you'd think - even at only 30-50 people in an org, if a founder won't give up their roles then the whole org is kneecapped until the founder changes or is replaced.It obviously can't be the case that the CEO of a 5 person company can vanish without impact, so at what point is it your belief that a CEO's job is done and they should dematerialise?","title":"CMV: Capitalism assumes an inherent inequality between people, even though according to the law in most first world countries we are supposed to be all equal"},{"text":"Talk is cheap","title":"Harris says she backs legalizing marijuana, going further than Biden"},{"text":"Can you cite otherwise?","title":"Harris says she backs legalizing marijuana, going further than Biden"},{"text":"WHO??","title":"BREAKING: Taylor Swift reportedly lost 2 million unique listeners on Spotify after endorsing Kamala Harris."},{"text":"Europe doesn't even have oil.

There are exceptional people who start with very little and acquire vast fortunes but there are also tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of people who increase their total worth by orders of magnitude in a capitalist system.If you live in the United States, go try to get your nails done or your suits dry cleaned and I can almost guarantee you that you will find a Korean or Vietnamese family running that business. If you work in IT, you must count a great percentage of Indians or people from the former Soviet Union among your colleagues.These examples might seem modest to you but the standard of living of immigrants, especially those working in tech and research positions or owning small businesses is a tremendous improvement over where they came from and it is thanks to capitalism too.The alternative is to create a society where the government attempts to make people equal in their personal wealth and control of resources. To some extent all countries, even capitalist ones, do make some redistributive measures, social welfare programs paid for with taxes exist. But you can push this much harder, outlaw private property and ownership of businesses and a switch to centrally planned production as communist states have done in the past.

Unlike feudal systems where status was fixed by birth, capitalism allows social mobility, even if unequal starting points remain a challenge. Wealth inequality can emerge due to differences in skills, opportunities, and circumstances, but the system itself does not inherently mandate exploitation. Moreover, democratic institutions and laws in capitalist countries provide mechanisms to address abuses, protect workers, and regulate wealth accumulation, mitigating the kind of unchecked exploitation the argument suggests.Is it a perfect system? No, but it is the best one humans have come up with so far.","title":"CMV: Capitalism assumes an inherent inequality between people, even though according to the law in most first world countries we are supposed to be all equal"},{"text":"Is this based on anything I've said? Everyone has the potential to become rich in capitalism. But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to do that. And even if they were, this is just a theoretical idea because not everyone can be a CEO. Or can they? Who would be doing the work? Would there be different categories of CEOs, like \\"lowly workforce CEO\\"?But here's a question to counter yours: Where does your money come from? Are you generating it from thin air? Probably not. So it's coming from other people. Or companies. Why do companies have so much? Because they let people do the work but keep most profits for themselves. Does that seem fair? If you're a selfish business owner who wants to get rich you might say yes. If you're a lowly worker who doesn't want to be a selfish, manipulative corporate guy you might say no. But either way, why do you think that you need to get rich? Or that it is your god given right to do so? If getting rich only means that you've moved above everyone else?This isn't even \\"sharing your wealth\\" that I'm talking about here. It's simply treating everyone as equal. Companies don't like to share. They are selfish. Is that good? Something to base society on? You're not being harmed by sharing your company's profits with the people that are actually responsible for it.

I believe your take on socialist regimes is false, because your understanding seems to be heavily influenced by very innacurate depictions of the Soviet government in the west.There was still democracy, just a different type then the Liberal one.

Note here, that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from consequences of expression, which is why the fascists were killed during the purge. The leadership was collective, and there was no one man dictatorship, just a sort of president of the committee, with barely any more power than the rest of the members. Anyone with high education could rise to power, and everyone could attain high education.

I think the lack of housing is another big factor, creating a zero-sum mindset.I don't think there's a clear delineation between this type of racial anxiety, and outright xenophobia. I suppose we could consider the above post to be an example of low-level xenophobia if we're trying to categorize it.Actual xenophobia is undoubtedly another big driver of anti-immigrant sentiment.Sure I understand why you believe that but what I was getting at is: whats your solution then? How do you exterminate ideologies through a liberal framework?The devil will be in the details, and it's easier said than done. It's more of an aspirational policy direction rather than a well thought out policy prescription. It may be the case that it's too difficult in practice to outlaw particular extremist ideologies without doing excessive harm to free speech or without excessive unintended consequences. I am not fully committed to this, and I'd evaluate any given policy idea in this direction on its own merits. But my general perspective on all this is that to protect the liberal project, you need groups to feel safe and not alienated, and the existence of extremist ideologies inside a society is a force that leads to the failure of liberalism. The US hasn't gone through this yet because it has been bound by civic nationalism that has kept a lid on sectarianism and the ideological feedback loops that cause liberalism to fail. Maybe the solution is to implement policies that push civic nationalism, instead of implementing policies that ban divisive ideologies?","title":"Biden Will Allow Legal Permission to Lapse for Migrants From 4 Countries"},{"text":"piers isnt a centrist. never was. he is a shill","title":"As a Moderate Democrat, I don't get why there are 'enlightened centrists' like Piers Morgan who say they prefer Trump over Harris because of the 'culture wars' and 'wokeism'.

But not everyone views immigration that way. I believe there's unease in the white majority about becoming an ethnic plurality instead of an ethnic majority. Gen Z for example is about 50% white in the US. The great replacement conspiracy theory is that this is coordinated. I don't think it's coordinated, so I reject that conspiracy theory.

In the 1990s, this was an abstract, far away concept, that didn't trigger a defense mechanism. Now that it's actually happening, it's become more real, and many in the US and Europe would rather sacrifice liberal attitudes rather than sacrifice their position in society as the dominant group. For most people on the right, this isn't hardcore xenophobia, it's more of an unease and uncertainty that comes from being a non-majority group, and a desire for guaranteed \\"safety\\" that comes from being the majority. This attitude is reinforced by Islamism on the one hand, and anti-white (\\"anti-colonial\\") attitudes on the other. Even though these ideologies are subscribed to by only a small number of people, they are visible on media and contribute to the uncertainty. This is one reason why my brand of liberalism is to outlaw authoritarian ideologies.

Research topics include coastal and inland flood and inundation mapping and forecasting, and next-generation water modeling activities, including modernized precipitation frequency studies.  \\n...  \\nIn recent years, the increasing frequency and severity of coastal and inland flooding, extreme precipitation and other weather events have highlighted the urgent need for better prediction and resilience strategies. Rising sea levels, driven by climate change, are exacerbating these challenges and putting coastal communities at greater risk. These funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help communities prepare for a range of climate impacts and will directly benefit policymakers, emergency responders, researchers and the general public. Todays announcement is part of more than $6 billion being invested by NOAA in habitat restoration, weather forecasting, and community resilience to weather and climate events through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.  \\n...  \\nInvestigating the complex interactions between the ocean, atmosphere and land systems is key to creating more accurate forecasts. Funded projects range from refining long-term water level predictions to better understanding natural climate patterns like the El NinoCSouthern Oscillation to developing real-time flood risk prediction systems. Others focus on updating climate risk information to inform resilience strategies for communities as well as our nations infrastructure, including major bridges, power plants and ports.  \\n...  A list of recipients and the scope of their projects is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:Thanks to President Bidens historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this investment will help boost NOAAs efforts to address the rising threat of climate change  putting us on the path to becoming more climate resilient and giving future generations the information and resources needed to tackle the climate crisis, said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.Statement from NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D.:By integrating cutting-edge science and technology into prediction tools, we are working to equip communities to prepare for and respond to water-driven climate impacts on our path to becoming a climate-ready nation, said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. These efforts enhance our nations resilience and underscore NOAAs commitment to supporting sustainable and informed decision-making in the face of climate variability and change.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration, NOAA funds over $22.78 M to advance research of water-related climate impacts"},{"text":"Lets ask Doug","title":"Kamala Harris to appear on \\"Call Her Daddy\\" podcast"},{"text":"https://x.com/Valen10Francois/status/1842151400261738502Not, of course, actually a bad thing... but somehow sad nevertheless.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The Iraq war was the best thing to happen in the 21st century.

Harris needs to gain huge traction from the senior vote and college educated demographic.  Personally, I think you are right, but there's a chance that a loss in those demographics I mentioned (including union support) can be counterweighted by seniors and educated whites.  A historically low turnout is also a path for Harris.  Not impossible. My prediction is that Trump will win NC, GA and PA by 2-3 pts each and it'll be called by midnight on election night.  I think Harris wins WI and NV... AZ and MI will be too close to call on election night but they won't matter.
