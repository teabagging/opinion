Or how about the article by pro democratic media planting the seed that the constitution might be bad for this country?How about what Thomas Jefferson said regarding the constitution? In a letter to James Madison he stated a firm belief that [the constitution should be handed off to the next generation every 20 years](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jefferson-memorial-education-each-new-generation.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20letter%2C%20Jefferson%20states,repair%20as%20they%20see%20fit) to amend and repair as they saw fit.

And second, both parties (R and D) rig their primaries by limiting who is even allowed to run. Oh sure, anyone can run, but they have to collect delegates themselves without the help or support of what the party leadership wants to do. The choices put in front of you at primary time are choices that the two parties have already made for you in the first place.

It's the massive, or formerly massive, christian voting bloc.Think the Good Friday Agreement and our curiously high attention to Ireland. It's because the Irish American voting bloc is substantial.*Christians,* not Arabs nor Jews, are the relevant concern regarding ~~the Holy Land~~ Israel. Given that Israel/Palestine is strategically irrelevant and a burden to our diplomatic standing, the question to any President is, is the cost worth chasing these Christian voters?For Republicans who chase this dying voting bloc, the answer is YES.For Biden, whose career was built around respecting these voting blocs (Irish, religious, Cuban,) the answer appears to be yes. He seems to still think religious voters will swing a Democrat's way over this issue.For \\"younger\\" Obama (he's 63 now) the answer appears to be leaning yes but with conditions. Seems he's more attuned to the fact religious voters are ebbing out of relevance.Harris (59) is under the Biden admin but is closer to age to Obama. She could very well value religious voters even less than Obama, especially given she built her career in California.We're not going to be getting Democrat Presidents of Biden's generation anymore (80+,) nor of Clintons (75+.) By the time of the next cycle they'll be nearing 80+, something Biden dropped out of the race over.Meanwhile Younger Democrats are more attuned to the fact that religious voters continue to decline and veer right, well outside of relevance to the Democrats.

Trump regularly outperforming GOP Senate candidates, when it was the other way around in 2016 and 2020? Like what the fuck is up with *Arizona*? And he's tied in the polls and in the Rust Belt, up in the Sun Belt, but within a few points in *Texas* and *North Carolina*? And his campaign is littered with signs that I would ordinarily say pointed to low turnout -- his rallies being much smaller and struggling to fill those venues, with attendees leaving early. The huge fundraising issues the GOP has had, down to having to spend most of their money in just two states (PA and GA) to achieve spending parity with Dems, and the broke state GOP's outsourcing GOTV and voter contact to third-party vendors that appear to be pocketing the money and not doing the work?But polling shows neck and neck! And I just *really can't believe* there's a systemic *pro-Trump* polling error, even though I know it's a possibility (and know pollsters HAVE made multiple changes, both in 2016 and this year, to really really REALLY make sure they don't undercount) And then there's 2022 -- which should have been a BIG GOP win and wasn't -- and then especially there's *Dobbs*, which was driving huge Democratic turnout and 60-40 abortion access wins in places like Ohio! Seriously, absent polling, I'd have said this looks like a high-turnout D, low-turnout R, compounded by the GOP skimping on ground game and having no answer to abortion, and their culture war alternative (transphobia) polling poorly even among their own voters.But again, neck and neck in the polls and I just cannot believe there's some systemic skew overcounting Trump, not after two cycles of undercounting him.

In many if not all cultures, people will think that its preferable to destroy what we have rather than continuously improve it because theres this sense, especially in the US, that periodic revolution and rebirth is an unavoidable societal requirement rather than a simple misfortune to avoid. I believe this is how we ended up with Trump - that many craved a crash-and-burn upheaval of the status quo rather than to methodically and effortfully fix and tune our issues and deficiencies.Performance of waste is usually described in regards to festivals and carnivals - parties - where money is spent to show a family or community has money to burn. In terms of American politics, I see waste performed by Trump supporters voting to elect this chaotic maniac who will continuously attempt to destroy the country through harebrained schemes, ignorance of governance, greed, and delusion. The performance is done by the voter who believes Trumps jaguars will eat the faces off of the entire country but not _their_ country. They believe their personal, rural culture is so strong, Trump will destroy everything but them.Likewise, young college-aged adults tend to believe that the problems we face are so complex and the candidates are all so imperfect, we may as well elect a chaos-maker who will burn the country down for us to rebuild more perfectly.Unfortunately, both parties misunderstand that the jaguars eat all faces. They are both more dependent on the federal government than they know. And Trump has no desire or ability to burn this city over here but not this rural county over there. Last, there is no rebuilding after Trumps next move. Project 2025 doesnt work like that.","title":"Opinion: I'm a college student, and Kamala Harris is my only option for president"},{"text":"Horrible Harris supporters may soon be asking how's the view from under the bus. ??","title":"Biden-Harris Admin Paves Way For Bureaucrats To Take Gender-Confused Kids From Non-Affirming Parents"},{"text":"He was promised to be paid to be there.

They are not serious about toppling the regime at all. And this translates into U.S. policy too. Basically U.S. does whatever Israel wants. The utility to Israel is multidimensional.First, its brings Arabs into Israels lap (ie saudis / Qatar/ uae etc) - since they are scared of Iran they are ALL aligning with Israel - and this is hugely beneficial to Israel. Israelis are all over Dubai investing, raising capital etc. for example. Israelis are selling arms and surveillance equipment to Qatar and Saudis etc. its big business. You see them (Israelis) all over the region. Making Iran into an evil monster has real value to Israel.Second, Netanyahu has an enemy he can scare Israelis with and gain votes. Its so much more critical - domestically in so many ways. There are large numbers of Iranian-Israelis that make a critical difference during elections. Theres the constant state of war and arms industry domestically. Its a scare tactic to get more aid from the U.S. its massively useful to Netanyahu.Third, it provides an ongoing pretext to sanction and contain Iran - and keep Iran out of Israels markets. This goes beyond exports to Israeli aligned states like Azerbaijan or UAE  this is about oil and gas global markets. If you dont already know Israel discovered massive quantities of gas off its coast in the Mediterranean. When Israeli-Ukrainian Zelensky pushed Putin into invading Ukraine - and thus to the cut off of Russian exports to Europe, it turned out Israel was a huge beneficiary. Even the invasion of Gaza and the imminent invasion of Lebanon has an oil and gas dimension to it  there are massive gas fields right off Gaza and Lebanons north coast. Israel is now exporting record volumes of lng to Europe  both directly and indirectly via terminals in Egypt. Starting a pissing match with Iran helps paint Iran as the enemy - and has given Israel a pretext to invade Lebanon  even Hamas is painted as an Iranian proxy. Plus they can keep Iran out of Europes market with sanctions etc. Iran by the way has the second largest gas reserves in The world behind Russia. U.S. has been a massive exporter to the EU of lng. Its amazing how both US and Israel had unused - new terminals and ships - ready the day Russia was sanctioned. We are taking hundreds of ships and dozens of terminals  billions of dollars worth out in place way before Ukraine was invaded. The last thing Israel wants is the regime in Tehran to be toppled. They will kill Iranian scientists working on nukes but will stop short of toppling the regime or enabling a regime change. Money talks and bullshit walks. Or in the immortal words of deep throat  follow the money!! Dont for a second forget that Israel gave Iran - the same Mullahs - arms during the Iran-Iraq war. Lots of arms. They dont really want the regime gone.","title":"The Deep State has wanted war with Iran for decades.

Everyone seems too busy squabbling about just how unfair things are for black people that they never stop to wonder just why the Chinese excel and arguably over achieve, despite having very similar obstacles and difficulties to overcome. For me a big factor is having a strong family to rely on. This is a slightly tricky discussion for people to get into because the black community has such a high proportion of absentee fathers. Black men don't need a business loan, they need to stay with their wives and children. Same goes for white people too of course, the rising trend of marriages and families dissolving is worrying to say the least.","title":"So just Black Men? I guess White and Brown are getting fucked.

I don't know what country you're from, but Bernie Sanders has extremely reasonable policies which as you said, are commonplace in many other countries.

Maybe Trump is sundowning, but this event wasn't actually at all unusual to anyone who's ever been to an evangelical church service.That's what this was.  People sway awkwardly to random music for 40 minutes while their leader \\"leads\\" them.  The background has replaced a cross with a big banner that says \\"**Trump was Right About Everything**\\".This is actually completely normal to them, because it's a church service for people who don't actually believe or understand religion.  Or to put another way, their religious lives have become so empty that this fills that behavioral role for them.  It gives them an in-group (MAGA), it gives them an out-group (everyone else), and it gives them a simple purpose (take control of the country).  It doesn't make any demands on their morality like a religion might.  It doesn't ask you to make any confessions of faith (though lots of MAGAs will).  You don't have to even believe in anything (most MAGAs know Trump is a liar and a scumbag).They get religious fulfillment from this.  This was a religious service.And that's (part of) why it's neck and neck in the polls.  All around the world, we've seen the decline of religiosity in western democracies. America is still (on-paper) quite religious, but like many western democracies, church attendance is plummeting.  Religious cohesion and meaning is in decline.  An increasing number of people are okay with that or adapting to it in healthy ways.But the people who have that hole in their brain that still needs a religion-shaped-peg will fill it with politics if they have to.  That's this.  That's MAGA.  That's Trumpism.  That's the White / Nationalist / Conservative / Traditionalist / Fascist / Patriarchy Buffet that they're all going to, where they pick and choose what their republican vote means to them.  That's the broad story that seems to be happening in all western democracies to some degree or another.  And the only thing stopping it from taking over is the mostly apathetic middle-of-the-road voters who don't really give this stuff much thought and probably won't vote anyway.Heaven help us.","title":"Imagine if Biden did this!"},{"text":"You mean for Trumps shit","title":"Do you think this guy on the left is re-evaluating his life choices?"},{"text":"Yes.

Everybody believes in things that are illogical or they lack evidence for, its a completely normal part of human behavior. We are hardwired to see patterns of causality that, in all reality, do not necessarily exist but it makes it easier for us to understand and explain the world we live in if we simply just take for granted that it is. The fundamental issue with zealotry/fundamentalism is not a lack of evidence. If I go outside and do a rain dance and later that week it rains, I can always point to that as evidence of my rain dance working. What we define as evidence is entirely a debatable conceptThe problem is that a zealot/fundamentalist has come to a conclusion upon which they no longer just believe is correct, but that it is the ONLY correct explanation. Because it is the ONLY correct explanation, all other explanations must therefore be wrong. Because all other explanations are wrong, the people who believe in those other explanations must also be wrong and those who spread such obvious misinformation to others must be resisted or stopped. Because of those people who are spreading misinformation, we must also spread our correct information to these people so that they no longer believe the wrong things.This is the psychology of a zealot/fundamentalist they have PLENTY of evidence that they will find utterly convincing and indisputable.

Role of Third Parties   - U.S. Challenges for Third Parties: Third parties in the U.S. face systemic barriers, including the difficulty of getting on ballots, limited media coverage, and a lack of access to debates. The Electoral College system further limits their impact in presidential elections, as they are unlikely to win states and thus receive electoral votes.   - Other Countries' Inclusion of Small Parties: In contrast, third parties often play significant roles in countries with multi-party systems. For example, in the United Kingdom, while it is a majoritarian system like the U.S., smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats or regional parties in Scotland and Wales have greater influence. In countries with proportional representation, even small parties can influence policy and participate in governance by joining coalitions15?source. 5. Stability vs. Flexibility   - Stability in the U.S.: The two-party system in the U.S. is often considered stable because it simplifies the choice for voters and reduces the frequency of coalition negotiations. However, it can also limit new political ideas from gaining traction at the national level.   - Flexibility in Other Systems: Multi-party systems provide greater flexibility, allowing for shifts in political alliances and the emergence of new parties that represent evolving voter interests. This can lead to more dynamic political landscapes, but it may also result in less stable governments, especially when coalition negotiations are difficult or fail.In summary, the U.S. system is characterized by its dominance of two major parties, a first-past-the-post electoral mechanism, and significant barriers to third-party success. This contrasts with the multi-party systems in many other democracies, where proportional representation fosters a broader range of political voices and often leads to coalition governments. The U.S. approach offers stability but can be less adaptable to new political movements compared to multi-party systems, which, while sometimes less stable, better accommodate a variety of perspectives. \\"","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"Thank you for voting!","title":"Sundowning dementia. Id bet my non-medical license on it"},{"text":"Because I am lazy, here is a nice summary care of Chat GPT. The part that interests me is that all of the systems in place to maintain the 2 party system also reduce the odds of a progressive party or candidate making serious waves in the USA. As long as the 2 party system holds, the USA will be a right wing country. \\"The U.S. two-party system is distinct from many other political systems around the world due to its structure, dynamics, and electoral mechanisms. Here are some key differences: 1. Dominance of Two Major Parties   - U.S. Structure: The political landscape in the United States is overwhelmingly dominated by two parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These two parties have been the primary contenders for power for over 150 years. While third parties exist (such as the Libertarian Party or the Green Party), they rarely win significant offices or influence national policy.   - Other Countries: Many democracies use multi-party systems, where several parties have a genuine chance of gaining seats in the legislature and forming coalitions. For example, in countries like Germany, Italy, and Israel, multi-party systems lead to coalition governments, as no single party often has a majority11?source. 2. Electoral System: First-Past-the-Post (FPTP)   - U.S. System: The U.S. uses a first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system for most elections, including congressional and presidential races. In FPTP, the candidate with the most votes wins, even without a majority. This system tends to favor larger parties because votes for smaller parties often do not translate into representation, creating a winner-takes-all environment.   - Proportional Representation: In contrast, many countries with multi-party systems use proportional representation (PR). In PR systems, parties gain seats in proportion to the percentage of votes they receive. This allows smaller parties to win representation in the legislature, contributing to a broader spectrum of political voices. Examples include Sweden, the Netherlands, and New Zealand12?source14?source. 3. Political Polarization   - U.S. Polarization: The U.S. two-party system has become highly polarized, with Democrats and Republicans often holding divergent views on major issues. This polarization can limit bipartisan cooperation and lead to gridlock in policymaking. The structure of the system encourages candidates to appeal to the bases of their respective parties rather than building broader coalitions.   - Other Systems: In many countries with multi-party systems, the need for coalition-building fosters compromise among parties with differing viewpoints. For instance, in Germany, parties like the Social Democrats (SPD), Christian Democrats (CDU), Greens, and others often negotiate to form coalition governments that represent a broader range of interests11?source.","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"If you look past the headlines its a program for all citizens and thats the estimated number of black people who are expected to participate.Edit: typo","title":"So just Black Men?

Almost certainly not.Netanyahu wants Trump to win, so he's going to give a huge middle finger to Biden any chance he gets.Edit:  I realize later that I made a reasonable post that is almost pitch perfect to piss everybody off, because it notes that Israel has likely committed war crimes but doesn't go with the credulous nonsense that all we need to do is turn off weapons shipments and everything will be fine.","title":"Biden (Finally) Threatens to Halt Arms to Israel Over Gaza Carnage"},{"text":"Democat","title":"My conservative boomer Mormon parents have voted against Trump and have only gotten more liberal since 2016."},{"text":"I didn't express an opinion on whether it was \\"okay\\" in my opinion.But the powerful generally get away with things like this with minimal consequences, yes.","title":"Biden Tells Iran Assassinating Trump Would Be an Act of War"},{"text":"Huh, they made sure to include \\"President\\" in his title.","title":"Biden Tells Iran Assassinating Trump Would Be an Act of War"},{"text":"throw em in prison? oh no, that's from her cali days","title":"Kamala Harris releases her plan for black men - everybody hates it - Dr Boyce Watkins"},{"text":"I would still pick jimmy carter over him for my dodgeball team.","title":"Trump is physically and mentally unfit.

The country has reportedly kept a kind of hit list for former Trump administration officials who were part of the 2020 decision to have Iranian General Qasem Soleimani killed in an airstrike. Mr. Biden relayed his message to the highest levels of the Iranian government through international partners, according to the Post. The threat comes just days before the 2024 presidential election that has seen an unprecedented level of violence directed at Trump. Trump has already faced two assassination attempts this year, neither of which has been tied to Iran. Congress quickly allocated more money and manpower to Trumps security detail in the wake of these attempts on his life for fear of a more sophisticated operation by Iranian intelligence services.

If the venue has puchased rights to a song through a licensing package through a performing rights organization, they have a legal license to play that song but not necessarily *permission*. Artists can revoke permission for that license however, and they do, often for specific cases like this where they explicitly do not want someone to play their music. This is why many artists ask for permission in advance of these kind of venues, particularly political ones.When this happens the performing rights organization will inform the venue that a cease-and-desist has been issued where the artist has revoked their license to play that song and that doing so constitutes a legal violation. In a few circumstances this has been done and Trump's campaign has ignored those cease-and-desists.More details here, along with an interesting history of artists that have opposed Trump's use of their music: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music#:~:text=Venues%20and%20political%20campaigns%20can,a%20campaign's%20Political%20Entities%20License.","title":"Looking forward to the \\"Real men have dementia\\" MAGA attire"},{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't seen more about the Safe Harbor deadline.

My point is, to hate an entire group of people, and judge everyone within this self-defined group as if they were one vehement detriment, you should know that what *you* believe in is true over what *they* believe in. The thing is, you cant. If you think you can, thats just another bias inlaid within your personal ideology. We are all clueless, blind lemmings falling off the cliff.

Grifters are people whose ideological shifts coincide with either their financial interests or obtaining power.  This can be contrasted with principled actors (eg the Massies or the likes of Sanders) who have transparent principles that make their actions predictable over long periods of time.  For all the criticisms you want to lob at the likes of Kyle, he's been principled and consistent over time compared to the people he's criticizing.  Which I think fuels his frustration because he feels like he's stayed on course while others are folding to audience pressure/capture.There are obvious cases like Russell Brand, where the ideological shift is clearly cynical and goes along with a religious conversion.  Tulsi is another case as after a period of inactivity she returns to raise tons of money from naive Trump supporters and raise money via social media...money that apparently mostly gets funneled into her religious organization.  People like Jimmy Dore are a tougher case, because the bump he got from orienting his channel towards naive Trump supporters is beginning to wear off now that he's lost his former audience.  And of course his I/P coverage can hardly be described as grifting, since it's quite courageous.  But ultimately his channel did better with the populist vax-skeptical content than it ever did as a leftist channel and this financial incentive undoubtedly played a major role in egging on his arc.  At the end of the day he doesn't want to be doing this forever and if he wants to retire he needs $.  Matt Taiibbi is yet another example--in his case the audience capture comes via substack.  Don't discount how much money post-lefters can make via catering to the right-wing audience on Rumble either.  In general, you seem to be overlooking how much pressure there is to conform to the manufactured political climate and advocate lesser-evilist or conspiracist positions that are more understandable to a naive and unpoliticized audience without much class consciousness.  You also seem to be overlooking the long-term cumulative impact of the billionaire propaganda behind Rumble on the political culture and political discourse, which coincides with billionaires promoting \\"right populism\\" as a phony alternative all across the western world.  Meloni in Italy being a good example of what these billionaire backed populists would do if they got into power.    The \\"Rescue The Republic\\" event was an excellent example of grifters at work because as recently as a year ago Dore and/or Taibbi would have been embarrassed to speak at a pro-establishment pro-Trump event like that.  There was a \\"Rage Against the War Machine\\" event for principled actors and the grifters chose to skip that and speak to the pro-genocide audience.Even relatively principled people actors like Sabby Sabs feel the need to \\"grift\\" in the sense of choosing cheesy horserace video titles in order to draw in viewers accustomed to the \\"dems bad\\" clickbait.","title":"Rant on \\"Grifters\\" claim that Democratic Extremists like Kyle and Krystal Make"},{"text":"As an Austrian I can tell you the dude just makes shit up for whoever pays him.

Religious fundamentalists could argue that things that seem logically inconsistent are just God's way, but climate change extremists at least seem bound by some form of logical consistency.Many of the measures advocated by climate change extremists are counter-productive to their own cause. You sabotage an oil pipeline, that oil starts getting moved around by trucks that burn oil instead of flowing through pipes that have far more efficient pumps. You sabotage a refinery, the oil that would have gone to it just gets transported further (using dirty means) to get refined somewhere else until the refinery gets rebuilt (and that will have its own environmental impacts). You shutdown fracking in the US and people ship in oil from the middle east instead. Even absent the more extreme levels, a lot of policies that try to address climate change end up backfiring. Some policies seek to limit emissions in certain countries, which results in moving industry to other countries, which requires building more infrastructure in those other countries which results in more emissions. Fifteen years ago the US had the \\"cash for clunkers\\" program that took a bunch of old cars off the road and replaced them with more fuel efficient vehicles, but the environmental impact of manufacturing a bunch of new cars instead of using existing ones resulted in more emissions over the lifetime of the cars than leaving the old ones in service would have.To that end, there's no amount of evidence that would make these behavior consistent with the stated goal.","title":"CMV: The problem with Fundamentalists/Extremists isn't their behavior, it's their lack of evidence."},{"text":"trumps mentally unfit. thats the realitywatch how the media sanewashes trump. its like they cant let him lose, cuz they have to milk the traffic/ratings","title":"Kamala Harriss Campaign Is Not in a Good Place"},{"text":"to them, all you have to do to be a trump voter is not stopping your day to pray to the god of blue maga at minimum four times.","title":"Look, I bet those evil unredeemable isr4eli death squads were just following orders"},{"text":"I also plan on living long enough to vote for Kamala","title":"Jimmy Carter Achieves His Goal, Lives Long Enough to Vote for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"...to be fair it wasn't because she was molested by homeless men.

The average voter isn't neatly put on a left-right scale. What is more accurate is that they have a range of positions, many of which are typically progressive. For example, depending on how you phrase the question, most Americans support universal health, not just the far left. Most Americans support the legalisation of weed. Most Americans would prefer the president be elected by popular vote. Most Americans support a wealth tax. Most Americans support free tuition for public universities. More Americans think we are spending too much on the military, not too little. These are not \\"far left\\" positions, at least to the general population.Now this is anecdotal, but from talking to some people in more rural communities that have been more historically left behind (i.e. many people of many of the important swing states this election) it seems that they are much more likely to support populist economic policy such as a wealth tax or free tuition for university. That's why states like Iowa have shifted so incredibly to Trump, because his rhetoric is extremely populist (note: I am not saying his policy is, but people vote more based on rhetoric than reading reports from the Heritage foundation). So sure, I don't think Americans, especially those in swing states would vote for Vladimir Lenin, they certainly would vote for a typical democrat who has injected some of these more populist policies into their campaign. This would mobilise more left behind voters than alienating people who vote purely on the basis that we shouldn't have universal healthcare yet would have otherwise supported the democrats.","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"That's the number for the whole state That's fewer than voted in my *district* in the midterms","title":"Wyoming Democrats urge their voters to come home as party numbers sag"},{"text":"shitty headline. should have been Democrats preparing countermeasures to prevent an Insurrection Jan 6 v2.0 in 2025.","title":"Democrats in Congress are planning for the next Jan. 6"},{"text":"Not we, Lieberman bailed on the public option, the actual party was behind it.

That said, its crucial to challenge the idea that theyre inherently conservative-coded. Symbols like the American flag were designed to represent shared valuesdemocracy, freedom, and justicerather than specific ideologies. The issue arises when these symbols are co-opted by reactionary movements, which equate them with exclusionary, hyper-nationalist ideals. This distorts their meaning and alienates those who dont subscribe to those ideologies.Many MAGA supporters claim to be patriotic, yet their fixation on Trump undermines genuine patriotism. True patriotism is about loyalty to democratic values and principles, not blind allegiance to an individual. By elevating Trump above the nation itself, they fall into a cult of personality that contradicts the very foundations of American democracy: that no one person is greater than the system. This devotion to Trump, who has undermined the rule of law and dismissed the peaceful transfer of power, betrays the ideals they claim to uphold. Their actions, from flying Trump flags above the American flag to violating the U.S. Flag Code, reveal a misguided understanding of patriotism.This dynamic is mirrored in their relationship with Christianity. Much like their political allegiance to Trump, many MAGA adherents prioritize political ideology over the core teachings of Christ. They distort Christian values to justify exclusion and power-seeking, abandoning principles like compassion, humility, and love of neighbor. In both caseswhether its patriotism or Christianitythey reduce profound beliefs into tools for tribalism and self-interest, hollowing out the deeper moral core of both.Scholars like Benedict Anderson argue that nations are imagined communities. Symbols like flags create a sense of belonging, but they arent tied to a fixed or inherently conservative vision of the nation. Its entirely possible to reclaim these symbols for a broader, more inclusive identity that reflects the countrys diversity and evolving ideals.The issue lies not with the symbols themselves, but with how theyve been used to promote harmful forms of nationalism that reject pluralism. Liberals can embrace patriotism without succumbing to nationalism by advocating for a national identity grounded in democratic values, inclusivity, and the pursuit of continual improvement.","title":"America Is Suffering an Identity Crisis - In two years, the U.S. will mark its 250th birthday, and the left doesnt seem to care-giving up on Americas symbols and its very meaning."},{"text":"Also way outspending on YouTube","title":"Democrats outspend Republicans on airwaves in crucial House races, with California and New York leading the way"},{"text":"There is a reason it is \\"democratic republic\\" and not \\" republican democracy \\"","title":"The Democrats Are the Only True Defenders of the Constitution"},{"text":"As opposed to 1 AM in the evening.","title":"Sundowning dementia.

Those behaviors tend to be problematic when their beliefs have no evidence, but if they believed the right things without evidence then their behaviors would be fine.

And my issue is you could perhaps say the NBC nightly news had a sort of liberal bias , but compared to right wing talk radio what was literally right wing propaganda it looked fair and balancedSo I think much of it was overblown and it seemed like even the news shows that were accused of having a liberal bias was still news and still tried to be objective while the conservative ones were pure propaganda and did not even try or claim to be balanced .","title":"Imagine if Biden did this!"},{"text":"Yeah it's not like I gave an example of just that happening very recently.","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"Always question media narratives and confirm if what they are saying is accurate Here's the full video where Trump said.https://youtu.be/JmaZR8E12bs?si=hTvMCN--mkdQxNtfAnd no, I am not a Trump fan","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"well, yes, I understand the estate of o'connor would in no way want the music associated with Trump. what I'm speculating about is that there may be some licensing thing that Trump's camp has that allows them to legally use the song (eg Foo Fighters earlier this year)","title":"Looking forward to the \\"Real men have dementia\\" MAGA attire"},{"text":"100% agree. Idk if I can really say theyre rigged but most of these races are somewhere between rigged and unfair. Couple more points because I could go on about this forever:1. The DCCC is strategic when it comes to endorsements. Early in the race theyll typically give out/lobby for a bunch of state and local level endorsements(nothing necessarily wrong with this, this is how endorsements are supposed to work), and as the race progresses, especially if its close, theyll drag out national level endorsements. One campaign I worked for seemed to actually be making good headway in internal polls and was not far behind the DCCC backed candidate, and then a week later she received a Joe Biden endorsement and the race was essentially over. 2. Theyll decide who they want to win early on in the race but ideally theyll know who theyre running a couple years before the race even starts. People are groomed for these positions and its largely related to how willing a candidate has been to fall in line with the party in the past at lower levels of government or power. 3. The most upsetting thing to me is that a lot of the time the people making these decisions about who will be allowed to run have no connection to the state or community that theyre making decisions for. Its people sitting in a boardroom in DC who have never been to Iowa in their life deciding that Theresa Greenfield should represent Iowa in the Senate.","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"Early voting starts today in Georgia, so I've already gone down to the election board offices and cast mine :) Now I can kick back, pack a bowl, and try to ignore the internet for the next 3 weeks.","title":"Kamala Harris pledges to support federal cannabis legalization"},{"text":"Was he really swaying to Nothing Compares 2 U?

The first are accelerationists, and they want exactly what you describe in your first sentence. Dems largely push for using incremental change to make people's lives better in the existing system. Accelerationists see this as preventing the people from rising up and joining the revolution, and so they push for Dems to lose with the idea that the more material conditions deteriorate, the more likely we are to finally see a Marxist revolution in the US. They are specifically aware that their actions will lead to multiple groups being severely harmed, but they are people who will largely be safe from that harm, either because they themselves reside in what they believe is a safe location (e.g., Brooklyn, LA, etc.) or because they are the sort of person who won't be harmed by the policies (e.g., the stereotypical white male leftist with parents who paid for college and may even help out with expenses as an adult). The other group believes that, if Dems lose and it's perceived even in part that they lost because leftists withheld their votes, then Dems will swing to the left and chase their vote in future elections. This group frequently makes moral arguments about voting and either lives in a safe area and is a member of a safe demo (lots of overlap with above) or believes the good they'd achieve by forcing the Dems left would make up for the harm of withholding their vote now (in 2016, these were the people saying things like \\"don't threaten me with the Supreme Court.\\"). The problem here is that it's naive. Those withholding their vote on moral grounds are effectively just refusing to engage with the actual consequences, and those believing the party will move to court their vote simply don't understand party politics or that, despite the bubble they surround themselves with, they are a small faction in a big coalition. The party will go where the votes are, and if they can pick up two in the middle for every one they lose on the left, then they're going to tack to the middle. On top of that, leftist purity challenges, e.g. attacking Biden first because the loan forgiveness wasn't big enough and then faulting him because the SCOTUS we got as a result of losing in 2016 blocked his attempts, guarantee not only that the party has to work a lot harder to get those votes than votes in the middle but also that attempts to go for those votes risk turning off more voters than it gains. And it's particularly frustrating because the GOP has already shown how a minority faction can take over the party, and it's by voting hard for the fringe in the primary and then showing up religiously to vote for the nominee every time. It takes decades to work, but eventually the fringe candidates they get in office become sizeable blocs in Congress, get serious influence in legislative priorities, and even get their candidates in the White House. Sadly, playing the long game doesn't seem to be on anyone's mind.The unfortunate reality is that politics requires constant compromise, and if you're goal is to do the most good for the most people, then it means frequently means swallowing policies you don't like or that you see as half-measures. Letting perfection be the enemy of the good is a luxury that can be afforded only by those who would be spared from the worst effects of failing to pass the good or prevent the harm, and those advocating for it either don't know or don't care that their advocacy actually makes what they claim to want even less likely.","title":"DNC launching Wisconsin ad attacking Green Party candidate Jill Stein"},{"text":"You arent acknowledging reality lol.

It had all the makings of a classic campaign stop: the brewery with dim lights and loud music, the pump-up speech culminating in a spirited call to action, the cheering fans queuing up for photos afterward.Only?[Elizabeth Warren](https://www.warren.senate.gov/), who is up for reelection this year, was in the wrong commonwealth, and she was promoting Kamala Harris, not?herself.In a late September visit that evoked, at times, her own presidential campaign, Warren was greeted as a returning hero by party faithful here in the?[collar counties outside Philadelphia](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philly-suburbs-harris-trump-democrats-growth-20240814.html), largely?[blue-leaning areas](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/inq2/voter-registration-demographics-pennsylvania-democrats-republicans-20240813.html)?where Democrats are hoping to run up the score to help them clinch this essential swing state.Her?traipse through the Philadelphia suburbs was just the latest out-of-state stop the senator has made as a surrogate for the Democratic ticket this year. Altogether, shes made eight visits, including one other trip in Pennsylvania and three to Wisconsin, another crucial swing state.The visits are a testament to Warrens continued star power on the national stage; fellow Democrats look to her as a powerful speaker and fundraiser, and the partys base still reveres her, as evidenced by the?[lengthy standing ovation](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/23/metro/massachusetts-democrats-elizabeth-warren-praise-kamala-harris-dnc/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)?she earned at the Democratic National Convention this summer.In Warrens telling, campaigning out of state is just one part of her work for Massachusetts constituents. But its hard not to see?it as a sign, too, of confidence about her prospects back home, where?[she is heavily favored over Republican John Deaton](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/08/nation/elizabeth-warren-john-deaton-senate-poll/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).The best thing I can do for the people of Massachusetts is make sure Donald Trump doesnt get elected president, Warren said in an interview on a recent Sunday afternoon, sipping a root beer at Pudges Steaks &amp; Hoagies in Blue Bell, Penn., as she waited for a cheesesteak with provolone, cheese whiz,?and no onions. What I can do best for Massachusetts is help maintain a majority in the Senate so that Democrats are the ones confirming Supreme Court justices, so that we can move our agenda forward on housing and child care.Warren was there to pick up lunch, not votes; she hardly stood out as anyone notable in her dark gray sweatshirt. She was nonetheless recognized on the way out by a woman who happily reported that she planned to vote for Harris in nearby Bucks County, an important battleground. As they wrapped up a brief chat, Warren encouraged the customer to vote for Democrats down-ballot, too.It was a pitch she had been making all day  to a whole bunch of Democrats who cant go down the ballot to vote for Warren herself.While Warren was in Pennsylvania that Sunday, Deaton was campaigning in Massachusetts, appearing at Dedham Day.?Deaton?[criticized Warren](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2024-09-23/john-deaton-says-if-hes-elected-to-us-senate-he-will-break-with-gop-on-some-issues)?in a recent radio interview for being loyal to the Democratic Party and her agenda and her own ambitions more than Massachusetts and America.The senator insists she is not writing off the campaign against Deaton, and emphasized her commitment to her home state. She has done dozens of campaign events in Massachusetts this year, including the day before she traveled to Pennsylvania on behalf of Harris. She has committed to two debates against Deaton, set for Tuesday and Thursday. (Deaton pushed for five debates; Warren said two would provide more than enough time to discuss the issues.)","title":"With her own race at home in Mass., Elizabeth Warren stumps in swing states for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"So run.

It would be great to live in a country again where conservatism still has a voice, and gets its needs fulfilled through the democratic process our Constitution has provided, but without upending democracy itself via a hostile seizure of powers. It would be great if we were always aware that our ways of living do not dictate how others should live, especially in a country that is supposed to be free and just.

Thank you for choosing the way you have and helping us all avoid the colossal pitfall of another Trump term.  A Harris term is not the end of Republicanism by a longshot.

Democrats went for a moderate candidate because they have a cross generational appeal. Sure, you might gain some Gen Z voters with a candidate farther to the left, but at the cost of a huge number of voters might not support. At this point the trade off isn't worth it from an electability standpoint:\\"* In 2020 Gen X, Baby Boomers and the Greatest generation had nearly 20%, 29% and 31% greater percentage points in their respective rates of voter registration than Millennials.\\n* I**n 2016 and 2020, Gen Z had the lowest rates of voter registration for any generational cohort.**\\n* Up until 2012, Gen X voter registration rates had near parity with Baby Boomers but a gap has grown over recent years, with Gen X experiencing declining voter registration rates until 2016 and a slight rebound in the most recent election cycles.--https://youngamericans.berkeley.edu/2024/04/voter-registration-rates-by-generation/\\"Hillary lost in 2016, Biden only won in 2020 because the country was in turmoil because of the pandemic, and this election will be extremely close despite going up against a felon with dementia.The situation in all cases was far more complicated than that. Hilary didn't lose primarily because she was centrist, particularly when comparing her claims vs trumps. Its not like leftists said F Hillary I'm voting for Trump. With respect to Biden in 2020, leaving out Jan 6 and all the other craziness aside from the Pandemic is kind of a big miss, I'm not sure how one would attribute the closeness there to Biden's centrism either.In 2016, the core Republicans didn't want Trump to win the nomination because they figured he was too far right, but they were clearly wrong. I think something similar could happen with the Democrats.I honestly don't know what this means. What are saying could happen with Democrats? That the \\"Core\\" won't want Harris, but she'll get elected anyway, or that if a far left candidate were in place they'd win in spite of that core? Meaning here isn't clear to me.I know I'm not the only Millenial and Gen Z person who would prefer a much further left candidate who will actually try to change things, so I think there are a ton of votes being left on the table.Sure, a ton of Millenial/Gen Z votes, which make up a smaller portion of the electorate (see above) than necessary to solely carry an election. That's why you need a candidate with broader appeal to win: You're not electing the President of Millenials/Gen Z, you're electing the President of the US, which serves the interests of a whole lot more people than that.The Republicans' strategy with all of their attack ads is to call the Democrats crazy, Socialist, extremist, Communist, etc so it wouldn't be any different if the candidate actually was further left.Republican claims on that front are generally false due to the extremity of their rhetoric. Shifting the political left closer to that extreme causes a few problems:(a) Their accusations would be harder to swat down, and(b) If one views their rhetoric as extreme, but justifiable if it were true; how can one justify consciously moving toward the dystopia they've imagined?To be clear, I'm not saying acting in a more lefty manner is equivalent to transforming the US into communist regime, and I'm with you on preferring more lefty solutions in some instances; but the argument you're making is essentially for the Left to consciously choose to be the boogey men the right has painted them as.If we're criticizing those critiques as extreme, but then seek to embody those critiques; we are necessarily choosing to be the thing we view as the most problematic version of ourselves.

You speak primarily about the president,  and while they are the face of the party, they have very little power to enact meaningful long-term change compared to congress. If we really want progressives to start taking power, then the vote needs to get out for these people in local elections and get them seats in the house. When the national party sees the people elected, it lets them know they are viable candidates,  and it lets those elected candidates start building a name for themselves to try and win higher offices.  The democratic national party does not have a ton of play in these smaller seats, and it has a lot more to do with small local donations and  knocking on doors activism from volunteers. \\n2. In a healthy functioning democracy the higher up the chain you go in terms of elections, the president being the only nationally voted seat,  the more that person should represent a middle ground between all sides because then everyone can feel like they have a seat at the table and can be invested in our nation's governing.  Unfortunately, we have one side that has decided to game the system instead of invest in it,  so they care more about winning power for themselves than actually governing and prioritizing party loyalty over holding any meaningful idealogy.  If we can fix that, that may result in a president who is more left than our recent presidents, but the president should never be the most left or right of their respective parties. \\n3. Finally,  both parties have very intelligent no-name people running numbers for them constantly. If the democratic party really believed it could win by going more left, it would run on that platform.  I believe that the work needed to motivate those on the far left side of the spectrum,  who are never going to vote for Trump in he first place,  to vote at all or not vote for some third party would alienate the party from people in the middle of a but right of middle from the democratic party, and those people might actually vote for Trump.  At that point, you're gaining 1 vote at the cost  losing yourself another and giving your opponent an extra one so it's a net loss for the party.","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"I think he took the one they gave when they suspect dementia years ago.

Im going through something similar myself, so I wanted to share whats been helping me navigate this situation.First off, it sounds like youve done a lot of deep thinking over the years, and its impressive that youre able to recognize how your beliefs have shifted. I can imagine it must feel isolating living in a place where your views are different from most people around you.When it comes to your wife, I think starting with a calm, non-judgmental conversation could help. You dont have to convince her to change her views, but maybe approach it from a place of explaining your own values and how you got there. When my mom or my brother and I talk about politics, I focus on why I care about certain issues rather than trying to win an argument. Its more about, Heres what matters to me and why, rather than Heres why youre wrong. It can be tough, but it lowers the temperature in the conversation. They will never change their views and I have accepted that.If she thinks the Democratic Party is full of liars or has never heard their point of view, you might consider acknowledging that a lot of misinformation is floating around. Maybe point out that, even if you both get your news from different sources, you still care about the same things: your family, your daughters future, and having a safe, fair country to live in. Sometimes starting from shared values can help both sides feel heard.Another thing thats been useful for me is practicing boundaries. If things get heated, its okay to say something like, I dont want to argue, but I do want to make sure we understand where each other is coming from. Maybe you can even agree to set some limits on how often or when you talk about politics, so it doesnt take over your whole relationship.If these conversations still feel difficult, it might be worth talking to a therapist who can help you both communicate better around these sensitive issues. Couples therapy isnt just for when things are badits great for improving communication and understanding, especially around topics like this that stir up a lot of emotion.At the end of the day, you dont have to agree on everything to have a strong relationship. Its more about making sure youre both feeling heard, respected, and that youre able to talk through your differences without it leading to bigger conflicts.Wishing you the best of luck.

Banning things like porn and snuff IS censorship, but since most of us are OK with it we call it moderation. It's not that difficult to make a case that censorship of certain topics/images is good. But you shouldn't pretend it doesnt happen.If your point that it isn't \\"government\\" censorship i tentatively agree, but I feel like you're misunderstanding the way power works in America. Corporations hold immense power and influence, and yes, even over the government.I think your argument  is directed at \\"small gov\\" right libertarian types since it plays into their bias towards the private sector. Against someone who also disdains corporate tyranny, it not much of a gotcha. But then the argument counts on leftists being sympathetic to the types of things being censored by corporations. (Left doesn't like corporations but they like this *specific* type of censorship. Right doesnt like censorship but they like private business)If firearm manufacturers and distributors all decided to stop selling weapons to a certain race of people, because they collectively decided it was more profitable to keep this group disarmed and vulnerable is that ok because the government didn't put it into law?It might be better to not mess around with moderation/censorship definition debates and just justify why the stuff you want censored should be censored while your opponent's censorship is unreasonable.

No.No, and doesn't matter. The **scale** is what matters. The fact that it's so large that, F.E. politicians view it as one of their main outlet for their ideas is what drives me to this conclusion. This entire debate hinges on a misunderstanding of what a platform like Twitter?*is*. Its not a public square. Its a private business that provides a venue which people can visit to engage, and it comes with terms of service and guidelines of participation. No one is obligated to attend and no one has a right to attend.It's not a misunderstanding, nobody is debating that Twitter is a private company out to make money. But i oppose the idea of full corporate freedom without any obligations or responsibilities. WHen you grow to a certain size, it accompanies a certain level of responsibility. If not, we essentially allow companies to run rampant and do whatever they want. Just like you wouldn't allow companies to engage in deceptive marketing tactics, (Federal Trade Commission Act) why should we allow them to engage in deceptive use of censorship to display their preferred rhetoric? These regulations are parallel to ensuring that users are not misled or unfairly treated on social media platforms. Its not a public square, its more like a convention center.

Like I said in another comment, papers aren't just a collection of complex data points, they form a narrative using the data to support their conclusions.

From their rules:Violent &amp; Hateful Entities: You cant affiliate with or promote the activities of violent and hateful entities.Promoting the activities of violent and hateful entities is unambiguously legal, as long as the promotion itself consists purely of speech....explicitly threatening, inciting, glorifying, or expressing desire for violence is not allowed.Threatening or inciting violence is a grey or black area, but glorifying and expressing a desire for violence are unambiguously legal protected speech.This is completely wrong. Hate speech is absolutely protected by the first amendment.Here you argue it's legal, ignoring the cases where it meets X requirements that would make it illegal.I'm having a hard time understanding what this sentence actually means.The X rules state Hateful conduct: You may not attack other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.Doing so is absolutely protected speech; it's not remotely close to anything that \\"would make it illegal\\".So yes, there are lots of X rules against speech which is clearly and unambiguously legal speech. Which I'd say they have a right to do, and I'd agree it's also reasonable to do.

Democracy didnt really take hold until WWII, but the power of the people and the institutions were still young when the drug cartels rose up.Mexico just didnt really stand a chance, and as were seeing with AMLO and his party Mexico is reverting back to its old ways which probably would have happened without the cartels anyways.

I dont get the sense that the Deep State is as afraid of Trump this time around. And more importantly, I dont think the Deep State actually wants war with Iran. I think they want to maintain the status quo more than anything. The Israel-Sunni-Shia power struggle serves American interests by keeping the region divided and really prevents a repeat of 1970s oil diplomacy. Israel is really just a lightning rod for the peasantry. There is a reason no one will take on those refuges from Gaza. By keeping the local Muslim populace focused on that struggle it keeps revolutionary forces from taking root in places like Saudia Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, etc. Then you have those same countries bickering with Iran, Syria, Yemen, etc and it prevents any one bloc from getting too powerful. Thats all by design. Its a delicate balance that serves our interests. America disrupting that balance would only lead to more problems. With Iran off the board, the Saudis would become the defacto leader of the region and wed be forced to capitulate to a united Persian gulf like we faced in the 70s. If anything Israel would have the most to gain and even then, I think it would still be a shit show. Part of the instability we are seeing is derived from a perception of pending American distraction. War with China is coming. Israel wants to get ahead of that to ensure its own security prior to whatever that conflict will bring. China is happy to prop up Iran and is using it to further deplete Western stock piles of air defense systems. The current administrations response and desire for peace stems from the real need to not get bogged down at the moment. So I can understand the thought process but I just dont see it. Trump has shown he isnt going to realistically alter the course of the Deep States strategy. If anything they would want to use him as a scapegoat for an unpopular war - not a martyr that would bolster his popularity.","title":"The Deep State has wanted war with Iran for decades.

It's not the only place people rant about politics or conspiracy theories. You're on a competitor right now. So the idea that because they're a monopoly, they should be mandated to allow harm to the public doesn't hold water.*As of 2024, X (formerly Twitter) has around 500-600 million monthly active users worldwide, with roughly 245 million daily active users. On the other hand, Reddit has a significantly smaller user base, with an estimated 57 million daily active users and 430 million monthly active users.*Come on.I'm not sure why protecting fascist propaganda should be a goal of a government that has historically been concerned enough about the spread of fascism to go to war about it.Who is protecting fascist propaganda? Is fascist propaganda a biproduct of free speech? Maybe, but that's the point of free speech, that you can say inflammatory things and have people disagree with you accordingly. As long as it's not hatespeech, or inciting violence. Twitter is an international company. If it wants to elevate fascist propaganda, it can do so. It will find advertisers in fascist countries.But here in America, our government being antifascist is constitutionally pretty baked in.Not that our government is stopping Twitter from hosting fascist propaganda. It's not.Nobody is bringing government antics into this, the point is the **platforms,** IF they are of such scale that important discourse like political discourse by important figures in that branch is a mainstay on it, shouldn't censor things no matter if they disagree with it or not, unless they spot something that is banned by the government, THAT should be their limit. Not doing so creates a BIG funnel for ONE type of rhetoric, which is diametrically opposite to American, or democratic values. Platforms should acknowledge the reality of their size and act accordingly. Our government asked that all the major social media companies?*look into*?the people telling the masses not to trust vaccine science because it was an immediate driver of pandemic infection and death. Nobody made a law. Nobody sent an enforcement arm. The propaganda wasn't actually removed unless the social media companies chose to remove it, which was about advertiser pressure, not government intervention. There are currently people spreading vaccine misinformation right now on every social media platform.?*at most*?moderation ads a \\"hey, this is likely bullshit and you might not want to make medical decisions relying on it\\" tag to the posts. Becsuse the government did not force them to moderate the content nor force them not to do so.**Perfect!** That's exactly how it should be imo. Like i said, i'm not saying the government is in the wrong here, i'm saying the **platforms** who willingly decide to censor one thing over another are the issue. \\"The government should protect destabilizing fascist propaganda\\" seems as ludicrous as \\"the government should protect destabilizing communist propaganda.\\" Why would our government do either of those things? We are neither communists nor fascists in our governmental structure, constitutionally. And neither is constitutionally protected from private corporation deplatforming based on ad dollars, which are allocated based on broad customer engagement. That may honestly be one of the most democratic ways of deciding what is permitted. The people decide with their engagement.I mean, you can do that, but then any credibility of your country being a country built on free speech goes straight out the window, Free speech entails that everyone is allowed to voice their opinons, even your communist neighbour.","title":"CMV: Social media moderation isn't a form of leftist government censorship."},{"text":"What an odd thing to say","title":"US President Joe Biden issues warning to Iran.  \\"Any attempt to kill Donald Trump would be an act of war.\\""},{"text":"Oh my, were digging now.","title":"Kamala Harris accused of plagiarism in co-authored 2009 book on criminal reform"},{"text":"Typical brainwash regurgitated trash.

Either way, at some point people need to depend on experts and an ability to judge credibility. The ability to judge credibility should be bolstered by public transparency - if everyone is free to speak, then people can call out liars and demonstrate how they are lying.So while there are practical limits to how much information individuals can have, those limits apply to benevolent dictators just as much as to the population at large, except that the population at large has the \\"marketplace of ideas\\" to help separate good ideas from bad ideas.That doesn't mean it always works or just happens on it's own. There are things you need to foster to get the best outcomes, but dictators aren't inherently benevolent either, so don't let that discourage you. Our society could do with a lot more humility, for example, and better education.All of this belies a misunderstanding, though - that the best path is objective. You cannot derive an \\"ought\\" from an \\"is\\". The whole \\"facts don't care about your feelings\\" has always been a trick. Every political question cares about your feelings, or more accurately, your values. The point of democracy isn't \\"fact-finding\\". That's the point of a free press and free speech.
