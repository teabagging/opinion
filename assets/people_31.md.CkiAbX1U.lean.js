And when a group in power tries to use those numbers as justification that everything is great people will vilify and attack them and rightly so. Same with the markets they could be up 1000000% and the vast majority of the country would not care because they have no real stake in the market at all.

Trump. has no solution either, but by not making asinine promises, he can at least conceal that (until the 2026 midterms when he, too, will be exposed as inept).This was a garbage election all the way.

People are fundamentally defined by the basic, universal desires and fears pretty much everyone shares regardless of their background- they want to be financially secure, they want to be able to live comfortably and provide for their families if they have one and they want to feel safe from crime or chaos.

So its likely Trump will come into office with a minimum of 66 federal judges to appoint himself.Edit: when I posted this I had not yet read the bill. I have now and learned that this bill splits the judge appointments over the next two terms, and the bill specifies that the first half takes effect on 01/22/25. Which means there isnt an attempt in the senate to slow roll to keep appointments from Biden. It was always drafted to give them to who ever is in office the next two terms.

Started in 2016, as Im sure a lot of people did. I asked her about her opinion on the psychology of each political side and she stated that democrats in this country and liberals elsewhere are highly neurotic folks. We spiral on our mistakes and are probably perfectionists in other aspects of life, to an extent. Not all of us but I suspect a large portion identify this way. The current GOP experience a collective Dunning Kruger effect and overestimate their limited abilities. Imagining myself as such a person gives me anxiety honestly lol. I think it would be really hard to change what makes us liberal, the fact that we want to be deliberate and present the best ideas that help every hard working American is like really ingrained in our belief system. The GOP just has one thing tax cuts for the rich and everything else is their way of dividing the 99%. They dont care about the working person so they do not need to aim for perfection because their position is relatively simple. Id love to understand if others see it that way, but is this part of the issue with our side?? I feel like its inherent in our value system that we behave this way. Another interesting note: I asked my therapist early on about her politics because I felt scared to see a person who wouldnt understand my anxiety about being a woman of color, first gen American, LGBTQ, etc. she said that in her field, she hasnt yet seen a MAGA type therapist, EVER in 30 years of practice.

Our Republican party at least used to be a centre right party.You must come to terms with the fact that America is a capitalist country, if the dems move any further, a vast majority will quickly shift towards another party because majority of Americans are always in the moderate category. One of the reasons why we have large number of undecided voters and our elections are always close. This is a key point to remember. The politicians like trump and his influence make them go further right. Dems are progressive but in the terms of supporting minorities, LGBTQ+ etc. Mostly cultural. A moderate is all we'll get. That's another reason why someone like Bernie or AOC will never be a nominee. No party in America actually works for the middle and lower classes because both are funded by billionaires. A slight tilt towards left can make it difficult for the Democrats while the extreme they go the easier it is for the Conservatives. It's not a fair world.

In CA weirdly I don't even see issues with \\"migrants\\" it doesn't seem to be a factor in homelessness at all. Instead what I see as a problem is the fact that there are lots of unsheltered drug addicted and mentally ill homeless people that litter and do petty crimes. They refuse to go to shelters even if the shelters exist. The police have to go through all this rigamarole to break up encampments. Cities don't want to make \\"no barrier\\" shelters or put people in prison, so they just end up on the streets doing a bunch of disruptive things. It's not an issue in a lot of red states because there is no housing shortage and they just arrest people who are doing drugs. So it's good that a lot of blue states have lower incarceration rates, but there is a cost to that as well. CA just voted to be more harsh on petty thefts and fentanyl use. Basically there was a wave of kind of leftist DAs and city governments since 2016 and they failed very badly at actually governing. State governments are a little better but also wanted to pursue a lot of these progressive aims and didn't think about the negative consequences. Particularly NJ and NY seem to have gotten the worst of this but it's here in CA too. In SF there has been a notable shift to the right after briefly being having a very left wing government. Other large CA cities as well. This is possible with Democrats, it's a big tent you can elect kind of extreme Democrats or very pragmatic ones. It seems like there is less variation on the right. It seems like this would be a good time for more of the pragmatic moderate Democrats to emerge. Also it should be noted that back in the 80s and most of the 90s a lot of cities were in decline. Large cities made a huge comeback after the recession. \\"Superstar Cities\\" during this time they were all run by Democrats. Their one big issue and failure was a lack of building new housing. Other than that it was Democrats that controlled cities while they saw crime decreases, economic growth and all these positive elements. Democrats can do it again and show the rest of the country how innovative and pragmatic/competent they an be.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"It doesnt really matter.

Josephson ran into problems with the corrupt Rockefeller Syndicate and AMA. He would go on to write several books aimed at the Rockefeller Syndicate. Josephson also wrote of Adam Weishaupts historical Illuminati stating that theyd merged with European Freemasonry in 1782, and forced the Vatican to reinstate the Jesuit Order. Nesta Websters earlier work mentions this. Josephson acknowledges the Rothschilds as more of serving the Vatican/Jesuit/Illuminati faction. Dr. Josephson writes:INSIGNIA OF THE ORDER OF ILLUMINATI THAT ILLUMINIST JEFFERSON MADE THE REVERSE OF U.S. SEALThe above insignia of the Order Illuminati was adopted by Weishaupt at the time he founded the Order, on May 1, 1776. It is that event that is memorialized by the MDCCLXXVI at the base of the pyramid, and not the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, as the uninformed have supposed. ^1The significance of the design is as follows: the pyramid represents the conspiracy for destruction of the Catholic Church, and establishment of a One World, or UN dictatorship, the secret of the Order; the eye radiating in all directions, is the all-spying eye that symbolizes the terroristic, Gestapo-like, espionage agency that Weishaupt set up under the name of Insinuating Brethren, to guard the secret of the Order and to terrorize the populace into acceptance of its rule. This Ogpu had its first workout in the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, which it was instrumental in organizing. It is a source of amazement that the Catholic electorate tolerates the continuance of use of this insignia as part of the Great Seal of the U.S.ANNUIT COEPTIS means our enterprise (conspiracy) has been crowned with success. Below, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM explains the nature of the enterprise; and its means a New Social Order or New Deal.**It should be noted that this insignia acquired Masonic significance only after merger of that Order with Order of Illuminati at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, in 1782.**Benjamin Franklin, John Adams (Roosevelt kinsman) and Thomas Jefferson, ardent Illuminist, and defender of Adam Weishaupt, proposed the above as the reverse of the seal, on the face of which was the eagle symbol, to Congress, which adopted it on June 10, 1782. On adoption of the Constitution, Congress decreed, by Act of September 15, 1789 its retention as seal of the United States. It is stated however, by the State Department in its latest publication on the subject (2880), that **the reverse has never been cut and used as a seal,** and that only the obverse bearing the eagle symbol has been used as official seal and coat of arms. It first was published on the left of the reverse of the dollar bills at the beginning of the New Deal, 1933.What is the meaning of the publication at the outset of the New Deal of this Gestapo symbol that had been so carefully suppressed up to that date that few Americans knew of its existence, other than as a Masonic symbol?It can only mean that with the advent of the New Deal the Illuminist-Socialist-Communist conspirators, followers of Professor Weishaupt, regarded their efforts as beginning to be crowned with success.In effect this seal proclaims to the peoples of the U.S. that **the entire power of their Government supports the conspiracy to undermine and destroy it and the Constitution on which it rests** - that it is **a Government of traitors.*REFERENCES**(1) Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

Because of this - financial firms created CDS. Then with the changes to the 1995 Community Reinvestment Act to help encourage lending to ?low-income borrowers, which then led to a 1999 change with the banks to ease the credit requirements. Well intended changes mixed with financial greed from banks across multiple administrations. When 9/11 happened, the Fed, which the president has no power to influence, lowered interest rates to combat a mini recession caused by the attack, which then accelerated to what we experienced. If CDS were not created or leading standards were not eased -- then the \\"great recession\\" would have been avoided or been less severe.The inflation wasn't caused by Biden or Trump. It was caused in large part because of Covid. If you think the Covid Checks for people who couldn't work was a bad idea -- then that's fair. And, again -- i don't think Trump should be given credit or fault to it because I think any sitting president would have approved it.

If they say they support affordable healthcare, that's a lie and the opposite is true (repeal it and make it more expensive which satisfies big pharma donors).","title":"Trumps Plan to Use Local Cops to Get the Mass Deportation Machine Going"},{"text":"Many working class people are suffering, and when we try to tell them how the economy Is actually doing good, they feel insulted, like we think they're stupid.Months ago there was a post on here in a thread about the stock market gains and one of the interest rate reductions and someone posted how rough they had it right now and people were literally replying to him telling him he was wrong and that he was better off than in 2020.That is the kind of messaging struggling people just fucking LOVE","title":"Biden gets blamed by Harris allies for the vice presidents resounding loss to Trump"},{"text":"Put his name in the headline.

Kimmel did a random segment in LA, (and yes they stage/filter people and it's hardly a scientific survey) but it was asking live on November 6th if they planned to vote **on November 6th**.They all responded yes, who they were going to watch the results with, etc. There's millions of Americans who haven't voted and are completely apolitical/ignorant to politics entirely.Kamala got **15m less** votes than Biden in 2020 and Trump got about **2 million** less than 2020. Yes he increased margins among certain demos, but far less people came out to vote for the Democrat candidate.However to your point, even those who do vote, I'd venture to say 40% of MAGA literally have no idea what is going on, or vote on \\"feels\\" not facts. There are countless interviews of MAGA voters who say they are voting for Trump because *they're afraid the stock market will crash* despite it being record breaking under Biden, or complaining about gas, which again is back to basically pre-pandemic levels. Or simply complaining about things the government has absolutely zero control over like groceries etc.Yes there's a lot of Americans who want to see mass deportations and even cheer on a dictatorship, but I don't think that's the *majority*, I think it's just plain and simple incredibly stupid and uninformed voters.Also this stuff is cyclical. People vote with their wallets and despite inflation being lower than any Western economy, unemployment being incredibly low, GDP and virtually any measurable metric being quite good, for the average American who's struggling, they **always** punish those in power.It's why every 8 years we go through this stupid ass doom cycle of Republicans inheriting a recovering/good economy, do their best to destroy it and then Democrats clean it up. Every. Single. Time.Trump inherited a very strong economy (and for some reason voters just ignore the millions dead and record high unemployment, etc) and answer \\"yeah it was better 4 years ago,\\" not realizing it was **Obama's economy**. Not accepting gas was so cheap because of lockdowns and millions dying.I'm cynical but I hope Trump does exactly what he promises; kills social security and suddenly those who voted for him that rely on it are struggling to live, deports millions of *legal* immigrants, kills healthcare and as crass as it is, any female MAGA voter that needs an abortion to save their life/child is unable to.

They behave just like him name calling, whining, conspiracy generating, blah blah. You guys need to realize people are not dumb for voting trump. You cant sell wine to someone who doesnt like wine. You cant force a candidate without a primary because you feel like lying about Biden being healthy. Your campaign cant be Im not him during a time when the median voter can barely afford prices in grocery stores because of the supply chain issues during Covid. You need to wake up and the give the people what they want rather than complaign and call trump dumb. The people voted republican because dems didnt talk about high prices and they also let 100000x immigrants come in the country recklessly so they could try to skew the vote. Dems need to wake up and stop putting trump on a pedestal and just treat him like you would treat Romney. With respect and taking debates seriously. Kamala fell right into the trap Hilary did. She didnt take him seriously, her interviews were dogshit (same one liner over and over is frustrating the American people because its political BS - she was not ready. And she said she wouldnt change anything Biden did. Thats just stupid - anyone who works know they would change the way they approached anything during a year) and she made stupid faces immaturely during the debate. People dont want a pompous, high horse democrat in the office. They care about money and someone who will be a straight shooter. Say what you want about trump but people resonate with him because he doesnt talk like a politician and he says what he wants. On top of that, with prices being so high democrats missed the ball and had no pulse on what people actually want. The second they lied about Bidens health and forced a shitty candidate (not democracy ) it was over. Stop blaming the American people for wanting a party that is more fiscally responsible. Womens rights are important but you put a gun to someones head they are going to prioritize financial stability. Take accountability for a shit campaign rather than playing the customer. That is not how it works. You sold a shitty product and no one bit. Its your fault and you lied to your own party.","title":"Americans said they were worried about democracy.

What OP said about RFK not being listed is pretty concerning, and made plenty of valid points that I cant argue.

That aspect of things worked out for him then and it did not end up costing the consumer. Whether or not he can do it again remains to be seen. Youre taking a campaign/media interpretation of what he said as gospel. What he wants to do and has always said he wants to do, and has done in the past is threaten tariffs on companies who keep jobs out of the country or want to move jobs out of the country along with threatening tariffs on countries who implement disproportionate taxes and tariffs on us. The only real tariffs he actually put in place were on China and the Biden administration has kept them in place because they ended up being beneficial. All of those economic predictions before the election were based upon the assumption he actually enforces the tariffs rather than using them as a threat to get what he wants. His main source of economic growth and how he plans to pay for things will be through massive energy production via oil and natural gas. He will withdraw from the Paris climate accord again and allow the refineries and oil producers to go at 100% production and expand (they have been capped since Biden took office per the Paris Climate Agreement) this will give us an over-abundance of oil and gas, it will most definitely bring down prices across the board as energy costs have been passed down on the consumer. Transportation, production, storage, refrigeration, power, heating etc. gas prices will plummet.His idea is to be able to sell our excess oil and gas to other countries (particularly in Europe) in order to pay down the debt and for whatever crazy shit he plans on doing. One of his biggest gripes last time was that Europe chose to purchase oil and gas from Russia instead of the U.S. (Which they are still doing while at the same time sending aid to Ukraine to fight Russia) and he believes getting Europe off of Russian oil and gas will help keep Putin in check economically. All this will of course be at the cost of climate change, the environment, and the loss of federally protected lands. Again, Im not a supporter of this idea nor do I think it will work long-term but Im just explaining the actual truth of the situation. It will probably work in the short term, but the long term consequences may not be very good. Especially now that he has Musk pushing even more energy production than he did last time.","title":"Two Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"Oh he fucking destroyed densantis, also he'd do well with the podcast bros","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"Obama, Hillary, Biden and Harris....srslyThey just get worse and worse.

Trump won because we have tens of millions of knuckle dragging idiots in this country, full stop.

Not one peep about how ballot boxes in cities were destroyed, or how Russia was using AI to generate fake videos of ballot tampering, or the bomb threats to polling places, never once mentions the things that may have actually influenced the election. Make no mistake, the Rs did some shady shit this year, but no one wants to talk about it.Editing to add: what about Elon Musk giving away millions of dollars to people who registered to vote in PA after he endorsed Trump? Is there no way some people didnt just register in PA even though they dont actually live there because A: they wanted a chance to win the money and B: because they knew PA was gonna be close so they wanted to increase the odds of a Trump victory? I remember when I moved to Mississippi I had NO proof of residency but I HAD to get my license switched over so what did I do? Registered to vote, just had to sign an affidavit that I live where I said I lived. No ones ever questioned it. Also Ive seen reports of people doing mail in ballots but their recently elected election-denying county clerk magically never received it, so of course their vote for Harris didnt get counted. Go figure. Its unlikely enough fraud occurred to influence the election but the fact that Dems arent even talking about it is maddening. Were only in power for a couple more months, we should be using the DOJ to investigate and expose these shenanigans, at least show the American people that the evidence of fraud exists, but its on the other side.","title":"Election Deniers Went Suddenly Quiet When Trump Won"},{"text":"Yeah, that dude aimed for his ear.

Those who have gotten additional doses beyond the primary vaccination series are very well-protected.Also, including this here because I added it as an edit to my other post and I don't think you saw it, but the NEJM study had another reassuring finding that these effects are less common with the current variants circulating now compared to earlier strains: \\"Multiple findings indicated that the association between Covid-19 and cognitive deficits attenuated as the pandemic progressed. We found smaller cognitive deficits among participants who had been infected during recent variant periods than among those who had been infected with the original virus or the alpha variant.\\"","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"Pretty simple actually.

The study in the NEJM looked at people that didn't have Covid as well as those that had Covid of varying durations and severities, ranging from asymptomatic to over 12 weeks of symptoms. It was not specifically looking at people who experienced long-term cognitive effects. It then sought to determine *whether or not* any of these people did, in fact, have cogntive effects.In our study cohort, we tracked the prevalence of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing Covid-19, in England from May 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022,12-15 using data from a randomly selected community sample of 3,099,386 adults (18 years of age). A total of 2,494,309 participants (80.5%) consented to be recontacted and to allow data linkage with the National Health Service (NHS). Between August 1 and December 30, 2022, we invited a subsample of 800,000 adults (32.1%) to complete a follow-up survey7 and cognitive assessment (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). This invited subsample comprised participants who reported positive results on a SARS-CoV-2 test or who suspected that they had had Covid-19 and whose symptoms persisted for at least 12 weeks; participants who, as part of the REACT study, either had a positive result on a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 or were unvaccinated and had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies on an at-home lateral flow immunoassay device16; and participants who were randomly selected from the remaining REACT study population.In fact:Participants who reported having poor memory or brain fog were slightly more likely than participants without subjective cognitive symptoms to participate across all the study groups, including the noCCovid-19 group (Table S4B).There were only *slightly* more people who had reported cognitive deficits in the study than those who did not report cognitive deficits. So portraying this as \\"looking at a subset of people who experienced long-term cognitive effects after recovering from COVID\\" is not accurate. Looking at community data, the authors of the study said that the cognitive protection that vaccination offered was \\"small\\", not \\"significant\\", as you said. When it comes to vaccination and long Covid, the protection is not as strong as you are making it seem. A [recent review in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6) says:COVID-19 vaccines may partially reduce the risk of long COVID in adults by 15C70% (mean, ~40%)86,87,88,89; they may also partially reduce the risk of long COVID in children90,91.An average 40% reduction in potentially permanent cognitive damage is not particularly substantial. Further, when you say:There will always be vaccinated folks who are still at risk because of their age, immunocompromised status, etc., but **for most folks, the current strains of COVID-19 will cause mild illness at the very most, with a low likelihood of long-term symptoms.**While this is technically true if we lean on \\"most\\", this contrasts what the article you sent says in spirit. The article says:**The prevalence of long COVID is currently** 11 percent among those who are unvaccinated and **5 percent among those who have had two or more doses of the vaccine.**When discussing medication side effects, a common framework adopted by European regulatory agencies is that side effects that affect 10+% of patients are \\"very common\\", side effects that affect 1-10% are \\"common\\", \\"uncommon\\" between 0.1-1%, \\"rare\\" between 0.01-0.1%, and \\"very rare\\" less than 0.01%. This framework lines up with the WHO's definition of rare diseases (less than 0.065%) and the Orphan Drug Act's definition of less than 200,000 Americans (roughly 0.066%). Long Covid is therefore (within this framework) a *common* sequelae of the disease even among vaccinated people. These studies also indicate that recurrent infection *raises* the risk, so it becomes increasingly common the more we are infected. Everyone is free to make their own risk assessment, but it seems you're attempting to portray what is a common sequelae across all age groups and health statuses as uncommon, which is not what the data indicate. Keep in mind as well that many of these studies on long-term sequelae in relation to vaccination are looking at *symptomatic* sequelae, whereas many of the cognitive deficits are completely asymptomatic. The same goes for immune system and cardiac sequelae. The clinical relevance of asymptomatic sequelae is of course debatable, as the study authors themselves admit. But I personally am not willing to accept a 5% risk of long-term cognitive deficits each time I go out, and I suspect that if most people were offered a pill that they needed to take each day that came with the same risk, they would refuse. Most people I know will avoid even medications that are generally considered safe but have risks that are much lower in frequency than LC.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"A South Korean old guy with a MAGA hat was trending for rambling about Trump on social media.

It's about the way that the parties communicated and reached out (or didn't) to these communities.For example, in many working class Hispanic communities in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, there was no direct outreach at all from the Harris campaign. In fact, the current Administration insisted that the economy was good and even called it \\"Bidenomics\\" during the time when the same communities are struggling badly financially.My sister-in-law (naturalized citizen) for example works two jobs and my brother works 48 hours a week at one job. They both told me that they voted for Trump because he acknowledged how terrible the economy is for them. All they heard from Harris was \\"about the middle class and fascism\\" according to her.When you're struggling to feed your children and pay for rent and you're doing everything you can, lofty concepts like democracy and fascism and comparing the party's platforms just don't carry any weight. You're going to vote for whomever the challenger is to the current administration.
