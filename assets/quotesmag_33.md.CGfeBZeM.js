I think it is a disastrous political mistake to compare this period with the 1960s and the flight for civil rights. There huge differnces. Whats the progressive movement is fighting for now is not equality, but a remaking of society to THEIR values. Cancel culture is rife online and in society. Social justice is not about rights but about what one set of people deem as the right thing to be shoved down the throats of others. Eg reparations. DEI etc. Thee policies take ordinary people and force them into the role of defendants being judged guilty, despite them not having done anything. Its time we took MLKs words seriously and stopped judging people by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. And its not always the case that if the outcomes are not racially proportionate, that the system is rigged or wrong. For instance, in Boston, SF, ans NY, advanced math classes were cancelled because not enough black and Hispanic students were enrolled. This was done in the name of equity. Who do you think the parents are going to vote for? Similarly in cities, if for example a large proportion of black youth are rounded up by police, it doesnt mean the police are racist. Perhaps it could just mean that black youth are the ones indulging in crime. Progressives try to change the system to fit the outcomes rather than tackling the root causes, tackling of which is the the only real way of solving the problem .

We'd still have mostly the same situation immediately post WWII. What happens then?I'm trying to come up with how such a WWIII would start, what it would be fought over, what the goals would be. I'm not seeing it. The Russian-aligned side and US-aligned side still don't like each other, but invasion and occupation of either one by the other just isn't practical. Russia and America are both too big for it. WWII happened the way it did because the Axis powers went on the offensive, but were kind of small actually, too small to actually conquer the world, and small enough for the big superpowers to actually fully occupy for a while. So how and where do the two sides fight in our counterfactual WWIII?Maybe they could do a WWI like thing, fielding huge armies across vast fronts that smash into each other repeatedly at enormous casualty counts, but never actually take any territory, until someone has taken so many casualties that they have to give up. It's hard to see that. All technology developments since then have made war more mobile, not less. And more able to use air power to strike far into enemy territory, even if they can't do anything as destructive as nuclear bombs.Maybe the Red Army would infact decide to march to the Atlantic. Well, they could try. Maybe if things go very well for them, they could conquer some more territory. But then they have to control it. I guess it could happen, but I don't see it escalating to something we could call WWIII. Wouldn't they be just as concerned that the so-called Warsaw Pact might not actually hold together for an offensive war and they would only provoke NATO to counter-invade and take Eastern Europe back into their sphere.Maybe Russians and Americans aren't so afraid to directly fight each other in places like Korean and Vietnam. Maybe, but wouldn't it just make those particular wars go slightly differently but still not escalate into a WWIII?So yeah, I wanted to agree with you at first, but I just can't picture a non-nuclear WWIII that feels plausible.

The civil rights movement in the 1960s wasn't popular, but through organizing and protests, they captured the imagination of the American public, and eventually, legislation got signed. I don't believe in a kind of politics where you just look at what is the majoritarian position and poll-test to death what you should be doing. That was literally the Kamala campaign. It looked like she didn't stand for anything.That being said, I agree progressives have a bad reputation on cultural issues, especially \\"cancel culture.\\" I wouldn't attribute it to the Bernie left necessarily. Much of the Bernie left were maligned as \\"Bernie Bros\\". I think on things like trans issues and crime, we need to have a hard look at how we communicate these things and even how much we support certain ideas ourselves. Trans issues impact very few people and is very easy to scapegoat, but on crime, yes, progressive DAs simply have a bad reputation. I think we do need to have a conversation about reforming our justice system which badly needs to be reformed, while at the same time investing in public safety so that the average person walking in San Francisco feels safe. I was always against the idea of \\"Defund the police.\\" I think body cams, training, qualified immunity, etc., are things we can look at. I think you fall into the trap of defining protest movements by their most radical, unpopular, and controversial elements. Why focus on the parts of the BLM protests that turned violent and not the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY that are just marching for justice? Same thing with Palestinian protesters. And no, AOC does not support protesters with Hamas flags. You're just simply being dishonest. And neither do the majority of protesters. If anything, I agree we need to do a better job of organizing behind mainstream leadership and speakers who distance themselves from easy attacks from the right. There's always a few stupid people at a protest that ruin it for the rest of us and we need to talk about how to combat that, because we know we're right on what we're protesting on.I think a strong, economic populist vision is actually what we need to go forward. We need to target healthcare affordability and housing affordability. We need a message and story about how the elites have ruined this country. And it's a winning message that unifies people.","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":" Hardly anyone was even talking about trans issues until a few years ago.Honestly most progress on trans rights in the US was in the 2010s, people talking about trans rights has been largely a disaster.","title":"Liberalism is the rebellion now"},{"text":"I genuinely despise them.

The consequences of mass incarceration also didn't quite register in the brains of the white working or middle class yet due to the privilege and systemic racism. Democrats wouldn't have won if they decided to go back to public health messaging. Reagan started this whole country working for the rich rather than the poor with his tax policy benefitting the rich, his public health policy getting rid of public health as much as he could get away with, and systematically jailing people for a public health crisis they themselves created. Then George H.W. came along and cut taxes for the rich again. Then during his term he didn't kiss their asses hard enough so they voted Clinton instead of having a George H.W. 2nd term. Neoliberalism was born. \\nOn a side note, the Bush family was involved with laundering money for the Nazis during WW2. And then we voted them in as president.

Illinois faces a massive unfunded pension liability and has experienced big fiscal shortfalls. An influx of federal Covid-19 relief dollars briefly helped, but this year the state is again facing a $3 billion budget deficit. We always believed that our best opportunity to negotiate our way out of Illinois was when Illinois was approaching that financial cliffits been on a path toward it for years, said G.H. Merritt, chairman of New Illinois State. She said financial experts in her group, which held its latest constitutional convention Nov. 8-9 in a historic Bloomington, Ill., hotel, think a moment of reckoning could come in the next three to seven years. There is lively debate over whether downstate would be better off without Cook County, particularly if other wealthy, blue counties decided to stay part of so-called Old Illinois.  Research from the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute shows downstate counties benefit greatly from the flow of state funds from north to south. Its a ridiculous thing they want, because we would be a Third World country without the kind of money we get back from the state of Illinois, said John Jackson, a visiting professor and co-author of the report for the Institute, which is part of Southern Illinois University in downstate Carbondale. Merritt questions the reports methodology and says downstate Illinois would have an economy and population the size of Indiana. She also argues both sides would benefit from separation, with Cook County free to pass the laws it wants, and the rest of the state flourishing under lower taxes and eased regulations.attempted snapshot, not available now not sure if it captured correctly. https://web.archive.org/web/20241117131611/https://www.wsj.com/us-news/rural-counties-new-illinois-california-1e1badb5","title":"The Rural Areas Pushing for Divorce From Democratic Cities"},{"text":"Exactly.","title":"Schumer now pleads for bi-partisanship having promised to railroad Democrat agenda through"},{"text":"I don't know anyone that takes it.","title":"Ambien"},{"text":"That really doesnt seem like an exceptionally high amount.

It was completely unenforceable to begin with and they never actually set boots on the ground there. You see, Guyana historically was known as the Wild Coast. Right down to the coast was dense jungle and it took a lot of money, death, and disease, to clear the areas that are clear now. An expense the Spanish Crown did not want to undertake so their claim remained lines on a map.Enter the Dutch in the 1600s. The Dutch ALSO claimed this land and ACTUALLY put the work in to settle the land. At this point, the Wild Coast was both the modern territories of Guyana and Suriname combined. Guyana itself was subdivided into three separate administrative/colonial companies: Essequibo (remember this one), Berbice, and Demerara. This is why many towns and people's surnames sound Dutch. The Dutch Colonial period lasts roughly 175 years. In all this time the Spanish Empire are quiet on the issue.Enter British North America and their Revolutionary War. Little known fact, the Dutch Republic was on our side. They were still a little salty over New ~~Amsterdam~~ York plus some other more recent issues with the British. The British, in response, took the colonies of Essequibo, Demerara, and Berbice. AND AGAIN THE SPANISH DID AND SAID NOTHING TO ENFORCE THEIR CLAIMS.  As weve established, many Spanish claims were lines on a map the lands of which the Spanish had never actually set foot in. After some back and forth, will they wont they, the three colonies of Essequibo, Demerara, Berbice, end up permanently under British control in the 1800s and merged into one administrative unit of British Guiana.Enter the Spanish American Wars of Independence. Simon Bolivar creates the Gran Colombia which eventually splits into Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia/Panama, and Venezuela. Because the maps from the Spanish Empire show the Essequibo colony as being part of their lands, Bolivar includes it into the claimed territory of the Gran Colombia. Though again it was always a claim and never acted upon. When the Gran Colombia breaks up and Venezuela is created, they maintain this claim. And here we see THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THE CLAIM. Why? Venezuela is diminished from being part of New Spain then again from the Gran Colombia, and now some more land seems worth fighting about.Enter International Arbitration in 1899. An ascendant United States represents Venezuelas interests in arbitration. This is key. Venezuela itself does not have a voice in its own affairs due to a bit of Monroe Doctrine, and a bit of Britain BIG, Venezuela SMALL in terms of global politics. The arbitration panel begins with the Schomburgk line. A line Britain commissioned a German/HRE naturalist named Robert Schomburgk to delineate for them. His line is TBH way out of pocket. It consumes the entire Essequibo territory and reaches until the mouth of the Orinoco river which would interfere with Venezuelan trade and taxation. Venezuela obviously protests this and with the United States intervening a new line is drawn which is the current border. Guyana got to keep the Essequibo which we had occupied for at least 2 centuries (my family among them) and Venezuela got to keep control of the Orinoco River.Maybe the Venezuelans genuinely accepted this, maybe they kept quiet because what else could they do? Were they about to go to war with the largest Empire in the world at that time? Anyways, this is the start of the conspiracy that they were robbed. A conspiracy of Anglo interests against Venezuela. Considering Guyana was a territory of Britain, we had no actual say in the decision. I believe there is a story about some letter the then President of Venezuela wrote which was not to be opened until after he died which claimed they were robbed and hence the current conspiracy.Anyway the decision persists until 1962 - Guyanese independence. Venezuela, now the bigger of the two, reopens the case with this conspiracy saying they wont abide by arbitration because they were robbed. There have been attempts to reach diplomatic compromise with little success since then. They invaded and still hold an island of ours called Ankoko Island. We Guyanese are here like, you never owned or occupied this land, and now that you think you can bully us, you want what was never yours. They in turn have put troops on the Border to detract from the failures of socialism (I dont wanna hear it about thats state capitalism and US imperialism and thats not real socialism blah blah blah their people are fleeing to MY country and others so shut the fuck up).Its funny the Venezuelans call others Imperialists when they are in fact trying to restore imperial claims which even the originator of those claims didnt enforce or do anything about.

We all do it from time to time, but we should be self-aware enough to manage it and not let it get the best of us or destabilize us.

They are right brain imbalanced due to a concerted effort to destabilize their mind and conscious awareness. Only when you balance both hemispheres of the neo cortex can you open the path to the pineal gland, which grants us the garden of Eden, or harmony in our thoughts. There was a study years ago that has since been contested that said we only use 10% of our brain capacity. Those who are able to access their pineal gland can use much more than 10%.Likewise, I believe we have an electromagnetic \\"aura\\" or frequency that surrounds us.

Sadly, many people are negatively charged and very off balance now days in their energy fields also, which indicates that they are that way in their brains as well.

Ill propose a number of reasons and then you can tell me which candidates might be suitable. Although no doubt Newsom is licking his chops.The problem completely lay on the left. Trump got nearly the same amount of votes he got the last election. Over 8 million people who voted for Biden last time around stayed home. Thats clearly a problem with the Democrats and the left. Trump did not change. It was the Democrats that did not resound. There are reasons.A big problem was  the Democrats constant pandering. They assumed Democrats, especially Latinos and Progressives would want open borders. Thats why they didnt do anything on the border for nearly 3 years. They pinned all their hopes on abortion not realizing that MOST people were fine with the power of being handed down to the states. They got carried away with social and identity issues.Most people do not want to see men in womens sports. You can debate all you want, but people do not want to see a man beating up a woman in the boxing ring, or placing 1st in the swimmers rankings from 554th, simply by changing his gender and competing with other women. Democrats were also passing policies in some states where loans would only be available on the basis of race. They even change the FEMA directive to disburse aid the basis of  equity. And hours and hours of mandatory DEI training and all these initiatives at work also pissed off a huge chunk of people. Most people want to be judged by the work they do, and actually qualified they are, not on the basis of the color of their skin. Affirmative action directly goes against this. in addition, a whole bunch of cities and states started discussing reparations and started a prioritizing social justice above Later day needs of most people. One needs to understand that with the exception of the hard, Progressive left, these types of issues do not resonate with the masses, and they felt ignored. Further, when it comes to social issues, most dont appreciate being called racist, or transist whatever -ist simply because they oppose the woke policies pushed by the left. In short, there was too much change at the social level in too short of time. And if the Democrats dont understand, this will continue to lose the elections.In addition to rampant cancel culture! Dont even get me started. Sites like Reddit and IMDb are notorious for removing reviews and comments they dont like. When Lord of the rings was review bombed, most were immediately removed. People dont like being censored by a woke police. Granted had nothing to do with these initiatives, but its the Democratic Party that is tainted by such actions because that is part of their brand. It didnt help all these students protesting on campus waving Hamas flags were supported by the likes of AOC and other prominent Democrats.Likewise wirh crime. After George Floyd Democrats went overboard with defund the police and easy on crime DAs like Chesa Boudin, LAs Gascon, that fruitcake in Philadelphia and all the major cities. People were sick of those videos of mobs shoplifting at will with security, just standing by. They were similarly sick of calling attendant every time they wanted to purchase some shaving cream or bottle of Tylenol at CVS or Walgreens because everything was put behind locked shelves. Videos of tent cities, downtowns drug infested hellholes did not help. Yes, people blame inflation but they understand the supply chain issues. But they also understand that these ESG and environmental policies that places like California adopt, add a huge amount to the price of gas. And whether we like it or not, the price of gas is still extremely important to most peopleThere was the issue of the various lawsuits against Trump. Whether you agree or not, Alvin Bragg made him a martyr. And what he was charged with or convicted of, I bet no one can actually knows. And in all the other cases where he deserved to be prosecuted, the Democrats were asleep at the switch or completely inept.Internationally too, Bidens policies were a complete wreck. His Disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the timorous and peacemeal handing out of weapons and aid to Ukraine -  no you cant have tanks, OK you can have tanks; no, you cant have, ok you can have planes, same thing with ATACMS, HIMARS, and dozens of other weapon systems. He succeeded in distributing aid in the worst possible way - slowly in drip drip fashion.He canceled XL pipeline on day one and put the kibosh on oil drilling while at the same time rushing to Saudi Arabia to beg for oil. He was met with derision and ridicule for that fatuous fist bump because his advisor said he should not be seen shaking hands with the bone saw killer. Hootie have shut down the Red Sea, and all his attempts Very limited military strikes have failed. His constant equivocating and moving his deadlines with Israel and with Iran have also condemned him as a weak figure and impotent figure in international geopolitics.It was for all these reasons the voters simply lost interest in Biden and Harris because Harris could not divorce herself from Biden or his agenda. She did not condemn and did not propose anything new. People did not want the same type of governance they had been seen for the last four years, so good chunk of them apathetically just stayed home. Which of course allowed Trump to win.Democrats really need to understand that the government needs to represent the people, and trying to get the people to represent the government is not going to work. People like competence in and being able to relate to the people they elect. In Biden and Harris they do not find that. Which is why Trump won the popular vote as well as the electoral college, a first for Republicans since 2004. He also made in inroads  into virtually every demographic and category, including getting a record share of black men and Latinos. Democrats learned the hard way that if you have an agenda, a brand or stand by policies that do not resonate with the masses, you get kicked out. And thats exactly what happened.","title":"Detailed Analysis of Progressive Options for 2028"},{"text":"We really dont want to dig into how harris blew anything.","title":"Kamala Harriss campaign spent $24,000 on Uber Eats and ice creams, filings show, amid questions about how the party blew $1.5 billion on a failed election"},{"text":"if you read the article, it lists a variety of options, including these:**The range of unilateral options open to President Biden in his remaining few days is surprisingly broad**.

Reagan won a landslide victory, was insanely popular, and even though H.W. Bush wont after him, it swung in the other direction after one term. Trump won very handsomely in 2016 and by 2020 lost very decisively. Trump often over-performs other Republicans on the ballot, so whether another Republican will recreate Trumps popularity, well have to see.People are sick of Biden and choosing Harris meant choosing someone who isnt even allowed to criticize the incumbent but is somehow meant to convince people she will do things better. Even then, yes, the swing in all categories was massive, but it was still the same 3-5% of swing state voters who call the shots. Considering how Biden fumbled the border, was seen as weak on foreign policy, the fact that prices were massively up, and the job market was rough, its not like the states swung 60-40%. Also, people tire of Trump. When everything is bad, people can put up with voting for him. But the next 4 years are likely to be very exhausting and there is a high chance people will vote for the Democrat, provided hes mentally there. Lastly, Senate swung in the Republicans direction, but thats because red states states finally voted in Republican senators, such as in Montana and West Virginia. They were the exceptions. Of course there are states like Pennsylvania who could have gone either way but went red.Lastly, it depends on what people are expecting. Lower prices? I cant predict the future, but well have to see how that works out. People are much more worried about 2019 vs 2024 prices, not 2023 vs 2024. If you paid $3 for a specific food and then in 2023 it went up to $6 and in 2024 it went to $7. Youre more worried about $3 vs $7 more than $6 vs $7. If the product keeps going up at regular inflation rates, it will never go even close to $3. Very dumbed down example.We cant tell the future, the Democrats did bad and are out of touch, but it depends on how well Trump does and if Democrats learn any lessons, especially on the border and social issues.","title":"CMV: Republicans will continue to win both the Presidency and Senate continually till 2036."},{"text":"Its starting to be covered by other outlets","title":"Democratic leaders across US work to lead resistance against Trumps agenda"},{"text":"That just makes me sick","title":"Latinos!

We might be more integretad than ever before, but the fact is before ww1, trade between superpowers were massive and you could find similar statements back then about war having become impossible because of the economic collapse that would follow. This was being said right up to the point when war broke out.We also saw Russia becoming more and more integrated with EU and especially Germany and that didnt do Jackshit to stop them disconnecting themselves from the west.I think the point about EU and democracy is fair, but I have a different take about the mechanism. The EU has an effect of deescalating tension because it removes authority from national governments. The EU as supranational state changes a bit the game theory that may otherwise lead to competition in armament, , distrust, spying, fear and tension between rivals which eventually can incite war. The point about democracies works only indirect. Democracy as a government itself does not prevent war, weve seen democracies get into plenty of wars. Weve seen conflicts between democracies and even in ww1 most countries involved were democracies although they were less developed. You might say we havent seen war between two democracies in a while, but I think that requires you to conveniently define democracies in a way to exclude the bad ones. I would argue a stronger reason the good democracies dont go to war with each other is because they are all aligned under and subjected to the US security umbrella. The way democracies can reduce the risk of war indirectly is that they can generate a strong culture of liberal/humanistic values which reduces the apetite for war. Although as we see historically democracies, especially US, UK and France have been involved in a lot of wars anyway, just not against each other. I dont think the UN can do much about preventing war. It perhaps helps on the margin, creating a forum for discussion and to allow international community to voice their opinions. Having said all of that, its quite obvious that there would have been a ww3 if it werent for nukes during Cold War between nato and Soviet. There is absolutely nothing trade, democracy, the UN, the EU could have done to prevent it without nukes.","title":"CMV: Without the threat of mutual destruction WW3 would have already happened"},{"text":"And he really didnt harm anything.

The government can step in to help increase production or offset the costs for the production to meet the populations wants. Such as housing, artificially introducing an oversupply of housing may harm economic output. But the societal benefit of people being able to more adequately meet their housing costs is more important. Or giving tax incentives to build in x state over y state because x state is falling behind the rest of the country and needs more things build there.

Or that it would start with a single \\"final straw\\" of violence that leads the nations to publically declare war on each other, or that it would end with a ceasefire that is agreed by both sides OR foisted on the loser by the victor? WW1 was at first thought to be fought like all the wars of recent history before. Cavalry charges and open field battles. Technology meant that instead it was trench warfare and chemical attacks, a slow war of attrition.WW2 was thought at first to be fought like WW1: trench warfare and rock solid defences. The maginot line and blitzkrieg showed that to be false. Again, technological advances meant that war was unlike anything that came before. Why should we think WW3 will basically be WW2 again but with better guns and weapons? Technology has advanced again, and America doesn't need to send soldiers into Europe to fight Fascism or socialism or imperialism or whatever else. I think that if anything WW3 already happened: it was the cold war with proxy battles between smaller nations allied with one side or the other of the larger ideological conflict of \\"liberal democracy and capitalism\\" vs \\"authoritarian communism\\". The economic might of the US and Europe and the Soviet Union, all tangled up with proxy conflicts and economic incentives and trade barriers and tariffs used to try and suffocate their enemy while supporting their allies. If so, then it ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Or it won't end until NK and China officially admit that their economic systems are inferior to the West's (unlikely given that China is the second wealthiest country on earth by GDP) Which would mean that we are now in WW4: an information and economic war between the nation states that have ideological differences. China's manufacturing might has caused great economic harm to other countries. Russia and Iran continue to engage in disinformation campaigns to get their enemies countries to tear themselves apart from within.

You can split hairs about whether a bunch of smaller wars loosely connected through larger wars like the cold war, the war on terror, and so on count as a \\"global war\\" - but if the number of deaths is the same, idk, seems like its all the same thing to me.You could split World War 2 the same way. Was it one war, or a group of wars - one between the Germans and the Russians, a war between the US and Japan, and 15 or so other smaller wars, etc. I'd argue that at the end of the day the total # of war deaths is a good proxy for whether nukes have reduced war deaths.Anyways - I always thought war deaths were dramatically down - but this chart is interesting. [https://www3.nd.edu/\\\\~dhoward1/Rates%20of%20Death%20in%20War.pdf](https://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/Rates%20of%20Death%20in%20War.pdf)**In summary: **Total deaths (civilian plus military) from war are pretty much constant.** We're down from WW2, which was an all-time high...but we're right about where humans were at various other points in history.\\n* **Deaths of military personnel are down.** But I mean, is that because of nukes? If it was, wouldn't civilian deaths be down just as much? The lower number of military deaths (and consequently higher rate of civilian deaths) probably has a lot to do with the rise of guerilla warfare, tech developments, terrorism, etc. Put another way - a lot of those military deaths in the Catholic vs. Protestant wars should probably be labeled civilian, but...we don't look at it that way...for...some reason.**So my takeaway is that perhaps nuclear weapons just changed the nature of war, but didn't reduce it.*Maybe nukes just mean more smaller wars and less bigger wars.** Part of this is just a definitional thing. Because the implication of the US and Russia fighting a war in Vietnam is WW3, we all agree to call it \\"The war in Vietnam\\" not \\"US vs. Russia.\\" But the # of people dying - that's not changing.","title":"CMV: Without the threat of mutual destruction WW3 would have already happened"},{"text":"It's weird how he's doing exactly all the things he said he was gonna do.

From Wikipedia:Neoliberalism is often associated with a set of **economic liberalization policies,** including privatization, deregulation, consumer choice, globalization, free trade, monetarism, austerity, and **reductions in government spending**. These policies are designed to **increase the role of the private sector** in the economy and society. Additionally, the neoliberal project is oriented towards the establishment of institutions and is inherently political in nature, extending beyond mere economic considerations.From [this, also found in the FAQ](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/coming-out-as-neoliberals)For us, the word neoliberal means that were:Pro-markets \\\\\\nPro-property rights \\\\\\nPro-growth \\\\\\nIndividualistic \\\\\\nEmpirical and open-minded \\\\\\nGlobalist in outlook \\\\\\nOptimistic about the future \\\\\\nFocused on changing the world for the better\\\\Selected points from[this description of neoliberalism that you can find in the FAQ](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/thinkpieces/looking-at-the-world-through-neo-liberal-eyes-2)#Poorer peoples become richer by creating wealth, not by redistributing it.The world's wealth is not a fixed supply to be shared out according to some idea of what is just.  Wealth is created by exchange.  When people trade what they value less for what they value more, wealth is increased.  Development aid redistributes a little wealth, whereas trade creates a great deal of it.  [...]\\n#Economic growth is a good thing and there are no limits to it.Economic growth brings the opportunities to satisfy our wants.  It enables us to pay for medical care and sanitation, and for education. It funds art galleries, libraries and concert halls as well as meeting our material needs.  Although some critics say we will run out of resources, our ability to access new sources of them as technology advances is increasing faster than our use of them. [...] Technology is becoming smarter, too, using fewer resources for its outputs.  Growth can continue to bring more opportunities and greater security to more and more people.\\nAnd from [this, which is, too, found in the FAQ](https://s8mb.medium.com/im-a-neoliberal-maybe-you-are-too-b809a2a588d6)[Neoliberals are] a emerging and growing group of people, [...] who are libertarianish??but they are fundamentally different to the mainstream libertarian movement when it comes to important values and approaches [...]We like markets  a lot. We think that markets are by far the best way of organising most human affairs that involve scarce resources, because they align peoples incentives in ways that communicate where resources can be be used most efficiently, and give people reasons to come up with new ways of using existing resources. This means that markets and market-like systems are desirable in many, many places theyre not present at the moment  healthcare, education, environmental policy, organ allocations, traffic congestion, land-use planning.We promote low, simple taxes because we want economic growth and to give people more power over their money, so it is individuals and not the state that choose where their income goes. We promote competition in healthcare, education, utilities and other public services because we want those things to be better through a process of experimentation and individual choice. [...]Are we against redistribution of wealth? ...No... But also sorta. A good, uncommitted answer is that we are not *ideologically* against it, but neither for it. From the same medium link above: Redistributing wealth or income from lucky people to unlucky people may be justifiable, if its done without depressing economic growth too much. Too much redistribution can have bad consequences because taxes tend to depress investment and growth, but too little redistribution has bad consequences too  poor people dont live good enough lives. A neoliberal is someone who believes that markets are astonishingly good at creating wealth, but not always good at distributing wealth.It is perfectly acceptable for a neoliberal to not support wealth distribution tremendously.

The market is not a person. It is the sum of many distributed human actions. If you insist on reifying and anthropomorphizing it as if it has goals you are completely misunderstanding how markets function.The government does not have a better ability to predict the future than investors and industry experts in each niche area of the economy. Much like a slime-mold typically outperforms humans at quickly creating efficient distributed resource transportation networks, the market quickly communicates complex information about supply and demand, and how supply and demand are expected to change. This allows for individual actors (whether corporations, individuals, or various levels of government)  to optimize their response to dynamic conditions.Attempting to control the market necessarily disrupts this information transfer, in addition to the political dysfunction and waste which such interventions generate. Very few government programs to direct the economy can claim to have been successful, or even genuinely prescient.Modest interventions proposed by supply side progressivism types hardly amount to GOVERNMENT CONTROL. Supply-side progressivism has relatively few proposed interventions, and generally their position would be better described oh fuck we overregulated and made progressive goals impossible.Im certainly not opposed to them, and count many of them among my political allies.

I have a group of 6-7 friends, and weve been together since the 1st semesteralmost two years now. Things were good for the first 6-7 months, but then everything started going downhill.The main issue is that Im not particularly great at studies or extracurricular activities; Im just average. On the other hand, my friends are either good at studies or decent at other activities. Because of this, they constantly make fun of me, and it feels like they gang up on me whenever they get the chance.To make things worse, I have backlogs too, and I honestly dont know whats going to happen with my academics. I feel so demotivated and alone most of the time. Im the kind of person who doesnt like sharing much about my family, but this situation has made me feel like Im useless. Its affecting me mentally, and I cant seem to find a way out.Another problem is that theyre the kind of people who never pay their share of bills. Over the past couple of years, Ive paid for a lot of things fees, rent, and even helped them financially multiple times. I never asked for the money back because I didnt want to make them feel bad. But now, I feel like theyve just used me as an ATM.What hurts the most is that they exclude me from everything. They party together, drink together, and travel without even inviting me. Yet, whenever I organize something, I make sure to include them. Its been like this for the past 9-10 months, and I dont know what to do. (i dont drink and smoke)I feel trapped because if I leave this group, I wont have any friends left.

I'd argue that economic interdependence and international institutions have been far more effective at maintaining peace.Look at the EU - former enemies France and Germany became so economically integrated that war became unthinkable, not because of nukes, but because their economies would collapse. Modern warfare between developed nations would devastate the global financial system that we all rely on.Also, nuclear weapons haven't prevented numerous proxy wars and regional conflicts. The Soviet-Afghan war, Vietnam, Korea - all happened despite nuclear deterrence. Even today, Russia is waging war in Ukraine despite having nukes.The real game-changer has been the rise of liberal democracy and free trade. Countries that trade together and share democratic values rarely go to war with each other. That's why the West has been largely peaceful since WW2, while authoritarian regions remain conflict-prone.I used to work in international trade, and I've seen firsthand how business relationships and supply chains create powerful incentives for peace. When you're making billions trading with another country, you think twice about bombing them.The \\"nuclear deterrence\\" narrative is pushed by the military-industrial complex to justify massive defense spending.

Defensive democracy seems to work alright for Germany, after all.EDIT: The terrifying part of that ethos is its communitarian anti-individualism, if the community deliberates that they don't like you, you're pretty much screwed. But there's also the part that since they vest so much power in that kind of little state, they thought a lot about the ways that it might become subverted and turned into a tool of oppression.

Hes running America just like he ran his companies, take as much as he can and then file bankruptcy. How is this already not an ethics violation? How is trump able to keep his presidency with his rules and regulations that will permanently destroy a country? Wtf?! Why isnt anyone handling this in the government?!??The ds are supposed to be these smart and well educated people and yet they are consistently under prepared and easily surrender. For example, Im really surprised that Harris didnt come up with a contingency plan re trump/rs falsifying votes. And again, why are all of the changes that trump wants to make that will negatively impact us permanently ok? Why did Biden drop out 3 months before the election - why wasnt this done 3 years ago?Its a shit show all around. The rs keep setting the us on fire and the ds put out little fires without coming up with a framework and methodology of managing the rs. As George Carlin said, garbage in and garbage out.

It's commonly understood that good politics and good policy are separate matters, but people still tend to assume that their brand of policy will each the ideal political outcomes. I'll defend the Afghanistan withdrawal and Big Fiscal as policy decisions, but I can't deny that they were political liabilities. Still, I think it's worth noting that the majority of the progressive economic policy passed under Biden was either temporary social assistance (ARP) or investment that will take years to feel the effects of (Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS, Infrastructure). For voters to appreciate a policy, it needs to be both lasting and immediately impactful. None of the progressive policies passed under Biden fit that category. I don't think the takeaway is that economically progressive policy is a political loser. It's that any progressive policy needs to be non-inflationary, immediately impactful, and lasting to have good electoral results.

I'm glad you don't want children to be trafficked at the border, but Trump just appointed a child predator as AG. All in all, it's your vote and you used it as you saw fit.  I'd just encourage you to look at policy positions of the candidates and examine the info you're using to make that choice rather than relying on the narratives that you're getting. You didn't pick outside the two party system, you voted for the Republican. You didn't vote for the candidate who sticks up for the middle class, you voted for a billionaire who was supported by many other billionaires (the same ones that own major newspapers and TV channels that changed how they operate to favor him).

Cracking down means that we may end up putting more people in jail, while toleration means that we lose both the benefits of legal regulation and the benefits of illegal persecution.2) More philosophically, if a substance is sufficiently harmless that we believe at least some people are able to use it recreationally, I dont see the morality in punishing those who sell that substance.If were going to reduce drug incarceration without legalization, the appropriate tool seems to me to be sentencing requirements and prosecutorial discretion (though whether drug prosecutions actually significantly contributes to the American carceral state is somewhat in doubt, given the research of John Pfaff).","title":"Did you know that succ disorder affects a growing number of r/neoliberal users?"},{"text":"Joe was so happy to get out of the White House.

This makes it difficult for third parties to gain traction, as votes for them can be seen as wasted if they dont win, leading to strategic voting for the lesser of two evils. 2. **Ballot Access Laws**\\nEach state has its own laws regarding how political parties can get on the ballot. These laws often require third parties to gather a large number of signatures or meet other stringent requirements, which can be a significant barrier to entry. 3. **Funding and Resources**\\nMajor parties have established fundraising networks and significant financial resources. A new party would need to build these from scratch, which is a daunting task. Campaign finance laws also tend to favor established parties. 4. **Media Coverage**\\nThe media often focuses on the two major parties, giving them more visibility and legitimacy. Third parties struggle to get the same level of coverage, making it harder to reach potential supporters. 5. **Voter Loyalty**\\nMany voters have strong loyalties to the existing major parties, often passed down through generations. Convincing these voters to switch allegiance to a new party is a significant challenge. 6. **Internal Divisions**\\nProgressive movements often encompass a wide range of issues and perspectives, which can lead to internal divisions. Building a cohesive platform that satisfies all factions within the movement can be difficult. 7. **Historical Precedent**\\nHistorically, third parties in the US have struggled to maintain long-term success. While they have occasionally influenced major party platforms, they rarely achieve sustained electoral success.These obstacles create a challenging environment for any new party trying to break into the established political landscape. However, history has shown that significant change is possible with sustained effort and strategic planning.Does this align with what you were thinking, or is there a specific aspect youd like to dive deeper into?","title":"What are the obstacles to making a progressive reform party in the U.S. that can challenge and/or replace the democratic party in the way past political parties rose to prominence?"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/5dtmpmdjcf1e1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5dabac933bd7adacc8b51e8d1323b913b895ef6I get that supporting content makers is important and all that butthis made me laugh out loud","title":"Liberalism is the rebellion now"},{"text":"You would need to have a major split in the Democrats, who are basically a centrist party, which would push the Democrats more central, create a new true left party, and split some of the voters away from the Republicans, so you have a viable 3 way race.","title":"What are the obstacles to making a progressive reform party in the U.S. that can challenge and/or replace the democratic party in the way past political parties rose to prominence?"},{"text":"It wont be a sham election.","title":"Democrats got wiped out in 2004.

Feminism is what it does - and what it does is misconstrue society, blame men for everything, make them acceptable targets for condemnation and dehumanization, empower narcissists to invent endless grievances against the world, all while failing to acknowledge women's power and privilege. It is unambiguously a chauvinist movement, not an equality movement, nor any kind of movement to deconstruct gender.Feminists had a chance to recognize the manhaters and other toxic elements in their group and kick them aside in favor of a more honest, open, and inclusive equality movement; instead it overlooked them, protected them, and embraced them and their hatred. Like all the other social justice movements, feminism allowed its symbols and rhetoric to be coopted by corporations and liars in exchange for fame and power, and in the process it became wedded to neoliberalism.People wonder why young men are moving right. It's because they see all their enemies in one place that they think of as \\"the left\\": the women and white knights who hate them on social and corporate media for clout and ruin every male space while decrying masculinity as toxic, and the corrupt establishment that has abandoned both free and fair democracy and the working class and calls them names if they complain about it.It's not that the men are all fascist racist misogynists. It IS that they've had just about enough of this shit, and they see no other political home for them than the right - which, for all its flaws, accepts them with open arms, not the calculating death-stare of some noseringed, fluorescent haired harpy.It will probably lead to empowering _actual_ racists, misogynists, and fascists - and that's the price that the SJWs and their pet demographics will pay for trying to bully society into changing and succumbing to the temptation of hypocrisy.I'm not sorry at all.

The Washington Consensus is, strictly understood, an 1989-era economic reform package provided to countries which requested loans or bailouts from the IMF, World Bank, or Paris Club of creditor nations. It is an area of ongoing economic research as to how best to deal with systemically indebted and poorly-managed countries, and so arguing against the Washington Consensus as a means of critiquing all of neoclassical economics is little better than a strawman.Second, this doesnt substantially respond to any of the criticism Ive made or cited regarding the Chang/Studwell industrial policy approach. [Consider](https://pileusblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/ha-joon-chang-wrong-on-free-trade-markets-and-development/):\\nSignificantly, Chang fails to acquaint his readers with any of the empirical literature that has sought to decipher the causal role of protection in development relative to other factors. Douglas Irwin and Stephen Broadberry, in particular, have questioned the role of tariffs by showing convincingly that the sectors of the US economy that were supposed to benefit most from infant industry protection did not in fact experience strong growth. Thus, at the time the US overtook Britain in the nineteenth century it did so largely by increasing labour productivity in the service sector C and not through gains in protected sectors of manufacturing industry. Similarly, high growth in Argentina and Canada in the late nineteenth century was largely due to growth outside the specific industries which were supposed to benefit from import tariffs. Protection in Britain meanwhile C notably the Corn Laws, actually slowed the industrialisation process by preventing the transfer of resources out of agriculture and into industry.\\nIt is, of course, tempting to be frustrated with the pace of development in poorer countries, and to turn to proponents of alternative ideologies that promise quick gains at no cost.But the neomercantilists are selling snake oil. Like the Marxists and Austrians, their version of economics relies on disregarding data for [narratives rife with observation bias and sample selection bias (as many critics have noted)](https://eh.net/book_reviews/kicking-away-the-ladder-development-strategy-in-historical-perspective/), and insisting that any failure of policy has to do with implementation, rather than the policys own shortcomings.","title":"Did you know that succ disorder affects a growing number of r/neoliberal users?"},{"text":"We cannot be sure, no, in general if you haven't experienced something yourself, then you can't be certain that its true, it's rather elementary.

When really, this election cycle looks like a vindication of Obama-era neoliberal caution on the economy where you strongly favor low inflation (even with a slow recovery) over faster growth but higher inflation. Had the ARP never existed, or at least been half the size it actually was, we are looking at President-Elect Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. Similarly, it also vindicates Obama's reluctance to wind down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, because Biden never recovered from winding down in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Biden himself took a bold stand on trans rights (before coming out in favor of gay marriage!) on the trail in a seemingly close election, which didn't hurt him or Obama at all.For all the handwringing, had Biden adopted a truly neoliberal economic approach (which was called for, seeing that 2020-2021 was a supply shock, pure and simple), either Biden or Harris is President-elect today. The fact that it wasn't done stems from the Dems more or less adopting the Bernie Sanders autopsy of why we lost in 2016, which was not adopting enough economic populism and not ending the wars. We did both of those things and lost, because voters didn't like the results of these things (inflation, and looking weak).I think a lot of liberals in general are uncomfortable admitting that Bernie Sanders's influence on the party has been both significant and almost entirely malign, first by road-testing a lot of the attacks against Hillary, then by pushing the party into thinking it needed to move closer to his style of politics, and then finally by getting significant concessions on policy that objectively hurt the economy.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Just based off the numbers and my Conspiracy mindset, there might be some evidence in the numbers that suggests that someone or some entity found a way to simply erase Republican votes in 2020.

There is an issue with *well meaning liberals* trying to fight a fight for justice that they don't personally understand rather than just being good allies in that fight, and I feel like he touches on that a little, but not really.In this monologue though Maher just sounds like a weak willed yuppie in his golden years bending with what he thinks are the political winds in his well to do social circle.  The fact that he's parading out minorities and shitting on trans girls as a well off old man to try to make his point is just as bad as any other doing the same regardless of political affiliation.  His attitude is the type of attitude that divides the Democratic party and shrinks it to a handful of well off elites alienating it from the rest of America, not the other way around.Mouton's constituents have chastised him heavily and shown up to protest his office for his remarks.  He seems to think that allowing for equal rights for trans youth means that \\"men\\" are going to be playing with his \\"little girls\\".  The guy is vilifying trans girls the same age as his daughters.  That's not leadership.  That's being a coward and biting on alt-right rhetoric.  If his constituents vote him out or want him to step down, that's not \\"cancel culture\\", that's consequences.Edit: Let's also not ignore the fact that Maher has built his career on calling conservatives stupid.","title":"Bill Maher: Privileged and Stupid Democrats Need to Stop Digging Hole Over Identity Politics"},{"text":"??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So what?Just sack officials left right and center until you get some yes man that will do what you want.Can't rig things before the election? just do it after as an \\"official act\\".Set alllll the safeguards you want america.

The scale of this is immense.??\\nPower: The Ras Al-Khair needs 200MW for desalination. Seven times that would mean 1,4 GW. Egypt's current electricity production capacity is 60 GW and they are a net exporter of electricity. It seems like this should not be a power generation problem.??\\nCost: the Ras Al-Khair cost roughly $7,1 Billion. However it is not just desalination, it produces 2,2 GW excess power. So let's say $5B was the cost of desalination. That would mean Egypt would need $35B to construct 7 times that capacity. That's a lot of money but not too outlandish. Ras Al-Khair took 5 years to construct. If Egypt planned it as 20 year project, they'd need to set 3% of their government budget aside to cover the costs.??\\nNone of this seems too outlandish to me.","title":"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history"},{"text":"In my opinion, youre jumping too quickly to the doomsday scenario of national collapse.

Your class is determines by your relationship with production (I.e. whether or not the capitalist system is exploiting your labor for profit) not how you feel about yourself.But yes, a class identity of sorts does emerge from shared experience and cultural. But it's not the point. The point is that society is divided into owners and non-owners which creates a fundamental social antagonism. Other antagonisms exist, but once they are resolved, if they are resolved, the class antagonisms remain. This can be clearly seen in independent countries that used to be colonies. The colonial overlord has been overthrown, but the colonial capitalist just gets replaced with a native capitalist, the foreign boss with a native boss, and the fundamental conflict isn't resolved.The other major drawback with identity politics is that even the identity politics of an oppressed minority group can become reactionary, can develop into tribalism, supremacism, bigoted ethnocentrism, or mysticism. The very fact of the historical oppression can serve as a sort of mythos of supremacy.Whats worrisome is this push to recontextualize class consciousness as another matter of identity politic. It's just fluff. The interviewee is right, in a sense, when she says that when nobody is addressing class guys like Limbaugh can come riding in appealing to class as an identity as a means of channeling frustration. But it's just exploiting that frustation for the ruling class's ends, and you don't want to support any program that parrots that strategy, from any angle, including from liberals.

It's about whether abortion should be broadly acceptable and legal. In order to advocate for legalizing abortion totally, unless you want to argue that it is acceptable to kill children, you need to formulate an argument to make the claim that it is not a person. That is what the debate centers around. The pro-abortion crowd is not advocating for abortions to be allowed in cases of medical risk or necessity. They're arguing for it to be allowed at a whim, for any reason, or none at all. To say it is about healthcare is simply a dishonest representation of their argument.You can say that it is about 'bodily autonomy', but this is exactly where we get into biased framing. The anti-abortion side does not generally hold the belief that women shouldn't have bodily autonomy, but rather that the one specific act of abortion violates the bodily autonomy of what they view as another person. From a more moderate perspective, the abortion debate is about how to balance the rights of the child to live with the woman's right to determine what happens inside her body. One side is more concerned with one of these things at the expense of the other and vice versa. To label the issue by referring to it only in terms of the concerns of one side is pretty much the textbook definition of biased framing.Framing it as not a conspiracy is biasCalling something a 'conspiracy theory' is in fact biased. To call something a 'conspiracy theory' is a conclusion, not a presentation of a fact. You are presenting the reader with the conclusion you felt they should come to before, or instead of, giving them direct facts and information.  \\nit still gives the topic more legitimacy it deserves.To determine, as the writer of a news article, how much legitimacy one side of an issue deserves is the most clear definition of biased you could make.

This is what they do. Moral panics, fearmongering, complete distortions of reality, all for the sake of inciting hatred and validating the prejudices, phobias and paranoid delusions of a seething faction of conservatives.Despite all the histrionics from conservatives on social media this election cycle about the radical left's plot to indoctrinate the masses with transgender and anti-white pedagogy, to perform sex change operations on students and immigrants against their will, to \\"groom\\" children and expose them to pornography in schools, to flood women's sports with men, to force children to attend drag shows, to expose young kids to graphic material in class, to use the education system to recruit children into the LGBTQ and cultural Marxist movement, to use companies to promote the transgender and gay agenda.Despite the hysteria from conservatives around critical race theory, \\"DEI\\" and affirmative action initiatives, \\"anti-racism,\\" imposed white guilt, a radical and secular agenda that's persecuting Christians, a \\"defund the police\\" movement that only a fringe minority of liberals actually took literally, while most were merely asking for accountability, the addressing of racial injustices, profiling, stereotyping, police brutality, and better de-escalation training for police officersdespite all this culture war driven panic and outrage, voters did not turn out en masse to protect their children from a long list of LGBTQ boogeymen, voters did not turn out in solidarity against the \\"woke mind virus.\\"Because it's all a bunch of propaganda and scare tactics, the same old story told again and again about some liberal agenda to transform American culture into something depraved, abnormal, irreligious, and evil.The key drivers this election were the economy, foreign policy and immigration, while most Americans, and low propensity voters in particular, have entirely memory-holed Trump's disastrous economic and foreign policy record, and the fact that Republicans would rather run on immigration as a fearmongering wedge issue, than actually address it with policies that aren't extreme, non-viable, impractical and inhumane...But let's address the hysteria around \\"wokeness.\\" Conservatives claim that it's \\"the left\\" who are obsessed with race, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc... but what I see is often the opposite. Where figures on \\"the right\\" constantly condemn \\"woke culture\\" and criticize a liberal, racial, gender or DEI related agenda whenever the opportunity presents itself. I see conservatives instigating this culture war conflict disproportionately more than I see liberals living up to these criticismsLet's not forget that the modern Republican party was built off of a conservative movement that thrived by inciting racial tensions, scapegoating minorities, and appealing to the grievances of white southerners in particular who were dismayed by civil rights legislation, desegregation, and law and order dog whistling that inculcated white conservatives with fears of racial crime in their neighborhoods.Think about the modern panic around critical race theory and cultural Marxism, and how we are apparently teaching children to feel guilty for being white because history lessons are a little discomforting for parents, albeit accurate. Think about how some conservatives now claim that racism is over while spouting \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric, yet it's anti-white discrimination that's the *real* threat. Think about the record number of challenges to book titles in libraries, thousands more every year, most of which conservatives haven't even read. But because they feature a POC as the protagonist, or contain a queer character or title, they must either be rife with pornography or teaching children to hate whiteness.Think about all the fearmongering and misinformation surrounding immigrants, and how Republicans have emboldened an ultra nationalistic, nativist, white supremacist movement in this country. Think about the promotion of the \\"great replacement theory.\\" Are these things not centered largely around race and ethnicity?Think about how Republicans highlight isolated black crimes in particular in order to raise fears. Think about how every time there's a mass shooting, Republicans direct the conversation to gun violence and murder rates in places like Chicago, when the reality is, rates of gun violence and death rates are highest in Republican-led states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, Alaska etc...Think about the outrage and panic centered around Bud Light after the company sent a single custom can to a transgender personality. Think about the moral outrage directed at target for selling rainbow sandals and t shirts. These are just a couple of examples where conservatives act like a coalition of liberals got together and forced these things to happenThink about all of the increased transphobic and homophobic rhetoric from conservatives every time \\"Pride Month\\" arrives, or how often they promote the idea of a \\"straight pride parade\\" as some kind of joke. Even though pride month was first recognized in 1999, and pride parades have been around for 50+ years.Think about all of the outrage around \\"DEI.\\"Think about all the race related criticisms that Letitia James received, or Jasmine Crockett, even Ketanji Brown Jackson. They were dubbed \\"DEI hires,\\" \\"ghetto trash,\\" despite being more than qualified for their positions. Hell, Jackson was far more qualified for her position than Clarence Thomas was back in the day during his judicial appointment, and Thomas has literally been labeled, \\"the greatest beneficiary of affirmative action in US history\\" by those closest to him.Think about how when gay or black actors appear in a movie, TV show, commercial, or any form of media, there's always someone crying \\"woke.\\"Think about how when some black MAGA personality speaks out on social media, conservatives rally around them and claim *their* appeal to black people.Think about the AI images that circulated over social media of Donald Trump posing with black people.Think about Trump's disingenuous showings at black events, where he sometimes rambles on incoherently about how he's done more for black people than Abraham Lincoln, or remarks that Kamala Harris is \\"all of a sudden\\" black.Think about the outrage over litter boxes in schools. Think about how race, gender identity and sexual orientation in particular are the target of countless Republican-led legislative efforts.Think about Republicans wanting to roll back civil rights based on sex or gender discrimination.And all the fearmongering propaganda centered around the LGBTQ movement.Or how conservatives are so obsessed with pronouns, that they can't help but constantly make the same \\"joke\\" over and over again, while crying \\"God have mercy!\\" if anyone uses non-heteronormative pronouns, sometimes literally passing bills to prevent itOh, and the very disturbing fixation on pedophilia and conspiracy theories centered around child sex abuse rings and their bizarre tendency to accuse their opponents of being pedophiles.The point being, who's really obsessed with these things?","title":"Bill Maher: Privileged and Stupid Democrats Need to Stop Digging Hole Over Identity Politics"},{"text":"you're trying to equate being against males in women's sports with women's right to vote","title":"Bill Maher: Privileged and Stupid Democrats Need to Stop Digging Hole Over Identity Politics"},{"text":"I've never once had a pollster ask me who I voted for.","title":"Jill Biden gives letter to Trump to give to Melania after she skips White House meet"},{"text":"Anyone using the term \\"woke\\" unironically doesn't get to be taken seriously.

Community after community feels taken advantage of by Wall Street investors and distant landlords. Vice President Harris is calling on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act, to curtail these practices by removing key tax benefits for major investors who acquire large numbers of single-family rental homes.Not bad.Actually talked about health care for all/single payer healthcare and not good, though ticky-tacky micro policies like $35 insulin or letting Medicare cover in-home care.While I agree the urgent need for a full proper health-care, I wouldn't knock her offered proposals (also in the link above). I suppose Gen Z may not grasp the actual value of Medicare covering home elder care, but it's kind of a huge deal (though it would have been tough to get it passed).

No tax on tips can be a good policy if implemented but if were all being honest, she just took it from Trump after he talked about it first, which makes her seem a bit disingenuous.No tax on tips was immediately and transparently bullshit from Trump. Because it's such an obvious excuse not to raise the federal minimum wage - which is Harris' position. Trump's pretending to do workers a huge favor but Harris really wanted to push to raise wages. The no tax on tips from Trump was a little insulting without meaningful wage increases as well.

Charles Schumer, Majority Leader  \\nThe Hon. Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader  \\nUnited States Senate  \\nWashington, D.C.? 20510Dear Senator:The below civic organizations and scholars write to you out of concern that a year-long hold by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) on the confirmation of David Huitema for Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is placing ethics compliance of the presidential transition process at risk. We encourage the Senate to lift that hold and complete the appointment of fair and impartial leadership of OGE.Sen. Lee declared more than a year ago that he would prefer the appointment of the OGE Director be made after the inauguration of a new administration and has thus placed a Senatorial hold on the appointment of Huitema ever since.*Ethics should never be viewed as a partisan game*. In fact, the Directorship is a five-year term, specifically designed to overlap administrations to minimize the influence of partisan politics. And David Huitema, much like the prior Director Emory Rounds appointed by then-President Trump, has a seasoned career of impartial ethics enforcement. Huitema has long been managing the State Departments ethics program in a fair and prudent manner, without consideration of partisanship. Huitema is precisely suited to be the kind of balanced Director of OGE that ethics requires.One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGEs vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.We strongly encourage the Senate to override the hold of David Huitema as Director of the Office of Government Ethics and allow for the proper enforcement of the ethics process without undue consideration of partisan favoritism.Sincerely,American Federation of Teachers  \\nAmerican Oversight  \\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  \\nColorado Black Women for Political Action  \\nCourt Accountability  \\nAlexander B.

Charles Schumer, Majority Leader  \\nThe Hon. Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader  \\nUnited States Senate  \\nWashington, D.C.? 20510Dear Senator:The below civic organizations and scholars write to you out of concern that a year-long hold by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) on the confirmation of David Huitema for Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is placing ethics compliance of the presidential transition process at risk. We encourage the Senate to lift that hold and complete the appointment of fair and impartial leadership of OGE.Sen. Lee declared more than a year ago that he would prefer the appointment of the OGE Director be made after the inauguration of a new administration and has thus placed a Senatorial hold on the appointment of Huitema ever since.*Ethics should never be viewed as a partisan game*. In fact, the Directorship is a five-year term, specifically designed to overlap administrations to minimize the influence of partisan politics. And David Huitema, much like the prior Director Emory Rounds appointed by then-President Trump, has a seasoned career of impartial ethics enforcement. Huitema has long been managing the State Departments ethics program in a fair and prudent manner, without consideration of partisanship. Huitema is precisely suited to be the kind of balanced Director of OGE that ethics requires.One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGEs vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.We strongly encourage the Senate to override the hold of David Huitema as Director of the Office of Government Ethics and allow for the proper enforcement of the ethics process without undue consideration of partisan favoritism.Sincerely,American Federation of Teachers  \\nAmerican Oversight  \\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  \\nColorado Black Women for Political Action  \\nCourt Accountability  \\nAlexander B.

Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader  \\nUnited States Senate  \\nWashington, D.C.? 20510Dear Senator:The below civic organizations and scholars write to you out of concern that a year-long hold by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) on the confirmation of David Huitema for Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is placing ethics compliance of the presidential transition process at risk. We encourage the Senate to lift that hold and complete the appointment of fair and impartial leadership of OGE.Sen. Lee declared more than a year ago that he would prefer the appointment of the OGE Director be made after the inauguration of a new administration and has thus placed a Senatorial hold on the appointment of Huitema ever since.*Ethics should never be viewed as a partisan game*. In fact, the Directorship is a five-year term, specifically designed to overlap administrations to minimize the influence of partisan politics. And David Huitema, much like the prior Director Emory Rounds appointed by then-President Trump, has a seasoned career of impartial ethics enforcement. Huitema has long been managing the State Departments ethics program in a fair and prudent manner, without consideration of partisanship. Huitema is precisely suited to be the kind of balanced Director of OGE that ethics requires.One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGEs vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.We strongly encourage the Senate to override the hold of David Huitema as Director of the Office of Government Ethics and allow for the proper enforcement of the ethics process without undue consideration of partisan favoritism.Sincerely,American Federation of Teachers  \\nAmerican Oversight  \\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  \\nColorado Black Women for Political Action  \\nCourt Accountability  \\nAlexander B.
