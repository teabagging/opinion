I don't think justice is about culture, or at least surely not in this sense.

A religious culture doesn't have to stay religious, the state shouldn't try to keep religion alive for this purpose. Members of a culture who wish to create their own culture should be able to. One state should be able to house many cultures. Interaction between cultures is mostly beneficial for both. Even assimilating shouldn't means 100% because members of the culture are not the same. There are many attributes you can loosely tie to cultures, but nobody has 100% of them. Why not treat the whole thing as more fluid.Also, to treat other cultures with respect and tolerance is not a threat to your own culture. You don't have to respect ever part of other cultures, you can call parts out as barbaric, but to therefore have a problem with other, usually neutral parts I think does not make sense. Ideally, every culture should share this attitude.","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"Steve Bannon thinks someone is more racist and evil than he is?

Unless it's in self-defence.In many cases, wars is not benefical. But in some extreme circumstances (self-defence is one of them) - it is. But self-defence is not only one circumstance. Like it this case should people choose the initial Sovereign and then later generations don't get a say or what?Because we lost a monarchy. For example, in England, to change to ideal monarchy in my views, there should be no elections, heir should just get powers back, like Meiji's Restoration, but from those flawed democracy, which lead to woke values. But in countries who lost a monarchy - there should be elections to select most capable one to start a new dynasty. You put a lot on this \\"save culture\\" thing, so I assume you think that has value. But why? Culture, by Mearsheimer, is \\"the set of shared practices and beliefs that underlie a society. These practices include customs and rituals, clothing, food, music, habits, symbols and the language people speak. They also include the subtle facial expressions, mannerisms and modes of communication through which people interact and make their way in everyday life.\\" Shouldn't the best values of a culture be tolerance, non-aggression, solidarity and the like? To a said culture's members, yes. But if outsiders try to change our culture, but not to assimilate, then they are a threat. Or is culture only good until it serves self-preservation and expansion?Culture should serve self-preservation, definitely. Not always an expansion. But it should be able to defend itself from cultural rivals. Would cuisine, outfits and religious rituals and stuff be a more important value in a culture than moral ones? I would consider cuisine and outfits as least important things of a culture. Religion is a different story. Religion ingrained deeply inside a culture, and, for example, for Serbs and Croatians it is a big deal. Cultures that don't do that deserve to die out?If culture at some point lost - winner can try to kill his rival. In a world of cultures, might makes right. But it is important to distinguish culture from a population, because you should not need to be violent to population, even if you try to kill their culture. You should not cosplay Hitler.  As in, not justice, no liberal democracy, but still power but at least power treats people consistently and more or less equally, no arbitrary rulings?Not liberal democracy, but justice. But justice in cultural sense, so, for example, I think it is okay to require assimilation for getting a citizenship and a full rights. And any members of said culture should be threated equally, by same law, except the Emperor, who has a special duty.\\nBut do not forget - if you try to assimilate somebody, which has a powerful neighbor of a same culture which you try to destroy in your country - ready to get FABed and your land annexed.  Also, what about changing cultures? Cultures don't come from nothing and they change all the time. Do they always need to be kept the same or should they adapt to serve other interests? Yes, cultures can change overtime. And they should adapt, but only in that sense if they will not lost ablitity to self-preserve and to reproduce.","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"Well...

I do not mean this as a criticism of your style. Only of the relationship between your assumptions and conclusions.You espouse a fundamentally conservative view of the concept of human rights and political economy (the 10 commandments, as I've shown here, are a political economic blueprint that the enlightenment engages with), but you say that you have absolutely no objection to the invasions of Syria, Ukraine, or potentially Greenland. Yet we know, and there is no disagreement, that such actions result in violations of our social compacts, which are ultimately based on those beliefs.?To believe in both realpolitik and Judeo-Christian morality, even if you have no belief in God or any spiritual institution whatever, is an inconsistent belief set. Realpolitik says that these considerations, while they can be considered in a secondary fashion, are only important in the sense that they enhance a state's claim to legitimacy before its own people and between nations. They are entirely cynical, and are therefore quite ready to be dropped anytime they become difficult to maintain.?Realpolitik in that sense treats its own citizens as a version of the enemy against which it commits these crimes. The crime itself is one thing, but the state then criminalizes the citizen who carries this out on its behalf, by forcing him to betray his basic moral convictions, victimizing him all over again. Anyone else who views this person as a victim is also a criminal in the sense that they are an enemy of the state. But anyone who views the person's actions as a crime is also guilty of a sentiment against the state's interests, and so on.?Realpolitik is a system of crime and victimization that extends across a society and down to its very daily life. The crimes of the state become the crimes of the people, and the state becomes as much a system for maintaining its own control as for using its hard power to extend itself or gain real geopolitical advantages.?If you want the absolutely simplest possible argument against this, its that it *never* works. It always creates unbearable contradictions and tensions which an enemy state can exploit and which its own citizens rebel against as soon as the material advantages that it brings in the shorter term have expired.?/fin","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"# Part 3 (of 4)The trial had a very difficult balance to manage: to satisfy most particularly the Soviet desire to be seen as a legitimate partner to the other Allies, to satisfy the vastly greater grievances of the Soviets compared to everyone else, but to also try to implement a fundamentally enlightenment moral philosophy on a proceeding against actors who were seen to use state-level politics to carry out an attack on the very foundations of monistic Enligthenment values.?And to acknowledge a like objection: keep in mind that Soviet Communism, as much as it was demonized as antithetical to western enlightenment values, is in fact based on all the same fundamental assumptions about the nature of people and the enlightenment critique of \\"received truth.\\"Now, did Nuremberg succeed? There was never a third war. Germany was totally reformed, and even though its purge and blacklisting of huge parts of its institutions was largely undone in the following years, yet these institutions never returned to the anti-enlightenment, anti-liberal orientation the Allies feared. This was so much the case that despite the fact that Germany had lost the war, it was in essence put on a path to eventually lead a united European political economy. One can certainly criticize that process and that idea, but it has been extremely successful on its own terms.?One could indeed argue that ALL of this was done with a profit motive in mind. And profit, people certainly did. However I think it's significant that in choosing an initial direction for the process of European re-integration, the Allies chose and agreed to a process that recognized that there are higher moral considerations to the actions of individuals than the legal systems in which those actions take place. That is something (nearly) every state seems inherently to know, or else it would be the rule that wars produce no prisoners, that all civilians are to be executed, and that genocide would be, for practical purposes, the foreign policy of every warring state.?We saw what happened to cultures that really did adopt those kinds of policies: either they succeed (American colonists against native Americans), or they fail in *spectacular* fashion (Germany, Japan), and are then rebuilt from the roots up as whatever the victors want them to become. I'd argue in many ways Japan and Germany today are far more free and more humane states and cultures than the states and cultures they once tried to destroy. It's almost as if they demonstrate how enlightenment values *can* work if they are applied on a truly grand scale. But who knows? Maybe the results aren't because of the values at all. I don't know and I'm sure nobody else does.?I see no issues in a dictatorships in authoritarian states. They can be as good as democratic ones, and as bad as democratic ones too.I think it's questionable whether this statement is self-consistent with your views on morality. A dictatorship is, without exception, a system in which political violence is monopolized by an individual or ruling cohort. The basic tenets of dictatorship (as with monarchy by the way), are that a monopoly of violence is the source of legitimate authority.?That authority derives originally from the dual role of a king or tribal leader as a spiritual leader. Some would argue that the commandments and other law codes in fact derive from an older pattern of a tribal leader being in some sense indistinguishable from the role of Father, War Leader, Chieftan, and Priest (even Godhead). The law codes can be seen as military code that was necessary to enforce discipline on small groups, and became useful also as a means of keeping political control.?Since most conflicts within a tribe would relate to violence and jealousy (adultery, stealing, killing), the law codes make the rules clear on those. The rest of the codes relate to authority: not making idols (ie: propaganda against the leader), honoring your father (ie: respect your leader), taking no other gods (ie: adopting your tribe's beliefs and following your leader), and taking the Sabbath, which is most probably a means of control as well: dedicating a part of your time to \\"spiritual\\" (as in state related) matters and doing no other work. This keeps people from ever building competing bases of power and influence, and it allows the leader to conduct the tribe's business efficiently, maintaining his control.?","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"What do you mean \\"pressed into cooperation\\"?","title":"Have the past 10 years of Democratic politics been a disaster?"},{"text":"As a democrat myself.

Why would you care more about suffering in one nation over another?I also think the war in Ukraine is outside the scope of this discussion but a large component of my view is that allowing Russia to conquer Ukraine would inspire other would-be conquerors and reduce stability worldwide. We live in a time of unprecedented peace among nations and fewer people die from violence than ever. It has allowed the fastest growth of human development in history. That peace should be upheld. So when one nation attacks another, it should be punished so that other nations see clearly that their own imperial ambitions are not feasible.

Liberalism, I will admit, has a tendency to view itself as the \\"ultimate and final\\" culture, and that tendency is built into the roots of the enlightenment and its basis in the legalist traditions of Judaism that date back to our first truly literary culture. There is and has always been an inborn belief (just as exists in other similarly old and deeply rooted traditions), that western judeo-christian values are in some way special and manifestly destined to be the last and final political culture.Now, as to whether this substantially informs your conclusion? I'm not convinced. I, as you do, tend to think that there are probably things about each other that we will never truly learn. However I don't believe that the current state of western liberalism yet supports a broad conclusion that it is incapable of further reform -- or I suppose that to jump to the end, that it is impossible that liberals could understand anyone who isn't them. I'll grant you it does *seem* impossible. Even to me. But I don't think appearances are proof.?Apart from universal sins (written in the Testaments), like trying to kill entire population, other things (even non-violent genocides) - is state's business, not world one. If you are strong enough, you can try to subjugate other state to force it to stop - but what is the point? You need to have some profit from it.So, you do a little sleight of hand here that makes your argument completely unacceptable and incoherent (and I mean that in the critical sense, not that I think you're being rude or anything).?**\\"Apart from X, YZQ is true. Based on YZQ, here is the solution for the system\\"** But then YZQ is no longer a universal statement about the nature of values. The statement is no longer universal, and thus the conclusion upon which it rests is disproven. You believe there ARE universal values that humans can and do recognize, which then can and MUST be operative at the level of state politics as well. There is no middle ground there.?If you're a computer science guy, and I'm sensing you probably are, you will recognize an application of formal logic here: If a system claims to be complete, it cannot contain a statement that it asserts as true while simultaneously invalidating its own universality.  If you posit **Y - X, then Y = Z\\\\_Y** must hold universally. Otherwise, the system's consistency collapses, revealing its inherent contradictions.In formal logic, introducing exceptions (X) to a universal set of values (Y) creates an inconsistency, similar to how G?del's incompleteness theorem reveals that a complete system cannot be entirely consistent. By asserting 'Y - X,' you acknowledge that Y is no longer universal, undermining the original claim of universality.Liberal democracy, as much as it does try to appear to be a universal system, is also fundamentally aware that this weakness exists. You believe that a universal human value system exists, therefore you DO believe that liberalism (which *also* proceeds from these values), is at least partially correct. Perhaps incorrect as a matter of degree or of detail, but not as a matter of basic principle. You cannot say that the political philosophy that flows from a fundamental belief in the tenets of the ancient Law Codes, such as \\"eye for an eye\\" and \\"thou shalt not kill,\\" is wrong *in principle*, unless you wish to argue that that is not the fundamental basis on which liberalism rests.And if this is indeed the same fundamental basis of liberalism (and you're free to argue it isn't), then really the actions of liberals are just attempting, at their core, to enact and enforce a version of the same values you believe in. The problem with believing there is a universal set of basic values is that there will be people who don't embody those values, and you will need to do something with them: since genocide is out (of course, we know historically it isn't -- I'm not trying to deny that liberalism can be hypocritical), what then do states do that goes beyond realpolitik? If they want lasting stability and change, and they believe that there are fundamental values that need to be somehow respected everywhere, then they must engage in some form of social politics.?Well, let's think about a practical example of this thinking: Nuremberg, which was designed to try to turn the idea of a politically driven show trial (realpolitik), into a true testbed for the practice of international law as a means of resolving post-war conflicts. Did it succeed? Certainly in some respects the post-war recovery of Europe exceeded all reasonable expectations, particularly outside of the Soviet zone, but also within.","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"They wouldn't need to ban tiktok if our privacy laws in America were as robust as those in Europe.

One can disagree about whether that works, or what it might lead to (as one can disagree with realpolitik for the same reasons), but one should not confuse Leftism with liberalism.

It hasn't exactly led to stable governance when expansionist wars were seen as legitimate, sibling feuds were constant and I don't think it has been generally observed that all that education monarchs got made them very good at ruling in a dependable amount of cases.You seem to have something similar to Hobbes' view on the Sovereign. It was actually a big departure from how monarchy was justified before, but obviously it opened other cans of worms.

He fled to Poland in 2023 and was allowed to compete for the country after declaring opposition to Russias war in Ukraine.At the European Speed Skating Championships in Heerenveen this weekend, the 22-year-old finished 10th in both the 500m and 5,000m mens allround races. It is his first competitive international appearance since winning bronze while representing Russia at the Junior World Championships in January 2022.The following month, Russia invaded Ukraine and its skaters were banned from international competition. Later that year, Semirunniy became Russian champion at 5,000m, but in September 2023 he fled to Poland and declared his desire to represent the Polish national team.However, Semirunniy first faced a compulsory suspension from all competition for changing his international allegiance. Russia wanted him to have a 24-month ban while Poland proposed 12 months. The International Skating Union settled on 14 months.That ban expired last month, after which Semirunniy competed in the Polish Allround Speed Skating Championships, winning gold and setting a faster time in the mens 10,000m than any Polish competitor in history.That was his first competitive appearance of any kind since March 2023. However, since arriving in Poland, Semirunniy has trained constantly with the Polish national team, where he has been nicknamed W?adek, the Polish equivalent of Vlad.Of course, because he is Russian, we were aware that it was a sensitive topic, Konrad Nied?wiedzki, sports director of the Polish Speed ??Skating Association, told broadcaster TVP.We required W?adek to sign documents confirming that he was not sponsored by Russian companies, that he had nothing to do with the Russian army, and that he did not support the war that was going on beyond our eastern border \\\\[in Ukraine\\\\], he added.In December 2022, Semirunniy told Eurosport that of course I do not support this war, the war that Russia started. However, he also made clear that the main reason he left Russia was the lack of prospects in Russian sport, the lack of access to international events.Speaking this week to TVP, Semirunniy, who did not speak Polish when he arrived but is now conversational in the language, said that, after he decided to to flee Russia, he contacted the Dutch, Kazakh and Polish federations, eventually settling on Poland.When I left, I knew it was a one-way ticket, said the skater. Criticism on the internet doesnt bother me. I have many good friends who helped me sort it out in my head.Although he has not yet been granted Polish citizenship C with an application due to soon be submitted C Semirunniy can already compete for Poland at the European and World Championships. However, he would require citizenship to take part in the Olympics.","title":"Speed skater who fled Russia and condemned invasion of Ukraine makes debut for Poland"},{"text":"I'll be completely and unambiguously blunt and say it...

They love to talk about supporting small businesses and workers, but wheres the proof? So far, it feels like empty promises.Honestly, the only time America was great was during the Industrial Revolution, and even that came at a massive cost to workers and basic human dignity.

I dont blame you for having these questions and unbelief even though i do believe in God. To be quite frank these are questions that a lot of people have even if they believe in God. For me personally the one thing that sticks with me is that this earth is created for our conditions perfectly. What i mean is if the earth was an inch closer to the sun we would burn. If it was one inch further we would be too cold. Also our oxygen levels and gravity. All these things make me believe that there has to be a caring and loving God who made these conditions for us. Otherwise we wouldnt exist. The chance for the world to be able to create such a perfect conditions for us on its own is so low that there is a higher chance God is real. Also to answer one of your questions God knows whats going to happen but he gave us free will meaning he will not change it. He can but he wont. A question i also struggled with like yourself is the question about how can God create people he knows are going to hell. And what ive come to learn after a lot of questions is that God created free will so we wouldnt be like robots who just follow him. He gave us a choice but that doesnt mean hes not gonna create the people who choose different anyways. Also hell is not like how we imagined it as kids like a fire. It is simply the absence of God but since we are created by him we will feel pain and hurt from not being with him. However, if the person chooses to live a life away from God then they will get Hell as that is the absence of God. I hope this answered some of your questions.

It's a combination of an oddly angular touchscreen, a windshield-spanning heads-up display, and an LLM-powered AI assistant. The software behind the scenes is called BMW Operating System X, and it powers a new iDrive that combines screens and voice commands. Running along the base of the windshield is what BMW calls Panoramic Vision. It spans the width of the car, with the left-most portion handling typical gauge cluster duties like displaying current speed, active safety controls, and even warnings. The rest of the Panoramic Vision display is customizable, with six widgets that you can drag up from the central touchscreen covering things like outside temperature, navigation ETA, and even another widget showing you turn-by-turn information.?There's another HUD situated on the left, up above the Panoramic Vision, which gives 3D navigation information for the driver. Between the touchscreen, the Panoramic Vision display, and the HUD, you can get three separate feeds of turn-by-turn directions. BMW also quickly demonstrated a new in-car LLM that, for now at least, is only for navigation. ?BMW's SVP of connected company technical operations Stephan Durach states that ?\\"This technology is a little bit different than a traditional heads-up display... we're using black print on the bottom. In bright sunlight, it's even performing a little bit better,\\" he said. \\"You'll not have any issues at all.\\" He also confirms that Android Auto and Apple CarPlay will still be supported.?

Panoramic iDrive is slated to arrive on all new models by the end of 2025.\\\\- Hyundai Mobis is showing off their holographic windshield display (HWD). It consists of two main components: a projector (or in this case multiple projectors) hidden beneath the dash and a special optical film with a carefully tuned wavelength sensitivity embedded inside the windshield itself. This combination allows the HWD to pump out brighter and more colourful images with much shallower viewing angles. It spans the full width of the car with increased brightness and sharpness, two for the driver and one dedicated to the passenger. For the driver, the HWD can display basic stuff like the cars speed, directions and more. But where things get interesting is when it shows holographic 3D maps that can adjust in real-time based on your position, adding an entirely new dimension to help you reach your destination.  \\nFor passengers, their dedicated section of the HWD can be used independently for checking vehicle information or simply watching a video or playing games. Because of the limited viewing angles of Hyundai Mobis tech, the driver cant see the passengers side of the HWD. The company envisions its HWD as a way to augment the main display found in most modern cars, which will most likely serve as the main control center for manipulating what you see on the windshield. And for passengers, its possible they will be able to control what they see on their side of the HWD simply by casting content from their phones. Furthermore, the placement and size of the holographic display makes it easier for the driver to see and interact with helpful tools like real-time 3D maps compared to current tech.?Hyundai hopes to put its HWD into production by sometime in 2027.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"This is a repost, correct?","title":"CMV: AmITheAsshole or AITA is misandrist and racist"},{"text":"  If you think there is no \\"natural and universal human rights\\" then what changed to make it different today?Cost of wars and a decline of TFR.

And it looks like its a uniquely dangerous city with a high crime rate (9.1) compared to the rest of CT (2.1) and the nation (4.3) in 2019. If it is as you say, that crimes is caused by the homelessness, then increased homelessness should be accompanied by an increased crime rate.During Bidens presidency, national crime rate decreased to a historic low, even though homelessness has remained steady in the same time period. The data would then suggest homelessness may not be the cause of the crime rate as you say.To give an example of the discrepancy between statistics and perception, people not wanting to walk around homeless people can result in reduced foot traffic. But that doesnt make homeless people inherently dangerous. If you truly want to convince us that your city is dying, you need to provide tangible proof.You are entitled to the opinion that your city is dying because you observed less foot traffic and growing resentment among your social circle. But as someone whos never been to your city, statistics arent supporting your personal opinion.Of the cities I lived in, HK and CPH are arguably more affective in dealing with homelessness, in the sense that crime statistics being generally lower and there being the perception of safety. Those cities not achieve perceived safety by turning into a police city. The cities fights homelessness by having comprehensive social safety nets and focus on rehabilitation so that fewer people go homeless in the first place.At the end of the day, you cannot just will homeless people out of existence.

The issue is economics, which inspires your decrease of police. No one wants to police a city with an economy in the gutter. Why not try proposing an above ground subway that connects downtown Hartford to NYC instead? Why not try to encourage the growth of commuter lines into downtown Hartford, and pushing for vertical skyscrapers that can actually house people comfortably and provide retail space? More eyes, feet and commuters will justify more real, actual police men. I'm in Jersey, I don't have any real association with Colorado outside a few high school friends who moved there.

You have to remember how massive the US debt is. Its gigantic. Losing the ability to manipulate your currency and print money when the Dollar is replaced, would almost instantaneously result in a mass default. The US military is powerful, no doubt. But a big part of its power relies on western partners having its back. The US has a secure border with Canada and Mexico, attacking NATO would mean US troops abroad would be surrounded in enemy territory right away. Russia, China and Iran, may or may not directly threaten the US homeland or at the very least US spheres of interest and influence. The US is powerful, but not powerful enough to fight Canada on its enormous front line, potentially Europe on their territory, as well as Russia, China, Iran (etc) in US spheres of influence spanning across the globe. The US military is designed to be able to fight in two theaters at once, sure, but that is alwasy assuming that the homefront is secure take that away and youre looking at a different scenario.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"Maybe we should ban Trump.

Scandinavian here, so take my points with a grain of salt. Some of the contributors to small cities having trouble keeping a nice facade and population, along with a shopping area, are both complex and a lot more deep than 'feeling unsafe'. When you grow up not knowing the people around you, you feel like things outside are scary and dangerous. If you only know the people just around you, you're also bound to be in an echo chamber. It's hard to even see it yourself, and even harder to leave them.  \\n  \\nThe best way to revitalize a small city is.. Community. Personally I'd add; devoid of religion and monetary incentive. Positive Community meet ups, Meet and greets, Football clubs, Cookouts, themed events ect. It requires the public to meet, and to engage both younger and older people. It also doesn't require more police. Scared people are dangerous. People who are hungry, cold, scared and destitute can be downright malicious. they need help from the community, not from a single person on the street, or a one off event. But that's a lot longer discussion. All of it also requires people have time, money and energy to set up something like this. This requires people in local government to be interested and want to effect a positive change, that will be tough and more long winded, than publicly just saying that they've increased one budget or another, which can be hard when you need to be re-elected. Real change is slow, and it takes long planning. As others have pointed out, it sounds like you had a conversation with someone who has the idea of wanting specific things but not being very good at putting them into words. Like wanting to treat addiction like a sickness, with medical personnel and help, rather than incarceration. Like many things, it can be hard to put something into words, when you don't know the scope of what you want. I hope that might have changed your view a bit. I don't know your city specifically, but I'm sure there are a lot of people there, that would love to meet others in their area, and make something of it. But when everything becomes money, either getting it or using it, just spending time together becomes tough. I hope it gets better for you.","title":"CMV: Liberals are delusional when it comes to police enforcement and protecting their cities"},{"text":"Not really no.

Recent laws that curb the right to protest are potentially concerning, and at times hate speech laws which I think are generally valid, have been taken too farBut can we not spread conspiracy theories that the UK is 'insanely authoritarian' and join the weird sector of the internet kicking up a fuss about literally 1984 because, for example, people who called for specific and direct violent attacks during riots (eg. calling for specific buildings to be burned down because there were immigrants inside, or coordinating violent gatherings) faced legal consequences.I mean you can find cases of miscarriages of justice, and there are too many of them, but you can find mistakes in how courts and police have handled things in every country on every law. That's the consequence of having laws in general, which are always ultimately defined on fuzzy lines and precedent, sometimes they'll get it wrong. I think the UK sometimes does get it wrong on this and should shift its outlook a bit, but it's not like the UK's democratic society is in peril. Once you're calling the UK 'authoritarian' for it, you're spreading conspiracy theories like Elon Musk.I absolutely prefer our situation with its flaws over the way the US does things and I make no apology of that fact, nor do I think it's illiberal. Europe has a whole legal tradition and structure around civil freedoms and free speech, there's robust protection in various levels of UK and pan-European human rights law, but it just doesn't assert free speech as implied to be supreme, and like all other rights sees them as potentially limited when in conflict with other rights. I was at a talk by a UK supreme court judge once who mentioned that the only right in the European Convention on Human Rights without caveats is a prohibition on torture in all cases, every other right necessarily has exceptions because all rights will conflict with each other on some level. That doesn't mean those rights don't exist, they're defined as robustly as possible (and governments are *constantly* held to account by national and international European courts *and bend to their rulings*), they just will always have to have exceptions.

But actually the US has quite an anti free market right wing and Trump in particular is very anti free market.Breaking it down further across a number of different ways of measuring left right- Canada is well to the right of the US when it comes to regulating the private sector, Canada is aggressively anti red tape for commerce, whereas in the US because of the lobbying industry it's a lot more complicated\\n- As discussed Canada is well to the right of the US on free trade\\n- Canada is well to the left of the US on social issues, even right wing Canadians consider US attitudes on abortion (readily available and publicly funded in Canada) to be medieval\\n- Canada used to be aggressively pro immigration due to being underpopulated and needing demographic support. That is starting to change, but it's still well to the left of the US on immigration.\\n- Canada is well to the left of the US on welfare and even on the right the idea of abolishing universal healthcare is a fringe belief So in summary Canada is well to the right of the US in terms of economic policy and well to the left of the US on social issues and the role of the state. It's well to the right of Europe on all these things.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"Why non-violent genocide is universally bad?

If you could earn the same amount of money without risking prison, who would ever choose a crime career ? So what you need is jobs, not drones.

Addiction don't stop because there are more cameras and drones. People are still addicts, and will still try to find their drugs at all cost. That's the idea behind legalization: instead of wasting money to catch dealers that will be replaced by other dealers because dealing is a lucrative job, you make drug dealing legal, and get taxes from the ones dealing. And with this tax money, you pay for medical help for the addicts, which now have better chances to leave addiction as they are not branded as criminals (who want to hire a criminal) and receive medical help to get out of it.","title":"CMV: Liberals are delusional when it comes to police enforcement and protecting their cities"},{"text":"When the proposed alternate solutions are objectively impossible or vague to the point of being useless, then yes, they are delusional.?if you dont mind me asking, which city do you live in??","title":"CMV: Liberals are delusional when it comes to police enforcement and protecting their cities"},{"text":"You're right over the target, beware of flak.?","title":"Democrats Killed Los Angeles And No One In Power Cares"},{"text":"So true bestie","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I am by no means a luxurious person, almost all pensions in my country are public and I have a pretty good grasp of how they are funded/allocated.

But liberals would argue they are a good thing and should be adopted universally, because not doing so clears the path for abuse and more human suffering. So that is the reasoning.\\nDictatorships could be good in theory, but there's no guarantee they will be. As so with democracies. But with democracies, there's a bigger chance we can get rid of the bad apples, because the system is set up to be able to do so. That's not the case with dictatorships. So we understand that although both democracy and dictatorship can have bad outcomes, democracy is the lesser evil. If you get a good dictator things might work, but if you defend dictatorships and get a bad one, you're doomed. So it's best to not have dictatorships at all.\\nSo liberals are always defending points of view that produce the best outcomes for peace and human quality of life in their views. That's why defending Nazism as free speech doesn't sit right with liberals - they know what roads that leads to, and it's not a pretty one. So defending free speech per se seems great, but it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Same for censorship, liberals wouldn't defend censorship of things that aren't harmful to other people's right to exist. They will want to censor racism (because it has awful consequences), but they wouldn't censor criticism to the government (because that harms democracy).\\nSo liberals don't only think of their views as \\"logic\\" (as in \\"human rights differ by country, therefore aren't universal \\" - duh, they know that, but they don't think that ignoring human rights is likely to produce the best quality of life for the overall population.\\nNow, what each individual thinks it would, it's a different story. But that's how they think, and that's why someone defending dictatorships seems abhorrent for a liberal. They think of the paths it might lead humanity down to.\\nI suggest you do the same with your views - what type of world would be created of everything you believe was true and in place?

And especially for Greenland or Canada nothing exists. You can't make up anything like Bush did for Iraq.Second, attacking an ally is the stupidest thing a president could do. Any military or economic benefit is lost by the dissolution of NATO, which is what such an attack would immediately cause. Panama could be different if Panaman government for some reason decided to block the US from using the canal. In that case the benefit from the invasion could outweigh the diplomatic loss. In the current situation that's not the case. Thirdly, at least Canada would most likely start some form of guerilla war as it a relatively large country both by population and especially area, which would make it extremely hard for the occupation force to keep under control. The cost of the occupation would quickly outweigh any direct economic gain that the annexation would bring. The other two (especially Greenland) are probably less problematic in this sense.Fourthly, the US population would not accept the invasions, especially Canada that is probably the most friendly nation on earth towards the US. This would cause further trouble for the government as it would have to deal with military recruitment crisis and constant protests.

Basic view of their post-ww2 political history shows that quite well. It was only in recent decades that at the \\"end of history\\" the libaral narrative took over and the old fritz was seemingly finished.\\\\\\nThis state of affairs was kept as long as liberalism was triumphant and the country prospered, and certain methods like heavy moderation of the public discourse (even via police force), and uniform narrative on many matters presented in all of the media were employed to ensure just that. Yet, here we are today: the discontent towards the established elites and the economical situation is rapidly growing and thus radical views grow as well fueled by xenophobia, and the establishment feels it's enemies breathing down it's neck, as shown by it's nervous reactions.\\\\ \\nTo claim that Germans have learned from the WW2 (at least except political methodes, they did learn that economic coercion works better for them than military, but that's another topic) while the knowledge about WW2-era atrocities commited by Germany other than the Holocaust is low and dropping and the police are locking up not just Arabs but Jews for publicly criticising Israel's atrocious regime is unseemly. It'd be foolish to say that people in their mass learn in General (have you seen any footage of the Calais Jungle? Oddly familiar, wasn't it?), but the attitudes present in that particular nation are still \\"exceptional\\" (not in a good sense). Here's one quick article: https://jewishcurrents.org/bad-memory-2\\\\\\nAlso, you speak of \\"punishment\\" and \\"atonement\\", but truth of the matter is that apart from very modest gestures Germany never really tried to make amends after the atrocities it has commited other than Holocaust and the war reparations it was forced to pay (e.g. Herero and Nama genocide, massacres in Yugoslavia of destruction of Poland), and the current German historical narrative seems to be that some stateless \\"Nazis\\" are responsible for the 39-45 period, and since \\"Nazism\\" is a set of views and since everyone can be a Nazi the same exact way it was just poor Germany that fell victim to it first, which does sound a little bit like attempted denial of responsibility, admittedly. In my opinion the reason behind that is the effect of the guilt being shoved upon the proud nation rather than actually worked through with it \\n(Like Anglo-Australians and -Canadians did for example) to the point it came back as a trauma, but again, that's just my opinion, not an argument here.\\nRegarding your bullet list:\\\\\\nAd 1,3: How is that an argument for a lift of military restrictions? It's not like nuclear weaponry or a large conventional force would help strenghtening German democracy (especially if increasing xenophobic sentiments will have a say in that). The 1919 Constitution of German Reich established a democratic state with certain guarantees for individual freedom too, mind you.\\\\\\nAd 2: German trade interests don't need a strong native military protection, nor do values as \\"human rights\\" in there or it's vicinity. Similarly, Germany's neighbours and allies would not benefit from a seceded province joining/being joined to the BRD either.\\nAd 3: Germany was in the League of Nations until it had voluntairly left 9 months after the new Chancellor took power. The fact that Germany was a considerable power when those formats was established, and was not kicked out becaus it didn't perpetrate any dire violations of international law just yet doesn't mean all that much.\\\\\\nAd 4: Funny you should say that just after the shortest-ruling goverment since like 50 years just fell and an anti-establishment formations are supported by like 1/3 of German population.\\\\\\nAd 5: Again, how is this relevant to your point? Germany's public services are among the most outdated in Europe, the infrastructure lacks hundereds of billions of Euros in investments, welfare state is headed for cuts, at least for \\"Auslaender\\" and the social and political turmoil is considerable. Germany would probably not want to get rid of those restrictions. It's primary interest is to stabilise and improve it's economic position to keep its social situatin intact. It needs Russia and China for that. Military buildup would be a heavy hit on their economy while they have no actual need for it, so I don't see why would current or next govt. want to lose the justifcation for not doing that.\\\\ The argument that such buildup would be a good thing for their allies seems to be void, or at least not backed in this post. As a matter of fact Germany is doing it's best to reduce it's NATO responsibilities - it keeps making up excuses for not deploying (or should I say actively withdrawing) the military force it has taken an obligation to deploy in Lithuania (which is by the way located in a position that allows for a fast and easy retreat). The infrastructure that would be used by NATO forces to move East is in dire state and receives no financial priority still.\\\\\\nGermany has interests in establishing economic partnership with a country that has hostile intents towards the NATO eastern flank. It is not clear whether in case of successful triggering of article 5 by NATO Germany would even allow for unobstructed transport of allied military ASAP, and absolutely nothing suggest it would want to actively fight off an incursion from Russia in say Latvia.Meanwhile, what Germany *could* actually take as benefit forom bigger military (that doesn't necessairly mean using in a kinetic conflict obviously) sometime in the future is using it as a tool of pressure towards weaker European powers they could want to enforce their (e.g. economic) interest on. Just a loose observation, not necessairly leading to a conclusion: Xenophobic tendencies ang revanchist sttitudes are rising in Germany, including the rethoric aiming at \\"reclaiming\\" Western Poland. The party that represents those issues (actively spreading the later) is the no. 2 in terms of popular support. Interesting fact is that to this day Germany refuses to sign a bilateral peace treaty with Poland, and it wasn't until 90's that Germany agreed to sign a border treaty with them.There is still a lot of room for Germany to build up their armed forces within their restrictions should it actually want to, and repelling them should be made for a certain cause, not by virtute and attitude (especially in regard to officially allowing tham to have nukes), if for no other reason than because that's how politics work.","title":"cmv: The post WW2 military restrictions on Germany should be lifted."},{"text":"And his supporters literally don't care.","title":"CMV: There is no way Trump's gonna succeed in getting Panama, Greenland, and especially not Canada."},{"text":"I thought he didnt like him?","title":"Steve Bannon condemns Elon Musk as racist and truly evil"},{"text":"S&amp;P500 down over the last month.

If you create a creature, and you know in advance that that creature will behave in a certain way, regardless of whatever or whoever tries to get it to act another way, you are making them act that way.If you know that by creating a person they will end up doing a certain thing regardless of anything that happens in their lives - as God would know because of his knowledge of the future, which cannot be wrong - then you are making them do that thing, and the possibility of them doing something else was only ever an illusion. You're putting them in a position where they can only do the thing they're already going to do. The only way they could not do that thing is if you didn't create them to begin with, but if you know that they're going to do the thing (due to your knowledge of the future) I guess you already know that you are going to create them. Unless god second guesses himself and we just don't know. Hope that makes sense. For example, if a teacher knows a student will fail a test because of poor preparation, the knowledge doesnt cause the failurethe students actions do. Except in the case of god, the teacher created the student, and knew that he would end up preparing poorly and consequently failing, and there's nothing he can do not to fail because it's already been foreseen that he will fail. As you yourself say: Gods knowledge is timeless and independent of human choices.Meaning God's foresight will be actualized, regardless of what you do.\\n Importantly, eternal punishment is only for those who knowingly reject the truth after it has been made clear to them (4:165).I would argue that if you reject the truth, then it has not been made sufficiently clear to you, or God made you unreasonable and illogical as only an unreasonable and illogical person would deny a truth which has been thoroughly explained and proven to them. Without water there is no life. That's a fact (please let's not get into a debate about possible alien worlds). So it would take someone unreasonable and illogical to not believe or not be able to grasp that. And being unreasonable and illogical is not your fault and outside of your control so you shouldn't be punished for that.Not to mention people who aren't even given the opportunity to accept or reject God, like people with severe mental disabilities.The Quran repeatedly states that God forgives all sins for those who sincerely repentWhat if someone is incapable of sincerely repenting though? Like what if someone accepts God and your religion as a truth due to them feeling that sufficient evidence has been produced for it, but they simply cannot help what's in their heart?Psychopaths for one are people who are more or less biologically wired to be selfish. It is my understanding that without the appropriate professional guidance it would be very difficult for them to understand this, much more to do anything about it.For the christians I think there's somewhere in the bible that says something along the lines of \\"from the wicked, even kindness is cruel.\\" So what about your faith?If a psychopath accepts the existence of God and all that it entails, then he would feel compelled to perform the actions necessary to get on his good side and guarantee the rewards of heaven like the lavish living and the wives/virgin, etc. But he would not be doing any of this out of genuine benevolence/kindness, but rather out of self-preservation, not any different from how any other psychopath operates.

In 1903 US had decided to buy the land and complete the channel. However, Colombia had refused. So US had declared independence of Panama from Colombia, and had sent troops to enforce it:* November 2: US military arrives to defend Panama* November 3: Panama republic declares independence from Colombia* November 6: Panama republic sells Panama channel territory to United States.I.e. Panama was, basically, created by United States for the explicit purpose to own Panama channel.Local population had never exhibited great ability to resist US intervention. For example, US was able to easily replace government of Panama in its 1989 invasion.It is very unlikely that annexation by US would be resisted more than previous invasion. Especially, if general population gets to acquire US citizenship (which is likely to improve their financial situation).&amp;nbsp; Greenland: Greenland is an Autonomous region part of Denmark, who is an ally to the US. Buying it would be a huge betrayal for Denmark, and could lead to the US potentionally losing all of Europe as an ally.There are plenty diplomatic ways to wrangle Greenland from Denmark.As Greenland can declare independence (there is a strong support for it), US only needs to browbeat Danish parliament into accepting said independence. There shouldn't be much doubt that White House has enough influence to pull this off.Worst case scenario, Greenland can declare independence unilaterally, as a colony (there are plenty precedents of this). That might cause some outcry, but it doesn't violate international law much, and US can frame Denmark as being oppressive towards Greenland.From then on, independent Greenland can be safely incorporated into US.This can fail only if parliament of Denmark decides to dig its heel in (which would be quite uncharacteristic, as Danish politicians tend to toe the line when it comes to international politics), and - as nobody else is likely to be sufficient deterrent for US - decides to call Russia and China for help to defend Greenland (which would be very unlikely due to Denmark being strongly aligned against either). Leaving aside aforementioned scenario, there isn't much Denmark can do to stop US. US reputation might suffer, but I don't see any European nation actually switching allegiance over this. Even those that already are openly anti-US (Slovakia, and Hungary) aren't likely to quit NATO over this.&amp;nbsp;Canada is a separate matter, as there are too many factors involved. Hence, I don't have a defined scenario on how exactly would incorporation of Canada proceed.Nevertheless, you overstate impossibility of this: Canada: the ONLY thing they share are a border and the sports leagues.Canada is part of US \\"close allies\\" (the rest being UK, Australia, and New Zealand), and is deeply connected to US on all levels, from economic to military.While Canada is a big nation, the amount of influence White House has within Canada is immense. Don't forget, Canada is one of the most liberal countries in the world, and buying it would be a huge loss to the Republicans (as Canada likely won't vote for them).You might want to elaborate on Canada being \\"one of the most liberal countries in the world\\". I have a very strong impression of Canada being a thoroughly right-wing nation.Moreover, while Republican party might have some problems in the future, Trump isn't exactly losing anything here as he won't be running for president again. Most of all, buying all of these would cost the US a lot of moneyWho exactly would US be paying money to? Into the budget of Canada that it is going to acquire alongside Canada?As I said, I don't have enough information to come up with a plan on how US might annex Canada.

The examples you've cherry-picked don't really prove systemic bias - they're just random posts that fit your narrative.

The sub's reaction typically depends on who's being unreasonable, regardless of gender.Also, those gender swap experiments are methodologically flawed. Posts get different reactions based on time of day, title wording, and how the story is told. Plus, AITA has 4+ million subscribers - looking at 2-3 examples isn't statistically meaningful.The real pattern I notice is that selfish or controlling behavior gets called out, period. A guy being cheap on his girlfriend's birthday isn't judged for being male - he's judged for being stingy on a special occasion. Same would apply to anyone.Instead of seeing bias everywhere, maybe consider that bad behavior is just bad behavior? The world isn't as ideologically driven as you think.

God reveals what's important for us to know. There is no answer I can give because we do not know.2 and 3: I was taught that God views time much more separated than us. While we live through time in a linear path from past to future, God sees everything at once. Here's an image to make sense of it [https://thebiblephiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/god-in-time-1.jpg?w=324&amp;h=332](https://thebiblephiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/god-in-time-1.jpg?w=324&amp;h=332)4: God does not send us to hell nor is it a punishment he puts on us. Hell is eternal separation from God, and Heaven is eternal communion with him. When we sin, we push ourselves away. When we do good, we get closer to him. Essentially, we send ourselves to hell. It's an unfair punishment, but the ones down there knew that and chose it anyway.5 and 6 I don't currently have answers for as I haven't done much research prior to leaving this comment, but I'm pretty sure it's due to either mistranslations (It *is* a really old book that got thrown through a lot of different languages) or figures of speech. It's also important to take into context that the bible was designed for a very different audience from a different time, so sometimes comparisons are drawn between things that are unacceptable today but were seen as normal then to get those people to understand.7: To be a Christian is to be an imitator of Christ and all of his virtues. Even if you've never heard of Jesus, doing good still brings you closer to him, so you \\"know\\" him in a way. For those that died in the womb or before they were old enough to understand the difference between good and evil, they're not judged for that.

I've been in tech recruiting for years, and nobody serious uses IQ tests anymore - not because of \\"wokeness\\" but because they're terrible predictors of actual job performance.Look at Indonesia's own tech sector - companies like Gojek and Tokopedia became unicorns by hiring based on demonstrated skills and cultural fit, not test scores. They actively recruit talented developers from diverse backgrounds, including many women, and they're crushing it.The market itself is proving your theory wrong. If hiring only high-IQ Asian/white males was truly optimal for business performance, then companies doing that would consistently outperform diverse companies. But they don't - McKinsey's data shows diverse companies actually outperform homogeneous ones by 36% on profitability.Take IQ tests for example. IQ is a very strong PREDICTOR for job performance, especially in programmingThis is just factually incorrect. Modern software development is about teamwork, communication, and creative problem-solving. I've seen brilliant \\"high IQ\\" developers fail completely because they couldn't collaborate or understand user needs.The free market you claim to support is actually moving AWAY from your position naturally. Companies aren't hiring diversely because of government pressure - they're doing it because it makes business sense in a global economy where understanding different perspectives drives innovation.Instead of fighting against market forces with outdated theories about IQ, maybe consider that businesses are adapting to what actually works in practice rather than theory.","title":"CMV: Why anti racism becomes de facto racism against whites and asians"},{"text":" Can an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they cant lift it?This is a flawed argument, because it at once tries to speak about omnipotence but instead substitutes it for nigh-omnipotence- specifically a form of nigh-omnipotence which is still subject to and below logic.

You're talking bullshit about a topic you apparently know exactly nothing about.Your \\"source\\" is also just FUD-mongering slop. \\nHere's the actual history/situation:The SPD, together with the Greens, passed a bill around 2000 to massively expand renewables and exit nuclear power by 2025 (a quarter of a century in the future), due to high operating costs, unclear storage situation of nuclear waste and - by then - need for significant and expensive maintenance on the reactors.      \\nThey'd have gladly also decided on an exit for coal, but due to the extensive coal mining industry in Germany, that would have been politically impossible. We still consistently reduced our coal use since then.\\nWhen the CDU got to power in 2008, they slashed that bill almost completely, mostly to get rid of the renewables subsidies. Only to then do a 180 immediately after Fukushima and reinstate the nuclear exit - but not the renewables subsidies.     \\nThe subsidies would have needed a rework, by then, but mismanaging and slashing them was more popular with the fossil fuel lobby.      \\nThanks to them, a booming industry with over 100k jobs was killed off and China was able to corner the solar panel market. Both, CDU and SPD also signed extensive treaties with Russia to get most of our natural gas from them. One, it was cheap. Two it was political tactic to bind Russia more closely to the West, which obviously failed.\\nWhen the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, we therefore had to scramble to pivot to new suppliers. Which worked out just fine, there never was an imminent risk of blackouts in Germany.       \\nNuclear wouldn't have helped, either. Most of the gas is used for heating, which nuclear can't replace. We got the uranium from Russia, too, and the operational nuclear power plants were less than 10% of our total electricity demand. Getting already shut down plants back into operation was evaluated and found infeasible and/or prohibitively expensive. Now the same CDU is bemoaning the decision they themselves made after Fukushima and blaming the Greens. At the same time, they're also fighting tooth and nail against any regulation that would make us less dependent on natural gas (and fossil fuels in general).","title":"cmv: The post WW2 military restrictions on Germany should be lifted."},{"text":"Its massive over-reach.

The two standouts being bewitched and jeannie in the mid-60s. You also had the munsters and the adams family.I was a big fan of these shows growing up and they were on the surface innocent entertainment. But it's the deliberate themes that are the red flags. Of course it only got worse as the decades went on. Then there are the movies introducing mature themes along with graphic violence in movies going back to the 50s with aliens and weird experiment themes etc etc! I was stunned to see a bettie davis horror movie (\\"hush..charlotte\\") showing a man's hand chopped off in the mid-60s trailer. I had no idea it was getting that graphic in the early 60s. It really took off in the 70s of course with the slasher flicks.All this deliberate programming was put in place to desensitize the masses all over the world (syndication etc) to satanic themes and violence over the past several decades.Now here we are with it being out in the open with all the nonsense over the past decade. Overt demonic/occult themes, public praising of satan by celebs, debauched sexualized themes in all forms of entertainment especially music videos.We are in the end-times no doubt about it.

Unlike progressive opposition to war, which is generally framed in moral terms, Trump's opposition to a muscular foreign policy is rooted in a sense of unfairness at America carrying too much of the military burden for the rest of the Western, capitalist world, and for its costliness. Withdrawing military bases around the world and the security guarantees that they bring would amount to a retreat of US power to pre-WWII levels.Note that paleoconservatism is also in favour of protectionism, which is consistent with Trump's trade war rhetoric. This would again roll back the US's position to something closer to a pre-WWII era, which is why I would call Trumpism reactionary, and not merely conservative.

Im talking produce field jobs, last-mile delivery(Amazon-flex), restaurants, shit even uber/lyft. I work for start up that build ghost kitchens, at any time we have about 40 kitchens per site. Early days we had shift leads, runners. etc. to handle processing. Things like grabbing orders, setting them in lockers, customer support - all that jazz. Fast forward to now, we have waiter bots and customer support is now an AI pay out machine. We save cash on overhead and essentially dont care to dive deeper into issues. With the exception of shift leads, all of those other jobs were done by immigrants(inadvertently)- dont get me wrong I tried my best to hire local residents but most didnt last or would get the boot for stuff like truancy and policy issues. Eventually, we started relying on Instawork which we found out later is a loop hole for most undocumented or in the process immigrants to get hourly work. Now to circle back, most of these jobs are done by robots now. Goal is only have one shift leads per shift as quarter back for all the bots. A looong time ago, we hired an Indian CFO(H1B) - dude laid off most AR/AP team - outsourced to some dinky Indian company(in India) and eventually more than 60% of our engineers were here through h1b as well, what pissed me off is that they werent even skilled - saw a lot of Americans get laid off and clearly all the strings led back to CFO. Dont even get me started on the culture these guys brought the corporate offices - left such a bad taste on boards and CEOs mouth. Dudes gone now. Dinky company that we outsourced to is even shittier. Guess what? Brought things back to the states eventually. Tip of the ice berg but wanted to create an idea of my environment and experiences to conclude that I believe AI is the biggest issue. We havent gone through the learning curb and possible implications it will bring to the job markets but we have seen what immigration has done places like google, meta, etc. AI doesnt just replace jobs; it also restructures the economy, concentrating wealth and power in fewer hands.

For once, there's a big risk of brain drain, as it's generally the wealthiest aspects of your population which can receive higher education, resulting in brain drain as they are generally more sought after in foreign countries, and can largely afford moving elsewhere, and are more likely to be critical of the current leadership. What most dictatorships do is allow for critics to leave the country if possible, which allows for no internal critics, however, that ruins the possibility of any advanced industry or service economy.There's also the issue that China doesn't attract external Western investors like it previously did, or said otherwise, \\"having full governmental control and modifying or destroying any existing economic records to fit your agenda is not exactly good economic practice, and heavily destabilizes an economy\\". Economic transparency is a common issue in most one-party states, and generates distrust in the economy. I would highly recommend Nobel prize winner Daron Acemoglu's book *Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy*, as it goes far more into detail than I possibly could.You also have to take into account that most Chinese oligarchs do not want this transition to occur, as Manufacturing is not only far more stable for internal politics, but also facilitates corruption far more than any service economy could.","title":"CMV: China's economy will collapse in 2025."},{"text":"I dont remember much i was 10 at the time but I do recall being able to go to the gate to pick up your loved ones.

Conservatism isn't just about \\"not change\\". Yes, Trump is radical. He's an extremist, a populist, and radically illiberal. But, he's not proposing any progressive changes. Even rhetorically, he's fighting to bring us back to a mythologized past. Both his first administration and his coming administration were heavily influenced by the Republican elite, especially lobbying groups like the Heritage Foundation, who have built a database of people for Trump to hire to bring about their ideals. These ideals are pretty much what conservatives have been trying to do for decades: dismantle regulatory agencies to allow corporations to make more money harming average people, cut the safety net (social security, ACA, etc), expand the military, and enforce concepts of a Christian state. Then Trump brings his own flare, xenophobia, corruption, hate towards immigrants, a white nationalist bent. None of this is the least bit progressive. But, sure, people who pay no attention to policies whatsoever and just want radical changes and to burn everything down with no care for what comes next find Trump's rhetoric appealing. But, that flips constantly, depending on who's in power. It's hard to say Trump is against the elites when he's a former president, a billionaire, teaming up with other billionaire elites to implement trickle down economics. And yes, conservatism has come back around to being more mainstream, as it's basically always been through history. We're back to conservatives enforcing their views on people and targeting anyone they view as outside their norm. But that's also not what progressive means. Change is a shit metric. Everyone talks about change. Trump isn't a progressive, he's regressive, he's largely trying to dismantle the liberal achievements of the past several decades. He's illiberal, undemocratic, and wants the country to be less progressive, less democratic, and more weighted towards people like him and his friends.","title":"CMV: Progressivism Has Become The New Conservatism and Conservatism Has Become The New Progressivism"},{"text":"Trump is explicitly regressive.

If God knows everything, including His own future actions, He cannot act differently, which limits His power. If He can act differently, then His knowledge of the future is incomplete.

If he had lived 5,000 years ago, he may have suffered from a similar delusion, but it's likely unlikely that the material he thought himself composed of would have been glass, for the simple reason that glass hadn't been invented yet; about the only time he would have encountered it would be if he'd found a fulgurite. Thus the presence of glass in his immediate environment was able to become an element of his delusion.Similarly, someone alive today who is certain that extraterrestrials have planted a electronic computer inside their head through which the extraterrestrials communicate monthly stock tips would almost certainly not experience this if they were King Charles VI, as electronic computing had not yet been developed when he ruled France (although early stock markets had).Let's say that someone nowadays experiences a feeling of interconnectedness with other life forms and attributes this to an interaction between themselves and a spiritual realm. Let's say further that we know about someone who lived thousands of years ago who wrote about feeling something similar. The modern individual is in the interesting position of being able to supplement that feeling with the knowledge that they're at a particular place in, as you put it, geological time. Instead of having to speculate about the immediate past on that scale (what happened a thousand or two thousand years or even ten thousand years before), the modern individual's scientific knowledge has enabled him to kick the can far further back in time. A god might have made the Big Bang go bang, but nowadays we're pretty sure that he didn't cause last month's thunderstorm. What might have been attributed to the purely spiritual for the ancient person has become, to a significant degree, empirical for the modern person, and even if the spiritual still impinges from time to time (and usually in times of great physiological stress), the empirical way of knowing is a mode of knowledge that his modern outlook will not let him ignore; the hint of skepticism is always there now.","title":"CMV: If there's anything sacred about the universe, whatever that is intervened in my life"},{"text":"They're still posting on X though.

They introduced a minimum corporate tax and enforced tax fraud. They capped insulin prices for Medicare recipients. Despite having very weak control over Congress, the Biden administration was the most progressive Presidency we've had since LBJ.","title":"CMV: Progressivism Has Become The New Conservatism and Conservatism Has Become The New Progressivism"},{"text":"I wouldn't say he was *never* in any other movies, but nothing of consequence.

People can broadly agree about some goal but completely disagree with how to achieve it. That solution - that how to achieve - is what matters, because it's ultimately what gets voted on by legislators. You can see this in your own examples, where a large percentage may support something like stricter gun control, while a much smaller percentage may support a specific solution like handgun bans.For example:? High level concept: 60% of people support immediately replacing a coal fired power plant with a renewable power plant.? Low level issues: Overall 20% of people support natural gas, 10% support solar, 15% support wind, 15% support nuclear, and 40% support retaining coal.While the majority of people might agree that we shouldn't be using coal, the coal-supporting demographic is still by far the largest.

Yes, it is true that Bidens expanded Child Tax Credit reduced childhood poverty almost by half in 2021, but that was a temporary policy and expired within a year. That claim about Biden cut childhood poverty in half omits the fact that, due largely to Congressional inaction, the rate in 2022 returned to its pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, the major Trump signature domestic policy, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, has been criticized as favoring the rich but doubled the standard deduction and expanded the Child Tax Credit to make many middle-class families tax-free.On foreign policy, the claim that Trump did absolutely nothing to end wars ignores major troop drawdowns during his presidency. Troop levels in Afghanistan, for example, were cut from roughly 15,000 down to 2,500 by the end of his presidency. The killing of Qasem Soleimani made things worse with Iran but did not provoke a new war, and generally Trump refrained from deeper military involvement in several areas as befits this administrations goal to recast U.S. involvement.Bidens withdrawal from Afghanistan was framed as a decisive move to end forever wars, but the chaotic execution resulted in the death of 13 U.S. service members, left billions of dollars in military equipment behind, and plunged Afghanistan into humanitarian crisis under Taliban control. These are realities that seem to undermine a narrative that what Biden did represented anything cleaner or more effective a break from the past than what came before him. Lastly, the plausible view that a Trump policy legacy has been no more than Republican norm continuance with unpredictable variations, his trade war with China, the renegotiation of NAFTA into USMCA, and the emphases on isolationist foreign policy have broken ways with traditional Republican priorities. Legislative successes for Biden too, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, have been incremental rather than transformational.","title":"CMV: Progressivism Has Become The New Conservatism and Conservatism Has Become The New Progressivism"},{"text":"Yes!

Let me explain why lifting them would be a terrible idea:1. The 370k limit isn't actually restrictive. Germany can't even maintain its current 180k force level properly. They've had massive recruitment and retention problems, with only 7 out of 50 Puma tanks being combat-ready last year. Lifting restrictions won't magically fix these issues.2. Russia and China's threat is precisely why we shouldn't change anything. Germany's current setup, focused on EU economic leadership and NATO coordination, works perfectly. Letting them build nukes would just give Putin more excuses for aggression and destabilize the entire European security framework.3. Your \\"beacon of democracy\\" argument actually supports keeping the restrictions. These limits are part of what MADE Germany stable and trusted. It's like saying \\"this person recovered from alcoholism, so now they can drink again!\\" The restrictions aren't punishment - they're a successful formula. In simple terms - Germany are not the bad guys anymore, they're one of the main good guysExactly! And one reason they're \\"good guys\\" is because they accepted these limits.

Relaxing the restrictions gains Germany nothing, but keeping them helps their image as a recalcitrant and peace-loving nation forever sorry for its past actions, which is diplomatically much more valuable.

Export your way out of it. Have government subsidize your money-making companies such as BYD. Have them under cut the competition and gain market share (and hope your cars dont get recalled due to quality issues). Once you have a larger market share you can start to raise prices again to make a real profit without subsidies. 2. Transform economy into a high tech economy like the United States and offshore all your labour to up and coming countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, India, South America, and Africa. Then replace all your labour related positions with robotics and AI. This will lessen the effects of population crisis a bit depending on how fast they can achieve this. 3. Promote child birth by giving massive incentives. Although I dont know if this can work, we will have to see how it plays out in South Korea and Japan.

I decided that perhaps I should quit drugs, so I did and I began going to AA meetings with other young people who had decided they'd had enough. I never really believed I was genuinely physically addicted to anything. But I learned the AA principles and there was enough strife in my life that I committed myself to it. One of these principles was to appeal to a \\"higher power\\" to help solve my problem. So I did. I prayed to God. Every night. And sometimes at other times, too. Even though I wasn't at all sure there was a God.But God answered. I began to see his answers in everything around me. Streetlights that would change or not change just at the right moment to answer a question in my mind. I had what psychiatry calls \\"ideas of reference,\\" thinking that things around me which ostensibly had nothing to do with me, were in fact about me and contained messages for me. I do not think of this time as a period of mental illness. Far from it. I was as high functioning as I had ever been. Developing friendships, greeting every morning with enthusiasm and optimism. Feeling a oneness and a belongingness that I had never felt before. And then it faded. I don't know if it was a month, a summer, or a year, but eventually the experienced fade away.  It's fair to say that I went to college in an effort to understand what had happened to me. And so I studied psychology, religion and philosophy. My studies led me to becoming an avowed atheist, much to the disappointment of some of my mentors. I am now 56 years old and my spiritual experience is long behind me. It was only a week or two ago that I put together the fact that I'd been doing a lot of LSD prior to my appeals to God. It is well known now that such substances can help produce such experiences. I'm not saying these experiences are without value because they are enabled by psychotropic drugs. I'm just saying that for many people, myself included, it was a key element.

If rebels were still actively fighting, then they obviously wouldn't have been arrested and taken to trial yet, but it was understood that they could be granted a pardon regardless.The need to use pardons like that is one of the reasons they didn't require anything like Senate approval for pardons.

Here are some statements I can make though. For God to be God, Love, all will grow closer to the peace, the Light, the love of God. Those who believe otherwise are \\"Adamists\\" claiming some version of a fall away from what we truly are is greater in power than Jesus, our Creator, the Spirit. God's reality is knowable by faith, not any number of intellectual propositions. That's a lot like love: humans experience it. We can say a lot about what it looks like, how to recognize it. The only way to know it is to be a giver or recipient. Not a repeatable, verifiable phenomenon. For as long as humanity has been around we have in all cultures experience individually and collectively the numinous. Those experiences also sought to explain and influence the seasons, birth and death, food, health, etc. Science, using the minds God has given us, has replaced religious explanations for why rain and eclipses and the plague occur. I'd say antibiotics help prove God is real. Science will never explain or capture the intuition, the assurance, we are more than all the the atomistic pieces of knowledge. You cant find the meaning of life in a test tube. The Bible does not speak with one voice. It can't given the 2,000+ yrs it spans with marathons than we will ever know or name. Treating every sentence in it as bearing a same, flattened level of truth claims is silly. The Word of God is not the Bible. The Word is Jesus. The Bible is part of Jesus' revelation of God. The faith is at heart not an insurance plan.

Whether that is connected or not, who knows? There was a lot of what I believe to be preprogramming targeted at the son. The preprogramming seems to have been an attempt to bring out paranoia later on (I.e. basic technique used by control groups and abusers to discredit their victims). He was the victim of a triangulation scheme and abuse while living in PA which cost him a high paying job. Trusted (at the time) individuals abused his trust and worked to cause him to discredit himself and possibly to control and direct his life. Oddly enough, all of the abusers were from NY where he was from, or had heavy NY ties. Many claimed to have NYSP or low level NY government ties.He claims in 2015 that he was dosed by a person he purchased marijuana from. It did not taste like weed and the effects were more like DMT.  This may have been was the preprogramming was aimed at exploiting.In 2017 the first phantom wellness check took place with both Madison County Sheriff and NYSP responding. This was attributed to computer error. He claims the Madison County Sheriff was more concerned with telling him You cant be scared of all these government cars driving by on the road. Etc.. This, coming from a supposed authority, was most likely meant not to help or ease any fear but to cause them and to skew his view of events, but the authority figure was not even supposed to be there. Its a blatantly abusive tactic but again, it was attributed to a computer error via the Madison County Healthcare system. Pretty frivolous and weak, really. All-in-all it seems as if a high control group thought they had an easy mark in the son and his mother, but it just didnt work out that way. They may have been in it for land or money, but I guess since the son is committed to the fight, it doesnt really matter because theyll never get anything. It doesnt look to me like theyve even managed to discourage or discredit him yet. Having been a member of his social media while he lived and worked in PA, I can assure you, he was very well liked and well respected, the people attempting discredit had already developed a bad reputation, so it was largely attributed to their presence in his life.","title":"Real, Live Authoritarian Conspiracy"},{"text":"Tumblr 2.0.","title":"Bluesky is a Liberal Cesspool"},{"text":"Perfect!

No president  or  governor has been able to magically forecast natural disasters, magically determine the number of homelessness resulting from it, and have housing on standby.

I feel like a lot of your arguments boil down to you trying to write rules for a being that doesn't follow rules. God is on a different plain of existence, one that our human minds will probably never truly wrap our minds around. It's like trying to think in the 5th 6th 7th ect.. dimension. We just can't do it. And it's understandable trying to break something apart logically, it's pretty much what we are conditioned to do when combating arguments. A lot of what religion is is having faith. Knowing that while you might not understand it, you know that it's all real and that God made it all happen just because he can. So yes, while there are no definitive answers to your questions, there is also no definitive proof backing up your refutes of God as well. Such is religion.

Omnipotence ParadoxThe question, Can God create a rock so heavy He cannot lift it? stems from a misunderstanding of omnipotence. In Islam, Gods omnipotence is not bound by logical absurdities. Gods power encompasses all things that are possible within their nature. Asking whether God can perform logical contradictions (e.g., creating a square circle) misapplies the concept of divine power, as contradictions are not things but rather failures of logic.2. Omnipotence vs. OmniscienceGods omniscience does not negate His omnipotence. In Islam, Gods knowledge is perfect and eternal; He knows what choices we will make, but that doesnt mean He forces us to make them. For example, if a teacher knows a student will fail a test because of poor preparation, the knowledge doesnt cause the failurethe students actions do. Gods knowledge is timeless and independent of human choices.3. Suffering and Free WillIslam addresses suffering through the lens of divine wisdom. The Quran teaches that life is a test (67:2), with hardships as opportunities for spiritual growth and purification. Free will is a gift that allows humans to make choices, even when those choices lead to evil. Gods justice ensures that no one suffers unjustly. Those who endure suffering patiently are promised immense rewards (2:155-157). Importantly, eternal punishment is only for those who knowingly reject the truth after it has been made clear to them (4:165).4. Eternity and Proportional JusticeIslam balances mercy and justice. While eternal punishment exists, Gods mercy is emphasized more strongly. The Quran repeatedly states that God forgives all sins for those who sincerely repent (39:53). Moreover, no soul is wronged; God judges based on intentions, opportunities, and knowledge (6:160). The fleeting nature of life is what makes our choices significantit demonstrates our priorities and sincerity.5. Scriptural ContradictionsThe Quran positions itself as free from contradictions (4:82). Muslims believe that earlier scriptures, including the Bible, were originally divine but were altered over time. The Quran affirms many of their truths while correcting errors or contradictions that crept in. For instance, the Quran rejects anthropomorphic depictions of God and resolves theological issues by emphasizing His oneness (tawhid) and transcendence.6. Morality in ScriptureIslamic law is rooted in context-sensitive principles. For example, verses about war or gender roles often addressed specific historical conditions. The Quran explicitly forbids injustice, oppression, and compulsion (4:29, 2:256). Islamic teachings evolve through jurisprudence (fiqh) to apply eternal principles to changing circumstances, distinguishing Islam from rigid literalism.7. Exclusivity of SalvationThe Quran recognizes diversity in human experiences and explicitly acknowledges the possibility of salvation for those who have not received the message of Islam (22:17, 17:15). God judges individuals based on their circumstances, intentions, and opportunities to know the truth. This differs significantly from exclusivist interpretations in some Christian denominations.ConclusionYour concerns about God reflect deep thought, but Islam offers a coherent framework that addresses many of the issues youve raised. It emphasizes divine justice, wisdom, and mercy while encouraging humanity to seek knowledge and truth. Far from contradictions, the Islamic understanding of God is both logically consistent and morally compelling.I invite you to explore the Quran directly with these questions in mindit often speaks to seekers of truth like yourself (2:2).

There are plenty of issues to be concerned about, but I think we need to be worried about the rich on both sides, because they only care about getting richer, and that usually happens at our expense. Capitalism isnt functioning properly, stifling innovation and ballooning wealth inequality. Im worried that our concern about immigration depressing wages is misplaced, not because it doesnt matter, but because I think it will be like a wave compared to the tsunami that AI will bring. Rich people will naturally employ AI and robotic systems that are getting cheaper and more reliable than human labor in a lot of aspects.

Just joking. That was for military aid to Israel."},{"text":"First- I respect your perspective, but I think your reasoning makes some assumptions that deserve further examination. Heres how I would address your points:\\t1.\\tThe Omnipotence Paradox\\nThe rock so heavy paradox is based on a misunderstanding of omnipotence. Omnipotence doesnt mean the ability to do the logically impossible; it means the ability to do all things that are logically possible. Creating a rock that an omnipotent being cannot lift is akin to asking for a square circleits a meaningless concept, not a limitation of power.\\t2.\\tOmniscience vs. Free Will\\nYou argue that omniscience negates free will because if God knows the future, our actions are predetermined. However, foreknowledge isnt causation. Knowing what someone will choose doesnt mean they werent free to choose otherwise. A parent might know their child will eat a cookie left on the counter, but the child still makes the decision.\\t3.\\tThe Problem of Suffering\\nThe existence of suffering is often viewed as incompatible with a benevolent God, but this assumes we can fully comprehend the purpose of suffering. Many theological frameworks suggest suffering has a redemptive purpose or that free will necessitates the possibility of evil. A world where no suffering exists might also be one where free will is nonexistentsomething that would arguably make existence less meaningful.\\t4.\\tEternal Consequences for Finite Actions\\nYou mention that eternal consequences seem disproportionate to our finite lives. This objection rests on the premise that life and eternity are measured by the same scale. If life is seen as an opportunity to respond to infinite love, then rejecting that love might have infinite implications.\\t5.\\tBiblical Contradictions\\nApparent contradictions in the Bible often arise from interpreting ancient texts without accounting for their historical and literary contexts. For example, Genesis two creation accounts reflect different theological emphases rather than irreconcilable accounts. Similarly, apparent contradictions in salvationfaith vs. worksare reconcilable when you consider faith and works as inseparable parts of a transformative relationship with God.\\t6.\\tMorality in the Bible\\nYou rightly point out some troubling passages, like Deuteronomy 22:28-29, but these must be understood within their historical context. Ancient laws often sought to regulate and mitigate injustice in imperfect societies. They were not endorsements of immorality but steps toward a higher moral standard.\\t7.\\tExclusivity of Salvation\\nThe claim that Jesus is the only way to heaven doesnt necessarily imply that those whove never heard of Him are damned. Many Christians believe in implicit faith, where individuals are judged based on their response to truth as they understand it.Ultimately, the existence of God cannot be conclusively proven or disproven using logic alone. Faith is not about resolving every mystery but engaging with them. Your objections are thoughtful, but they may stem from expecting God to operate within human limitations rather than beyond them.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Econ 101 is about as credible as Astrology 101.

However, I seriously doubt there are not ill effects in a significant relationship watching your man masturbate to other women is dysfunctional. Sexual gratification that comes through interacting with a screen is dysfunctional and because of the dopamine, dangerously addictive. Robbing the couple of hormones like oxytocin which causes them to bond. Women feel pressured to partake, and even men do. So I do not agree. I think its 100% toxic, morally reprehensible, pornography supoorts sex trafficking, pedophilia, incest, and rape.

Just stick to his duties as President of the Senate and distance himself from Trump. Because the alternatives are worse: resigning means he's lost the approval of Trump and many likely GOP voters, but given their short memories maybe he can stage a comeback for 2032 (he's young). Resigning means giving up.Plus, impeachment and conviction is impossible since no Democrat will vote for that because it's likely Trump would pick someone way worse than Vance as VP, some rubber-stamper. I dislike the guy but at least I think that (like Pence) Vance would be more of a tempering voice than anyone else Trump would appoint if there was a theoretical falling out.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"I perceived that everybody everywhere is paying more for everything.","title":"Surprise!

Increase supply and prices go down. We have lots of government policy to artificially restrict supply. When supply is restricted so much, it is profitable to increase prices significantly. If we embraced the market and deregulated housing, we'd remove lots of those artificial restrictions on supply. In that case, it wouldn't be profitable to increase prices because new developers and investors could enter the market and then offer lower prices in order to undercut their competitionThis wouldn't make everything perfect, there could still be room for government intervention, but this deregulation would be the biggest thing we could realistically do to improve things. As for government intervention to pair with it, it would make way more sense to just make Section 8 an entitlement and fully find it. Subsidizing consumption of private goods is generally more effective than having the government just directly do something itself. Support for public housing as the primary solution is generally driven by ideological motivations and dislike of capitalism and markets rather than anything else, and often also looks back to history for inspiration, looking at places like Vienna with their historical public housing situation, but without actually understanding the context of that housing situation and how it is similar or different from our own","title":"Surprise!

Well, shes right about this at least:Democrats should extract several lessons from this pattern. First, the media cannot be relied on to tell the success story. Republicans have a reliable propaganda machine in right-wing media; Democrats enjoy no such luxury. (One need only look at the economic coverage during Bidens term to see this is true.) Second, it follows that Democrats must do a much better job touting their own successes and communicating with low- and no-information voters. Biden joked he should have put his name on the stimulus checks; he was right.\\nAnd finally, before Democrats change their philosophy or dump capable leaders, they might simply run a 24/7 hard-hitting critique of the Trump economic agenda. That will set the stage for the midterms.","title":"Surprise! The media just discovered Bidenomics works."},{"text":"I don't even know why yall would even go there.

They basically boil down to saying that God is not all powerful because He is not more powerful than Himself. The second one also assumes that God is bounded by time, so you're essentially assuming that God is not all powerful in order to prove that He is not all powerful, which is completely circular logic.The second section of moral criticisms basically just boil down to a subjective argument saying \\"God can't exist because I don't like Him.\\" I think they just demonstrate that you have a flawed understanding of justice and benevolence.The third section of supposed contradictions are flawed arguments for a variety of reasons. To take a couple off the top of my head, the first one in Genesis pretty much requires you to be as intentionally dense as possible when reading the text. The \\"two accounts\\" dont actually contradict at all; they just focus on different aspects. (Gen 1 on Earth as a whole, Gen 2 on humanity.) By this logic, you could \\"disprove\\" pretty much anything by finding multiple sources on it that each have a different emphasis/perspective. The reconciliation of James 2 with the other \\"faith alone\\" texts is a little bit more complex, I'll give you, but Christians have been thinking about this for centuries and have come up with multiple understandings that harmonize the texts. The most obvious one imo, is that James 2 doesn't really teach salvation by works. James 2 teaches that all saving faith comes with works as a side effect, and that any \\"faith\\" without works isn't real faith. So even though there is no salvation by works, you can look at works to get a better idea of whether or not the person will be saved.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Enlist Stephen Miller in your little race war, then.

The fundamental metrics you refer to (such as CPI) are invented and defined by the very people in charge of controlling them. Its the most blatant conflict of interest imaginable, and they regularly change the goods used for CPI comparisons to make their performance look more favorable. You can lie to people and tell them that theyre doing better than ever before all you want, but when people are struggling more now than any other time in the past 5-20 years they wont believe it.Edit: To the person who deleted their reply claiming that CPI manipulation is a conspiracy, its not. Its a fact that CPI has been changed and manipulated quite frequently. Theres literally nothing conspiratorial about it, even the CPI website itself shows a history of dozens of changes. They change the contents of the fixed basket of goods. They change the weighting of the goods in the basket. They also modify pricing based on quality of goods and use temporary substitutions when certain goods are deemed too expensive for the basket. Again you can lie all you like about how things are for the average citizen, but the lies fall apart when people living with them can see for themselves that they dont hold water.","title":"Surprise!

In May 2022, the California Governors Office announced that the state, through the California National Guard, facilitated the shipment of protective gear and medical supplies to Ukraine, with more planned in the following weeks.Additionally, in August 2022, retired Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman aided efforts to send donated gear to firefighters in Ukraine. This initiative involved collecting surplus equipment from various fire departments to support Ukrainian firefighters.More recently, in January 2025, the Los Angeles County Fire Department sent a plane full of surplus supplies, including boots, hoses, nozzles, body armor, and medication, to Ukraine, where first responders work under the threat of strikes from invading Russia.These donations are part of broader humanitarian aid efforts to support Ukraine during the ongoing conflict. However, its important to note that some social media discussions have inaccurately suggested that these donations have left Californias firefighting departments under-resourced, especially during recent wildfires. Firefighters have clarified that the challenges in combating wildfires are primarily due to factors like lack of personnel, strong winds, extreme dry weather, and outdated water supply systems, rather than equipment shortages resulting from donations.","title":"POV: While CA burns to the ground after the LA County Fire Department donated \\"surplus fire equipment\\" to Ukraine, Biden announces $500 million more for Ukraine!"},{"text":"What if there was a fire that burned down an entire city, wouldn't that be awful if it caused people to criticize the woman in charge who failed at her job?

Yethere we have Meta and X. Platforms run with suppressive algorithms (TikTok is very open, which is a big part of its success). Also these are platforms that have been actively manipulating content to sway public opinion and discourse (especially during the election and public health crises like covid).One of which is now run by Musk who has boosted his own posts with fake engagement to control the narrative of his popularity. I personally still had X on my phone during the election and was getting notifications on Trump/Musk when I dont even follow them or interact with related content.Its just interestingthe arguments getting made at the hearings right now because logically Meta and X should then be on the chopping block for actively using content manipulation to sway the election.","title":"Fake news is driving us apart amid disaster  but slanted news is slowly drowning our democracy"},{"text":"And the President impacts homelessness, how?But corporate greed making home ownership or the ability afford rent near impossible absolutely does.","title":"Surprise!

If your water demand is 50 billion gallons per day, and a desalination plant like the one California built in Carlsbad produces 50 million per day, you need a thousand plants to completely replace the demand, or 500 to replace half.The Carlsbad plant takes about 35 megawatts to run day and night. An average nuclear power plant produces a gigawatt output, you lose about 10% of that in transmission, and you get about 25 Carlsbad sized desalination plants per nuclear power plant. That means to supply those 500 desalination plants you need 20 nuclear power plants. Now you need the infrastructure and power plants to pipe the water produced uphill, infrastructure to dispose of the high salinity waste water, power to move all of this water, and so on.At a billion per desalination plant to build, and 20 billion per nuclear power plant, you're looking at a cool trillion dollars before buying any land or burying a single foot of pipe to deliver the water or dispose of the waste. Oil pipelines (which are much much much smaller) cost about 5-10 million per mile to run. In relatively flat areas. You have dozens of watersheds in California, running a pipeline to the head of each river is going to be thousands of miles of pipeline. In hilly terrain. Even the most conservative estimate imaginable is going to be in the hundreds of billions to trillions or more in cost.Or you could just fix water rights laws and agricultural policies to encourage more efficient farming practices.","title":"CMV:  California should immediately enact mass desalination programs and solve almost all its short-term and long-term water problems."},{"text":"While a separatism might seem like the way to go after watching anything on the news, your different thinking neighbors are a lot more like you than you are being told.","title":"Do you guys got liberal freinds"},{"text":"Another Queertard follower.

The US only cares about maintaining its position as the world global super power. It does so through alliances, friendly relationships, exporting USD / Culture, and policing the seas to facilitate global trade. All money spent overseas goes towards one of those things. Aid to Israel gives the US a strong middle eastern ally and base from which to operate. Aid to Ukraine is to degrade a Russian invasion of Eastern Europe in *their own* attempt at expansion to the detriment of the US. When you say our own people need help, what do you mean? You want money diverted to expanding welfare / section 8 / WICs? You want single payer Healthcare? (If that's what you want, I'd say ask Republicans why they strongly oppose those measures).If you mean Aid as in disaster assistance, I'd suggest you to maybe expand your media sources because the federal government **absolutelty is** providing aid to fighting the fires.

Feminism demanded everything that men have, as if what men have is the pinnacle of everything a person could have.  As such, nobody wanted what women wanted, and why should they?  Feminism branded things that were female and being feminine as inferior.Feminism by necessity pits women against men, and then wonders why men don't like it.  It tells men that they are solely responsible for the problems of society (the incessant piercing whinge about the bogeyman known as the patriarchy) but then assumes being female is somehow superior and would fix everything, so men are effectively defective women.  Feminism would rather concern itself with getting women into comfy offices rather than getting them out from under burqas.And finally, feminism assumes that it has a lock on \\"equality\\", as if those concepts are inextricably tied together, and you can't possibly not be a feminist, whether or not you consent to it.Feminism is so unbelievably fucking contradictory and backwards that I fail to understand how anyone who thinks they possess even a lick of sense would actually buy into it.","title":"Feminist mad, even most Democratic men think feminism is harming civil society."},{"text":"Yes, although my main one is converting.","title":"Do you guys got liberal freinds"},{"text":"It's definitely odd that the path of wildfires seems to follow the plans for the high speed rail and that there's an LA 2028 smart city plan.

Sears: How the federal Liberals have opened their leadership race to foreign interference"},{"text":"Sorry for the formatting, I don't know how to do a lot of the fancy stuff. Can an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they cant lift it? ... Is a correct grammatically and logically sound sentence but doesn't really mean anything. Would an all powerful being even have a body in which to lift something? On what surface would the being need to stand in order to lift it? That would imply something even bigger than than rock and the being. \\nPhysics says every action has an equal and opposite reaction so the being pushing the rock is the same thing as the rock pushing the being. Can God do a handstand on a big rock? A rock too big becomes a black hole. \\nThe paradox lies in the construction of the sentence not of the idea itself. \\"Next, omnipotence and omniscience are incompatible.... This makes the coexistence of these traits logically impossible.\\"\\n \\nWhat? I don't understand this point. If God is all powerful all knowing and all good why would he need to act differently? Why does knowing what you're going to do make you any less powerful? If your take is more along the lines of he can't do evil things so therefore he can't do everything... In the Bible The concept of good and evil revolves around God. God isn't good he just IS. The things WE do in relation to him is what is good and evil.\\"Christianity often justifies suffering and evil with the idea of free will, but this raises more questions than it answers..... That doesnt align with the concept of benevolence.\\"\\nYou're right it does raise a lot of questions, many that I can't even answer. If there is a specific one you want to discuss further then write a reply.I'm not entirely convinced the concept of hell in the afterlife even exists. There is judgement day yes, but in more cases than not what the Bible is talking about with hell is: \\nactual places in earth that are given that name/nickname. \\nA way to describe the emotional state that follows a act of selfishness or other sin.\\nThe only other places hell is likely mentioned is the apocalyptic literature, which is so heavily misinterpreted it definitely shouldn't be considered as an actual place.\\"The Bible itself adds to my doubts. Its full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. 'Modern day' Christianity holds the blame for this one. The two creation accounts are not supposed to be actual accounts of creation. They are stories being told in such a way to show an underlying message. Look up \\"chiasm\\" in Wikipedia to get a better idea. The Bible was not written/spoken with the intention of being a historically accurate history book. It tells stories with morals. The same way a folk story would today. Every culture in that day has an adam and eve story, a flood story, a creation story etc. The epic of Gilgamesh already existed and one story is about gods flooding the evil earth. The stories weren't new, 'God' chose to do something different with 'his' telling if them. \\n\\"Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30. \\"Is a matter of expression. To 'see' someone is to know them intimately (even sexually). We say we're 'seeing' somebody when we are dating them. \\nBut the passage can also mean actual sight. God has no form. He IS spoken word. That also comes from Exodus. \\n\\"Salvation is another inconsistencyRomans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and works.\\"Faith saves yes but you cannot have faith without believing it yourself. You show what you believe by acting on it. \\nAn example: if you believe a parachute is going to save your fall, you act in accordance by pulling the cord. If you say you believe but do not pull the cord (putting aside fear in the moment) then you do not believe it will save you.\\"Morally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today. Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapist.\\"This is true. However what you don't realize is many of these horrible treatments were BETTER than how women were treated at that time. \\nMarriage for women was everything. They had no rights/were property. Marriage is how you got token care of. No man would want to marry a rape victim in that day. So it was a way for the woman to still be provided for. Still horrible? Yes absolutely! But it was better than being left to die. Id also guess this law was not to control the woman but in fact to force the rapist to own up to his own consequences.\\"1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church.\\"Women speaking in church is a good one.  Corinthian women had a habit of verbally abusing their husbands (citation needed). Paul is telling them to treat their husbands with respect and to show the 'non-believers' there is something different about these people. Paul's word isn't gospel. It is recommendations for how to live out the gospel and corrections for what doesn't fit. There is another letter where Paul specifically compliments a 'tabitha' (iirc) on her work in the faith. Kind of hard to do that if you're forbidden to speak.\\n\\"Finally, Jesus is claimed to be the only way to heaven (John 14:6), but billions of peoplesuch as those in North Koreamay never even hear of Him. How could they be judged on something they never had a chance to know?\\"What i think Jesus is saying here is the only way to reach the father is through him. Who is Jesus? John 1 tells us he is the word of God become flesh. Therefore the only way to get to the father is through his word. Wether it be in person (Jesus), in writing (the Bible), or a voice on the wind. People will be judged by whatever value system they hold. Paul talks extensively about this. Problem is: even to our own morals and values we fall desperately short. I do not know about the people in North Korea. I do know there are Christians in NK and have every inclination to believe they are one of the few actual Christians given where they are.In my honest opinion there are more self proclaimed atheists who do the work of God than the people who say they follow him. And I wouldn't be surprised to find them in 'heaven'. It's not about the words and teachings, it's about the actions. Those atheists have values that they believe in and are trying their best to fulfill them. This is the point. This is faith.\\nTldr: In summary Christianity hasnt done well for the last 2000 years . Criticism is definitely warranted. The Bible wasn't written for us, to us, about us. It was written by Hebrews, about Hebrews, for Hebrews over many years and today the techniques, culture, and context is widely misunderstood. The Bible contains STORIES not historical accounts. Contradictions in it are a FEATURE. The whole point isn't to dictate a correct life, it's to make you wrestle (just like Jacob ) with conflicting ideas. It's the struggle that makes us stronger not the knowledge. Final note: true Christianity isn't a set of beliefs, it is entirely experienced and a RESPONSE to having an encounter with God. That's it. Without that: faith is useless, works don't do anything, hope is pointless, love is fleeting, and the religion is empty.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Imagine being so abhorrent as a person Steve Bannon, Steve Fucking Bannon, Founder of the Alt Right Steve Bannon calls you a racist.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"California historical peak water use is in the 40-50 billion gallons per ray range.The desalination required to provide that amount of water would require a ludicrous amount of investment and energy, and probably kill all sea life on their coastlines with the wastewater.It would be cheaper just to change agricultural practices to be more water efficient.","title":"CMV:  California should immediately enact mass desalination programs and solve almost all its short-term and long-term water problems."},{"text":"Is the economy strong or are Americans struggling now more than ever?

The last few days have been particularly difficult, as a terrorist attack by the Islamic State-Khorasan killed 13 U.S. service members and many more Afghan civilians who were trying to flee.But perhaps we should take a step back and talk about the bigger question: Was U.S. President Joe Biden right to pull out? I think a lot of people have been conflating this with the evacuation and its implementation, but they are two different issues.**MK:**?The short answer, in my view, is no. This was a self-created catastrophe. There is little reason for U.S. forces to be experiencing this tragedy right now. The U.S. and NATO military presence in Afghanistan was sustainable. Those forces were helping the Afghan government control Kabul and much of the rest of the country. This military presence was good for the United States, the Afghan people, and much of the rest of the world.Then Biden pulled all U.S. forces out, which surprised NATO allies and forced them to also withdraw troops. The Afghan government quickly collapsed (something I predicted would happen in?[our April 16 column](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/16/is-leaving-afghanistan-misguided-or-overdue/)). The Taliban will now run the country with devastating consequences for human rights in Afghanistan and U.S. national security interests, including the return of the terrorist threat that we have already tragically experienced this week.","title":"Sullivan says history has judged well Bidens call to withdraw from Afghanistan"},{"text":"They're just move it up to 2040 to excuse more mayhem.

I've looked at the first four links you gave pretty closely, and the problem (to me) is that you don't distinguish between what the left calls bullying and what I think of as bullying.  To me, threatening real violence against peaceful, democratic allies is real bullying.  Bringing up Hilary's bathroom habits or mocking a disabled reporter, you know, it's not right, but it's not what I think of when I think of bullying.  It's not a reason to believe Trump is going to destroy the international peaceful order we spent so many decades to build.  Which in my view is the real problem.Second.  You mention that using a different reason for impeachment than a ground of impeachment implicates our justice system and makes it easier to slide into corruption.  I would have to agree.  So thank you for that!  !deltaI don't think it's enough MORE corruption than what we already have to make it necessary to avoid, however.  Our constitution doesn't actually protect us very much.  We nod in its general direction, as we pass it every day on our way to work in our so called justice system, but we don't actually implement it meaningfully, as far as I can tell.  Right to trial?  No.  Speedy trial?  Nuh-uh.  Applying the laws as written?  Sorry:  no.  And so we're already on the far side of that particular divide, and I don't think a slippery slope is going to move us any significant direction toward or away from corruption.I actually have no evidence the people did NOT vote for a bully.  I would like to believe they didn't, and if we impeach Trump we will give them an opportunity to be heard, on that.And finally:  the Republican establishment has the BIGGEST axe to grind, where Trump is concerned, because he's destroyed everything they spent years of not decades building.  I don't know, but I suspect there are very few, in Congress, who don't harbor some secret animosity toward Trump and who don't secretly yearn for an excuse to implement it.

Im a Muslim, so I believe in the same God as Christians and Jews do, though we have some different opinions about his exact nature. Ill try my best to answer your main objections, primarily with evidence from the Quran, our holy book. First of all, theres what you said about omnipotence. Part of the problem here is the very idea of God lifting rocks. We dont believe in an old dude with a beard, instead we believe that God is unlike anything else and cannot be compared to anything else (Quran 112:4, and there is nothing comparable to him). However, we do believe that he is all powerful (Quran 2:284, and Allah is powerful over all things). So where does the rock fit in? The real issue is the phrasing of the question. The linguist Noam Chomsky is famous for inventing the sentence colourless green ideas sleep furiously. As you can tell, it means nothing. However, it is used in linguistics as an example of a sentence like yours that is grammatically correct, but semantically meaningless. An idea cannot be green, because idea and green are words we have created with unrelated meanings, just as green and colourless have incompatible meanings. So likewise, the rock sentence is one of these. From our perspective, it describes something meaningless, as everything (including words) exists in relation to God, not the other way round. He is infinitely powerful (as above) and could also create an infinitely heavy object (Quran 36:82, His only command, when he wants something, is to say to it be!, and so it is). With regard to the next point, about knowing the future and people going to Hell, and the compatibility of this with Gods mercy, we can again look at the Quran. Of its 114 chapters, all but one begin with the exhortation in the name of God, the all-merciful, the especially merciful. This implies that Gods mercy, and not his wrath, is his defining characteristic. Yes, some people will indeed be in Hell forever, but this is a punishment for the truly wicked (Quran 92:14-15, So I have warned you of a blazing fire, within which nobody will burn, except the most wretched). As Muslims, we are not supposed to say with certainty who exactly will go to Hell, or what exactly will happen to them there. However, we can see that many places today are already a Hell on Earth, such as Syria and indeed North Korea. Innocent people, including children, are suffering immensely in these places, so maybe Hell is the right place for those responsible. This also helps explain his reasons for creation. We often talk about life being a test (Quran 67:2, He who created death and life to test which of you is best in deed), but we get this the wrong way round. Its not so much the children in Syria being tested, as theyll get their eternal reward, but you and me. Our test is what we do to help them and others like them (Quran 36:47, And when it was said to them Spend from that which Allah has provided you with, the disbelievers said to the believers should we feed one whom Allah, had he willed, would have fed? You are nothing but clearly misguided). And Allah doesnt need anything from us, he knows all this already, but he wants it to be fair for us. Have you read Franz Kafkas book The Trial? Its about a man arrested and put on trial for a mystery crime, the details of which are not revealed to him, so he cant effectively defend himself. Its obviously a horrible experience, and its where the word Kafkaesque comes from. Heaven or Hell would feel similar if we didnt go through this life first. Your last few points are very good points, so its good news that they are specific to the Bible. Your very last point, however, is probably the best, and is in my opinion one of the strongest reasons to reject Christianity in favour of Islam. Although we Muslims have a duty to spread our religion, we cant reach everybody. But Allah promises he will not put anyone in Hell before they have been given a fair warning (Quran 67:8-9, Every time a group is thrown in there, its keepers ask them Did a warner not come to you? They will say Yes, a warner came to us, but we denied and said Allah has not sent down anything). So as before, we cannot say exactly what happens to people like North Koreans or uncontacted tribes when they die, but we know they will get a fair deal. Many scholars say that such people will be told about Islam and/or given a moral challenge in the afterlife before being sent off to Heaven or Hell. I apologise if this was a bit long, but this is obviously not a simple subject. I hope you take the time to read it and somehow benefit.

There is the subway, 3 commuter railways that converge on Lower-Midtown Manhattan, and the Port Authority with trains and the best commuter bus network in the country. So not only is there great transit in, there are natural chokepoints. Literally the tunnels in on the Hudson, &amp; the bridges on the East River.So that means implementation meant cameras on these highways and then on about a dozen north-south avenues. Most other cities would have to do a lot to implement. (1) Because the downtowns/CBDs might not be easily delineated as easily as Manhattan and (2) because geography doesn't suit itself to setting up these boundaries.I'm familiar with DC for example. Using the border of the district would be too broad, but even if you zero it in on everything inside FL Ave and the rivers, you'd be missing Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Arlington. And what about Tysons? Even the simplest zones would mean hundreds of blocks with cameras otherwise people will divert to side streets.Boston might be the one other place it could work, due to the river + harbor geometry and how their transit all leads to downtown.I'm all for the congestion charge in NYC. But NYC is also the one city in the US, arguably, where having a car is not only unnecessary but actively worse than using transit. But given that other cities have (1) more spread of job centers and (2) worst transit than NYC, I think transit should be a little more carrot and less stick in other areas to build out more transit and dense housing via zoning reform.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"she wanted to make it look like only democrats showed up. by their own definition, she posted misinformation","title":"Kamala Harris Shares a Trump-less Photo of Presidents at Jimmy Carters Funeral"},{"text":"Anyone else thinking about where Diddy's freak off tapes are?

Think McMansion developments in what most people would view as run-down small cities.He did work with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, ran youth programs in the town of Braddock, PA after joining Americorps, and later moved to Braddock and became its part-time mayor, full-time youth services person focused on getting out of school youth GEDs.Protesting the highway bypassing the town? He was there. Protesting the medical center taking away the town's hospital? He was there. Buying up distressed properties, and converting them for public use? That's him. Defying the law to marry LGBT couples at his house? That's him too.Basically, if you look at Fetterman in Braddock, it makes sense why he had progressive credentials at the time. He was a strong example of a downhome decaying city focused mayor bringing real change to his constituents as much as possible.He ran in the 2016 primary for PA-Gov, which he did surprisingly well for comparatively low recognition, and the guy who beat him lost to the Republican. He next ran for Lt. Gov and won in 2018, and is most famous for his first task being MJ legalization research, and famously loudly supporting it and LGBTQ equality with flags hanging  from his office balcony, which the legislature made a point of having him remove.This is where most peoples knowledge comes in, and they focus on his work on the Board of Pardons at Lt.Gov.The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fetterman ran the Board of Pardons \\"with the heart of an activist and, at times, the force of a bully\\".[63] The Inquirer also reported that he threatened to run against Attorney General Josh Shapiro (who, at the time, was planning a run for governor) unless Shapiro supported more pardons.[63]While chaired by Fetterman, the Board of Pardons recommended 50 commutations for life sentences, and Governor Wolf granted 47 commutations.[64] As lieutenant governor, Fetterman announced \\"a coordinated effort for a one-time, large-scale pardoning project for people with select minor, nonviolent marijuana criminal convictions\\".TLDR: He was more along the lines of a upper middle class kid who saw he was privileged as fuck, and started operating in noticeably positive and productive ways in forgotten cities, something progressives have wanted to see for a long time to rebuild the working-class base.","title":"Enabling Trump is a bad look for Fetterman | Pennsylvania's senior senator was elected as a progressive Democrat.

They are easily refuted by many philosophers throughout history.. now a days a Google searches show the flaws and explain why they are logically flawed questions.It seems you don't really understand Christian teaching.  We live in a fallen world where everyone is subject to death in this life.  Freewill necessarily implies consequence... if I choose to hit you with a bat then you will suffer.  This universe is a shared environment, tapestry, or simulation if you will to see how we will live.  You miss the point that each individual is lost at birth (and we all confirm this by how we then chose to live)... The point is God loved us still and so he made a way to save us.  One that did not rely on our goodness... no one is good, no, not one.... Yes, we can do good things that shine as brief examples, but no one can do good to undo or make up for what we have done... the easiest example is can a murderer do enough good to undo that sin.. ofc not.   Same applies for any other lesser sin (missed mark)... a lie, hurtful words etc. We are not saved by good but by being forgiven.  God who demands justice for our many sins but his love demands mercy... so he decides to take our punishment upon himself.  Jesus was born to be the perfect sacrifice to show us his love for us.

I spent most of my life agnostic, and only in recent years have I come to believe that God surely exists. It took personal experiences and much thought. The biggest lie any church has ever told is that you need them to understand or get close to God. It's simply not true. Spirituality is a personal journey, and God speaks to all of us. Everyone is different, so everyone is going to experience this journey differently, and at different paces.To sum up my beliefs;God is nothing, but also everything.I don't believe it's possible for us as humans to ever fully understand existence and its purpose.

I'm not sure I have time to answer every one.Lets start with omnipotence. The classic paradoxCan an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy they cant lift it?reveals a flaw in the very concept. If the answer is yes, theyre not omnipotent because they cant lift the rock. If the answer is no, theyre not omnipotent because they cant create the rock. The concept collapses under its own weight.God can decide how strong he is. Just like in The Bible, Jesus said that even He does not know the hour. That's because He can decide not to.In the same way He can create the world, He can just decide not to be bound by the same logic we are.Next, omnipotence and omniscience are incompatible. If God knows everything, including His own future actions, He cannot act differently, which limits His power. If He can act differently, then His knowledge of the future is incomplete. This makes the coexistence of these traits logically impossible.God is able to not be bound to time. and maybe He can act differently, just like we can flop around our arms or get up and do the Macarena right now. He just knows what is the best choice at any point therefore probably would prefer that over just testing to see if that paradox works or not.The Bible itself adds to my doubts. Its full of contradictions. Genesis has two conflicting creation accounts. Exodus 33:20 says no one can see God, but Jacob claims to see Him face-to-face in Genesis 32:30. Salvation is another inconsistencyRomans 3:28 says faith alone saves, while James 2:24 insists on faith and works. If this is the infallible word of God, why is it so contradictory?Exodus happened after Genesis. There's no reason both can't be true: The people of Exodus time couldn't, and  Jacob, who claimed to see God's face in Genesis time could.Being faithful implies works, If we are faithful that Jesus did all of this for us and that we have all commited sins, it wouldn't make sense to then not do any works. But we don't need to do a certain number of good works and then come to Jesus, we just need faith.Morally, many biblical teachings are indefensible today. Deuteronomy 22:28-29 commands a woman to marry her rapist. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 forbids women from speaking in church. Christians selectively ignore these teachings, undermining the Bibles authority as a moral guide.You don't necessarily have to find that law to work today to follow Jesus, but that law is justice against the rapist. The rapist, on top of whatever legal punishment they face, has sinned and has to provide for the woman he raped for the rest of his life, while the victim has not sinned.\\\\-Overall, I'd say some of these *might* change if one tries to put aside a lack of context, black and white thinking, or just thinking of God the same way one thinks of humans.Asking questions in good faith is great, but you aren't the first to ask these questions. I'm not the first to provide my own perspective. Many of these questions can be googled and you can hear many other different perspectives or arguments.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"Yes.
