It's nearly impossible to get people to understand that if anyone but Trump was in office during COVID, it would have been handled much better with a lot few deaths.And everything Biden had to overcome when he came into office was a fallout from Trump and/or COVID. Global inflation, for example. Biden kept it down to one of the lower inflation rates in the world. Some countries were over 100%. Biden maxes at 8-9%. If Trump was in office instead of Biden, I imagine our inflation rate would have been considerably higher than what we had with Biden. Biden knows what affects an economy, what helps an economy.  Trump THINKS he knows, but actually doesn't. But since he will refuse to admit he's wrong, he'll go ahead with his bad plans in an attempt to prove everyone wrong.Trump has never had a successful business. They've all tanked. His profits have been made from schemes. He love get rich quick schemes. Okay, enough. Yes, I noticed that his tariffs were starting to come back at him but then COVID hit so it didn't matter at that point.

At least if you are not a white male Christian. Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are all doing everything they can to make this happen so we are no longer a check on their power.

And with civil unrest like that over stakes that high.... that's when societies implode. One thing that kept Jan 6th from turning out as Trump and his inner circle wanted was that the military wasn't with him. Which is why they are openly talking about mass removals of officers.

It means intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest. Say what you will about both bin Laden and Mangione, but their causes were anything but esoteric.Bin Laden had a huge number of supporters in the Middle East and would not have been regarded as throwing his life away. He was lionized by a huge number of people. And the scary thing about Thompsons assassination is how lionized he has been as well.I think youre trying to emphasize that its not unprecedented that rich kids take to violence in pursuit of their goals. Thats the other problem with the comparison to bin Laden, who was raised in a region that was and still is actively in the middle of one invasion or violent revolution after another. Taking up arms was not at all outside the Overton window of accepted ways to react. Mangione obviously did something much more extreme relative to his societys expectations for behavior on how to react to the problems of the healthcare industry.For those reasons I would recommend searching for a more apt comparison for Mangione, or at least select a different word.

Patel was a staffer for the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee at the time, and Schiff has since been elected to the Senate and took office Monday.Prosecutors also sought records including emails from journalists at CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times, according to the report.The report found that DOJ investigators issued a broad sweep based on who may have had access to the sensitive information that was leaked.Seeking records based only on the close proximity in time between access to classified information and subsequent publication of the information risks chilling Congresss ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the inspector general wrote.Thats because such a move exposes congressional officials to having their records reviewed by the Department solely for conducting Congress constitutional authorized oversight duties and creating, at a minimum, the appearance of inappropriate interference by the executive branch in legitimate oversight activity by the legislative branch, the inspector general added.The inspector general did not recommend charges against anyone in their review and did not find any indication that the career prosecutors assigned to the leak investigation were motivated by politics.\\nNo guardrails\\nAmong the issues that the inspector general pointed out is that there are no guardrails for prosecutors who want to subpoena communication records from members of Congress or their staff, and that while some protections for journalists do exist, they were not properly followed.For example, prosecutors did not have to inform Justice Department leadership that the records they sought were those of members of congress C and Bill Barr, who was the attorney general at the time, has said he was not aware of any congressmans records being sought in a leak case. Barr declined to be interviewed as part of the inspector general review of the matter.The report also notes the Justice Department obtained non-disclosure orders in 40 of the congressional cases, meaning that members and their staff were not aware their communications records had been seized. In seeking those orders, prosecutors were not required to say with any specificity whose records they were going after.While journalists do have more protections outlined in Justice Department rules, the report details breaches of that protocol in the departments efforts to secretly obtain communications of eight journalists at news organizations.Within CNN, the Trump administration secretly sought and obtained the 2017 phone and email records of Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr. The Biden Justice Department later informed Starr that prosecutors had obtained her records covering two months between June 1, 2017, and July 30, 2017. It remains unclear what the Trump administration was looking for in Starrs records.The inspector general found that prosecutors failed to follow some of the department guidelines that instructed prosecutors to exhaust all other investigative options before subpoenaing records from journalists. Among those failures is that an internal committee that is supposed to review subpoena requests for reporters records was never convened, the report says.In one leak investigation, prosecutors did not obtain the required certification from the Director of National Intelligence, the inspector general said. In another, they obtained the required certification, but it is not clear whether it was ever provided to Barr.Prosecutors also failed to obtain Barrs approval, which was a required step in the process to get non-disclosure orders that stopped reporters from learning that their records had been seized.After the effort to obtain records was publicly revealed, the Justice Department codified a rule that bars department employees from secretly seeking journalists records except in limited circumstances. Under previous DOJ regulations, investigators could secretly obtain journalists records through a court order without the journalists knowledge.","title":"Trumps DOJ secretly obtained records of his FBI pick Kash Patel, lawmakers, staffers and media in leak investigation"},{"text":"Yeah I think that's pretty much always the question.

Atleast not entirely.? Some of the lack of progress is because democratic/progressive/Blue voters don't show up like we need to for every election.\\nRepublicans have been working and voting regularly in every election for 50 god damned years to build up to the crap they have done and want to do. And so many blue voters seem to expect it to be fixed in 2 years or less with barebones majorities. Right now republicans control a majority of state and local governments. And have 6/3 advantage in the highest court in the land.\\nFor Biden's first two years democrats had a 1 vote advantage in the senate that could be blown up by easily by any one of the 2 \\"moderates\\" in the senate, and anything they did could be reversed by the court. Most of the shit Biden has done to fight the pandemic has been reversed by the court.? Then in 2022 we lost the House and all progress came to a halt.\\nThe easiest way to ensure we didnt end up in this position would have been to show up for midterms in 2014 to make sure that Republicans didnt win the Senate in 2014. Then showing up in 2016 to make sure Hillary Clinton won the presidency in 2016 and democrats kept the senate (allowing her to atleast replace Scalia and RBG if dems had the senate. I've read that Kennedy wouldnt have retired unless a republican was president and Republicans had the senate so he would be replaced with another conservative).\\nBut its easier to sit back and say well the Democrats should have done something instead of blaming the complacent voters who got us here. We need to stop falsely claiming Democrats have had power but failed to act. It isn't true. At absolute best Democrats have held portions of divided power at different points in the last 3 or 4 decades.\\nMeanwhile Republicans have had total power. When Trump was President his party unfortunately controlled Congress, the majority of state legislatures, state courts, and had the Judical Branch.\\nRepublicans had everything. Such control has not been there for Democrats once in my lifetime and I am sick and tired of people claiming otherwise.\\nYes, great things could get done when theres a strong majority. The left had 59 seats in the Senate in 2009, and we got:\\n- American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the largest social spending program in history up to that point.\\n- The Omnibus Public Land Management Act, which protected millions of acres of land, established the National Landscape Conservation System, expanded the National Parks and National Trails systems, reauthorized geological mapping for a decade, and a lot more.\\n- Expanded the AmeriCorps program\\n-The ACA which even though it isn't the universal healthcare(or Medicare for all) wet dream of progressives did change a lot of rules for health insurance. You can't be denied coverage of pre existing conditions, allowed kids to stay on their parents insurance a lot longer and other things. It polls well if you call it the Affordable Healthcare Act but if you call it \\"Obamacare\\" it doesn't.?\\n- Dodd-Frank\\n- DADT repeal\\n- The Food Safety Modernization Act, which among other new FDA powers grants the agency the ability to mandate recalls.\\nThat was all done in a two-year span. Could more have been done with a 2/3s majority? Yeah. But until Democrats can win like FDR did in 1932, this is about as rapid as change will come. If people are going to undermine that because it isnt fast enough, then we get more Trumps and more conservative ideologues on the bench that dismantle forward progress.\\nAt least President Biden and senate democrats on the judiciary committee are picking and approving judges at record speed. If that is all this Congress does, for me that will be enough. The balancing of the courts is one of my biggest issues.\\nDo I wish more was possible? Of course I do and that's why I vote in every single election that comes up. Something far too many liberal voters in this country do not/have not and far too many right wing voters do.\\nRepublicans are relying on the circular firing squad between progressives and left leaning moderates. You want to brow beat democrats? Do it in the primary. I'm not saying not to protest or hold their feet to the fire. What I'm saying is the \\"democrats don't do enough\\" and \\"both? sides are the same\\" voices are BS.","title":"Trump Will Lower American Workers Standard of Living"},{"text":"Shit Is orange Hitler still pissed that Melania gave Justin Trudeau a hand job?","title":"Trump mocks Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the 'governor' of the 'Great State of Canada"},{"text":"Unrelated, but thank God for this sub as a refuge.

Biden and Trump were both historically unpopular nominees, so much so that a man changed his legal name to \\"Literally Anybody Else\\" and ran a joke campaign.?Biden AND Harris came into office at the peak of the pandemic with insanely high unemployment, staggering debt, and a broken global supply chain. Not to mention significant social unrest. In the years that followed, they had to drag a terrible economy back to \\"normal\\". That included dealing with inflation and increased cost of living. While real wages have been rising for quite some time, it also dropped significantly when they took office (due to no fault of their own).People vote largely based on their view of the current and future economy. Most people are not reading financial reports, studying macro trends, or analyzing policy. They look at what they make, what they can afford, and that's their judgement. Their experience trumps statistics.No presidential administration has a \\"lay up\\" when the economy is in ruins. None.Furthermore, rural voters are never going to vote for Democrats again. Local media, commonly cited as an antidote to polarization, has shriveled up, to be replaced by right-wing talk radio. Now, if Democrats could lose those areas by 30 points instead of 50 points, that would go a long way in the swing states. However, they don't just need swing states to remain viable as a national party (more on that later). Additionally, the 2024 election saw urban centers, people of color, and many other demographics that traditionally vote for Democrats swing violently rightward. As a 24-year-old man myself, I'm shocked but not surprised that Trump outright won men under 30. And I don't think they're coming back, because the Democrats won't embrace alternative media - there will never be a left-wing Joe Rogan. If the Democrats can't make up ground in rural areas, but also lose core parts of their base, they are doomed.Then they need to change their policies. A few small steps they could take to \\"win\\" these voters:\\\\- Message border security and the safety of Americans as a top priority\\\\- Give up assault weapon bans, mandatory buy backs, or federal gun control legislation\\\\- Communicate that they acknowledge hardships people are going through and actually seem relatable. Trump is not relatable. But he gets people to think he is.  \\nFurthermore, if Trump does go through with:\\\\- Increasing tariffs on major trading partners\\\\- Mass deportations\\\\- Deploying the military on US soil\\\\- Sending national guard into cities and blue states he doesn't like  \\nThere will be **significant** economic and social consequences. Costs of living will skyrocket. Unemployment will rise. There will be domestic violence at a significantly higher rate than we see now. Then, in 2028, Republicans will be running with that baggage. Republicans have largely been lucky in presidential elections. They've never come into office when there's serious problems or economic downturn. They've come into office after a Dem president lead the economic recovery and the GOP rides on those coattails.

Democrats get in and hold government for fourteen years straight.Do nothing Republicans: In 1947, people finally decided to give Republicans another chance. They became known as the Do Nothing Congress. But they *did* do something big--the busted unions. People immediately smartened up and voted them back out.McCarthy Republicans: Under the tenor of a Republican war hero in the White House, Republicans won Congress again and the commie scare reached absurd levels. Meanwhile, under Dwight Eisenhower, the economy busted three times. People quickly voted out the Republicans.Republican White House hegemony: In 1968, Richard Nixon squeaked into power on a huge antiwar lie and sabotage of Vietnam peace talks. Nixon widened the war but was re-elected in a landslide anyway. Finally, after the worst crash since the Republican Great Depression and a scandal so big Nixon had to resign, people voted for a Democrat in the White House.Reagan Republicans: Unfortunately for America, Republicans became very popular. Not only did Ronald Reagan win 1980 and landslide 1984, Republicans won the Senate for the first time in more than a generation. Destruction of 20th Century progress had begun. People ran with Republicans in the White House through a long series of awful like the 1981 recession which replaced the 1974 Nixon oil shock as the worst downturn since the Republican Great Depression.

Republicans held the Congress for twelve long years, often on very low turnout--six years under Bill Clinton and six more years under the guy who stole the 2000 election.

The difference is in how they achieve it and how that growth is distributed. The left's expectations are pretty varied. The progressives indeed have a lot of lofty (but not necessarily unattainable goals). They mostly aspire to implement programs and social structures that are already present in many European countries. I don't think it's accurate to say they want to go back to the 50's... certainly they do not advocate for the 50's social structure. It's more like a rejection of Reaganomics and an appeal to the moderates who fear high corporate tax rates. But the left also consists of moderates and others. Some people just want some stability and civil rights protections and are reasonably afraid that the right is becoming too extreme. This seems to be who Harris was appealing to but unfortunately she just lost to people who want some kind of change rather than the status quo...even if they don't fully understand what that change could mean. At the end of the day though, I think people who are saying the left is doomed or hopeless are a little shortsighted. The democrats did extremely well in the past several elections and despite a lot of optimism for 2024 were actually fighting up hill in a lot of respects. They were forced to deal with consumer prices and a new, last minute campaign. They definitely need to regroup and improve a lot of things, but chances are Trump's approval rating will suck again so bad in 2/4 years that they will have the upper hand again. Voters have short memories.","title":"CMV: The reason things seem so politically hopeless in America for the left is because their expectations are too high"},{"text":"I don't see how any of this dispels my argument that basically he makes simple and ridiculous arguments with no actual plans on how to implement them and no one in his base seems to actually demand explanation.

It might sound amazing but if anyone took 2 seconds to think about it, it is probably unrealistic unless the candidate can actually explain how they are going to achieve the goal.  Trump rarely, if ever, can.  Yet his base just blindly believes he can and will and when he fails, they either pretend he didn't fail (i.e. many of them claiming he built a wall across the entire southern border) or that it wasn't his fault (i.e. many of the others claiming the Dems stopped him from building it and that was the only reason he didn't).  Yes, he has these broad plans.  Deport immigrants.  Then when pressed on those he flip flops constantly on what that actually means and who might be effected.  Yet, it doesn't matter that it seems clear that he has barely any plan on this.Yes, he wants to 'blow up trade deals,' and randomly throws out numbers on what that would look like and lies about what tariffs are and who they affect.  Yet, they blindly follow.Yes, he wants to cut taxes, like most presidents say they do.  How many of his followers actually know how he is going to do that other than 'no taxes on overtime,' which might also be a pretty big misnomer given his ties to Project 2025 and that plan to reclassify what constitutes overtime.","title":"On Issue After Issue, Trump Promises the Moon.

Also Heller wasn't really all that inconsistent with prior case-law. Scalia's opinion was a bit a-historical at least IMO, but in general it is not a particularly egregious reading of 2A. It's also important to note that Heller specifically arrived at the SC after the DC law was declared unconstitutional at the Court of appeals in a 2-1 ruling. The dissent at the COA is also interesting to read btw as it argues that 2A doesn't apply very specifically to DC because it's not a state and therefore inherently cannot have a militia of the states...Unlike Heller, defining \\"jurisdiction\\" as not applicable to children of foreign nationals has broad and far-reaching consequences in how the law itself would be interpreted. First Jus Solis extends backwards to common-law and has historically been the reading throughout US history. Could you legally charge a foreign national with a crime if they're not within the \\"jurisdiction\\" of the United States? What about the impact and consequences on civil law, contract law etc. if non of these are within the jurisdiction of the US regulation becomes incredibly complicated for foreign companies? What does this mean for anti-subordination ideas or anti-inheritance of guilt ideas. The idea that illegal aliens are not within the jurisdiction of the US itself hasn't really been controversial anyway. Even in Plyer v Doe, while the contention existed that equal opportunity to public resources should/shouldn't be given under the 14th, all justices concurred that illegal aliens were subject to the Jurisdiction of the US. Roe is also pretty controversial and requires a broad interpretation of the intersection of privacy, medicine, personage etc. The equal protection clause on the other hand states directly: \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" Its not particularly ambiguous. Roe requires multiple-steps to arrive at a legal argument in the positive and is again narrowly scoped to abortion, here the argument would have to be very direct that the EPC's \\"jurisdiction\\" statement doesn't apply to undocumented aliens and that interpretation would be broadly applicable.","title":"'Completely Un-American': Progressives Slam Trump Plan to End Birthright Citizenship | Common Dreams"},{"text":"People are still living in this fantasy land that rules will stop anything bad happening and all norms will continue.

If everyone was housed, there wouldn't be homelessness or homeless camp. If we had stronger health care and mental health services many of these people wouldn't be homeless anyway. If we had more educational opportunities, better minimum wages and a stronger social support system there would be systems in place needed for people to actually be able to have upward economic and social mobility. Your solution of just throwing everyone in jail isn't a good answer. No other country in the world has this solution. You want less homelessness and less crime? How do you address the underlying causes of homelessness and crime? If people have economic opportunities beyond crime, it turns out, there's less crime. If people have basic needs needs met, educational and work opportunities, there's less homelessness. I agree that it would be difficult to get more people on board because a lot of people think like you that having stronger police presence and more people on jail (even though America has the highest jailed population in the world) is the answer. The data just doesn't suggest that those solutions are the answer. Progressive or not, certain things are just better, Universal Healthcare is just better for everyone except for profit insurance companies. A more educated society is just better for everyone except for politicians who bank on the general publics stupidity, having a livable wage is better for everyone except billionaire CEOs who want to squeeze every last in of profit out of people (but arguably it would even be better for them if people had more disposable income). There are better policies and worse policies.

What those words describe is the kidnapping, imprisonment, and trafficking of human beings under cover of an executive order that is not a law, but the administrative whim of one man, Donald Trump. When Donald Trump sits down at the Resolute Desk on Inauguration Day and signs a piece of paper put in front of him by Stephen Miller or some other White House functionary, he will not be signing into law a bill that has been passed by the Congress. He will be photo-opping a campaign promise that will be challenged by lawsuit within hours, but in the meantime, lives of immigrants will be upended, and people will die, as they did the last time Trump rounded up undocumented immigrants and stuck them in cages on the Texas border with Mexico. \\n \\n Remember that? The mainstream media hasnt reminded you what happened back then, so I will. NBC News reported on May 29, 2019: At least seven children are known to have died in immigration custody since last year, after almost a decade in which no child reportedly died while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. One case was that of a teenage migrant who died of the flu. The flu. Thats how careful Trumps border agents were when they detained migrants in hastily constructed camps along the border the last time. NBC reported that in late 2018, a seven-year-old child succumbed to a rapidly progressive infection that shut down her vital organs. This was after CPB agents sent her on a 90-mile bus ride from one CPB location to another, even though she was showing symptoms of vomiting and dehydration.  In the eight months following the death of the seven-year-old child, several more migrant children died while being held in facilities that had concrete floors and thin mats to sleep on.","title":"Remembering Donald Trumps last political abduction racket: Lets stop repeating Republican talking points and call deportation what it is: Kidnapping and theft"},{"text":"That's a conspiracy - \\"McDonalds has been in the news 5 times\\" isn't","title":"Why so many stories involving Mcdonalds?"},{"text":"America's worst export: MAGAism","title":"Trudeau says Americans are realizing that Trump's tariffs on Canada make life a lot more expensive"},{"text":"I love how Elon is like \\"but I paid 11 Billion in taxes last year!\\" And it's like my guy, you made 94 billion in 2023 alone.

At what point is a plan to do things in the future that would currently be illegal, but you signal that when they will be done it will be legal at the time, actually illegal?If a future department head says \\"We are going to reassign the funds citizens specifically pay into for their retirement age needs\\" how is that not explicitly theft? The system works, afaik, because we pay into it. We don't necessarily get what we paid in back but it goes somewhere and does something, presumably for other people who aren't as well off and maybe couldn't pay in as much.Now, what if that same department head says they are going to reassign the materials used to build bridges on the interstate highway system? Meaning they would demolish a huge % of highway bridges and then idk... Sell the raw material or whatever to personally enrich themselves via shell companies etc. That in and of itself might all be above board but people would die because of that(emergency services would be cut off entirely for some communities).Ok what if they say they are going to implement a social credit score based off your skin color and who your parents were, and if you don't meet a minimum score then you'll be jailed? Seems currently unconstitutional but in the future it might not look so different from that.Out loud pondering about forcibly crashing the economy is, in this day and age, a physical threat of violence. Voiced against millions of people, the vast majority are law abiding citizens. Medicine will be at risk, food will be at risk, crime will increase...

It is dangerous and irresponsible to transfer power to an admin who states they will do these things.But to answer my own question it seems like as long as the President Elect himself doesn't say in what manner and specifically to whom the violence will be done it doesn't matter.Trump could in fact shoot someone on 5th avenue.

However, I must object to the 'not getting better' part--because there was a solid move toward progress after the 2018 landslide. There has been some slippage since then, but the 2020 election was disappointing, and despite media claims of a big win in 2022, fact is Democrats lost. Had people come out to vote in bigger numbers for Democrats in 2020 and 2022, there would have been no slippage. Democrats need big wins and big majorities to embolden them.Democrats moved away from progress as voters moved away from Democrats. Starting in 19568, Republicans seemed to gain a lock on the White House with five wins, three landslides, and one Democratic squeaker after the first presidential resignation ever. This political reality forced Democrats away from progress and caused the rise of 'third way.' Immediately thereafter and ever since 1994, Republicans have been more popular than Democrats*. With that kind of track record, there is a certain logic and history to suggest going for voters in the middle rather than trying to get non-voters in. We would both probably agree that Democrats went too far in the 1990's and into the 2000's, but in the Barack Obama years, Democrats moved more toward holding the line than rubber-stamping Republican legislation like they did in the Bill Clinton years. In the Joe Biden years following the 2018 landslide, Democrats took a significant turn toward progress. There were two years of the most progressive government in generations and the guy at the head of government--a lifelong moderate--was speaking out directly against the Ronald Reagan myth. We should have stayed the course, got out and voted in 2022 in record numbers again and kept on the path to progress.More generally, when in doubt, Democrats should chose the more progressive stance.(*excluding the massive cheating and voter suppression.)","title":"Trump Will Lower American Workers Standard of Living"},{"text":"My coworker said he voted for Trump and was happy because \\"at least I know I will receive social security\\".

Trump during his first term.Dec. 10, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ETIn his own telling, President-elect Donald J. Trump wields magical powers to shape world events in ways others never could. The other day, during his first broadcast television network interview since his re-election, he even claimed to have prevented wars that no one knew were about to break out.I have stopped wars with tariffs by saying, You guys want to fight, its great. But both of you are going to pay tariffs to the United States at 100 percent, Mr. Trump [said on Meet the Press on NBC](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/us/politics/trump-interview-meet-the-press.html).What wars, between which countries, and when? He did not say. Nor did his office identify any when asked afterward. Hyperbole, or perhaps fantasy, has long characterized Mr. Trumps public career, of course. But as he prepares to move back into the White House, his penchant for extravagant ungrounded claims will challenge his ability to translate bravado into reality.Mr. Trump has made some of the most expansive, some would say outlandish, campaign promises that any president has ever made, promises that policymakers across the spectrum take seriously in their intent but not in their specifics. While he may make substantial progress on his priorities, few other than committed Trump allies think he will be able to meet his maximalist goals on immigration, federal spending and foreign policy.Ending:Any other president might worry about laying out goals that cannot be met. But Mr. Trump bulls ahead, confident that his supporters will see that at least he is trying, and that they will find someone else to blame if he does not meet his targets.For most Trump supporters, hes always going to be faultless, said Brendan Buck, a former adviser to two Republican House speakers. Its not that Trump has failed. Its how did those around Trump fail him.

The destabilization serves multiple purposes, most notably advancing the \\"Greater Israel\\" project, which aims to expand Israel's borders and influence across the region.One goal of this destabilization is to create conditions favorable for expanding Israel's territorial control, pushing Syrian and Palestinian populations into smaller, more manageable areas of Syria. This would allow Israel to extend its reach while neutralizing the influence of these populations. The destabilization also distracts from this broader geopolitical agenda by creating regional chaos, which reduces international focus on Israel's actions.Further, the use of Western-backed financial institutions like BlackRock in the rebuilding of post-conflict regions is a key component of this strategy. By investing in infrastructure and resources in war-torn areas, these institutions not only gain economic control but also create dependencies that ensure long-term influence. Additionally, the financial support of various actors in the regionsometimes hidden behind the guise of humanitarian aidworks to reinforce the interests of the West and Israel.The withdrawal of players like Turkey could further exacerbate this instability, leaving behind factions that may not fully understand the strategic game being played but could still wreak havoc as they fight for control, potentially with the backing of Mossad and the CIA. This would further destabilize the region while advancing the ultimate goals of Israel and its allies.In summary, the destabilization of the Middle East is not just about controlling territory but also about managing global power dynamics, using the cover of conflict to further the strategic interests of powerful financial and political elites.","title":"Destabilized Middle East, Again, But Why?"},{"text":"There is a huge hispanic population in chicago and there is steady pipeline of immigrants going there.But even then, saying it will be ground zero is ridiculous and obviously politically motivated.","title":"Chicago to be ground zero for mass deportations, Trump border czar tells Illinois Republicans"},{"text":"I declare sanctions!!!!!!","title":"Liz Cheney Threatens Donald Trump's DOJ With 'Sanctions' If They Investigate Her"},{"text":"but there is no credible threat (at the moment) of him blanket tariff all imports from our 2 land borders.I mean other than him literally saying he would.

Products need to be priced competitively (regardless of tariffs) or consumers wont buy themIn general, if we are talking about a good that people want, the price of the good at a minimum must cover the expenses of the producer that supplied that product (a product that was produced was never produced for \\"free\\"). That's the baseline expense that must be covered by the consumer for the producer to keep supplying that good or service. If the price/unit does not cover the cost of production per unit, the product will not be produced or likely there will be a shortage. There also has to be a profit motive of course and that's where competition helps. A business that has a monopoly on a product would not know how to price it so they will charge whatever profit margin they want to have and obviously this creates problems. This is also one of the reasons why government can never be efficient. They don't have to consider pricing efficiency as they don't have any competition. Any good or service provided by the government therefore is inefficient by definition of monopoly. Competition is always good for the society at large so we are in agreement there.Historically What ends up happening is the companies build manufacturing plants inside the country to avoid the tariffs.Was that pre-NAFTA? There is a reason why foreign companies would want to build plants in the US even if the cost of labor is higher and have to deal with more regulations here. They wanted US dollars. Historically, however, we also used to be biggest exporters in the world after WW2 and our currency was backed by gold. It's no longer the case. We are still one of the biggest exporters in the world but we don't produce consumer goods. Many of the most successful countries in the world have a 100% tariffs on foreign companies (such as China)China maybe a successful country but I don't think the Chinese have the same standard of living as we do. They are relatively poor when you consider their income in their respective currency compared to the median incomes that folks get paid here in USD.","title":"Thoughts on tariffs?"},{"text":"Anybody with a brain knew this","title":"Trump Will Lower American Workers Standard of Living"},{"text":"If you knew the real number.

Bro, that's never going to happen.  It's a Constitutional amendment.  There's no fucking way that Trump is going to get 2/3rds of states to change it.  But, ... that's not his actual goal.  His goal is \\"the big ask\\", it's to claim he wants to end birthright citizenship, so that you're talking about that, and subconsciously accepting his fallback position which is deporting criminals, etc.  You don't know it, but by engaging with this claim that he's going to end birthright citizenship, you're choosing not to argue about deporting criminals, and have already accepted that, because that's way less crazy than ending birthright citizenship.It reminds me of a story I heard when I was young .. a girl goes off to college.  She comes back at Christmas and tells her parents that she met a guy, and he's in a band.  She's going to drop out of college, and go on tour with him, and she's pregnant.  Her parents flip out, her mom is crying, her dad is yelling ... and then she says, oh, it's okay guys, I'm just joking.  But I did get a \\"D\\" in English.  It's all a matter of framing and perspective, ... and Trump is framing this issue for you, like he always does, so that you by default buy into it.  Because when he is deporting criminals, everyone will be so glad that they fought back against ending birthright citizenship and won.It's a negotiation.

Jury nullification CAN be used when a law is unjust, being unfairly applied, the defendant has already suffered greatly, or to send a message about some sort of social justice issue.    \\nBUT jury nullification is actually more commonly used in the US to protect certain classes - the wealthy, the white, the famous, the power, the police.    \\nWe see this sort of nullification occur in high profile cases where the entire courtroom and public witness the evidence and it's considered strong - it's obvious to everyone that the accused is guilty AF - then we experience the tragedy of the jury voting Not Guilty.     Famous examples of this: the cops caught on video beating Rodney King, the OJ Simpson trial, Ted Kennedy's nephew William's rape charge, and R Kelly's first trial based on a sex tape.      \\nBut juries are also regularly doing this sort of thing in cases that are not highly publicized, such as white collar crimes of embezzlement or insider trading. The jury decides that the accused seem like a well respected member of society, somebody of high status who shouldn't be subjected to the same punishments as everybody else, so they vote not guilty based on vibes or a subconscious desire to protect wealthy, powerful white men, rather than making a just decision based on actual evidence.","title":"Jury Nullification"},{"text":"Yeah.

She visited Assad in Damascus in 2017, four years after he was accused of gassing his own people.After Assad fled to Moscow with his family over the weekend, former Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger trolled her on X, writing: Wonder if @TulsiGabbard will offer Assad safe harbor at her house? They are great friends.Former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton also questioned Gabbards judgment, telling Politico that her idea of U.S. foreign policy was like a funhouse of mirrors.He referenced her support for a Russian-backed conspiracy theory that the U.S. was researching biological warfare in Ukraine and said she had an inclination to believe the most outrageous propaganda against the United States by some of its strongest enemies.Bolton claimed that Gabbards worldview goes beyond normal political discourse in this countryand really is evidence of some kind of flaw, maybe even a character flaw, that she doesnt realize what shes saying.In a bizarre twist, Russian state media backed Gabbard for Americas spy chief, a move that only served to fuel her critics.She will need Senate confirmation to take up the role overseeing 18 intelligence agencies and managing a budget of more than $70 billion.The former Democrat, who ran unsuccessfully for the partys presidential nomination in the 2020 election, was meeting on Monday with Sens. Mike Rounds (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who called her extremely bright and capable last month.Transition spokesperson Alexa Henning hit back at Bolton, telling Politico: John Bolton is irrelevant and him saying he would write in Dick Cheney for president this year should tell you everything you need to know about his disastrous and failed foreign policy instincts of never-ending wars and more American deaths.Henning insisted Gabbard is in lockstep with President Trump and his statements on the events in Syria over the weekend.

Remember all those Haitian immigrants who are in this country legally, and the targeted hate campaign against them thanks to unsubstantiated rumors and misinformation running rampant across right wing media?Whether here legally or illegally, there are many Trump supporters out there who cannot or will not discern the difference.And let's not memory hole Republicans shooting down one of the most stringent bipartisan immigration reform bills in recent history at the behest of Trump. Trump himself even admitted that the bill's passing would be too politically advantageous for Democrats.Many Republicans killed the bill at Trump's demand, and without even knowing the bill's contents. Even Republicans like Katie Brit, who actually worked with Democrats for months to negotiate on the bill, turned it down.Trump brags about having the most secure border in history, which is an outright lie, while him and his supporters conveniently leave out the part where the Trump administration benefited from a global slowdown in immigration due to the pandemic, and a subsequent emergency policy that relied solely on the existence and prevalence of COVID, a virus that Trump and his supporters constantly downplayed. All of which created a backlog of border encounters that would carry over into the Biden administration. For Republicans, immigration is a winning, wedge issue, because they don't campaign on fixing it, they campaign on scapegoating immigrants and raising fears that appeal to a chunk of the electorate's grievances, phobias, and paranoid delusions.Throughout multiple administrations, Republicans have been complaining about the \\"border crisis,\\" and they're a hell of a lot more outspoken about it whenever a democrat is in office.The only policies that Republicans do propose, are non-starters. But unfortunately, a lot of Americans don't understand just how disingenuous the GOP strives to be when it comes to this issue. Their policies are often extreme, non-viable, cruel and fear-driven. While at least some Democrats try to run on policies that address legal and illegal immigration in a practical and humane way.","title":"'Completely Un-American': Progressives Slam Trump Plan to End Birthright Citizenship | Common Dreams"},{"text":"anyone find it strange that Assange just flew to a private island in the Pacific and had an in &amp; out court hearing and now everything is all good...  \\n[This was released the same day Assange was.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D81CN9R4)","title":"2017: Assange Reveals Trump and CIA at Loggerheads Over Syria Policy.

Teachers, doctors, lawyers, bank managers, civil servants, most politicians. Those are the people they see as 'elite', people who they think of as talking down to them.They resent that these people have (again in their mind) control over them, they resent that they don't fully understand them. On the other hand they feel they understand the used car salesman, who uses simple concepts and appeals to their emotions. \\"This truck has lots of power to tow the boat you dream of and it's big so it's safe and by the way you'll look cool in it\\", against \\"This PHEV hybrid gets 75 mpg with low NOX emissions and has an NCAP rating of 5 and 5% lower insurance and 10% lower taxes with a $4500 climate rebate\\".Trump is the car salesman, AOC is the professional they see as talking down to them.

But I dont think its super obvious according to the Bible that one must be against capital punishment. At least its not so solid as the way that certain other GOP policies (we should be maximally cruel to immigrants!) are obviously wrong according to the Bible.I agree that Christs atonement ends Gods mandate of capital punishment for sin. Also there is the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11) whom Jesus did not condemn.But its not necessarily ended for crime.  Eg Romans 13 speaks about the authority of governments, including 13:4 which plausibly still approves capital punishment: For the one in authority is Gods servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are Gods servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.It is IMHO reasonable to conclude that this is about some other form of punishment, and that execution for crime is wrong given the rest of the NT. After all, Jesus himself was unjustly executed by the state. But if you want an NT proof text in favor of capital punishment there is one.Also a commandment in Genesis backed by an argument from creation is not necessarily replaced by the NT anyway, at least in some Christians view.  Its not one of those civil law of Israel commandments about mildew or whatever. The laws from Genesis predates the covenant with Israel and is often considered more important, and an argument from creation is considered evidence that a commandment is universal.  The Council of Jerusalem even held that the prohibition against eating blood (also from Genesis) still applies to Christians, though it is ignored by almost all Christians today.I was raised Christian, and I still try to follow in a lot of ways, but I have doubts about some of the important tenets of the faith so Im not sure what to call myself.One of my biggest struggles with the faith has been, if all of Scripture is inspired by God (eg 2 Tim 3:16-17), then the OT still is generally applicable to help understand morality. If God ordered something in the past (eg, genocide against the Amalekites or slaughtering all the residents of Jericho except Rahab and her family or capital punishment for whatever crime) then Im not sure whether its consistent to call such a thing heinous today. Sure, maybe its outmoded and not in line with the new Covenant, but not an atrocity that must be universally condemned.But since I am more certain that eg genocide is wrong than that the entire scripture is divinely inspired, I still think its universally condemnable.","title":"Trump Preps Bloodbath on Federal Death Row As Advocates Beg Biden for Mercy"},{"text":"Progressives don't always lose their primaries, but yes, I agree that there have been several high profile primary losses. Moderates tend to have institutional support of the party, though, so perhaps it shouldn't be too surprising.I am also unsure how much faith to place in a lot of polling. A lot of people don't form informed opinions of policies that they support/oppose, but more importantly, they don't seem to actually vote based on what policies they support. People (undecideds, in particular) seem to be mostly deciding who to support and decide which policies they support based on the candidate they like.","title":"CMV: The reason things seem so politically hopeless in America for the left is because their expectations are too high"},{"text":" hurricanes leveling entire cities,The [Accumulated cyclone energy of North Atlantic hurricanes (ourworldindata.org)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ace-north-atlantic-hurricanes) **data** does suggest an increase to ACE (accumulated cyclone energy).

Or 2 to 4 years of free college or college in exchange for public service (not necessity military). Do you think that minimum wage cannot keep up with inflation?

Finding out that the first Starlink launch in 10 years failed the day before - sending 13 of Musks brand-new Direct-to-Cell satellites into brief, untracked orbits (as they were insta-classed as debris), lasting 4 days for roughly 3 units and 10 for the rest.These cell, not broadband, units would allow untraceable interference with any cell phones at that event, with no auditable pinging of local cell towers. The extremely low orbits they were in would have enhanced signal strength and ability to target the event, jam transmissions, mess with any transmissions of video. It could also issue a Pegasus like exploit to delete videos or photos on any cell or Bluetooth device.Is that why we didnt get dozens, if not hundreds of videos from the 21k attendees?Not to mention this is the first tech Elon doesnt hype, only tweeting about his DTC satellites twice before the election. Media reports coincidentally didnt mention the DTC payload (cost: $53m, a fraction of his total donations and not from his pocket).Elon announced his support for Trump dramatically on X within minutes of shooting - despite having weekly Friday meetings for his Trump PAC since April.Then on Nov 4, day before election, Trump rambles on about how Elon gave him the greatest gift ever while discussing his rockets. Then he says they looked at voting machines together and Elon said he could recognize any of them and hack them all. And, yes, with 265 untraceable-transmission DTC sats in the atmosphere on Nov 5, and the presence of cell modems in most tabulators - yes, he could.Check out transcript for Minutes 38-42:https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-campaign-rally-pittsburgh-november-4-2024/","title":"Task force leaders probing Trump assassination attempts concerned over \\"culture of silence\\" within Secret Service"},{"text":"I think we can piece some of the things together, if we don't care if they are truths or not because it's not yet proven. does that coincide with us also being monitored/guided via a matrix?It is possible but it's more likely a layer installed to guide us.

Companies started globalization in the 1960s which has continued through today to minimize expenses as firms do to maximize their profits.  It's a process that we can see has taken effect for over 60 years now.  Looking back at the GDP we can see it has steadily increased over this period except for a few years when we were going through a recession in the mid 70 early 80s in 2009 and  my goodness in 2020.  More importantly we should be looking at how funds are getting dispersed throughout this period to our CEO friends and why it has increased by 1322% since 1978.  But to answer the question using the GDP as a metric to gauge how the US economy is doing since the inception of globalization this increase indicates it's doing better than before. What has happened during these times when there has been a decline in those years is what would appear to be the beginnings of deflation if it occurred for an extended period of time.  This is what happened once in the US economic history and resulted in significant hardship which none of us were alive to see.  Some see the tea leaves now and are preparing for the storm. If it's a few years of a recession or something far worse.  Either way the hammer being used is not the correct response for something that is not a nail.

What are the Dems supposed to do? Go find their own megalomaniac billionaire? No. No. NO. This is the part where we as the voters need to stand up and say, \\"We won't be bought.\\"Here's my proposal: no campaign can raise more than the population of their state, district or city times $1. It can all come from one source, but you are capped out at that number. That means that the mayor of Cincinnati and his opponent are allowed to campaign on $311,097.00 each. And that's it. So the Democratic and Republican candidates for President cannot raise or spend more than $334.9 million apiece (or whatever the U.S. population is at the next election.) That's still a lot of money, but it will mean that campaigns will have to make some smarter choices and make more use of television and the internet than their gas-guzzling jets. But don't worry: that money will go farther than you think since no one will be allowed to announce their campaign before April 1st of the election year. Primaries -- which will be in random order by lottery -- will be finished by the  end of June. We get two weeks off and then the Republican and Democratic conferences are held in the last two weeks of July. That allows three months for the final campaign. And that's more than enough. Also: ads will be fact-checked, and a clarification disclaimer will be attached to the end of the ad just like we do with ads for heartburn and boner pills. This goes for Super PAC ads, too, and here's another rule for Super PACs: you can campaign for or against any issue you want, but you can't mention, depict, or reference a specific candidate in any way in your campaigning. For or against. Our campaigns are too long, too expensive, and too full of disinformation. We need to rein it in. WE do.
