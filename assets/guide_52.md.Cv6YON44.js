Crucially, along with this she also has the ability to speak to mainstream audiences by getting her messages go organically viral on social media.

The issue you will have with instituting universal healthcare will be that you essentially have to ban the private options.  A public system will only work if everyone has equal access.

These guys don't want to share a hospital room or wait for their elective MRIs for tennis elbow...The only thing that keeps the Canadian system somewhat functional right now is that wealthy folks have to participate.So the fundamental issue with universal care is that while it raises lots of people up...at the same time it brings a few people down.  This is why fighting for excellent care for everyone, regardless of income, age, race, and legal status, is so important.

But for the people who listen to these guys still, it's gotten itself stuck in an echo chamber. Saying they did the best they could with what they had is a bit weak for the average democrat that lives outside of heavy blue areas. At least for myself and my friends who live in a heavy red state and are liberal. Sticking behind Biden until the massive failure of the first debate, not taking accountability for constantly saying he was in tip top shape, not holding a primary, being very stiff in interviews and having the same emotionless answers to some tough questions, not taking the risk and doing some adversarial podcasts.All of this led to what I would say was the big issue with this election. Democrat turnout. I don't think any of this would have swayed a Trump voter or whatever we call an undecided voter these days. But it definitely was not exciting for the average moderate. Sure, progressive democrats were excited, but that obviously only gets you so far. No real talk about what made her policies exciting, no real talk about the inflation that people are super keep on discussing, no real talk on all the border news you hear about. Nothing was really descriptive for the average person who doesn't pay attention to politics enough to get a good sound bite.I think everything she mentioned and ran on was good, but I'm also clinically online and pay attention to this stuff. When talking to some buddies of mine in discord who don't really care about this stuff but are still considered democrats, they didn't have a single thing to say about her. \\"She's better than Trump. She's better than Biden.\\" That was it. Nothing else.  \\nThat was the downfall of this election cycle and heavy liberal outlets and podcasts just won't talk about that or admit it for some reason.

It felt like at the rallies, at the things I was going to, the shops I was going in, that the momentum was going our way, and it obviously wasnt at the end, Mr. Walz told KSTP-TV. So yeah, I was a little surprised. I thought we had a positive message, and I thought the country was ready for that.

People like a lot of liberal and progressive policies when theyre proposed independently of any party. What they dont trust is that Democrats will actually implement those policies in ways that work for them. Theyre not against helping others or pushing for a social program, but they hate the idea pushed by the right that Dems are taking their money to help people who dont deserve it. The right uses bigotry to frame this and point at marginalized communities as those who dont deserve it, so they can gut the government.People voting for tax cuts isnt because they just selfishly want more money. Its because they feel the government is not giving them a good return in exchange for their taxes, so theyd rather take the money back.

These two types of ballots aren't the same, so people who can't vote in person will still get to vote remotely via absentee ballot.The difference between mail-in and absentee is that, for absentee, you have to specifically request that a ballot be sent to you for that particular election and specify why you wish to vote remotely; whereas for mail-in, ballots are automatically sent to your address without your knowledge or consent.Mail-in ballots absolutely should be abolished in favor of absentee ballots. People should not be receiving ballots in the mail they didn't ask for and were not expecting. Otherwise I could just go door to door stealing neighbors' ballots from their mailboxes and front porches in order to use them to cast additional votes for my preferred candidate, which is cheating; and because they were never expecting such ballots to be mailed to them to begin with, they'll likely never realize that this is happening until it's too late.Why only one day of voting?I believe Donald Trump here was referring to \\"same-day\\" voting, not literally restricting voting to just election day and banning early voting. Same-day voting allows one to register to vote, and then vote, both on the same day.BTW, this will not stop election fraudNonsense.Voter ID absolutely will stop some cheating, as without requiring any form of identification to vote, I can go cast votes at my polling site for my preferred candidate multiple times in a single election, claiming each time that I'm a different person.","title":"Trump promises to change elections to paper ballot only, voter ID required, and only one day to vote."},{"text":"He also purchased twitter around the same time that he reportedly started communicating with Putin.","title":"Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump"},{"text":"100% this.

No one who is a supply-side advocate uses the term trickle down because it's not a policy but a political criticism.    \\nEconomics can broadly be put into two fields, micro and macro. Micro has repeated trials and strong scientific consensus across people with different political ideologies. Contrary to popular belief, most economists agree with each other when it comes to microeconomic issues. Certain policy decisions on trade or rent control have over 95% agreement along PhD economist across both party lines. This is higher than the consensus for climate change among climate scientists. Rigorous studies are done to validate  employment and wages that use mathematical techniques that are also used in physics. The controversial part of economics macro economics. This a field where political science is deeply involved. You can't get repeatable trials for most of macroeconomics because a politician is not willing to throw away there office to run an experiment with controlled variables.  There are still ways to run research but you can't control all the variables. If you want to call macroeconomics unscientific that's a valid argument, one I disagree with but a valid argument with the right evidence.I am hesitant to why you list Psychology and Sociology as a science. MyersCBriggs personality test are about as far away from science as you can get. The R\\\\^2 of most psychologists research is rarely higher than 0.2. The most scientific indicator in psychology is the IQ score but I think that say more to do with how poor the science is for psychology than anything to do with IQ.Sociology suffers a similar fate as psychology, and both suffer from poor and rushed research from overworked PhD students trying to publish articles to stay employed or get a degree.

Let me hit you with some real examples:Remember when Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15? Economists didn't just theorize - they ran controlled studies comparing employment data between Seattle and similar cities. That's empirical science, period.The same scientific method you praise in psychology or sociology is used in economics. We have randomized controlled trials testing policies in developing countries, behavioral experiments in labs, and natural experiments from policy changes. The American Economic Review is just as rigorous with peer review as Nature or Science.Progressive economists like Thomas Piketty and Joseph Stiglitz use hard data to prove wealth inequality is rising and trickle-down doesn't work. Their research helped shape policies like the earned income tax credit that literally puts money in working people's pockets.The partisan divide you're talking about? That's politicians cherry-picking research to push their agenda. It's like climate change denial - the science is clear, but special interests muddy the waters.Real economics isn't about Fox News vs MSNBC. It's about gathering evidence to figure out what actually helps regular people prosper.

I mean what purpose does science serve other than to try and understand what cannot be understood by simple deduction?What effects do tax cuts have for this demographic or that demographic? How well does the stock market generally predict the health of the economy? What are the long-term risks of tariffs? We have THEORIES about such things, but we really need to see these in action BEFORE we can make a definitive claim about what effect it has. We need actual experimental results, because it sure seems to me like a lot of people have made guesses about what effect economic policies will have and have been COMPLETELY wrong with those guesses.And yes, we do actually need to see these things through, and no, our assumptions of how things may turn out are NOT always correct. A couple examples from each side of the fence: Republicans thought that tax breaks for the wealthy would be a massive boon for the economy and that they would \\"pay for themselves\\" by unleashing the economy and creating so much economic growth that we'd have more prosperity in the long run. That didn't happen. On the other side, it was long believed by Democrats that when an individual does not have health insurance, they will end up costing the system more, because they get much sicker and then might have more extensive treatments at the hospital which just end up costing the system more. Studies have shown that this belief isn't true, either. (there, now nobody can argue I'm being politically biased, since I have pointed out the flaws of both sides in the argument :P)Personally I think people are WAAAAYYYY overconfident in their economics takes. How often do you hear people say \\"come on man, it's econ 101!\\" to defend their stance on economics, when in reality, the situation is actually incredibly complex and is clearly beyond the scope of Econ 101? People argue it is \\"econ 101\\" because they BELIEVE it is simple, when, in fact, the reality is that it is not. But their overconfidence in the simplicity of economic concepts leads them to believe this. It is very complicated, and we need scientific methods to get actual answers rather than just assuming we know how things work and leaving it at that. That's why it absolutely should be classified as a \\"science\\" and recognized as such.","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"He doesn't know where Syria is on a map.","title":"Trump's post about Syria states that Russia was only there to PROTECT Assad.

There would be no debate about whether \\"trickle down economics\\" works or not.Let's clear something up first... \\"trickle down economics\\" is the name given to Reagan economic policies by Reagan's critics. These policies were used to address the economy when it was in a particular state. In that case, the policies favored the supply side with an aim to combat record inflation (which it did, bringing 13% inflation down to 1%). The problem came in with not shifting strategies once inflation was under control. Serious economists understand that each economic state may require different strategies to address. Sometimes the needed intervention may favor the supply side, sometimes it may favor demand. Anyone who argues that only supply or demand side policies should ever be used is simply a moron.Just to show that these policies aren't really divided by party, the Harris-Waltz housing plan included tax incentives for home builders,  assistance in developing construction methods, and streamlining regulatory processes. These policies benefit the businesses rather than buyers in the hope that those benefits will aid buyers.With that out of the way, let's get to your primary assertion that there wouldn't be any disagreement if economics was a science.

It operates based on the scientific method using empirical evidence. There is a subfield in economics called econometrics which looks at historical trends and is able to determine how likely one variable (like unemployment) is correlated to another variable (like interest rates) using statistics and linear regression.One of the key pillars of economics is the idea that supply and demand form a market price. This is the most widely studied relationship and has been proven out time after time. For instance, when a hurricane wipes out a crop of oranges in Florida, the supply is reduced and price goes up. By contrast when there is lower demand for something the price of the good almost always goes down (assuming fixed supply).Another example that is in the headlines today is tariffs. We have historical evidence that increasing tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices for consumers as the companies pass their costs on to consumers. Theres also the concept of comparative advantage, where a country produces the good that it is best at producing and trades with another country for what the other country is best at producing this is the basis for why trade inherently lowers costs and is beneficial to nations.There are so many amazing concepts in economics beyond what I mentioned that have nothing to do with the national macroeconomy as you stated. I think you may be unfairly limiting the scope of economics to just predicting recessions, which is only a very very small aspect. There is also microeconomics which studies how companies operate and has nothing to do with macroeconomics which studies more national-level strategies.With Macroeconomics it is inherently difficult to predict with 100% accuracy because there are countless factors at work. But to lump all of economics into that one small bucket is not an accurate assessment of everything the field is trying to do. And even with macroeconomics, most economists realize that its not a perfect science, but still try to make the best predictions possible given the billions of different motivations and incentives of all the individual people and firms that make up a market.","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"Thats the problem right there.

It is very easy to understand how they work: they help you create antibodies to destroy the disease by injecting a tiny dose of it, so that if you encounter it again, your body can fight it off. The effects of vaccines are obvious too: illnesses that used to be leading causes of death hardly kill anyone now because of mass vaccine uptake.And yet, despite the fact that biology is a hard science and is not only provable but observable, people not only disregard it but argue against it.

First, that theres much debate. Theres not that much tbh. Most economists at this point, and even at the time saw the problem with it. Milton Friedman was not in the majority on his view. It was just a convenient person for republicans to say look! This economist backs it! In every science theres still disagreement. We saw this during Covid where the consensus was clear, but there were still a few doctors paraded out by Fox News and the like as vaccine skeptics. Doesnt mean its not a science, just means its basically impossible to get consensus. The second point Id make to this example is that supply side economics COULD work with different policies, including much stronger regulation and much higher tax rates for the rich. So ironically the only scenario the right wing economics actually works is by implementing policies that are distinctly not right wing. But that doesnt mean theres a right and wrong here. There are different ways to run an economy. There will always be trade offs. Theres no one measure in terms of this is the best and people can disagree on what to prioritize. At the end of the day, economists still propose a hypothesis, measure results, challenge each other and refine their work based on evidence.

The policies that political parties push for arent scientific. Economists might provide some input, but its congressional staffers who craft these bills. There would be no debate about whether trickle down economics works or not. Surely running a countrys economy would be solved by now?Nope! First of all, trickle down economics isnt even a real concept. It was created by left wing politicians to demonize supply side economics, the idea that our policy shouldnt restrict the supply of new things like housing or entrepreneurship via taxes and regulations. No one knows how to a run an economy. This is the central premise of Hayek's 1945 paper the Use of Knowledge in society. No one actor has all the relevant tacit, local information to make the effective decisions since that is inherently dispersed. Theres a reason why the richest countries in the world tend to have a pretty big private sector with property rights. Individuals from the bottom up making decisions is what is most conducive towards creating an economy thats allocateviely efficient \\nEconomists get paid more than any other social science!

For context, total tax receipts in 2022 were $4.9 trillion. Even if we were to take every dollar paid toward private insurance plans and push them toward single payer, you're only looking at $1.3 trillion (of which, only $60b is profit).

What about this is not science?The main problem with your understanding of economics is that money is a social construct and almost all of the variables within economics are impacted by social actors (i.e., people). Economics itself is a social study. We have created a way to describe value via a proxy concept and peoples behaviour impacts those values.And so, when people who prefer to base things on some constants try to understand economics, they inevitably end up feeling as if they are on a shaky ground. Physics has things that are constant. Economics has very few of those, if any. And thats the basic source of confusion. Someone might say that economics isnt hard science, but who cares whats hard science and what isnt? Economics is an attempt at understanding human behaviour, and since people are not perfectly predictable, we and up with estimates and not absolute facts. Because economics cant lean onto constants.Its not possible to predict human behaviour with 100 % accuracy. Economics gets us as close as possible.","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"Therere counting votes from the last election.","title":"I hope California finish counting votes before Donald Trump swears in as the President"},{"text":"Are people actually following policy that economists say are valuable?Or are they completely hamstrung by partisanship, where whenever the teams change, that undoes any progress on any individual economic plan in favor of *their* economic plan","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"no one is talking about all the rich people changing laws even more to favor their businesses and give them unfair advantage and destroy competition.   they dont love trump, they are only using him to make more money","title":"Its Not Just the Sex: The real scandal of Trumps nominees is what theyll do on the job"},{"text":"How?","title":"Trump promises to change elections to paper ballot only, voter ID required, and only one day to vote."},{"text":"Just because a bunch of people argue in bad faith against science that tells them things they don't want to hear does NOT mean there is a real debate.","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"So did climate science switch from fake science to real science in that time?","title":"CMV: Economics is not a real science"},{"text":"Nahh if you go to r/ conservative, even they aren't mad at the killer, and ben shaprio recently made a video about him and the comments disagreed that we should have sympathy for the ceoNow try asking people who aren't anonymous internet commenter and/or ask people who are over 30.The.

In McKinleys 1896 campaign, different delegates from different constituencies heard speeches tailored to them and Biden couldve leveraged that.The expectation that candidates give traditional media interviews is an archaic one based on entitlement as the mainstream media becomes desperate for ratings. He got rage-baited into making senior statements that were compounded by his stutter (there is a level of ableism there by the media too that needs to be considered). Meanwhile Donald Trump literally slept through his criminal trials and did far less rallies and he won by front-porching it to his existing base with the help of various podcasts and other aspects of the right-wing media ecosystem. Kamala, for her part, had charisma, messaging chops and stamina enough to do most of the barnstorming for Biden as a surrogate and he could appear with her when he could. Gender and race aside, when running by herself she faced the same problem as Clinton- trying to promise change when you worked in the administration of the status quo, which JD Vance will also face in 28. If she had just been a surrogate it couldve been reassuring that even if he was old, she could fill in *like Vice Presidents do.*His strengths on policy would have buffeted her weaknesses there, and her being the more visible face of the campaign wouldve complemented him.","title":"I mean Trump Said you can mass pardon even if a charge wasnt filed so why not?"},{"text":"Buttery males","title":"Trump is so relatable - MAGAs"},{"text":"[Pardon me!](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-photos-internet-reaction-1235194379/)","title":"Biden considers preemptive pardons for officials and allies who fear retribution from Trump"},{"text":"Interference.. against code of ethics.

If I invest in real estate, Im paying money for a house. I may believe that in the the future, the house will go up in value, but theres still an underlying asset - if the market value goes down I still have a house. If I buy stock in a company, Im (possibly) buying control over the companies decisions, rights to dividends, or rights to the companys assets if they liquidate. For some companies, the stock price is way higher than the current value of the company (due to speculative upside risk), but Im still getting something in exchange for money. While theres a chance that the companys value can go to zero, as an investor I can look to the underlying business operation and decide if the stock price is worth it. Even for beanie babies/trading cards, Im getting a thing in exchange for money, and hoping that other people in the future will pay more for it.

Just getting into the Xmas spirit by spewing some hate.","title":"Nancy Mace is now calling trans people slurs"},{"text":"For this, I'm going to use the term Universal Health Insurance (UHI) to make it clear what I'm talking about.Here's the problem.  States have general power to set up health insurance plans, but...1. Self-Insured Employers: Employers are allowed to act as their own health insurance companies.  A lot of times they'll contract out to private companies for billing, but it's really the employer that is the insurance company. The last time I looked at the figures, something like 50% of the workforce is under self-insured plans. That money  that the employers are using to cover their employees is not available to a state UHI plan without a change in Federal law.  And the state would have to take that money from employers and redirect it to the UHC plan--and the way to do that is a new employer tax.  Employers are obviously going to fight this tooth-and-nail against all of this.\\n2. Medicaid: If a state can show that its implementation meets Medicaid minimum requirements, it can get a waiver from Medicaid to implement a UHI plan.  A waiver would mean that Federal Medicaid money could go into the plan. But... if the President is hostile to UHI plans, then no waiver is coming.\\n3. Medicare: There is really no way under Federal law to redirect Medicare funds into a state UHI plan.  Congress has had plenty of time to change this, and they haven't.  So, without Medicare funds, a state would have to leave seniors out of the plan (they would switch to Medicare at retirement). If the state UHI plan provides better coverage than Medicare, that's going to cause a lot of resentment.From a theoretical standpoint, there's nothing stopping a state from implementing UHI.  But, because of the way our current health insurance system evolved, it isn't really practical to do without several changes in Federal law which don't seem to be coming.There's another problem, though.  States usually aren't allowed to run deficits.  During recessions, this would mean that funds a state has to provide coverage is reduced.  Since the Feds don't have to worry about this, it's more practical for them to act as an insurer.","title":"CMV: Blue states should now implement universal healthcare."},{"text":"less than 2% of abortions are for medical reasons (in fact the estimated number is 1.174%)so there was over 1 million babies aborted in 2023 in the USA. less than 20k were for medical reasons.would you be against abortions if they made an exception for medical reasons or rape that would affect the would be mother?Didnt think so.Youre full of it and using a logical fallacy.","title":"'Bodies are piling up': Reporter finds GOP-led states are hiding abortion ban death toll"},{"text":"Going to be a fight to get them to leave.","title":"Welcome to the New Dark Ages: If Trump has his way, the next four years will be far worse than even the Gilded Age"},{"text":"So, the US arming Ukraine was a good thing and now Trump is going to take credit for it?","title":"Trump's post about Syria states that Russia was only there to PROTECT Assad.

There are serious budget issues going on right now. In order to implement universal healthcare in the state, that will increase the spending dramatically which means significant increases in state taxes or piles of deficit spending that isn't sustainable. And it begs the question on if this coverage will cover medical treatment outside the state. I live right on the border of IL/IA. The closest hospital is about 5 minutes away in IA. The closest hospital in IL is about 20 minutes, and it is very small/limited. An equivalent to the closest hospital in IL would be about 35 minutes away. Part of universal healthcare being able to bring down costs is that there is one entity paying and they can negotiate rates accordingly. Are they going to be able to do that with providers in other states? Maybe, maybe not, but they will have much less leverage than they do over providers in their own state. Then we have the pay motive. If providers can't charge as much, they aren't making as much on a procedure, and the demand is higher. If you are a doctor, would you stay and have to do more work (while likely being understaffed) to potentially get the same paycheck or less or would you go somewhere where the working conditions are better and you can make more for less work? Expand that to nurses, CNAs, etc.","title":"CMV: Blue states should now implement universal healthcare."},{"text":"plastic surgery Her gender affirming care you mean?","title":"Nancy Mace is now calling trans people slurs"},{"text":"Not one of the people hoping utopia is the eventual outcome of gunning people down in the streets has read a history book, so no they don't realize that or much of anything.","title":"Apparently, Elon Musk supporting Trump means he wants to bring back the Nazi regime."},{"text":"Again, not sure if their concern is local road, county or state, and not up on the exact the funding stream from fed to state to county and city, but[https://www.roadsbridges.com/iija/news/11004415/major-iowa-road-plans-bolstered-by-federal-infrastructure-law-approved](https://www.roadsbridges.com/iija/news/11004415/major-iowa-road-plans-bolstered-by-federal-infrastructure-law-approved)https://preview.redd.it/7k5m0trpbg5e1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=087b80ed95c692a44418c7298b12f492a1a46f7cAnd bridges improved in Iowa.

The question was, \\"if you could bring america back to any year, where america was at its height, what would it be?\\"The top answer was 1893 during the gilded age. These dumbasses think the gilded age was a golden era. It's  named the gilded age because only a tiny fraction, less than 1% were super wealthy and they were allowed to do whatever they want. The rest of the country including infrastructure was a rusting heap basically. There was no social safety net. Millions got sick annually after being poisoned by the food they bought because the fda didn't exist. There was no FDIC so banks weren't Insured meaning they went bankrupt and people lost their financing houses/mortgages/life savings constantly.Women couldn't vote. Snake oil salemen were on every corner, even selling \\"wonder drugs\\" like radioactive substances.  America had no standing military. Couldn't properly tax businesses or monitor import/exports. It was essentially a pre modern society that had grown to the point it needed modernity for safety reasons, hence the technological and policy improvements that were developed to safe guard people. \\nAmerica was also considered a backwoods, non player on the world stage. It wasn't until the comprehensive modernization and manufacturing plan that the FEDERAL GOVT developed during and after ww1 that ensured america would be on the path to become a super power.You might remember the great depression? Yeah one of its biggest causes was a conservative administration taking over after years of progressive leadership with teddy Roosevelt. It led to financial panic and more than a 1/4 of the nation's wealth was wiped out in hours. It took decades of leadership under Fdr, a  DEMOCRAT to stabilize america, modernize it fully, and actually seize America's potential as the leader of the free world.The new deal (fdr's policies) introduced govt jobs programs. Created about merely every alphabet program that protects investors, consumers, and citizens in the stuff they do in everyday life, and created the social security net. Most historians and experts think of america before the new deal, and after the new deal as different stages. America was a super power and a fully modern society afterwards. All new houses were built with indoor plumbing, with safe water from the widescale infrastructure projects fdr championed. Bridges and hiways connected the country. Factories with union workers pumped out goods that dominated the globalized economy, and those jobs sustained whole families. \\nYou have to be either completely ignorant and stupid or malicious to the core to want to bring america back to 1893, yet that's what this far right admin plans on doing. \\nThe gilded age was called that because it was a thin sliver of gilded veneer of gold on top of a nation of rusted iron. It was not a golden age, yet far righters, even regular American types, believe it was. Once again, they've voted in their own swamp landlords. I think that makes a total of 7 billionaires in trumps cabinet  now. Then again, that's what happens when you specifically  auction off the countries top jobs to the highest bidder. \\nThese people spit on the integrity of america every day.\\nEdit: Oh man, sry about the typos.

Even if Washington cannot find a long-term solution to these crises, India will hope Trump delivers on his campaign promise to help bring both conflicts to an end in the short term. The Israel-Hamas conflict, as well as mounting tensions involving Iran, have absorbed some of Indias limited diplomatic and maritime security resources, and fomented instability in a region that is a significant source of energy, jobs, and remittances for India. Russias invasion of Ukraine, for its part, has generated tension between India and the West. It has increased Moscows dependence on Beijing, which is worrisome for New Delhi given Russias traditional role as a balancer against China and supplier of military equipment to India. Beyond alleviating these pressures, Indian policymakers are hoping that an end to these wars will lead to renewed U.S. focus on the Indo-Pacific. Over time, they would like sanctions on Russia to be lifted, making it easier for them and other countries to engage Moscow and limit its partnership with China. And they want a geopolitical landscape in the Middle East that offers more strategic and economic opportunities for India.On the bilateral front, New Delhi will focus on deepening cooperation, particularly in areas such as defense, technology, space, and energy, though the terms of such collaboration could change under a more transactional Trump. In terms of existing differences, India is likely hoping that the Russia gap will narrow, given Trumps praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin. New Delhi wont expect the president to care much about the state of Indian democracy and human rights, although it is aware that some of his evangelical Christian supporters may care about religious freedom in India. Indian officials will seek to work with their U.S. counterparts to discretely deal with the murder-for hire allegations, though judicial developments in the United States could ensure it does not disappear from the bilateral agenda. On the flip side, New Delhi may try to play up claims that Dhaka is taking an accommodative approach to China and Islamic extremists that will be detrimental to Trump administration objectives.New headwinds in the U.S.-Indian relationship could emerge should Trump proceed with a broad-based tariff war, though Indian businesses might also look for opportunities from U.S. trade disputes with China. If Trump leans into protectionism, it could entail a U.S. emphasis on re-shoring, rather than the friend-shoring that has benefited India. There could also be clashes between Trumps America first vision and Modis Make in India manufacturing initiative, discord between Indian companies and Trumps business backers, and the rerouting of investment away from India and toward the United States. Tougher immigration policies could also affect India if there is a move to restrict or change the terms of high-skilled or student visasor to enact the large-scale deportation of unauthorized Indian migrants, of which there were an estimated 725,000 in the United States in 2022.**AN INDIA LIGHT ON ITS FEET**To ensure that the United States and India converge more than they diverge, India will likely return to its original Trump playbook, with some updates and amendments. In particular, Modi will invest in his personal relationship with Trump to shape the U.S. presidents perceptions and policies. It likely helps that Trump appears to have a broadly positive view of the Modiand of India, where he also has business interests. Should Trump attend the Quad summit that is scheduled to take place in India next year, New Delhi will roll out the red carpet for him as it did in 2020. And, as well as deepening ties with Trump officials or allies, the Indian government will also continue to invest in relationships with other U.S. stakeholders including members of Congress, state and local officials, and companies.Understanding Trumps skepticism of alliances and desire for good deals, New Delhi will highlight that it neither has nor expects a security commitment, and indeed is willing to burden share and contribute to regional security. It will more explicitly underscoreincluding in dollar termsthe ways in which India is strategically and economically useful to the United States. New Delhi will also encourage Indian businesses to highlight their job-creating investments in the United States. And it will adjust to Trumps priorities and preferencesfor instance, by increasing hydrocarbon purchases from the United States given Trumps desire for increased U.S. fossil fuel exports, or by offering greater assistance with efforts to curb the flow of illicit fentanyl.New Delhi will also be willing to amend existing dialogue mechanismsor to create new ones should that make cooperation with India more attractive to the next administration. But it might also have to adapt to U.S. demands for deeper defense cooperation or more operational collaboration to balance China, and less tolerance for its participation in groupings such BRICS. New Delhi will also need to be prepared should Washington want to adjust the Quads agendafor example, by deemphasizing the provision of public goods in favor of increased security cooperation.India will manage potential differences with the United States with care. Trumps demands might be greater and louder, but Indias tolerance for themat least publiclywill be greater too. On economic issues, New Delhi might revive the idea of a trade deal, or offer an expanded one that would encompass trade, technology, and economic security cooperation, while also preparing retaliatory measures in the event that Trump enacts tough tariffs. The Modi government could also take more steps to improve the business environment to make India more attractive to U.S. and other investors. On the question of immigration, New Delhi will likely stress that it only supports legal immigration, and highlight Indian immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy. But it will also have to be prepared to respond to U.S. demands for help stemming the flow of unauthorized migrants from India, and for the swifter removal of those already in the United States.**NEW DELHIS PLAN BAND C, AND D**Even as it aligns and adapts, though, India will take steps to insulate itself as much as possible from the potential volatility of a second Trump term. It will do so by doubling down on diversification by investing in its partnerships in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and across the global south. This list will also include Russia, where New Delhi might believe it has greater leeway to engage with Moscowalthough Trump might press India to reduce purchases of Russian oil or defense equipment and increase those from the United States.Moreover, although its structural rivalry with Beijing will persist and may even intensify, New Delhi will continue to seek to stabilize ties with China, driven by a need to prevent further escalation and to buy time to strengthen its capabilities, as well as a desire to selectively engage economically with China. The two countries took an important de-escalatory step by striking a deal regarding their border crisis in October 2024. But New Delhi will have to tread carefully, and frame this outreach effectively to ensure that the incoming Trump team does not misread its efforts as a Sino-Indian grand bargain at the United States expense. India will also have to prepare for a potential Trump-Xi agreement that might lead the Chinese leader to believe he has greater scope for assertiveness against Asian adversaries. In other words, when it comes to Trump, India must prepare for any eventuality.Broadly speaking, Trumps re-election will also underscore New Delhis quest for self-reliance. His victory, with the greater uncertainty and transactionalism it could bring, will likely reaffirm Indias belief in the importance of building its own indigenous capabilities, not outsourcing its security or nuclear deterrent, and avoiding over-dependence on one partner. As a result, over the next few years, India will seek both greater alignment with the United States and greater autonomy for itself. But even as New Delhi seeks to make its own choices, given its deep strategic and economic links with Washington, India will have no choice but to grapple with those decisions made in the United Statesa country that, with its skepticism of alliances, free trade, and immigrants, resembles India more than ever before.","title":"India Is Hoping for a Trump Bump"},{"text":"(Article)There are not many things that the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden have had in common. One exception is that, under all five presidents, the U.S. partnership with India has deepened. Every one of them has left U.S. ties with India in a better state than they found them. It is because of this quarter-century of upward-trending relations that New Delhi is less concerned about a second Trump term than many other U.S. allies and partners. Indeed, if certain policy shifts materializediminished U.S. interest in Indias internal affairs, for instance, or reduced U.S. competition with RussiaNew Delhi will even welcome Trumps return.India wants its streak of success with American presidents to continue. It will therefore invest in deepening ties with Washington, drawing from its previous experience in dealing with Trump. It will try to adapt to the new opportunities and challenges of a second Trump term. And it will seek to insulate itself as much as possible from volatility, uncertainty, and other potential adverse effects of the new administrations foreign and domestic policy choices. To navigate this new landscape, New Delhi will seek to safeguard its interests even as it deepens its alignment with the United Statesand will simultaneously invest in strengthening ties with other partners, trying to keep its cold war with China from heating up, and boosting its own economic, military, and technological capabilities.**FRIENDS IN NEED?**Over the last four years, India and the United States have significantly deepened their cooperation, driven in no small part by their strategic convergence on China. Despite the many criticisms he levied at Trumps foreign policy, Biden accepted and built on his predecessors competitive view of Chinaand, through that prism, saw New Delhi as a crucial partner in balancing against Beijing. Consequently, the Biden administration kept in place Trump-era mechanisms such as the bilateral dialogue that brought together the U.S. and Indian defense and foreign ministers, and revived the group known as the Quad that includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United States.Heightened Indian concerns about Chinas growing assertiveness and capabilities also led New Delhis to work even more closely with Washington. New Delhi has especially sought stronger ties after Chinese and Indian forces clashed at a disputed section of the Sino-Indian border in 2020. The resulting phase of U.S.-Indian cooperation spawned new initiatives including the Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technology, which aims to facilitate enhanced U.S.-Indian technological collaboration; a bilateral Indian Ocean Dialogue focused on regional security; trilateral discussions on technology among the United States, India, and South Korea; the I2U2 partnership, through which India, the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates collaborate on food security, energy, and technology; and Indias participation in the U.S.-initiated Minerals Security Partnership, a group focused on securing reliable critical minerals supply chains.The U.S.-Indian convergence also incentivized both countries to manage or downplay their differences. Indias persisting ties with Russia in the aftermath Moscows 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for instance, put some strain on its relationship with Washington, which would have liked India to condemn Moscows actions. Meanwhile, New Delhi, for its part, has been uncomfortable with U.S. support for the new regime in Bangladesh that displaced President Sheikh Hasina, whom India saw as more responsive to Indian security sensitivities. New challenges have also emerged, from U.S. accusations about an Indian government employees involvement in a murder-for-hire plot on American soil, to Indian annoyance about what New Delhi sees as an insufficient American response regarding Sikh separatist activities from the United States.Despite these differences, though, New Delhi sees the United States as an indispensable partner in every sector of Indias forward march, to quote Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And particularly given the looming China challenge, Indians across most of the political spectrum seem to feel that New Delhi must work closely with Washington regardless of who is in the White House. It should therefore come as no surprise that Modi was very quick to congratulate President-elect Trump upon his 2024 victoryas was Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Indian opposition.**BUILDING ON QUICKSAND**As S Jaishankar, the Indian external affairs minister, has noted, New Delhi is not nervous about a Trump administration. First, as a non-ally, India is less worried than other countries, such as South Korea, that rely on the protection of the American security umbrella. During Trumps previous term, the lack of a security commitment allowed New Delhi to evade the presidents widespread accusations of freeloading. Second, given that neither is New Delhi an adversary, India is not expected to be a primary target for Trump, even while specific differences on issues such as on trade and immigration could reemerge. Third, New Delhi feels confident in how it adapted to Trumps first term, with U.S.-Indian ties remaining relatively positive despite friction on subjects such as tariffs.Critically, New Delhi is more prepared for the president-elect than it was in 2016. It has accumulated experience in dealing with Trump and his team. Moreover, for many in New Delhi, a Trump victory was not unexpected. Indian officials were careful not to criticize him publicly when he was out of office. And since 2020, India has maintained lines of communication with people in his orbit, engaging with Trump campaign and transition officials as well as others including family members, business leaders, politicians, and policymakers whom New Delhi expects to be influential upon his return to the White House.In the weeks ahead, as New Delhi attempts to read the tea leaves of personnel appointments, it will look for signals on how Trump intends to execute his agenda. It will also follow consequential debates within the next administration on trade, immigration, de-risking and Russia. But it will be watching especially closely to see if Trump will take an assertive stance toward China. Although India has little desire to see a confrontation between the two powers, it will hope that Trump aligns with the hawks in the administration. A White House that looks at the world through a lens of competition with China is helpful to New Delhi in a few ways: it will likely seek to ensure a favorable regional balance of power, collaborate with like-minded allies and partners and urge them to take the China threat seriously, deepen cooperation with India, and be more willing to manage differences with New Delhi.A Trump administration that is softer on China, on the other hand, could reduce Indias importance and make bilateral differences more difficult to resolve or manage. India would also worry about the adverse implications in the Indo-Pacific in such a scenario, such as uncertainty about U.S commitments, greater Chinese assertiveness, and obstacles in the way of building a balancing coalition, particularly if regional powers seek to bandwagon with Beijing. This scenario is not out of the question for some in New Delhi, given Trumps Mar-a-Lago summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2017 and the U.S.-Chinese Phase One trade deal in 2020, as well as his stated admiration for and desire to strike a deal with Xi. With this in mind, India will be keeping a close eye on what Beijing puts on the table once Trump is in officeand on those in Trumps orbit, such as Elon Musk, who might advocate for accommodation.","title":"India Is Hoping for a Trump Bump"},{"text":"Who wouldve thought that allowing unlimited amounts of money to flow into politics was a bad idea If our democracy survives until the midterms .we have to get these people out.

At some point, the operation was also called Operation Messiah's Coming.Most of Yemenite Jews had never seen an aircraft before, but they believed in the Biblical prophecy: according to the Book of Isaiah (40:31) and Exodus (19:1), God promised to return the Children of Israel to Zion \\"on wings of eagles\\".\\"They left their religious ways of life as farmers and adopted a totally new way of life in a new world.The operation's official name originated from two relevant biblical passages:Exodus 19:4 - \\"You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how\\nI bore you on wings of eagles, and brought you to Myself.\\"Book of Isaiah 40:31 - \\"But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.\\"Since they had never seen aircraft before, many of the immigrants were extremely scared and refused to board, but were assured when reminded of these verses by their rabbi.Operation Magic Carpet was the first in a series of operations whose purpose was to transport entire communities of Jews from Arab countries to Israel en masse during the 1950s and 1960s.","title":"Senator Tom Cotton introduces bill to replace 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria'"},{"text":"Nobody can speak against the fuhror","title":"Biden weighs preemptive pardons for those who could be targets of Trumps retribution"},{"text":"Our saving grace is that the presidency and his vindictiveness will speed run his aging.

Many of those who are not formally involved, like Mr. Ellison, have been happy to sit in on the meetings.Their involvement, to a degree far deeper than previously reported, has made this one of the most potentially conflict-ridden presidential transitions in modern history. It also carries what could be vast implications for the Trump administrations policies on issues including taxes and the regulation of artificial intelligence, not to mention clashing mightily with the notion that Mr. Trumps brand of populism is all about helping the working man.A core goal of Mr. Musk and the Silicon Valley set has been to improve the efficiency of government services. One tech executive who has been seen at Mar-a-Lago, the investor Shervin Pishevar, has called for an agenda that pushes substantial privatization of American government functions, such as the Postal Service, NASA and the federal prison system, and the creation of an American sovereign wealth fund.By leveraging the ingenuity of the private sector and creating pathways for direct citizen ownership, a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  spearheaded by visionaries like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy  could lead a revolutionary restructuring of public institutions, Mr. Pishevar wrote.This is late-stage Citizens United.[I have said](https://pa.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1grw51l/trump_vows_to_dismantle_federal_bureaucracy_and/lxbcg0q/) from the moment that I heard about DOGE that the ultimate goal of cutting government functions was to farm out these same functions to the private sector in an attempt to enrich their cronies.

I'm not talking Republicans shackling themselves to their ideology in spite of Trump, but people who don't know or care about anything in politics or government and wanna take that out on the world via Trump. *Both of these* needed to be involved simultaneously, otherwise Kamala Harris's 74M votes would have likely carried her to the presidency and Democrats to their Congressional majorities. And one will be removed, and the other likely flipping its head for the next election.The Harris-Walz campaign served its purpose by ginning up enthusiasm and energy to keep Democrats with more than a fighting chance. While I wish our ticket could have reaped the full rewards of their efforts, they're both still very much there, and very much active. So as we continue to improve and refine our message and continue to hold the line, we can still aim high.

The 1950s and 1960s are often regarded by modern conservatism as a better time. Even the newer generation of conservatives who are in their 30s and 40s will look back on this romanticized period in awe, while sharing similar sentiments towards the 1980s and 1990s. There are two things that are shared by all conservatives when they refer to these better times: 1. Access and understanding of popular culture both from these decades and cultural media that portrays it. 2. A desire to relive their youth in these decades. Access to cultural media from these five decades isnt scarce, but many popular tv shows and movies often portray the world as idyllic and without conflict. Sure, throughout this time there was the Cold War and the Vietnam war, but back in home soil, the nuclear family thrived and everyone was happy. The biggest issue among conservative thought when it comes to idealizing this time is that it ignores the reality lived by non-white and non-white collar Americans. The nuclear family is regularly expressed as the husband goes to his office job while his wife stays home to cook and clean and the kids go off to school to learn about patriotism. Even the blue collar American nuclear family was portrayed the same way, where the only real difference was the job that the husband had, but all the other details remained the same. This idealization of these decades blatantly ignores issues of racial segregation and the struggles of the true working class, and focuses on going back to a time where only a white middle class exists. The other issue with this idea stems directly from immaturity inherent in conservative thought: the times that are idealized by conservatives are often recalled as times in their youth. For example: it would be very easy for me to say I want to go back to the 90s when things were all good, because in the 90s I was just a child and things were all good. I had no bills, my favourite shows were on TV, and I was lucky enough to have my needs met every single day, no matter what: I had nothing to worry about. Modern conservatism truly is a desire for many of these people to return to a state of no worries, because as youth they really didnt have to know the realities of the world around them. At the same time, this is also suggesting that modern conservatism embodies fear of the world around them, and that they shouldnt have to encounter or be subject to anything they dont agree with or understand.","title":"Republicans and the 1950s"},{"text":"Only if you believe in the Constitution, laws, representative democracy, fairness, the truth, racial equality ...","title":"Russian TV host gleefully claims Trump's Cabinet will 'dismantle' America, report says"},{"text":"Nazis.

Consequently, under Trump, the long-term strategy of countering Russia will persist. The U.S. continues to benefit from the Ukrainian crisis, regardless of which administration is in power.Sushentsov fully recognizes how the U.S. state system is an inertial structure that resists decisions it deems contrary to American interests, so not all of Trumps ideas will come to fruition.Thats just one graphic illustration, among many, that Moscow harbors no illusions whatsoever about Trump 2.0. Putins conditions for an attempt to solve the Ukraine riddle have been known at least since June: total Kiev withdrawal from Donbass and Novorossiya; no Ukraine in NATO; end of all 15,000+ Western sanctions; and a non-aligned, nuclear-free Ukraine.That's the danger of Trump.

Trump and the people he's nominated have made absolutely clear, through repeated and unambiguous statements, that they plan to go after their perceived enemies. It really doesn't matter if there's anything to the charges, the people they go after will get bankrupted by legal bills. I mean, they went after Joe Biden as being \\"corrupt\\" for a couple years of congressional investigations, turning over every rock, and found absolutely nothing. It was the usual totalitarian BS where the conclusion comes first and the investigation comes after. In this case, Biden didn't have to pay the defense bills because he was president, but once he is out, he's probably on the hook for it. Same with pretty much anyone in his administration, anyone who ever spoke out against him, and probably the 41 out of 44 of his cabinet members who wouldn't support him and said that he was a threat to America. Trump, in his usual mode of always claiming victimhood, always claimed that the Dems had \\"weaponized\\" the DOJ but could never actually prove it. This was cover for him to ACTUALLY weaponize the DOJ to go against anyone who has ever opposed him. Again, he's made no bones that he plans to do this. Much like with Putin, every accusation against his enemies is actually an admission of what he's doing or plans to do. So, should Biden pardon the most likely people that Trump will go after? Or should he rely upon the decency of the American people to rise up and shut that down, a la McCarthyism? The latter would obviously be better for democracy, but a significant portion of America has shown that they now think decency to be an outmoded concept, one for losers and suckers.","title":"Biden considers preemptive pardons for officials and allies who fear retribution from Trump"},{"text":"He is term limited.

Because this is not a changed view.  It's just an acknowledgement that your original post's wording was genuinely human, and accordingly imprecise.  Sure: it's fun to challenge people's particular wording or argument structuring or whatever, but I feel like we should all know that this is, in general, entirely different than challenging someone's actual belief.Maybe we need a second symbol for a less esteemed award - maybe a circle, or whatever - meaning: \\"Okay, you got me; you're very clever, and I acknowledge that you found a real flaw or contradiction in my wording, but my original view is nevertheless unchanged.\\"  Hey, at best, that could even be a jumping off point for a real view-changing discussion!

She brought billionaire Mark Cuban onto the campaign trail as he contradicted her previous stance on tax policy and campaigned with Liz Cheney. She met privately in her home with CEOs of companies undergoing antitrust cases under Biden and refused to comment on the cases or the meetings. She hired advisors who were working with Google on antitrust issues and Uber on worker protection issues. Her interviews on the View, Colbert, and NBC had her being asked what she would do differently than Biden and she had no clear answer. On the View the *only* thing she could think of was adding a Republican. She waited a weird amount of time before engaging with the media, and made Walz wait until the Vance debate before using him more often.Clintons Labor Secretary, Bernie Sanders, Dem super PAC Future Forwards, some of her donors in statements to the press, and union leadership were all complaining that she didnt have a clear economic message. Thats a wide group of people. She didnt learn from her mistakes in the 2020 primary, where her unclear stances led to bad messaging which meant she couldnt capitalize on spotlight moments. She backed off the issue voters cared about the most: the economy. She didnt inspire Democrats, convert Republicans, or provide a clear message for anyone else.
