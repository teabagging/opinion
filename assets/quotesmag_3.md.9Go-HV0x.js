But even at this late hour, it is critical that he do so  even at the risk that President-elect Trump will reverse course. The United States must send a strong signal to the people of Israel, to Palestinians and to the world that we will not stand idly by as the extremist Netanyahu government dismantles the possibility of peace in the Middle East and ignores the root causes of conflict: the need for security and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.To send this signal, President Biden should immediately impose sanctions on the ultraright members of the Netanyahu government who have fomented violence and supported expanded settlements on the West Bank, including Smotrich and Ben Gvir. The United States must draw a red line against further settlements, not just in words but in deeds.Its also time to acknowledge that the Netanyahu government has violated its assurances under National Security Memorandum 20 and that it is not in compliance with the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act (Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act). As documented by leading human rights organizations, the Netanyahu government has arbitrarily restricted desperately needed humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and has used American weapons in contravention of international humanitarian law. These determinations should trigger a pause in U.S. offensive security assistance  a consequence the Netanyahu government must face until it comes into compliance.In addition to these actions, the administration should ban the import of any goods from settlements in the occupied territories or, at the very least, take the long-overdue step of reinstating the labeling policy that differentiates products made there from those made in the state of Israel. And it must continue to show its support for UNRWA  and encourage our allies to support its efforts  especially in light of the Knessets recent vote to ban the organization.Last, but perhaps most important, the Biden administration should recognize a state of Palestine, subject to terms set out by the United States. Those terms should include an end to the Palestinian Authoritys prisoner payments system. All this should be able to proceed almost immediately, since the PA has already drafted legislation that complies with U.S. law prohibiting direct support to the PA as long as the prisoner payment system is in place. This action would be a significant step toward realizing a two-state solution and set an example for other nations to follow our lead.\\"","title":"History will judge Biden harshly on Gaza | In the remaining weeks of his presidency, Biden must correct course."},{"text":"I like that - lets shorten it and punch it up:We abandoned our moral high ground when you elected a traitor.","title":"Jon Stewart on Biden pardon: Dems should f--- the norms but own it"},{"text":"Oh, thats rich, coming from him.","title":"McConnell cries foul after 2 Democratic judges cancel retirement after Trump victory"},{"text":"The WashPo isnt a singular person who write this article, a current Senator in Maryland, who obviously knows what Trump will do, wrote it.","title":"History will judge Biden harshly on Gaza | In the remaining weeks of his presidency, Biden must correct course."},{"text":"Because Americans are cowards and its not their fault.

But even at this late hour, it is critical that he do so  even at the risk that President-elect Trump will reverse course. The United States must send a strong signal to the people of Israel, to Palestinians and to the world that we will not stand idly by as the extremist Netanyahu government dismantles the possibility of peace in the Middle East and ignores the root causes of conflict: the need for security and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.To send this signal, President Biden should immediately impose sanctions on the ultraright members of the Netanyahu government who have fomented violence and supported expanded settlements on the West Bank, including Smotrich and Ben Gvir. The United States must draw a red line against further settlements, not just in words but in deeds.Its also time to acknowledge that the Netanyahu government has violated its assurances under National Security Memorandum 20 and that it is not in compliance with the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act (Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act). As documented by leading human rights organizations, the Netanyahu government has arbitrarily restricted desperately needed humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and has used American weapons in contravention of international humanitarian law. These determinations should trigger a pause in U.S. offensive security assistance  a consequence the Netanyahu government must face until it comes into compliance.In addition to these actions, the administration should ban the import of any goods from settlements in the occupied territories or, at the very least, take the long-overdue step of reinstating the labeling policy that differentiates products made there from those made in the state of Israel. And it must continue to show its support for UNRWA  and encourage our allies to support its efforts  especially in light of the Knessets recent vote to ban the organization.Last, but perhaps most important, the Biden administration should recognize a state of Palestine, subject to terms set out by the United States. Those terms should include an end to the Palestinian Authoritys prisoner payments system. All this should be able to proceed almost immediately, since the PA has already drafted legislation that complies with U.S. law prohibiting direct support to the PA as long as the prisoner payment system is in place. This action would be a significant step toward realizing a two-state solution and set an example for other nations to follow our lead.\\"","title":"History will judge Biden harshly on Gaza | In the remaining weeks of his presidency, Biden must correct course."},{"text":"They just had to call it a red light district.

The fact the plan was even feasible enough to be attempted is too close and the fact Mike Pence's decision was even a factor is a sign of how dangerous the situation really was. I cannot emphasize this enough: The plan does not have to succeed to effectively spell the beginning of the end of American Democracy. There are dozens of ways where the plan still fails (as in, Biden is still sworn in as president) and the constitutional crisis is still enough to irreparably damage American Democracy. Do you really think a scenario where Trump tries this and the military has to force him out of office is anything but apocalyptic? Hell, I'd argue we could be living through one of those scenarios now: The one where Trump was not immediately arrested or charged for his fake elector scheme and rides out the consequences for four years, then comes back to power with four whole years to plan for round two, a compliant court and knowing that there will be no real institutional pushback to his crimes.

It baffles me how people don't realize this. Storm the Capitol was not Plan A. Plan A was to use the Vice President and Republican members of Congress as a pretext to reject electoral votes on the premise of \\"fraud\\", then either trying to appoint an alternative slate of electors or force the election to Congress, which then hands it to Trump. The whole plan was to create a legal fiction *just* close enough to reality that people might be unwilling to tear the country apart to reject it. If Trump had had a loyalist VP in 2020, it is entirely possible that the whole thing ends **very** differently. Would it have worked? There is no real way to know.

The American system is designed for checks and balances. However, the intention was not to give one side or the other the ability to stop meaningful legislation beneficial to the American people, but rather to promote the ability for both sides to work together for the benefit of the American people. An example of a bipartisan effort was when the ACA was saved. The ACA remains overwhelmingly popular across both sides of the electorate &amp; if it is gutted, there better be something better to take its place or the party responsible for its termination will without a doubt pay in future elections. During this election cycle I only heard one side expressing an interest at working with the other offering a seat at the table for those willing to make a bipartisan effort to find solutions that might improve the lives of Americans.? The key factor in this last election was the economy, particularly when it comes to inflation, which is logically the biggest concern for Americans before anything else. Whether the actual numbers reflected overall sentiment when it came to this issue is another debate. But the argument can be made that Americans find a reason to eventually vote democratic as well because history proves that neither party maintains control consistently over election cycles.","title":"The End of Democratic Delusions | The Trump Reaction and what comes next"},{"text":"Nazis did not lose Germany did.

For example legalized for 18+, 21+, or everyone? Legalized for just for consumption or can you sell it too?  Do you need a liscene to sell THC or can anyone open a dispensary? Would it still be illegal to export weed? Who regulates the majuana industry? What kind of Taxes will be on THC? What I'm trying to get at here is that there's no such thing as a \\"simple law\\" every law interacts with all other laws and that has to be considered before writing the law. Either through debates in Congress for bills or by collecting signatures for ballot measures.To maintain neutrality, political parties, elected officials, and lobbying groups would be prohibited from endorsing or opposing any issue on the ballot.Yeah this is a really bad idea. You're basically saying that congress people can't talk about the top 5 issues effecting Americans. This would guarantee that you could never have anything done on these issues by congress. Which would be a huge issue due to the huge gap between direct votes.If an issue is voted on and resolvedwhether it passes or failsit would be barred from being included on the ballot in the next round of national votes. This restriction would ensure that the system prioritizes new and pressing concerns rather than revisiting previously decided issues. However, after a full 10-year cycle, the issue could be reconsidered for the ballot if public sentiment or circumstances significantly change, as determined by the neutral organization overseeing the process.I really think you don't understand how long 10 years is politically. As an example, 10 years ago gay marriage was illegal in most states. So now imagine what would have happened if a gay marriage referendum 10 years ago. There's a good chance that it would've fail and if that was the case then gay marriage would've remained illegal well into the 2030s.

In the same way he's not responsible for the assassination of prime minister Rabin.The same way he's not responsible for the six days war,  nor controversial Israeli settlements, nor the dispossession of Palestinian land, nor the wars that took place between 1917 and 1948, nor the Arab revolt, nor the bus bombings, nor the Yom Kippur War, nor the war in Lebanon, nor the Suez crisis, and on and on it goesThe closest that Israelis and Palestinians came to establishing a semblance of peace in recent history was during the Oslo Accords negotiations, when prime minister rabin And Yasser Arafat shook hands, one recognizing the other, one also recognizing the other's right to exist. But it was far right jingoists like Netanyahu that stirred up violence with nationalistic and incendiary rhetoric, that led to the assassination of Rabin.Rabin wasn't assassinated by a Palestinian no, but by a far-right Israeli extremist.That should have been the end of Bibi's career, but he was able to return as a strong man persona promising to be the only one who could keep the Israeli people safe. Since then, he's grown his far-right coalition. A coalition that pursued conflict in order to preserve power. A coalition that believes a two-state solution is no solution at all.The attacks on October 7th were a continuation of this conflict.Joe Biden's capacity as a peace broker is undermined by this history, as well as past administration's capitulation to Israeli leaders. Joe Biden did not formally acknowledge the annexation of Golan Heights as president, Joe Biden does not constantly espouse anti-muslim rhetoric, Joe Biden did not order the relocation of the US embassy and diplomatic missions to Jerusalem. Joe Biden does not recognize internationally condemned settlements. All of these things far more contentious than Diplomatic talks with the Saudis.Even your article suggests what I've been saying about Biden's challenges, an article which is nothing more than conjecture by the way, claiming that Joe Biden was working towards diplomacy with the Saudis, which was undercut by a long history of animus, political tensions, rises in violence, brutality,  land squabbles, and militant groups.And to say that US diplomacy with the Saudis somehow led to the October 7th attack is such an unimaginable stretch to begin with. Because if this is the case, we would have seen a disproportionate response to Trump's dangerous interventionism in the middle east. Congress had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions while Trump was president, the first one due to Donald Trump's interventionism in the Yemen war and his alliance with the Saudi crown Prince, the second to quell the possibility of war after Donald Trump approved the assassination of an Iranian general.What a ridiculous assertion.October 7th was another incarnation of a long list of escalations that have occurred in the region since the early 20th century.","title":"History will judge Biden harshly on Gaza | In the remaining weeks of his presidency, Biden must correct course."},{"text":"If they wanted all these rules to be laws they shouldve worked harder to get them codified.

Biden did not say he was \\"unlikely\\" to pardon his son. Biden did not say he was \\"considering\\" pardoning his son. Biden repeatedly said he would not pardon his son...then biden pardoned his son.Trump has been caught in similar lies and his supporters always claim we don't know what's in his heart. And they are right, for all you know trump just changes his mind everytime he speaks. So you are never allowed to call him a liar.But of course you can, because of course he is, just like Biden.Your accusation appears to admit zero nuance due to its absolutenessIt's because it's such a clear black and white broken promise.

I genuinely believe this is the best state in the country. However, California also has its problems, and both of these things can be true at the same time.One of the major driving factors behind people leaving California is the cost of housing. A significant number of those leaving are young peopleparticularly young couples who want to buy their first home and start a family. For most, California simply cannot offer that opportunity unless they are already wealthy. Additionally, the state is facing a severe housing shortage, making the market highly competitive. The more people competing for limited housing, the higher the cost of housing and rent for everyone else. A commonsense solution would seem to be building more housing, especially high-density developments like apartment buildings and townhouses. However, every time a measure aimed at incentivizing municipalities to invest in such housing appears on the ballot, it fails by a 2-to-1 margin.The cost of living in California is another issue that exacerbates this problem. A significant driver of this high cost is the disconnect between where employers situate themselves and where people can afford to live. Major employers, such as Apple in Cupertino (population 57,285) or Facebook in Menlo Park (population 31,690), dominate smaller subdivided cities. Local governments in these areas often bend to the will of these corporations, prioritizing their needs over broader community interests. For most workers, this dynamic means living far from their jobs, resulting in grueling commutessometimes up to four hours daily.These long commutes create additional issues. People who live far from their jobs often earn and spend money outside their own communities, driving up costs for local residents. Meanwhile, rural California, which may seem affordable at first glance, often proves just as expensive as urban areas when accounting for food, utilities, and property taxes. This economic squeeze is a significant factor in the homelessness crisis, particularly in rural areas, where many people have been priced out of their homes entirely.There have been efforts to address these issues, but they have largely failed. In the last election, two key ballot measuresone to allow cities to implement rent control and another to increase the minimum wagewere soundly defeated. Californians frequently complain about the cost of living and the homelessness crisis, yet many seem unwilling to support solutions that could begin to address these problems. The governor, despite his authority, cannot simply overrule the will of the people.The state has taken some drastic steps, such as suing cities that fail to comply with mandatory shelter initiatives and threatening to withhold critical funding from municipalities that refuse to address housing shortages. While these measures represent progress, they are not enough to resolve the underlying issues.California is at a crossroads. If we truly want to preserve the states promise and improve its livability for everyone, it will take a collective effort to support bold, systemic changes. This means not only acknowledging the states challenges but also embracing solutions that require sacrifice and compromisetwo things Californians haven't shown that they are willing to do.","title":"Red States \\"quality of life\\""},{"text":"I was thinking same thing!","title":"Jill Biden just presented her White House Christmas decorations, and it's truly the creepiest thing ever Melania Trump's return as First Lady is just as big as Trump's return.

Firstly, I definitely appreciate that it gives the voters a chance to vote for someone who is unlikely to win while also making sure their vote counts by voting for a stronger candidate.However, there's one thing that kinda bothers me, say if Candidate A gets 60% votes and 80% of the Candidate A voters also vote for Candidate B, whereas Candidate B gets 40% votes and only 20% of the Candidate B voters vote for Candidate A, then although Candidate B has 40% + 80%  60% = 88% voter support, Candidate A wins the race with only 60% + 20%  40% = 68% of the voter support. For the system named Rank Choice Voting, only the Candidate C voters actually get to vote for multiple candidates while the Candidate A and B voters get to vote for only one.I feel like Instant Runoff Voting (an alternate term from Wikipedia) is a more accurate term for RCV? Because essentially RCV assumes the Candidate A and B voters would vote for the same candidate again, and it is, say the Candidate C voters, whose distribution decide which candidate reaches the 50% mark, and RCV saves that extra runoff election.What do you guys think?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 3, 2024"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|IO5Ho0HqFqaQ0)","title":"That's rich coming from you, you demented turtle"},{"text":"Pardoning your son or really any family member should be frowned upon.

Dems seem to have an inclination towards infighting and mudslinging when in power in a way that Republicans generally don't (on a governmental scale - largely omitting the antics from this most recent House session).For one example look at Biden's student loan relief plan, you had centrist dems blasting him for 'giving handouts' or 'solving this the wrong way' when it was announced, and progressives shitting all over him and calling him a liar when it got blocked by SCOTUS.There was obviously a similar dynamic with the Israel/Palestine conflict over the past year - regardless of what he did, he would have taken (very public, vocal) flak from half the party; either moderates shame him for abandoning an ally and 'allowing terrorism' (or worse - lobbing antisemitism allegations), or progressives loudly denigrate him as 'Genocide Joe' for not making Israel stop bombing Gaza. I think it just boils down to a much higher willingness to publicly and loudly critique your own party on the side of the Democrats than the Republicans. I'm sure the age-old 'big tent problem' plays into it as well.But bottom line is you just don't see Republican elected officials catching heat from their voters like that. When Trump did something Republicans typically don't like ('grab em by the pussy', comments about vets, 'take the guns first, due process later', etc), both voters and elected officials had this uncanny ability to look you in your eyes and just say \\"well **I don't agree with him** on that\\", before pivoting the conversation to the points they *do* agree on.Democrats just can't do that. They can't just let there be a disagreement between themselves and the other member of the party they disagree with. They have to go out of their way to *convince you* that *their* view of the situation is correct, and [insert Democrat]'s views/actions are incorrect and even actively harmful. Which, on the one hand - can be seen as a positive; holding our elected officials accountable and trying to build support for change. But on the other, it leads to every major figure in the Democratic party having like a 30% approval rating, because every Republican dislikes them *as well as* a huge chunk of Democrats.

Do you pardon people in jail on cannabis-related charges? What age should it be legal for? Should the state have a monopoly on sale or production?

The issue is with the rules the Dems made for themselves and how they've played the game. The difference is that Republicans are tearing down these institutions for both individual and personal gain as well as for issues they've campaigned on for years. They break norms to stack courts to overturn Roe v Wade and fire the parliamentarian to push through more oil drilling leases which is what their base wants, so when they also break the rules to line their own pockets, their base doesn't care because at least in some capacity, they see Republicans playing dirty for their interests too. On the other hand, all the Dems have done is point out how dirty it is while seemingly never stooping to the same lows for their own base. That's why there's a double standard among their own party; you can't say for multiple election cycles that using political office for personal gain is unequivocally wrong and no one is above the law and then turn around and do that when you feel like it. But even if you want to go that route and say it's fine because the other side does it shamelessly anyways, you only have the personal gain to point to when confronted with breaking political norms. I'd imagine the Dems and liberal media would be a lot more okay with this if he had tried to stack the courts when Roe was overturned or fired the parlimentarian when the minimum wage hike was shot down. Instead, it reeks of the same hypocrisy that Republicans are known for but without any of the same rule breaking used for policy changes that bought them enough good will within their own party for it not to be a problem with their own base.  In fact, that was Stewart's whole argument in this segment: \\"Use the rules. Use the loopholes. FCk the norms, but also use it to help people, not just those people who are related to you.\\"","title":"Jon Stewart calls out Biden after Hunter pardon: 'Look at the dance' Democrats have to do"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/oaubhz9ibp4e1.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc5033647a0a16c38629fc4ec9781dd4a98da3c","title":"MT: South Korea Martial Law"},{"text":"All dogs are considered puppies unto eternity","title":"From South Korea to Brazil to France, it seems like democracy is holding the line everywhere except the US"},{"text":"Why not end subminimum wages?","title":"Biden moves to end subminimum wages for people with disabilities"},{"text":"How the fuck are Brazil and South Korea better at foiling and punish coup plotters than America.

They're currently beholden to both DoD budgets and DHS budgets, depending on project, in a way no other military branch is beholden to. When I worked with USCG their headquarters was going under renovation and they \\"temporarily\\" got absorbed into operating in DHS buildings, literally sharing buildings and floors at DHS buildings with DHS workers, but were unable to be issued laptops and other tech during onboarding due to budget issues.

Say imagine I ask you to cut a living person open? It'd be horrible! But perhaps you could do it if you knew it'd save their life.So medical ethics aims to balance these actions by finding them acceptable when they cure or fix an identifiable disease or similar - and minimizing pain as much as possible.Say, concerning genetic treatments, it's full greenlight for their use to eliminate genetic diseases. However, it's considered largely unethical to use genetic treatments for non-medical purposes. (E.g. designer babies.)I think while a hernia check IS more invasive, it's a medical procedure done for the explicit purpose of preventing strenuous activity from worsening hernias and causing preventable illness.Here in your example, the hormone check - say assuming kept private and the doctor reports a simple Y/N - is a medical procedure done for purposes non-medical purposes. Which is why such a procedure doesn't pass my ethics test. Obviously this doesn't make me the end-all be all for ethics - just figured I'd explain my reasoning.There's fantastic discussions on why we generally arrived on the agreed upon medical ethics that could talk in length the different views and arguments than I ever could provide - since I think the natural follow up would be why are those widely agreed upon ethics?","title":"The Left-Flank Albatross"},{"text":"You know what?

His role as peace broker was made more challenging by the U.S.'s complicity and involvement in this war for over half a century, while his position as a mediator was undermined by both the last administration's foreign policy and Netanyahu's appetite for conflict.This century's old war was not carried out by the Biden administration. If you want to criticize the U.S.'s long standing, geopolitical partnership with Israel, that's fine, but if you take issue with Biden's \\"complicity\\" in that partnership, which was on some level, obligatory, consider the alternative for a moment.Voters have memory-holed Trump's foreign policy record. Think about what the state of the war would look like under a second Trump presidency before talking about how history will remember Biden's role in it. Trump's middle east platform was built around anti-muslim/Palestinian attitudes and policies, interventionist and contentious measures that emboldened Netanyahu and heightened provocations in the region, a transactional relationship with aggressors, and a coalition of vehemently pro-Israel allies, among other things.Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with other \\"strongmen,\\" he caved in to Bibi's political pressures.Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. I prefer not to take a one sided stance on this war. I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as \\"Zionism out of despair\\" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. That being said, Trump's record indicates that he is willing to take an uncompromising stance on this war that he likely knows nothing about.Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved in. When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his handlers, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.What's more, Trump's \\"Middle East peace plan\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. As foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably brief, insincere and ineffective plan also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.In terms of his rhetoric, Trump has referred to all pro Palestinian protestors as \\"radicals.\\" Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said, Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,Trump has not only vowed to crush pro Palestinian protests, but he's threatened to deport *all* demonstrators. Trump has made statements like, they (Israel) \\"have to have a victory.\\" And speaking to Netanyahu, Trump has stated, \\"do what you have to do\\" in Gaza, while he has also said that we have to \\"let Israel finish the job.\\" Republicans in his orbit have also been pushing to annex the West bank, which is a real possibility considering Trump's MAGA coalition is willing to trade their loyalty for a chance to use him to enact their Islamophobic agenda.Trump hasn't laid out a viable plan for addressing the war in Israel. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gazas current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy. Gazas waterfront property could be very valuable, Kushner saidCaution around the controversial topic hasn't kept Trump from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.Trump has a long history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a \\"Muslim problem.\\" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.In 2015, he said he will \\"look at\\" closing mosques.He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.Trump once said he would certainly implement a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registryHe called for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\\"He's called Muslims \\"sick people.\\"Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that the Judeo-Christian west is engaged in a global war against jihadist Islamic fascism.Then there's Trump's first \\"Muslim ban\\", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of \\"radical islamic terror.\\"While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.Let's not forget the recent \\"rally\\" at MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points. Some of it directed at Palestinians. Trump even used \\"Palestinian\\" as a slur during his debate with Biden.All that being said, the consequences for Palestinians and Muslims will be far more severe with Trump in office and a MAGA coalition of fierce loyalists behind him. Not only that, but over the next four years, this agenda will encumber any future progressive efforts to broker a peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Criticize Biden all you want, but this is a war that the US has been complicit in for decades. Biden's role as a mediator during this stage of the war was made more challenging by not only the U.S's involvement in this conflict for over a half century, but also by the previous admin's policies and Netanyahu's far right coalition.","title":"History will judge Biden harshly on Gaza | In the remaining weeks of his presidency, Biden must correct course."},{"text":"Did they lose their minds when Trump pardoned Steve Bannon and Roger Stone?

The reason the plea deal has been discussed ad nauseam at this point, and you ding dongs still just keep spouting bullshit lies.

Already a big contradiction there. As to whether voters wanted her to attack Trump, the polling evidence throughout the election suggests exactly the opposite. Here's a link that is reflective of almost all the polling produced saying that people actually wanted Harris to talk about her policies, rather than attacking Trump. She called him a fascist, she called him a rapist, a fraudster, all of the things, and that moved the needle not at all. Why you think doing it on stage would be any different, when he could just call her a nasty woman spewing lies and accusations, is beyond mehttps://www.vox.com/politics/365833/trump-harris-walz-weird-2024-election-voters-biden-poll-attack-messagingAs to Trump being at ease among uneducated voters, he literally never saw them. He never did events where he was meeting people, or speaking to them. All he did were rambling rallies and right-wing manosphere podcasts. He was one of the most sheltered candidates in history, because any time he talked to anyone who wasn't a total sycophant, he was laughably out of touch. The only risks he took were spewing his steam of consciousness out at rallies and lying over and over and over again.As I've said in another comment: Personally, I think the Democratic party has long-suffered from their corporate bootlicking and unwillingness to embrace true labor-forward, social-democratic policies that will benefit the American people at large. But to do that would be to be a different party. That's not a messaging problem, it's an identity problem. Not to mention that this approach is basically that of Bernie Sanders, who has been the constant victim for right-wing lies and fear mongering around socialism.The story of this election is not one of messaging. It's that the Democrats abandoned their working class roots during the Clinton administration, and therefore cannot inspire the loyalty of those groups automatically. So when a once in a lifetime pandemic comes around that increases prices, they cannot win those groups back, because they are unwilling to 1) support policies that involve dramatic government spending and intervention in the economy and 2) lie blatantly, shamelessly, and repeatedly, like the Republicans.If this boils down to messaging, then the only lesson that the Democrats can learn from this election is that the American people prefer to be manipulated by promises of impossible things, demonization of outsider groups, and manufactured outrage, rather than being given the honest truth or good faith (if imperfect) solutions.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Well said, Biden will go back on his word and pardon his son but wont lift a finger to stop a felon from having another shot at ruining the country.

It absolutely does not.Trying to compare the two is very much apples-to-oranges because the right and left are representing fundamentally very different things. Conservatism/right-wing politics always have an advantage because they represent, in peoples minds, the cultural default. Its how they can get away with the unspoken idea that conservatives are not ideological while leftists are.This is why coalition-building isnt as much of a necessity for the right while it very much is on the left, if they want to actually win elections. The left is a patchwork of different groups of people who have their own priorities. So often the coalition falls apart or never materializes because people struggle to support other groups or candidates if they dont feel their specific causes are enough of a priority.Right now we see that very clearly between left-of-center liberals vs the more radical left. Its always been an issue but it is extremely pronounced lately.Tellingly, it was the breakdown of this coalition that enabled Hitlers rise to power. Socialists (far left) and social democrats (moderate left) couldnt unite. Not saying were heading to Nazi Germany times but the difficulty and consequences of the entire left not being able to unite is very much a pattern with pretty bad consequences.My belief is that the people who are most toxic, absolutist, and reject discourse are the driver of disunity, not the people who are criticizing them.","title":"The Left-Flank Albatross"},{"text":"Yes In My Emirate!","title":"MT: South Korea Martial Law"},{"text":"Forced praise gives no value except tyranny.

Often, this was done so blatantly that it didnt take much effort to see how overblown the claims were. For many Americans, this discredited MSM entirely, making their identity-based accusations seem baseless or irrational. Honestly, there is enough proof that he is a terrible person by sticking directly to the facts, we didn't need to exaggerate it. Many Democrats were either baffled that anyone could support Trump because of his distasteful personality, or they assumed his supporters were sexist, racist, or fascist. Once labeled in such a way, there was often no effort made to understand their arguments. But labeling anyone who questions certain topics, like DEI initiatives, as inherently bigoted misses the nuance of the conversation. You can support DEI initiatives and still critique where they fall short or are misused.The same applies to conversations about trans people in sports. Its possible to raise questions or suggest reevaluating frameworks like restrooms or sports categories without being transphobic. As society moves away from viewing gender as strictly binary, we may need to rethink and adapt systems to reflect these changes.These discussions are important and need to happen. However, they become impossible when people refuse to engage in the conversation and instead label those asking questions as sexist or racist. This shuts down dialogue entirely.I generally agree much more with liberal ideals than conservative ones, but I strongly oppose the practice of shutting down conversations altogether. That path leads to polarization and division, which is exactly where we find ourselves today.","title":"\\"Identity politics\\" did not cost the Democrats the election"},{"text":"YIMBY Technocratic Jihadism","title":"MT: South Korea Martial Law"},{"text":"We should officially change the name of this mega thread to \\"The Yoon Cave\\"","title":"MT: South Korea Martial Law"},{"text":"Meghan \\"My Father\\" McCain calling someone out as a nepo baby is peak Meghan McCain.","title":"Meghan McCain Slammed for Criticism of Nepo Baby Hunter Biden | \\nThe irony of the statement was apparently lost on the daughter of the late Sen.

He may not have the power to change interest rates but pretending like it didn't matter, or even patting himself on the back for slowing the price increase was absolutely the wrong move.At those 3% rates, that home could have increased in value to more than 800k and the payment would still have been more affordable than Biden's policy.  And existing homeowners would have been ecstatic to see that increase.

I'm not really sure what the rest is even about.Except we know nothing about these assessments and whether or if Putin know enough where he can take advantage of them to feign the use of trying to use nukes. Reminder that Putin has his own spies to where Zelensky is hesitant to share their war strategy with the US. So somewhere in the White House, either a spy or a sellout is still around.

Madness, but he'd made up his mind. Same reason Europe and even Zelensky had trouble believing American warnings (also Israeli intel re: the Hamas attack, but that's outside the scope).It isn't madness, it's strategic. Putin slowly started invading and dividing  other nations, Obama didn't do jack shit, so guess what happens years down the line? Now Putin is doing full-scale invasion. There is no madness, Putin intentionally creates small scales of conflict to be normalize and used to create the ground for him to do what he's doing now.

Laying a few things out here:1) I am not giving Biden credit for not pursuing more death penalty cases then hypothetically pardoning them because thats not a thing he can do. The president does not choose the sentences the DoJ pursues in individual cases. Biden did tell the DoJ to stop pursuing the death penalty in new cases in 2021, which was good. He didnt do much for existing cases tho, and aside from the 40 prisoners on death row the DoJ is actively pursuing the death penalty in 2 other cases. 2) Youre correct that the raw number of death penalty commutations per president isnt the most useful metric. I would have to take a lot of time and map out how many death row inmates were given clemency per president as a % of the total number of death row inmates. Im confident Bidens is still among the lowest, because he has not granted clemency in any death penalty cases yet. Bidens death penalty clemency rate is 0%. I am confident that still ranks him among the lowest. His general pardon rate is pretty low too. Hes given out 26, compared to 200 for Trump, 2000 for Obama, 200 for Bush, and 500 for Clinton. 3) Its nice that the US hands out fewer death sentences now. Im glad for that. That has very little to do with the president. The overwhelming majority of those past executions were carried out at the State level, where the president had no authority to grant clemency. The number of executions decreased in large part because 23 states abolished the death penalty, which again has nothing to do with any president. 4) Biden has the unilateral authority to commute the sentences of 40 people the state wants to execute. Hes had that unilateral authority his entire term. He campaigned on abolishing the federal death penalty in 2020. He did not exercise that authority at any point, and he dropped death penalty abolition from his 2024 platform. Those are decisions that Biden alone is responsible for because he alone had the authority to act and he alone chose not to.","title":"Catholic advocates push Biden to commute federal death penalty sentences"},{"text":"Wow.

Harris and Democrats generally campaigned heavily on project 2025 and January 26, and it's unlikely they did that randomly or without any evidence it has an impact. In fact they campaigned so heavily on those issues, and Trump's general incompetence and corruption, that they drove the issue into the ground and voters tired of the issue, which is why they tried to switch to a more positive message over the last few months. But they persuaded a lot of voters that Trump sucked along the way, and a lot of them voted against him.

In todays culture then what people want is a un-presidential president. Trump is 80, lame, embarrassing and a price of crap. But he won because, between the two, he wasnt a politician. So, if thats all it takes then what Democrats need is someone cool.  Imagine someone like Dave Bautista. Hes very liberal, political, cares about climate, was raised by a gay mom and  is appealing to men (the biggest obstacle in getting a democrat). He may be a big tough bruiser, but hes not President Camacho (idiocracy). Someone like that exists on the Democrats side. And they arent necessarily ruthless or swarmy or malicious. So thats what they should be looking for. Someone who believes in what democrats have been pushing but also appealing to the groups that they lost.","title":"Am I the only one who's angry how weak minded democrats are?

We don't need any more articles about it. There are exactly two ways for the Democrats to win. Option one is to field a candidate that gets people so excited that all of the blue-leaning but intermittent voters get off their couches and show up at the polls. Most Americans lean blue in terms of policy preferences but many obviously do not vote. You can look at survey data about sentiment for this information, I'm not going to litigate it on reddit.Option two is to convince the purple voters who are going to show up and vote regardless to vote for you. This is, I believe, actually easier than motivating non-voters to vote. The key talking point to court these folks is how much money they can spend. This could come from lower prices, lower taxes, or higher wages, but their singular measure of how the country is doing is how much shit they can buy. That's it. Once you're in office, as Trump has proven, you can do whatever the fuck you want. But you need to make sure that the Costco voters can buy a bunch of gas and flat screen TVs.Edit: I'm an independent who thinks the real conflict is working class vs the elite but we aren't ready for that convo just yet.

There were folks like you said the Democrats should \\"moderate\\" on abortion in 2022 and that roe v Wade ending wouldn't matter in the midterms, that turned out to be extremely wrong.

Restaurant workers are \\"working class.\\"   \\nHotel maids are \\"working class\\"   \\nUber drivers are \\"working class\\" Working class doesn't really, shouldn't really, mean \\"older tradesmen with low 6 figure jobs and/or their own business\\" anymore. Those people have a lot of contempt, a lot of FUGM, ladder pulling *contempt*, for the *broader* working class that needs addressed. The clean truck driver with opinions about zoomer spending, truck vlogging about how they too could buy 3 starter homes to flip or use as rentals if they'd just stop buying little treats and trinkets, it as least as real and at least as divisive and dissonant as any other sort of \\"chattering class\\" I think that the idea of certain words/terms/concepts constantly being ceded as shibboleths to the right needs to addressed. Because constantly moving away from terms once the right toxifies them is a losing strategy. The right doesn't stop and give you credit for compromising if you stop teaching CRT, they just roll the snowball and keep using the exact same tactics to attack \\"DEI\\" the following news cycle. constantly participating in this makes the left look like a jobber in a pro wrestling match after enough cycles.   \\n  \\nOne thing I think the dems need to sort out is that they don't need to be 1/16th everything to speak to people. They just need to be sincere, be present, listen, and do the work, and to stop calibrating their claims so heavily. Bill Clinton (at the time) was electable not because he WAS an x,y,z, 1,2,3 group member but *because those groups found him sincere.* When I say \\"calibrating their claims\\" I mean the shit they do that is like: \\"As a working class BIPOC woman, I know that health care is a major concern, so if I am elected I will undertake a project to add a home health care credit for ...\\" \\"I am sympathetic to systematic racism, so I am looking at programs that will empower black men...\\" \\"We will pardon \\\\[federal\\\\] marijuana crimes \\\\[under such and such amount\\\\] \\\\[under certain terms and conditions\\\\] \\\\[with certain caveats\\\\] \\\\[oh and the next admin can just keep locking people up for it\\\\]\\" this is cringeworthy shit the democrats have started doing because they are SO WHIPPED by the constant pearl-clutching and foul selling and empty hypocrisy claims coming from the right. It's nonsense. it ends with you getting no new traction with the people that say, abstractly support but aren't directly affected by, the issue, then alienating half of the people that ARE with the pandering and the half-assedness of it. Oh, you're going to reform student debt for 10k one time for current debt holders in repayment? Well, I'm a parent going back to school on a loan - does it affect my loan? will it affect my kid's in 4 years?

No one is going to give you full credit for doing 100 percent of a promise of 20 percent of what needs done. You'll get more credit for promising 100 percent, delivering 20, and calling out the people who cost you the 80. Talk like this:I will promote healthcare for all. I will make it easier for ANYONE to start a business. I will legalize marijuana federally.

Ive always voted Democrat, and I identify as a progressive.  Ill vote for the lesser of evils.  But Democrats as in people\\nwho vote for Democratic candidates arent in charge of the strategy (though you could probably blame the liberal elite inner circles for being a bunch of out-of-touch windbags).Even saying voters just wanted to give someone not connected to Biden a shot, because of high prices and cost of living, does not let them off the hook, because they should have anticipated that.  The issues with Biden running again were also obvious.The point that a LOT of people dont follow politics, and dont feel particular affinity for any politicians right now, is important.

Its not disinformation either.  Dems just ran a bad campaign and there is a load of baggage that has accumulated over the years.Its far beyond just politics.  Its crept into media and movies and games and etc.  Basically an ideological pressure has been slowly applied with increasing force to the US that did not actually align with the values of the average US citizen.  For awhile people just kind of got out of the way or accepted it because people don't wanna become social pariahs or lose their jobs or get dox'd and attacked by social media or etc.And eventually enough was enough.  People didn't change their views to match waht was being pushed onto them.  They simply laid low and stayed out of the way and at some point most of them had enough and they didn't show up on social media or polls or etc, because those are dangerous, but they did show up to vote.The kind of stuff that pushed people to vote Trump.\\\\- The stupidity in movies and games where every mediocre product gets defended via using identity politics as a shield.  Be it Star Wars or Dr Who or Captain Marvel or Ghostbusters 2016 or Dragon Age Veilguard or etc.  I still remember when I called Captain Marvel a 7/10 and got told I hated women.  That kind of thing eventually puts a chip on people's shoulder.\\\\- Ideologues and activists not creating their own works but instead taking over old works and inserting incompatible ideology into them, compounded by poor writing on top of that.  This is related with the above point.    \\n  \\nFor example there are good ways to discuss identity issues in the Dragon Age IP.  Its a universe with in lore hooks you could use to talk about it.  Shapeshifting magic exists.  You could have many nuanced takes on things subtly in the background that are just a natural part of the lore but deeply address or speculate about some identity stuff.  But instead we get top surgery scars, pronouns, and modern language/ideology.  It was such an easy win, the universe had all the tools needed to craft some great stories.  And instead we got something that doesn't fit in universe, talks down to the fans, and also quite frankly is not in line with the core demographic of the series.\\\\- The false morality.  Example: Biden will not pardon his son because he stands for the law unlike repubs!  Turn around:  Biden pardon's his son.  Lots of stuff like this where Dems claimed the moral high ground and then threw it away.  \\\\- Just flat out lying/being wrong.  Every time you say \\"we definitely got him this time\\" every time your local late night talk show is wrong about what's gonna happen in some controversy or legal thing, every time the polls are flagrantly wrong, every time something is exaggerated/created or otherwise proven untrue.   People stop trusting you.  And if you say \\"well Trump lies too\\" I got [a relevant George Carlin clip for you.](https://youtu.be/d005h78r-jU)  \\\\- The demonization of white people.

Those people you describe represent such a small percentage of voters it's flat asinine to even bring them into the conversation.  You assume we voted for tariffs, don't understand them, believe China will pay them.  Then you say within a month we have been rightfully educated on tariffs and all of sudden have changed our opinion to how it will help manufacturing.  Man, for a group that doesn't want to hear facts we sure do listen to those facts when you tell us and boy do we believe them because we flipped our opinion on the perceived benefits of tariffs!  Tariffs are not the smoking gun you think they are.... You've got to be a complete idiot to pretend like Biden didn't keep Trump's tariffs from his first term and in some instances increased them... So if they are so bad for everyone, you must be admitting to how terrible Biden has been right?  I'm sure you're not talking about those Tariffs though, those Tariffs are good because Biden kept em, it's the new ones Trump has been talking about right?  You act like nobody has the mental capacity except a Democrat on Reddit to understand tariffs.  News flash, we know what tariffs are and how they are paid.  What you don't seem to have the mental capacity to understand is the benefits of tariffs.  They are great bargaining chips, they curb unfair trade with other countries, and do encourage American manufacturing.  Even so, tariffs are such a small percentage of the reason we voted for Trump... Again it's flat asinine you even bring them into the conversation.  The funniest part of your comment is the whole \\"we voted against our best interest just to hurt other people\\".  Jesus Christ man, are you seriously that delusional?  You sincerely believe that we voted for Trump just to hurt you?  That hands down is the most moronic coping mechanism I've seen this week.

By that, I mean that if you are speaking to people who think that democrats lost the election because most of the American electorate is redneck, inbred, etc. then you are speaking to a vocal minority who like to blame others for their failings. Which basically just means you are speaking to what leftists like me lovingly refer to as a shitlib. So lets start from the start: democrats lost the election for many of reasons. Here are some of the biggest: - After ignoring everyone screaming for Joe Biden to give up the nomination for way too long, they then ignored everyone screaming for an open primary and undemocratically **appointed** an unpopular candidate as the nominee. - They have been funding a genocide that is extremely unpopular among the American electorate. - When the Joe Biden dropout honeymoon ended and their polling numbers started to slip, they desperately appealed to, of all people, republicans who werent quite sold on Trump, flaunting their endorsements from the Cheney crime family and refusing to look to the left during even their most desperate times. - They did nothing to change the trajectory of the country after being voted in, even having a full legislative majority for 2 years. Roe v Wade was overturned, campaign promises for no new drilling were broken and then lied about, they made labor strikes *illegal* at one point, the wealth gap continued to increase, etc. - They ran on almost no policy, and certainly not any policy that anyone gave a fuck about. Their entire campaign was tripping over themselves to scream VOTE FOR US CAUSE TRUMP BAD! We were all fucking aware that Trump is a fascist clear back in 2015. We all heard of Project 2025 the day it was released, not when democrats suddenly started caring about it because they cant run a competent candidate. We didnt stop caring about the concentration camps on our southern border just because Trump left office, and we all saw how they remained open after he did. And some smaller reasons: - They continued with their undemocratic tendencies by kicking 3rd party leftist candidates from ballots in multiple states, primarily swing states. - They continue to allow the fucking disgusting Clintons to run the party, even letting their resident rapist go to a swing state and explain to ground zero of the uncommitted movement that its okay that theyre killing civilians in Gaza cause theyre being used as human shields, days before the election. - They allowed the sundowning president to get on TV and call half the electorate trash a week before the election. \\nAll of these points are important, but its very important for you to understand that *progressives do not need to change their messaging* if they want to win elections. 60% of this country (plus or minus a few percentage points depending on the year) want universal healthcare. Do the democrats literally ever talk about that? 70% of this country wants free subsidized public college. Do the democrats literally ever talk about that? I dont even know what percentage of the country wants weed to be legalizedlike 75-80%? Do the democrats literally ever talk about that? Maybe theyll deschedule it MAYBE. 75% of the country wants way more swift action on climate change. And I can keep listing majorly popular positions that the democrats never mention. Because the democrats are capitalists bought by their lobbyists and my fucking god are they tone deaf. They run ancient, out of touch, unpopular candidates. And the hardest theyve ever worked was to desperately keep the only left-of-center candidate to ever near the nomination, Bernie Sanders, from receiving the nomination. This entire sentiment that democrats are losing because theyre too left or too brash or that progressivism is inaccessible is, simply put, bullshit. They lose because they are rainbow fascists and boosting Nazis as their opponents so that they can run on the platform of vote for me cause Im not them doesnt fucking work. The longer democrats continue to blame voters for not liking their unpopular positions and moral grandstanding bullshit, the more elections theyll continue to lose. Younger generations reaching voting age are astronomically more likely to be leftist.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Biden already blocked that deal.

Not ignorant rednecks and racists, but rather aging elitist professionals who think they know better than everyone else and who still have PTSD from losing 49 out of 50 states to Reagan and thus compulsively try to run to the right whenever they encounter opposition.Bernie Sanders figured all this out before, and that remains a winning strategy. It just keeps getting shut down by Democrats in leadership because they don't want to win that way (either because they are still fighting the last war against Reagan, or because they know their donors don't want progressive policies enacted and thus make sure they never allow them to go to the ballot).And this problem will persist no matter *how* you message to voters, because the issue isn't even necessarily with the electorate -- it's with the gatekeepers who control what ideas and people are allowed to go forth to the electorate. If you want to run a broadly appealing working class campaign, your chief opposition and the main people you'll need to convince won't be the average voter -- it will be Democratic party insiders.If you want to get even more sinister about it, I think on some level the elite professionals who make up most of the Democratic Party leadership like feeling smarter than the common rubes and thus have no desire to appeal to them. Like, the Democratic Party would *much* rather the working class not vote...that way they can focus on fighting with the Republicans amongst a much smaller, richer subset of the population. So they *want* regular people to get apathetic and just drop out. And the *last* thing they want is to have a bunch of poor people realizing they can actually solve some of their problems, like food and medicine and housing and so forth, by *voting* rather than working for very little and hoping they get a lucky break someday.Lastly, one other thing I'll mention: I'm not sure what you mean by \\"working class\\" , but in *my* understanding \\"working class\\" is just everyone who makes most of their income by selling their labor rather than owning things. That does *not* appear to be what Democrats or political writers more broadly mean when they use this term...and certainly isn't the people that Trump appeals to.And this is important, because while I agree generally with appealing to the working class as I have described it, if you seek to the appeal to the \\"working class\\" as Trump describes it, you *will* enable fascism... because Trump does *not* appeal to the material working class.Trump appeals to, for example, car dealership owners who believe they work way harder than their lazy employees and so consider themselves \\"working class\\" (even though they're not -- they're bosses and owners collecting income off of the stuff they own). He appeals to boomers living in enormous McMansions in the suburbs and collecting a mixture of government benefits and investment / rental income who used to work in a factory and thus consider themselves \\"working class\\" (when though they're not -- they're owners collecting income off of the stuff they own).Trump does *not* primarily appeal to, for example, renters working at Amazon fulfillment centers. Or Walmart employees. Or other such people whose income comes *entirely* from their paychecks rather than anything they own/investments/rental income. And to the extent he does have support among these groups, he gets it not by appealing to their economic circumstances, but rather to their bigotry.So in order to do what you're describing you kind of first need to reclaim the language you need to even make the case. Because right now the popular story is that Trump is the candidate of the \\"forgotten working class\\" and the Dems are the party of Wall Street. This is not at all the case, but the *actual* \\"forgotten working class\\" is so forgotten that neither party nor media even really remembers they exist. They don't even talk to Amazon fulfillment workers or other such people. To them, the \\"working class\\" are boomer homeowners, not poor renters.And so long as that is the case, you won't be able to leverage the strength of progressive politics , because you'll still be chasing elite owners (some of whom don't think of themselves that way but absolutely are in material terms).","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Every time they open their mouths they lie.","title":"Republicans stood behind Obama when he won?!

Senators in swing states, especially those not re-elected in this cycle like Ossoff and Warnock. Senators without a full term under their belt like Lujn and Padilla fall into the same grouping.

But I dont see much enthusiasm among the Democrats base for this approach. Am I wrong? Can anyone change my view?It comes down to your fundamental understanding of how elections are actually won. The Republican Party - who have created their own information ecosystem - have a theory that *mobilizing voters that are likely to vote for me and suppress those who are unlikely to vote for me* is how you win. So, that means their strategy to do so is a ton of negative partisanship. All the time. Outrage. We know that it works because they win. For instance, in the 2010s, they put $30m into state legislative races and bombed Dems out of the office via negative partisanship. What did was they won a majority of the 107 local races they entered in 16 states and let them draw really favorable congressional district maps. People talk in narrative form about politics \\"The Tea Party rose because Obama did X\\" or \\"Dems messaging was X\\" - in reality the Dems in 2012 got 1.3m more congressional district votes and lost the chamber because of how the maps were made. Sometimes narrative doesn't really matter as much as we think it does. Mobilization is what matters. Lastly - I wanted to touch on your assumption that \\"progressives\\" are the Democratic base. The progressive left is one of the smallest parts of the coalition.

But your thesis for why Harris lost was because she was \\"too left\\" just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. She was campaigning with Liz Cheney for god's sake. Why she lost is because they didn't run enough ads that were negative partisanship in nature.

It's hard thing to defeat because they will rally their voters no matter what, whereas the Democrats more so just need the economy and living standards to be good enough (if they are incumbents) or bad enough (if they are the opposition) for the outer circles of their big tent to show up to vote. Having better candidates and better campaigns obviously helps a lot, but tbh I think the Dems were fucked no matter what this election cycle. Unless they had a truly charismatic politician like Obama, they had no chance, and there is nobody in the Democratic party who was up to the task. The Dems could have done everything you suggested and they still would have lost tbh. I think it's really just a perfect storm between the state of the economy, social media, and an extremely talented populist con artist like Trump. The Republicans are going to get substantially less powerful once Trump is retired, their whole dynamic crumbles without the cult leader.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"Media sucks, omg Biden pardoned his only living son, how could he, whaaaa whaaa wha, oh Trump pillaged an entire town and burned it t the ground, who cares.","title":"Joe Bidens Pardon Is a Stunning Act of Hypocrisy | By granting immunity to his son Hunter, the president has contradicted his values and reinforced the rights cynical theory of power."},{"text":"If hunter was a private citizen, would there be as much vigor to specifically charge him.Yes or no?If he was targeted just to get back at Biden and wouldn't have been charged if he wasn't biden's son, the goal seems to not be justice but to attack Biden.","title":"CMV: The statement about Hunter Biden's pardon will be a stain on Biden's legacy, deservedly so."},{"text":"Youre misreading my post.

But when you think about it, thats obviously not true. If most Americans were unabashed racists, misogynists, and homophobes, Obama would not have been elected, Hillary Clinton would not have won the popular vote in 2016, and we wouldnt have seen incredible gains in LGBTQ acceptance over the last 20C30 years.Look, I don't think the American electorate at large is *driven* by bigotry and animus - they're not joining the Klan in droves or anything - but I think it's a stronger undercurrent than many people are willing to admit. Specifically, I think it informs a lot of resentment over perceived loss of status within larger society, which is a big contributor of the \\"divide\\" with the working class folks. My dad is not an ardent racist by any means, but he also does not consider non-white folks as part of his \\"community\\" or \\"class\\" and he's definitely reachable by people like Trump, who play a lot on his sense that everything is going to shit and that \\"real Americans\\" are the ones paying for it.

The idea that liberals are out of touch as some truth to it, I'll readily admit, but it's not an issue with Democrat-messaging so much as with people existing. Folks for on Twitter and cross paths with a few overbearing activists and that colours their overall read of the political landscape, to the point where pretty milquetoast democrats are hard-core gender communists. It's not enough to try and get a working-class mascot, I don't think, when people are both mobilized and interested in being mobilized by fringe social issues. Because politicians do speak in \\"voter-level\\" words, all the time. ?Trump got a lot of criticism for putting on a McDonalds apron, sitting in a garbage truck, and appearing on Joe Rogans show.

If someone like Kamala Harris went a put on a Burger King apron, I doubt it would come across as endearing. It would come across as (rightfully) patronizing.

Racism and misogyny can't be ignored, either.Regardless of reasons, the election wasn't particularly close. Every state saw more Trump votes than Harris votes as compared to Trump v. Biden. Turnout was a big issue for Democrats; lots of guesses have been made as to why.The hard spot for Democrats is that they are trying to be everything to everyone. They want Wall Street donors and Silicon Valley donors and unions and Main Street voters and activist organizers and civil rights supporters and celebrity validators, etc. I just don't think that's possible in this political climate. For example, the DNC decided this cycle that it's staying pro-Israel. Fine, it's a strategic decision, I get it. But then they act surprised/angry when pro-Palestine voters go to Jill Stein (and some, inexplicably, went to Trump). They take money from the 1% but seem confused when they start losing unions.In contrast, Trump is very clear: he's against people who don't want the US to be a Christian nation, he's against undocumented migrants, he's against free trade, he's against federal employees, he's for an authoritarian police state. It's very clear where he stands.So for the DNC, I think it's less about \\"selling\\" and more about deciding: who are you for?

First Past the Post voting is what is getting us in this mess, its keeping the Democratic Party stagnant at this point and preventing parties that would actually listen to local issues from popping up. Our focus now should be on getting signatures, and bringing those signatures to our city councils to request change our voting systems locally. Then, do the same thing to get ballot initiatives going in each of our states.Frankly, we cant rely on change to come from the top at this point, we need grassroots organizing to bring positive change across the country by bringing forward legislation for alternative voting systems.Ranked Choice Voting really struggled at the national level this year, many states shot it down and Alaska only barely managed to hold onto their Ranked Choice Voting. To me, this indicates a strong need to start smaller and more local. Helping to switch the voting system for school board elections, city, and county elections first can help make people more comfortable with trying other voting systems. That doesnt mean to give up on trying to pushing our states to try an alternative voting system, but it does indicate people are likely more unfamiliar with the idea of it and are a bit resistant to just adopt a new system without trying it at all smaller scale.Time is of the essence, we have two years till midterms and there is a lot we can do until then to bolster this change. If we work hard, we can even get a coalition of smaller political parties from all across the political spectrum that would want to join this movement since its help their smaller parties to actually grow and be more representative as well. Hell, even the Green Party wouldnt be much of a spoiler party anymore if an alternative voting system was the standard.\\nIf you want to help the effort for change these are some resources:- [https://www.starvoting.org/campaigns](https://www.starvoting.org/campaigns)- [https://fairvote.org/get-involved/](https://fairvote.org/get-involved/)","title":"Senate Democrats reelect Chuck Schumer as the Democratic leader of Congress"},{"text":"Center-left.

Did they only happen at the end?EDIT: I asked ChatGPT to check:Between 2016 and 2021, the White House Press Corps addressed the topic of presidential pardons in various briefings and statements. Notably, during this period, President Donald Trump issued several high-profile pardons, including those for individuals like Michael Flynn and Roger Stone. These actions often prompted questions from the press regarding the criteria and rationale behind such decisions.For instance, on December 22, 2020, President Trump pardoned his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. This move led to inquiries about the justification for pardoning someone who had admitted to criminal conduct. Similarly, in July 2020, President Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone, a longtime associate, raising questions about the influence of personal relationships on the exercise of presidential pardon power.These instances highlight the complex and often contentious nature of presidential pardons, which continue to be a subject of significant discussion and scrutiny within the White House Press Corps.","title":"White House press secretary defends Hunter Biden pardon: 'Enough is enough'"},{"text":"Right out of the Russian troll playbook","title":"How Biden Changed His Mind on Pardoning Hunter: Time to End All of This.

That job is everything for him and a huge part of his self esteem and social support. I'm not sure his abilities would justify minimum wage. Its not a non profit, its a business, that's part of what makes him feel normal. I hope he can keep his job. I'm pretty sure the business already sees the arrangement as somewhat of a charity, I don't know what their financial limit is in the situation.","title":"Biden moves to end subminimum wages for people with disabilities"},{"text":"Trump was paying an ADULT pornstar to keep quiet about them having sex in a hotel room. Thats not against the law. Btw she broke the terms of that agreement. What was illegal, was that Trump tried to hide it. He still paid taxes on it on that money.  But because he intentionally labeled it as something else is why its against the law. He had Mike Cohen pay her $130,000. And was going to pay Cohen back.Youre comparing that to Hunter Bidens 6 tax evasions, which is currently at 1.4 million dollars 2016 to 2018. They still have not paid it. And they were not done investigating so it could be more than that.His 3 convictions of federal gun crimes. Hundreds of drug crimes and paying prostitutes, who have yet to be confirmed as being adults at the time. And including corruption: Hunter Biden was working in Ukraine for Burisma earning over 1 million dollars a year. For what? He isnt an expert at anything.  Burisma was being investigated until, then vice president, Joe Biden withheld 1 billion dollars in aid unless the prosecutor was fired. Guess what? He got fired. And you dont want that investigated? Youre comparing that corruption to Trump hiding paying off a porn Star?Just the drug crimes alone are bs. How many other people are in jail for the same crimes?","title":"President Biden set to issue a pardon of his son Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Not so.
