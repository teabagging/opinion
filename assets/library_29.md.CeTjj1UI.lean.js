It really all depends how Republicans plan to address the legal immigration problem and asylum courts, personally Im a proponent of vastly expanding the migrant worker visa program for agriculture and similar industries.Yes, a reasonable guest worker program would solve this problem.The Republican Party has opposed this for decades because it gives the workers legal rights. Rights to unionize, rights to have a safe work place, rights to get workers comp and sue their employers if things are unsafe, etc... They don't want that. The status quo benefits no one ... except business owners and major corporations. Amazing how that happens.... Stop promising citizenship like free candy to everyoneLiterally no one does this. Everyone knows the legal immigration system is broken on purpose and incredibly difficult for someone without connections to get through.The democrats tried to have a program where minors who were brought here as children (and thus had not committed a crime but were technically here illegally) could just not get deported and the Republicans fought it tooth and nail because it might someday possibly lead to a path to citizenship (it's still in the courts 10 years later).

Well, here are some relevant differences between Trump and Hitler just so you can stop catastrophizing:Hitler openly propounded a violent antisemitic ideology and wrote a book about it that he encouraged people to read. Trump, by contrast, doesn't avow hatred of any particular racial or ethnic group. We could argue over whether his many statements amount to racism or attacks on a particular ethnic group, but Trump would deny that that's what he intends. Hitler, by contrast, was an avowed antisemite and racist. If you accused him of these things, he would accept the accusation. Even if Trump is as racist as his most strident critics argue, it's nowhere near as violent or genocidal as Hitler's antisemitism.Trump was actually elected president twice according to the rules of the US political system. Hitler only received 33% in Germany's last free election (1932), and was made chancellor by two people who foolishly thought they were outsmarting him (perhaps analogous to establishment Republicans embracing Trump after he won the nomination). In subsequent elections, Hitler used violence and repression and eventually just banned other parties and won the right to rule by decree. Trump, by contrast, was elected more or less fair and square (we could quibble about the electoral college being unfair, but that's not really analogous to the ways that the March 1933 elections were unfair). Nobody was beat up for voting for Harris that I'm aware of.Trump avows the US constitution. Again, one could question his sincerity or interpretation of the constitution, but his official position is that it's good. The Nazis were one of many parties that ran against the Weimar constitution.Trump has stated that he plans to leave office in four years. Hitler never planned to leave office and stayed in power until Berlin was surrounded and killed himself rather than being removed from power.Hitler had a (bizarre, dark) vision for Germany. Trump has an incoherent set of unprioritized policies and is mostly fueled by resentments and a desire for attention.The US is a government where large majorities of people endorse its basic political system (its constitution, the way the branches of government interact) even if they are polarized and disagree over how the federal government should be run. Germans, by contrast, largely didn't like the political system they lived under during the Weimar Republic, which is why the Reichstag had a negative majority (a majority of seats were won by parties that were openly anti-constitutional).The majority of political parties in Weimar Germany were extremist parties. Some people supported the Nazis because they thought the alternative were the communists. In the US, the alternative to Republicans and Trump are the Democrats. While hardcore partisans sometimes pretend otherwise, no one thinks they're going to abolish capital and institute Leninism or Luxembourgism. If Trump is bad enough, voters will just swing the other way.","title":"RFK Jr. compared Trump to Hitler and praised descriptions of his supporters as Nazis"},{"text":"Every single educational metric has gone down significantly nationwide since the DOE was established.

And it's not unreasonable that you feel this way, but you are missing the most important step in fighting for civil rights; a winning strategy.There is always a risk of losing in war, whether it be political, economic, or violent. The only thing that matters is strategy, and strategy is defined by the moment we are in, not the moment we want to be. Unfortunately, the moment we are in is worse than what we thought we had. Sarah McBride is right, and I'm very glad to have her representing my country in it's government. We often need permission to not be white knights, because that is what the civil rights cause is; a refusal to accept anything less than the purity of equality and equitability. To let any unjust moment pass without correction feels like violation, but it needs to serve a winning overall strategy or else it is only a temporary relief. Having trans rights enshrined for 4 years will mean nothing if it's taken away permanently as soon as a reactionary politician takes the reigns. It is not a direct shot to the end, and no one knows this more than the gay and lesbian community who made the exact same sacrifice that is now being asked of the trans community. What they had to do to \\"earn\\" a spot at the table that was always rightfully theirs is unconscionable, but we are further along than we have ever been. The social progress we have made in 1 living generation is incredible, and we can continue that upward trajectory if we keep playing smart.Getting rid of bigotry is like getting rid of cancer. The cancer feeds off the host and makes it difficult to live and fight it at the same time. Cancer makes fighting it hurt. A lot. But it's worth the fight to see the other side. I'm not ready to give up and fade away on coping drugs yet. I still have fight in me, and a tolerance for pain.

Trump gets this out of the way early.3) establish a police state: Trump plans to deploy troops within the U.S. to conduct immigration raids and round up what he estimates to be 18 million people who would be placed in mass-detention camps while their fate is decided.And even though crime is actually down across the nation, Trump is citing an imaginary crime wave to justify sending troops into blue cities and states against the will of governors and mayors.4) Jail the opposition: \\nIn classic dictatorial fashion, Trump is now openly threatening to prosecute his opponents.TRUMP: if I happen to be president and I see somebody whos doing well and beating me very badly, I say, Go down and indict them. Theyd be out of business.And hes looking to remake the Justice Department into a tool for his personal vendettas.TRUMP: As we completely overhaul the federal Department of Justice and FBI, we will also launch sweeping civil rights investigations into Marxist local district attorneys.In the model of Hitler and Mussolini, Trump describes his opponents as subhuman5) get rid of the Free press: I would argue Fox News has already done this for him. They are an entertainment company masquerading as news honestly should be shot as traitors. Why do we get our news from billionaires? What could they possibly want with controlling our actual reality and how it's shaped? Maybe so they can keep us from realizing how bad and unfair the world has become and taking steps to mitigate that.\\nLook for the Trump pseudo-fascists to use the fascist playbook of their predecessors: * Fake Legality: They exploited laws and institutions to give their actions a veneer of legitimacy, while systematically dismantling democracy. * Brutal Force: The SA and SS terrorized opponents through violence and intimidation, creating an atmosphere of fear and silencing dissent. * Deceptive Moderation:  They presented themselves as the solution to chaos, masking their brutality as necessary for stability.\\nThis combination allowed the Nazis to quickly consolidate power and establish a totalitarian regime.","title":"CMV: America is Fascist and either doesn't know or care."},{"text":"Oh dear.

In all seriousness though, I have noticed very sparse moments of accountability while so much else has been excused- the dude held the House hostage 2 years ago and GOT THE NOMINATION to begin with after his misconduct was already known and reported on. Are there any particular thresholds that have traditionally led to Republicans actually rejecting or punishing their colleagues over the last eight years? And if so, Trump has never been even nicked by it- so why do Republicans do it at all if they are going to be abhorrent and allow tons of bullshit anyways?

So red states recieve large amounts of subsidies to maintain low costs for food in Metropolitan areas. If we didn't subsidize the absolute fuck out of farming and ranching, then having the density of cities we have today would be nearly impossible.Then also because so much of the area is dedicated to supporting these industries. They don't generate large amounts of wealth. Which makes these populations reliant on Medicaid for Healthcare. Then also many red states like MT for example have both tons of reservations and federal land. Which they cost a fuckload of money. And then because these people live in these areas, they get paid lower wages. Meaning when they dedicate their lives to supporting our public lands. They then become reliant on Medicaid and further the cycle. And before you mention Blue states that do have national parks and large habitat protection and farmland. Look at the election map by county. They are once again all red. Its just the urban centers that are Blue. And if you look at red states. Again the urban areas are blue.TLDR: There are no blue states. Its just states with higher Metropolitan % of their population. EDIT: Also remember that the 80% urban statistic is kinda.... misleading. The Metropolitain statistic is much better one. Its ~60% in cities over 50K pop.EDIT2: There are some states that break this. Florida, with its retiree population skews heavily rightward. And Texas with its cultural proclivities. But if you check % of population in Metropolitan areas vs which way the state voted?

Like your belief system cant be forced down the throats of those who do not hold those views, and the people who dont hold those views shouldnt have to pay tax on your beliefs. like if you believe that verbal proclamation, and that alone is what determines your gender, youre allowed to believe that, but you are not allowed to force everyone else to hold that view and you cant change rules and norms without the say of those who it affects as well. if they dont feel comfortable with someone of what they believe to be the opposite gender accessing their bathroom, a place they were never granted access to previously, well they have to have a say in this too. You, and your belief system do not hold supremacy to others and theirs, and or their lack there of.\\nI think if we started to think of all of this as boy doesnt equal blue and girl doesnt equal pink and that construct is just a dogma that we dont need to adhere to, for there is a spectrum of masculinity to femininity levels in both genders, but a boy who likes pink does not just equate to a girl either because of verbal proclamations. Many just dont and will never believe that verbal proclamations are what determine our gender. Again this can be believed by you if you wish to, but you cant force it down the throats of others and theres details in places of medicine and such that these pieces of information need to be understood. I mean reproduction alone we need to know what is male what is female because if those two ingredients dont come together, we get no more in the future. Changing language and the definitions to words to fit our biases is certainly not the right approach. we need to have a common shared reality where words mean the same things to describe the same stuff.

Historically, the left focused on class struggle, workers rights, and wealth redistributioncore elements of Marxist and socialist theory. However, with the rise of movements like civil rights, second-wave feminism, and LGBTQ+ activism, attention began to shift toward issues of identity and social justice.A key factor was the intellectual influence of postmodern and poststructuralist thinkers, such as Michel Foucault, who emphasized the role of culture, identity, and power structures beyond economic class. This challenged the dominance of traditional Marxist ideas and expanded the lefts focus to include various forms of systemic oppression.At the same time, the decline of organized labor in many Western countries weakened the traditional working-class base of the left. Union membership fell due to globalization, automation, and neoliberal economic policies, leaving a gap that was increasingly filled by identity-based activism. The rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s also contributed, as many left-leaning parties adapted to the dominant economic framework instead of opposing it outright, often deprioritizing economic redistribution.Critics of this shift (like me) argue that it diluted the lefts economic message, alienating traditional working-class voters and paving the way for the rise of right-wing populism.","title":"Republicans Target Social Sciences to Curb Ideas They Dont Like"},{"text":"I think The Stapler, Trump wouldnt want to upstaged in his orange-ness.","title":"Shocking New Details on Matt Gaetz Sexual Misconduct Probe Released Minutes Before He Withdrew From Nomination"},{"text":"That does not sound like his voice","title":"CNN has uncovered an audio in which RFK Jr scorched Trump and his supporters, calling them belligerent idiots,\\" \\"outright Nazis,\\" cowards,\\" and \\"bootlickers.\\""},{"text":"That sounds strangely, oddly familiar... .... .....

Graham: Last Wednesday, President-Elect Donald Trump shocked even his allies by nominating Representative Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Today, Gaetz has pulled out of consideration, one day after meeting with senators on Capitol Hill  The reason Gaetz withdrew is no secret and no surprise. Hes been shadowed for years by allegations of sex trafficking, paying for sex, drug use, and sex with an underage girl. Trump doesnt appear to have bothered to vet Gaetz in any serious way before nominating him, but all of this was known. The Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years but in 2023 decided against bringing charges; the House Ethics Committee was still probing him. Gaetz himself denies any wrongdoing. The fact that Gaetz, like Trump, has a personal vendetta against the Justice Department seemed to be his main credential for the job.When Gaetz was nominated, he also resigned from Congress. That froze the House Ethics Committee investigation, because he was no longer a member. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Gaetz ally albeit primly conservative where Gaetz is a libertine, opposed releasing the committees work, and the committee deadlocked in a vote. But Gaetzs victory was hardly complete. His nomination dislodged lots of damaging new information, including testimony about him twice having sex with a 17-year-old, though witnesses believed that Gaetz did not know she was underage. A lawyer for two women said they testified to the House that Gaetz had paid them for sex  The question is what this defeat portends for the rest of Trumps slate of outrageous nominees. The president-elect likes to take a gamble, even if he sometimes loses, but as I argued last week, the presence of so many unqualified picks might perversely make it easier for some of them to get throughafter all, the Senate cant reject them all, right?Gaetzs speedy exit shows that Senate Republicans arent willing to accept literally anyone Trump throws their way, and the fact that they were able to send that message so quickly suggests just how deep their reservations were. If the rejection is a sign of weakness for Trump, it is also one for his vice presidentCelect, Senator J. D. Vance. Vance was given the tough job of squiring Gaetz around Senate offices yesterday to drum up support, which obviously did not go well.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/X9ebU1ho](https://theatln.tc/X9ebU1ho)?","title":"Trumps First Defeat"},{"text":"tooSohes straight up admitting to an abuse of power.","title":"Trump demands Republicans kill bill that would protect journalists from government spying"},{"text":"So Democrats trying to keep a rapist away from power while Republicans refuse to just nominate not a rapist?","title":"GOP warns Gaetz hearings will be Kavanaugh on steroids"},{"text":"I agree, it is refreshing to see more people becoming aware of these things .","title":"Its all of them!"},{"text":"My first thought was MTG, but she just has very dominant neanderthal genesThis ban is stupid as hell and people need to mind their own business, let people shit in privacy please","title":"AOC slams Nancy Mace for 'endangering all women' with transgender bathroom ban"},{"text":"Well, unfortunately 10+ years of the same BS will naturally lead to exhaustion in most reasonable people.

This isnt about law and orderits about consolidating power through fear, targeting marginalized communities, and dismantling what little accountability still exists in our immigration system.Sanctuary cities dont just protect immigrantsthey protect everyone by ensuring that local governments can foster trust with communities, allowing people to report crimes and access basic services without fear. Stripping that away wont make us safer; itll just drive people further into the shadows, leaving us all more vulnerable. And lets be clear: this kind of policy is about creating scapegoats, not solutions.The Greed Lords and their lackeys like Trump use immigrants as a distraction while they loot the system and leave working people fighting over scraps. Policies like this are designed to stoke division, fear, and hate so we dont focus on the billionaires rigging the game against all of us.If this plan becomes reality, well see an even more militarized, authoritarian statewhere families are ripped apart, workers are exploited, and fear becomes a tool of governance. Its a nightmare vision for America, but its exactly what Trump and his enablers want: total control, no accountability, and the rich getting richer off the chaos.

Notably, 15 Democrats joined Republicans in supporting this legislation.?\\tBill Overview: H.R. 9495 allows the Treasury Secretary, a presidential appointee, to strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status by designating them as supporters of terrorism. This action could be taken without judicial oversight, raising concerns about potential misuse.?\\tBipartisan Support: While the bill primarily received Republican backing, 15 Democratic representatives also voted in favor.

There is a conscious disrespect of someone elses time and emotions for the sake of you not having to face rejecting them, generally. Thats the benefit.To tackle some of your points- Viewing something as being OK to do is not the same thing as it actually being OK to do.

Sure. You can also find elements of Biden and Obama's speech/acts that look fascist.Can you? Did Biden or Obama talk much about immigrants poisonning the blood of the country or stuff like that?  For example, an expansionist nature is pretty well baked into the original idea of fascism, and Trump very much isn't that. Depends what you mean by \\"well baked into\\". Of the three well realized fascist states (depending how you'd like to count them, I'm open to arguing about this), two were expansionist to some degree, with Nazi Germany being particularly aggressive, and one wasn't. I think it's more accurate to argue fascists think of political violence as empowering and necessary/positive for their rejuvenation project (the reconquest of their lost greatness) and I think Trump certainly fits that bill. He's not inclined to go to war, but he's certainly not against the use of political violence or repression.  It's hard for me to square the circle of Trump being fascist when he wants to downsize huge segments of the government. That just doesn't make any sense.I don't know why it's hard? All fascists regimes purged the state apparatus to some degree or other. Fascists are authoritarian - which generally implies a lot of state control - but they're not necessarily in favour of large administrative states, especially not large administrative states that are unlikely to further their immediate aims. It also remains to be seen what kind of cut Trump hopes to make. I'd be surprised if he limits his own policing powers, for instance.","title":"CMV: America is Fascist and either doesn't know or care."},{"text":"Literal clown behavior.

It combines elements of nationalism, militarism, economic self-sufficiency, and totalitarianism.Same thing with the US. Trump wants to pull war money out of Ukraine. He spoke about pulling US troops out of Afghanistan, and he's not bearing on sending troops into any conflicts any time soon.In fact, the US under Trump is less totalitarian than other parliamentarian countries like the UK, Japan, France, etc. where the executive branch has more power than the US executive branch.I'll give you that Trump is nationalistic (immigration), but ultranationalism needs a strong, active military, which isn't strictly true under Trump. He does not have the backing of the armed forces like any other Fascist leader in history nor any different from previous POTUSes. Before mentioning any regulation on women's bodies which is a sore subject, Trump is not keen on making a federal rule on this subject, rather allowing US states to choose their own rules and regulations on this subject. He could sign a national abortion bill if it passed his desk and has mentioned he was open to it.I understand that Trump acts like a firebrand which seems to be a strong authoritarian leader, but he is less of one than a president like FDR who was probably the closest president to being a true dictator, albeit beloved by many.This should sway you to change your mind about Trump being a totalitarian with the definition you've given and the examples I've provided. Any additional examples that would push him to seem more totalitarian would be no different than other presidents who have acted in similar ways.","title":"CMV: America is Fascist and either doesn't know or care."},{"text":"Did I time travel back to 2016?

Democrats *support* DEI and a general attitude of protecting minority groups, but we all should. Republicans have their voters convinced that DEI is *the only thing* Democrats support. It is not the beginning and end of their platform and never has been, but Republicans just say it is, so now we're in a world where that must be true.I don't understand how Democrats are supposed to conduct effective messaging when Republicans control the message and the American people just let them do it. Too many people *don't want* to be educated and informed, they want to continue believing the world works the way Fox News and their other propaganda sources tell them it does, because that fiction is infinitely more appealing than reality.30 to 40 percent of the country literally refuses to live in objective reality. How does the country continue functioning at this point? How do we move on from this? A blue wave in the midterms, if that's even possible with Republicans controlling all 3 branches, is not going to repair the damage, it's just going to temporarily stop the bleeding.Democrats can't win unless they run as Republican-lite, because their policies are whatever Fox News and their ilk say they are. Truth is irrelevant. Then the other media outlets reinforce this. They may not air the same lies, but they come in from the other direction and sanewash Republican bullshit. So the combined effect is that to the average uninformed voter, Democrats are depicted as being complete gibbering lunatics while Republicans are presented as the only \\"normal\\" people in the room. This is why calling Republicans \\"weird\\" worked as well as it did.If it weren't for the fact that states are ideologically subdivided along district lines, I'd fully support a \\"national divorce\\" at this point. Blue states are where all the nation's GDP and population are condensed, the red states would become even more third-world than some of them already are, and collectively fail as a nation. I'm just so tired of living in a country where we have to entertain the feelings and opinions of the gleefully ignorant as equally valid compared to science and facts. They've dragged us down into the mud with them and probably won't ever want to crawl back out of it. These people want to believe the president is a god and can magically fix the economy and control gas and grocery prices and that tariffs are going to make us all rich. Literally none of that is true, but worse still, the facts are the exact opposite of that. Instead of just the red states failing, now the entire country will. And even then, you'll have people blaming Biden and Harris and Democrats for it when Trump and Elon Musk burn our economy to the ground and gut our infrastructure. People like me who depend on social programs to survive will starve and die.I'm just so angry.

I share a lot of your same fears, but they're far from certainties. Here are a few important things to remember off the top of my head.First, incumbents across the word lost in response to COVID-related inflation. I agree that the election of Trump is troubling and he would be a fascist if he could, but this election was more likely a (wrongly placed) judgement against Biden/Harris for inflation rather than a condonement of Trump's fascist tendencies. Said another way, if the economy has been better, Trump probably would've been trounced.Second, the popular vote is slim and narrows day by day. I was also upset when Trump was up 16 mil votes on the day after election Day, but California's voting laws mean that votes are still coming in. As it stands right now, in terms of the popular vote, was the closest election since Bush/Gore in '00. That's far from a mandate from the people.Third, there are checks and balances. All of his cabinet picks still need to be confirmed which may be hard for some of his extreme picks. Matt Geatz just withdrew as AG due to his ethics investigation, I wonder how many others that have been in the news won't make it across the finish line.Last, Trump is only a would-be fascist insofar as it serves his narcissism. For example, on Jan 3, 2021, DOJ officials threatened a mass exodus over a memo written by a low level DOJ agent named Jeffrey Clark. Trump was about to do it anyway until he was convinced it would be a bad look for him. Someone who's committed to fascism as an ideology would've done it anyway, but Trump just uses fascist methods to serve himself.","title":"CMV: America is Fascist and either doesn't know or care."},{"text":"Yep, same.","title":"For everyone who gets banned on Reddit subs for supporting Trump, take screenshots and send them in bulk to this guy"},{"text":"to get deported once they get settled I just turn around and go home","title":"A massive caravan is trying to storm the border before Trump is in"},{"text":"[Theres just no way we can keep you on](https://youtu.be/BsjH4djb6sM?si=3ijC99pqlT-Uj4zR)","title":"Musk and Ramaswamy call for ending work-from-home for federal employees"},{"text":"Same here","title":"For everyone who gets banned on Reddit subs for supporting Trump, take screenshots and send them in bulk to this guy"},{"text":"Its a great flair for a great author.","title":"Trump AG pick Matt Gaetz says he's withdrawing"},{"text":"I can't find it but I remember a clip where she was startled and gave him some side eye.","title":"Merkel: I mistook Trump for someone completely normal | Angela Merkel"},{"text":"Yeah, Trump probably wanted someone he knew wouldn't prosecute child sex crimes as his AG.","title":"Seems Matt Gaetz Won't Be Investigating Joe Scarborough After All"},{"text":"Vought has been a busy little bee these past few years, crafting the executive orders and whatnot needed to make Project 2025 operational on Day 1.Centre for Climate Reporting - Undercover in Project 2025 ([Article](https://climate-reporting.org/undercover-in-project-2025/) | [Video](https://youtu.be/PY_chqyaRHo) 9:51)[Russel Vought]  is the founder and president of the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank he described to his hosts as the Death Star, which alongside the Heritage Foundation has been at the heart of Project 2025.Vought said he is overseeing the drafting of hundreds of executive orders, regulations and secretarial memos, to help make the US conservative movements radical goals a reality. These include plans for the largest deportation in history C a promise also made by Trump C and a proposal to use the military against US citizens to suppress large-scale protests in response. This will, Vought said, help to end multiculturalism in the United States.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.A key part of Project 2025s plans is to give the President more powers, removing the independence of agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI. Vought has dedicated his time to helping make this a reality if Trump wins in November.Eighty percent of my time is working on the plans of whats necessary to take control of these bureaucracies, Vought said, And we are working doggedly on that, whether its destroying their agencys notion of independence  theyre independent from the President  whether its bringing back concepts that ruled until Nixon of impoundment  the ability to not spend money  whether that is thinking through how the deportation would work. Those are all the things that we are working on predominantly right now.Vought, who told the undercover reporters he had a deep relationship with the Trump campaign, even dismissed his former bosss disavowal of Project 2025. He said his close relationship with Trump means that he can put these transition documents directly into his hands. There are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position were at, he said. The relationships will be there. The trust level will be there.Vought also pointed to the fact he was recently chosen as the policy director for the Republican National Conventions Platform Committee, as evidence of the Trump campaigns trust in him and his ideas.PBS - [Russell Vought, a Project 2025 architect, likely in line for high-ranking post if Trump wins 2nd term](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/russell-vought-a-project-2025-architect-likely-in-line-for-high-ranking-post-if-trump-wins-2nd-term)Those who know Vought described him as fiercely dedicated to Trumps cause, if not to the former president himself.A very determined warrior is how I would see Russ, said a former Trump administration official who worked with Vought in the White House and requested anonymity to speak candidly about him.

I don't agree with the tactic, but to think the goal is to dumb people down is pretty absurd.Secondly, individual liberty is cornerstone to the current right.  It's the reason for the focus on gun rights, free speach, religious liberty and individual choice for education, reduced taxation, fewer regulations and so on.  I hate Trump with a deep passion, and his cabinet is a dumpster fire burning any semblance of competency.  I think you conflate strategies and tactics as goals.

There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus Ill be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trumps DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.The withdrawal comes one day after?[Republicans on the committee blocked the release of a report on the investigation](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/20/nation/gaetz-house-ethics-trump-attorney-general-nominee/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link). Two women?[told the committee?](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/18/nation/two-women-matt-gaetz-paid-sex-lawyer-says/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)that Gaetz paid them for sex, and one of them testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl, according to an attorney for the women. While the committee failed to agree on the reports release, Gaetz was on Capitol Hill with Vice President-elect JD Vance, meeting with senators in an effort to shore up support for his nomination.The Justice Department investigated Gaetz over whether he violated federal sex trafficking laws by engaging in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. The investigation was closed without charges being brought against him.I remain fully committed to see that Donald J. Trump is the most successful President in history, Gaetz wrote. I will forever be honored that President Trump nominated me to lead the Department of Justice and Im certain he will Save America.Gaetz, who was first elected to the House in 2016, resigned from Congress the same day he was announced as Trumps choice to lead the Justice Department.In a statement on?[Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113522181118234752), Trump thanked Gaetz for his willingness to accept the position.I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect, Trump wrote.

If someone is screaming and throwing stuff around their house, there is danger, but its pretty minor, this can, and is, often ignored. I had a mentally ill person living in another part of my condo, and we only bothered her when we saw she was heating her unit with an open fire in the center of a room, which was not designed for that, and could potentially burn down the entire structure. Her not having a gun allowed the rest of us to give her the freedom to live life as she wished, and not take her meds, if she didn't want to, until it threatened the rest of us. Guns in the hands of the truly mentally ill force us to deal with them harshly, and either lock them up, or force them to leave.Now lets discuss the real issue, people that intentionally and knowingly hurt others with guns. We sometimes call this 'mental illness', but its really not. By calling mass shooters 'mentally ill', it conflates two issues. There are those that cant function in our society, and those that aggressively refuse to function in our society by the rules. Either way, it makes logical sense to take guns away from both groups, to avoid people getting hurt. The question is, would libertarians support this taking of gun rights, and WHOM should judge if someone is not mentally stable enough to own a gun, and WHOM should pay for this judgement ?

You can also find things that don't fit the mold.  For example, an expansionist nature is pretty well baked into the original idea of fascism, and Trump very much isn't that.

They can wait until they suddenly have a medical problem they can't afford, and all of a sudden Medicaid is telling them they are SOL.  That, or they have an elderly relative that needs medical help and care that they can't afford, and suddenly find out it's gone, so they have to make the choice of wiping out whatever assets and savings they have, or letting this relative die. They can wait until their own SNAP benefits run out and aren't replenished, or much lower than they used to be, and then sit there bewildered, thinking that it was only going to be about taking benefits away from minorities in big cities. All those on social security can suddenly be surprised when their checks are smaller, all because the administration probably will slash or cut payroll taxes to make it look like everyone has a tax break, not noticing that the money from those taxes are what fund social security. I wouldn't be surprised also if Mango Mussolini will try to get us into a war, only if it's going to benefit him personally. All of those Palestinians and Arabs that voted for him, thinking he could magically end the war in Gaza are now realizing that his idea of ending the war is getting rid of Islam and using the Gaza strip for resort property.I'm also not going to be surprised if by 2027 the price of eggs and gas are still high, because people don't seem to realize that companies are only going to lower prices if they have a surplus and can foresee a loss. These guys are skilled though in creating artificial scarcity to keep prices up. They are charging what people are willing to pay, and the only way you're going to possibly see things change is to stop driving and stop eating eggs for a long time. I'm sorry, but I don't have any more sympathy. 28% of the voting population willingly chose Trump, and around half the country stayed home. So 3/4 of the country are responsible for all of this. My heart goes out to the other 1/4, but I'm telling everybody to insulate yourselves and just let the chaos happen, let them make everybody's lives miserable so they finally and hopefully learn.","title":"Trump voters shrug off cabinet pick controversies"},{"text":"Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Don Jr. et al.","title":"Matt Gaetz withdraws as Trump's AG nominee"},{"text":"Why","title":"Donald Trump's Favorability Surges by Nearly 20 Points With Young Americans"},{"text":"He cant go after subreddit moderators","title":"For everyone who gets banned on Reddit subs for supporting Trump, take screenshots and send them in bulk to this guy"},{"text":"From this Congress yes, but the new one (which he won re-election for) hasnt begun yet.
