But countenancing something like Jan. 6th was a HUGE leap in the severity of that evolution, even if it was a logical step that was likely to happen at some point.It's alarming that people don't recognize there's a massive difference of degree here. In any democracy there will always be people who disagree with you that try to limit your political power. Doing that within the rules (however flawed they may be) is massively different than doing it via extralegal violence. It simply is. I'm 45 years old. I've been through a lot of elections at this point. 2020 was the first time there was actual violence as a result of one and this year will be the second. This isn't normal.As for what I want, it's for them to acknowledge what I just said - there will never be a democratic government you feel completely represented by 100% of the time, but the opposition beating you in an election is something we all have to accept sometimes while them using violence against you is not.

If we assume extreme political differentials between people we can make the two essentially incompatible for coexistence at every possible level. In fact if people are truly political opposites to one another this must be true. Coexistence becomes impossible. It approaches anti matter vs matter where for one's ethical beliefs to exist the others must not.When taken to such an extreme dichotomy destruction is the result. It is worse than neutrality. Worse than the worst enemy one has experienced. The suggestion that being friends with such a person is unimaginable. An inanimate object that is bound to destroy you such as a black hole would be a more reasonable choice in a friend. At least it would not be your enemy at every conceivable level.However, this hypothetical is detached from the real world. In the real world humans are evolutionarily promoted to be the most similar beings to one another relative to the entire universe. There is significant overlap in ethical and political rationale hardcoded in that biology. So, to a significant level, this idea of thorough opposition or complete opposites in ethical foundations can't exist. We just arbitrarily define that for ourselves at a certain point where coexistence becomes impossible and war seemingly inevitable for opposing ideological beliefs. But even for those people the similarity across them is tremendous, it's likely lost due to a fixation or a misconception rather than a thorough analysis of shared values and the pragmatic or even idealistic manner to actualize them. If those people were to acknowledge that more instead of their fixation or misconception than they could be friends.","title":"CMV: People on different sides of the political spectrum can't be friends"},{"text":"Thats hardly a secret weapon, its a badly needed correction.

For some, democracy itself no longer reliably serves to preserve the social order they want, leading to a to hell with it stance that enables voter suppression, distrust in elections, and restrictive policies.As for your mention of figures like Eminem or Sacha Baron Cohen, theyre not spokespeople for the Democratic party.

(Not accusing you of doing this) But I notice that this tends to be the default/go to answer from people that lean left.One example that Id use that hopefully will make free markets look more favorable is the example of insulin in the US. The reason why insulin is so expensive in the US is because of government. The government enforces and gives out insulin patents for three companies that control the majority of the market. The government also made it illegal to ship drugs across seas protecting these companies from both domestic and foreign competition.

Those individuals can be found all over the spectrum. As with your example of Destiny and Hasan, it happens often with people on the \\"same side\\", when one person is not as hardcore as another. It's not that they even disagree on a broad set of issues, it's that they've chosen to base the very foundation of who they are on some small sub-set, or even a single belief. Doing so makes life and relationships difficult, because opposing view points are then necessarily perceived as a direct threat to them as a person. To the essence of _who they are._ I have a number of great, enduring friendships with people who have wildly different political views specifically _because_ they are confident in their views, and do not tie their whole existence to... whatever their cause may be. They recognize that people and belief systems can be, and often are different. Be it by incremental degrees, or lightyears. But only those who's moral sense of self  is fully grounded is their political view(s) tend to assume others are built the same way. Most people are not. People have other interests, goals, philosophies, etc that make up who we are and as a result, find other's political views less important than everything _else_ that makes them who _they_ are. When you find those types, even when your politics don't align, you'll find they're pretty easy to get along with.

Identity, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is the distinguishing character or personality of an individual.When your character or personality becomes how you feel about certain political issues, it becomes quite difficult to form friendships, even if a friendship between two people may not be based upon or ever involve such issues.If we truly focus on our character and personality as individuals as it pertains to our perceived identities, rather than how we feel about one candidate or another, what taxes should be, what medical operations should and shouldnt be legal, what country or ethnic group should be supported in a foreign war, etc, then we can begin to return to a society that treats one another with respect and friendliness, rather than dismissiveness and divisiveness. Once we do that, I believe we will all be amazed at with whom we could call our friends.And please understand, I am not saying the above issues do not matter, just do not make them a facet of your identity or the basis of a friendship.","title":"CMV: People on different sides of the political spectrum can't be friends"},{"text":"It's wild for a \\"journalist\\" to have the opportunity to interview the Vice President and presidential nominee and to argue over the location.

Bush and granddaughter of former President George H.W. Bush, spent part of her weekend in Pennsylvania campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris with just days to go before the 2024 presidential election. \\"It was inspiring to join friends and meet voters with the Harris-Walz campaign in Pennsylvania this weekend,\\" Barbara, 42, shares in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday, Oct. 29. \\"Im hopeful they'll move our country forward and protect womens rights.\\" Barbaras Republican father served as president from 2001 to 2009. Her mother, former first lady Laura Bush, 77, broke with the partys stance in 2010 by saying she supports same-sex marriage and abortion. At the time, Laura said abortion should \\"remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons.\\" In March 2017, Barbara rallied for Planned Parenthood, speaking at a fundraiser for the womens health nonprofit. I am proud to stand with Planned Parenthood not only because women, regardless of where they are from, deserve to live dignified, healthy lives, [but]  because its a really good investment, she said at the event, according to The Texas Tribune. We know that when women are healthy, their families and their children are healthier, too. Barbara, now a mother of two, told PEOPLE in 2010 that she does not identify with either major political party, and has since been described as an independent. While Laura and George, 78, have not weighed in on the 2024 presidential election, Georges vice president Dick Cheney stunned the nation by sharing that he plans to vote for Harris.

He was a homophobe who was indifferent to the damage AIDS was causing in the gay community and he deserves to be eternally raked for that. I'm not defending him. I'm merely pointing out that him sucking horribly on AIDS was not the reason AIDS killed so many people. Even if he'd responded in the most humane, understanding, aggressively interventionist way possible and poured money into fighting HIV, it still would have killed huge numbers of people, because at the time it was, as I said, completely uncurable and invariably fatal, and for quite a while it wasn't even clear how it was transmitted. This is evidenced by the fact that it killed tons and tons of people elsewhere in the world where Reagan wasn't running the government, continued to kill people in the US even after he was no longer running the government there, and wasn't effectively stopped by public health interventions even in places where there were governments with better policies.I wish Reagan hadn't been an asshole, but him being an asshole didn't cause every problem that emerged while he was POTUS.

Every road crossing is a risk to your life. You are _never_ not in a situation that _could_ result in your death. For things like \\"self defense,\\" it's up to a jury of twelve to decide if a person was reasonably in fear of their life. It's done case by case.If birth or c-section are decided the best course of actions then the mother should be given the option of knowing the fate of the baby after the procedure or not.Kinda violates the medical ethics of informed consent. A patient can only reasonably consent to a procedure after they have been informed of the risks and likely outcomes.under no circumstances should the possibility of a healthy baby force a woman to make a certain choice. Its their health above all. No, being informed comes first. Cases where this is impossible (children, coma patients, the mentally impaired etc) are unfortunate inevitabilities, but the most important thing is that a patient know the nature and risks of a course of action before proceeding with it. What you're arguing for is some real Greg House type stuff. And the point of that show was that he was an _unethical_ doctor and everyone only put up with his objectively outrageous behaviour because he was just so damn good at his job. I think he literally did what you're describing in one episode.you could use the health of the mother to justify an abortion almost 100% of the time.I mean, sure. And you could use self defense in every murder case. It's just that most of the time, while the jury, being human, knows that every human poses a threat to you, that won't necessarily convince them that the threat was large enough to justify the response. The threat is there, we all know it. But it's up to a dozen strangers whether that threat was great enough to warrant the response. I would wager that those who are generally pro life but would permit a \\"lifesaver exception\\"  would implement a similar system, legally and probably just extend the legal defense of self defense to abortion.","title":"CMV: If your pro-life with an exception for when a mother life is at risk how do you determine when a womans life is at risk.

News companies are not mom-and-pop shops, they are multinational corporations with their own interests, owned by billionaires or investment firms with their own interests, that may or may not align with America's best interests. Who owns the news? Pick a news channel or social media platform and tell me who owns it. Is it Jeff Bezos or Warner Bros, in charge of globe spanning companies with factories in China and investors in Russia for whom the American market is a fraction of their total revenue? Maybe there is no majority owner, and it's owned piecemeal by large globe-spanning investment firms which own stock in foreign companies and are owned in part by foreign investors. Here's my point to you: this shit happens every day, that the spin a news source puts out is guided by the financial best interests of their corporate overlords whose interests only align with America's in proportion to how much of their assets are invested in American business - the system is fucked up, but how do you propose to change it? To get foreign influence out of American media, you'd need to mandate that American media must be wholly owned by Americans, and that those Americans cannot own any foreign assets or be beholden to any foreign investors.

The truth is that the MAJORITY of men (of course there are outliers, our population is over 300 million) don't mind voting for a female president. The issue we have is the double speaking. When asked a question, the answers are always vary vague and just repeats of the answers to the last question. For example:Q: \\"What is your plan with taxes?\\" \\nA: \\"I'm going to lower taxes for everybody\\" \\nQ: \\"How are you going to accomplish this?\\"\\nA: \\"I'm going to lower taxes and give less tax breaks to the rich\\"\\nQ: \\"But how are you going to accomplish this? And, wouldn't less tax breaks for the rich also hurt you?\\" \\nA: \\"I'm going to lower taxes, but increase taxes for the rich.\\" This seems to be about the standard prompt for basically all her answers.

They just have to separate their beliefs from their relationship, or at least be able to rationally discuss politics without getting 'barbaric' or whatever. The problem some friends have is that they've become so blinded by politics that they believe anyone who isn't on their side is their enemy, which ultimately breaks up the friendship.Basically, my point is that this is not a politics issue, this is a personality issue.

Because it sure isn't borne out by history--Islam's rapid and diverse spread among different cultures is a testament (pardon the use of Christian terminology) to the opposite--or the Qur'an--it explicitly addresses *all* mankind and makes clear that it is the final revelation, let alone that the the Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is a messenger to *all* mankind, and for that matter the Qur'an enjoins upon us that we were created to be from different nations and tribes--*i.e. cultures/communities*\\\\--so that we may get to know one another (to paraphrase). I don't think it gets much less insular than that. Islam is 'cosmopolitan' by design; obviously there is debate on the finer details, but the *non-*insularity of Islam has never been in doubt (any more so than some Christians have tried to reframe Christianity as insular).Muslims from different cultures might seem culturally/insularly similar from the outside, but there are two major problems with that: first, Indonesian (to pick a random Muslim country) Muslims tend to be distinguishable from (to take another few examples) Indian or Pakistani or Saudi Muslims, and let me tell you from first-hand experience that there is often acrimony borne of culture clashes (as a funny aside my dad says a good rule of thumb for Hajj/Umrah, if you're not sure what to do, is to follow Indonesian Muslim groups--there's a lot of organized Indonesian groups conducting pilgrimages, those I saw while in Makkah for Umrah a couple months ago had standardized colour-coded scarves and luggage and everything).While I don't expect non-Muslims or people who are not already interested in Islam to accept this, there are several signs the Qur'an is demonstrably divine revelation, which I've never seen a satisfactory alternative for: 1. Until the end of his life the Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, remained illiterate--he never learned to read or write, nor did he ever display a particular talent for poetry--and for that matter there has never been evidence of a \\"cowriter\\" (\\"\\" used since it was not formally transcribed in a single collected volume \\\\[different parts had been privately transcribed by Muslims for personal reference, etc.\\\\] until after his passing, more on that in point 3). This is important because the Qur'an makes repeated reference to both the Torah and Bible, references which have been consistently corroborated by Jewish and Christian scholars, yet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, never read either book(s) or heard them recited and still made such accurate reference to them.2. Poetry was the \\"cultural currency\\" of the Arabs; it is well-established that they were extremely proficient in, and proud of, their mastery of their language. The Qur'an directly challenges them to bring something comparable to the Qur'an in its linguistic complexity and beauty; when they failed to do so, it was reduced to a surah, and after that an ayah. They still failed. To this day nobody has succeeded in even the smallest of those challenges (and again, I am specifically referring to the Arabic because translations are a human endeavour). Are we to believe that Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, successfully composed a text, *while illiterate and over two decades*, which no master of Arabic poetry at the time or in any age since has been able to match?2A. For that matter no human being has ever composed a work, in parts over 2 decades, *without editing the content*, and kept it all consistent throughout. Heck, we have trouble remaining consistent within something we write in the span of an hour.3. Lastly (I need to stop somewhere), the Qur'an has not been changed since its revelation: the person charged with formally transcribing it by Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him (the first of the four 'Rashidun' caliphs), Zayd ibn Thabit, verified *every single letter* from what amounted to hundreds of 'fragments' of transcription, and those who had memorized it by heart. Not one of the remaining companions of Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, objected to the final compilation's authenticity. There are 10 authentic Qira'at--broadly speaking, forms of recitation and everything coming with that--all of which originate from the time of revelation. No other religion with a text at least 1500 years old (yes I'm aware the Islamic calendar has not reached 1500 yet, but it's close enough for rhetorical purposes) even comes close to that rigorous level of continuity in the text, much less for the entirety of the span since the revelation.  \\nI hope this was helpful.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"Lol fuck!

Their position is obviously still not on par with most modern societies, but they're not calling for anyone to be killed over what they do in the bedroom and with who. The topic has been settled for some time now.Hell is the punishment now, which isn't much of a deterrent. i don't see why anyone who doesn't believe in it would care. But what people always ignore when saying this is still a hateful stance is the fact that these people desperately don't want to see you go to hell. Hence why they're begging who they deem sinners to repent.It's undeniable that this is still an intolerant position, and it's clearly not in line with modern values. However, in their own, bizarre way, they are sending a message of love, not hate. They're not threatening people with hell, but warning people and wanting to save them from it. Being willing to forgive someone for committing what they consider sins is not a hateful position. Wanting to forgive them is a compassionate position. There's too much whataboutism and bothsides responses when reasonable questions are asked of specific religions. The mental gymnastics people perform to avoid contradicting their other progressive stances is crazy, and needs to stop. Not all religions are equal, some have had longer to evolve whereas others remained in the dark ages for too long.

There is a difference between voting together with people we disagree with, and intentionally ignoring the massive flaws and outright crimes of someone like Bush. It also massively alienates people to the left of the Democrats that otherwise would be likely to vote Harris if the administration would stop selling weapons to Israel, but instead those voters are ignored, in favour of trying to wring an endorsement out of the least popular president in almost 100 years before Trump. It's a week until the election, and Bush has been silent. That speaks volumes about his integrity, and it's doubtful that he'd have a change of heart now.","title":"George W. Bush's daughter announces surprising endorsement of Kamala Harris"},{"text":"This is what I don't agree with. Harm reduction is not a valid principle because it justifies maintenance of the status quo and doesn't address core issues. Lesser evil voting has been what the Democrats have run on for decades, and instead of punishing them for that tactic, progressive and center/center left voters have contined to fall into that trap and the democratic party has taken their votes for granted in response.In a world where the objective reality is that one of the two major party candidates *will* win the election, because there is no other possibility, then yes harm reduction is absolutely valid.  It's not always *needed*, in which case sitting out the vote can indeed be the least harmful position to take.  However I'd challenge you to argue a position that not performing harm reduction in this year's election is the more pragmatic choice than voting for Harris.Fully *half* of the electorate sits out nearly every election.  And it does absolutely nothing to move the political needle.  This is empirical evidence that demonstrates that choosing to not participate in the voting process, does not have a measurable effect as a protest action.  That's indisputable in my view, though I'd welcome any argument to the contrary.Now one might say, if their policies were different then maybe some percentage of those voters would indeed choose to come out and vote for Democrats, and one would likely be correct.  I would argue however that it's too much of a variable when taken against the possible losses of people who are currently active voters who would feel, as you do, that they're disenfranchised by the Party.  Pandering (terrible word choice for this I admit, but nothing else comes to mind) to unreliable voters at the possible expense of reliable voters, is not a winning strategy unless you have the wiggle room to play the odds.In this case, we don't.  Donald Trump is an *existential threat* to the United States, and must be defeated at the ballot, full stop.Ultimately the problem is not the Democratic Party failing to woo leftist voters.  The problem is the voting system that would make such a scenario even necessary.  Leftists and progressives should be able to have a political party that directly represents their policy interests and legislative goals, I'll never disagree with that sentiment.  But until that voting system is changed to facilitate third-party viability, *this is reality*.  You can choose to participate in it and affect at least *some* change, or you can choose to sit things out and hope something else happens, in full denial of the objective fact that doing so *never moves the needle*.","title":"Urging Vote for Harris, Sanders Warns 'Trump and His Right-Wing Friends Are Worse' on Gaza | \\n\\"Many of you have differences of opinion with Kamala Harris on Gazaso do I,\\" said Sen.

And to put it in perspective, a woman is more likely to die in pregnancy/childbirth/postpartum than a car crash in a given year. Pregnancy increases risk of death DRAMATICALLY over baseline. 3 in 10,000 seems small but if you frame it like pregnancy and childbirth increase your risk of dying by 50%, that is substantially higher. That doesnt include the 35% increased risk of homicide during pregnancy. It also is only the average. Poor and minority women face much higher risks than wealthier and/or white women.Prior to modern medicine every single pregnancy had about a 2% risk of death. Because of how many children women usually had, 1 in 20 women died from pregnancy/childbirth. Not 1 in 20 who were pregnant/giving birth. 5% of the entire population of women.

This is the largest annual state allocation under the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program and is funded from the once-in-a-generation investment of $11.3 billion in AML funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.Communities once powered by the coal industry are now polluted by abandoned mine lands, which leach toxic discharge into lands and waterways, cause land subsidence and structural issues, and fuel underground mine fires. This funding will ensure that coal communities are not left behind, but rather are revitalized by the jobs created for displaced coal workers, economic opportunity, and clean air and water provided by these cleanup projects.  \\n...  \\nFunding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is expected to address nearly all of the currently inventoried abandoned coal mine lands in the nation, which will help communities address and eliminate dangerous conditions and pollution caused by historic coal mining.  \\n...  \\nTodays announcement builds on more than $489.7 million from President Bidens Investing in America agenda allocated to Pennsylvania for AML reclamation in fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Funding will be awarded to additional eligible states on a rolling basis as they apply.  AML reclamation supports jobs in coal communities by investing in projects that close dangerous mine shafts, reclaim unstable slopes, improve water quality by treating acid mine drainage, and restore water supplies damaged by mining. Awards can also enable economic revitalization by reclaiming hazardous land for recreational facilities and other redevelopment, such as advanced manufacturing and renewable energy deployment. As directed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, funding will prioritize projects that employ current and former employees of the coal industry.? This funding is a part of the Biden-Harris administrations unprecedented investments in communities and workers to support an equitable transition to a sustainable economy and healthier environment after the closure of mines or power plants. This effort also advances the Presidents?Justice40 Initiative?that sets a goal to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Additionally, reclaiming abandoned coal mines is a pillar of the?Biden-Harris administrations Methane Action Plan, which includes historic efforts to reduce methane emissionsone of the biggest drivers of climate changewhile creating good-paying jobs and promoting American innovation.Statement from Secretary Deb Haaland:Thanks to President Bidens Investing in America agenda, we have an extraordinary opportunity to address nearly all of the documented abandoned mine land hazards across the nation, said Secretary Deb Haaland. These historic resources are helping the Interior Department address long-standing environmental damage, clean up hazardous sites, create good-paying jobs, and help reinvigorate former coal communities.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces More Than $244 Million to Address Legacy Pollution, Revitalize Communities in Pennsylvania Through Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"Michael Steele was the *head* of the RNC and supports Harris.","title":"I was the director of the Michigan Republican Party.

A divided country is much easier to manipulate and control. Lets be realistic for a minute here theres no difference between these two parties. No matter who you vote for the outcome will be the same. Each party is accusing the other of what they are complicit and guilty of. The only real difference between these two candidates running for president is simple, if Kamala wins itll be a slower paced descent into a NWO and itll be a much faster ride if Trump is elected.

The respect that the President of the United States showed usand when he shows it to us he shows it to three million of our members across the United Stateswas nothing short of incredible. Five years later, McGarvey took the podium at a convention of the building-trades unions and offered up half an hour of ardent love for the Biden Administration. I asked McGarvey what happened. Trump, McGarvey said, never did anything he said he was going to do. He never did infrastructure. His National Labor Relations Board was laden with anti-labor ideologues. He never did pensions. Pretty much you name it. That first meeting was all the things he was going to do. And then we had four years of a knife fight in a phone booth. The Biden Administration, by contrast, had delivered every possible thing we could ever possibly ask for or imagine. There have been things they did for us that we wouldnt have had the chutzpah to ask for.

Non-voting members may vote in a House committee of which they are a member and introduce legislation.There are currently six non-voting members: a delegate representing the District of Columbia, a resident commissioner representing Puerto Rico, as well as one delegate for each of the other four permanently inhabited U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

And Trump taking office is inarguably a far greater harm for literally every aspect of life you can think of.This is what I don't agree with. Harm reduction is not a valid principle because it justifies maintenance of the status quo and doesn't address core issues. Lesser evil voting has been what the Democrats have run on for decades, and instead of punishing them for that tactic, progressive and center/center left voters have contined to fall into that trap and the democratic party has taken their votes for granted in response. This is why they always try to court right wing voters, because they think that they have left wing votes in the bag and no need to make their case for voting for them. That's how Hillary lost in 2016; and if Harris loses that'll be a reason why as well.

(often in a pretty horrific fashion but that is not the point of the discussion) - so by that definition, we need to spread out a couple of clarifying options:  \\n1.A - Most common use of the term \\"abortion\\" - termination of a 100% non-viable fetus/baby 1st and most 2nd trimester circumstances  \\n1.B - less common case - termination of a partially viable baby in very late 2nd or early 3rd trimester circumstances  \\n1.C - cases that should not be used (extreme cases only) - termination of a viable baby in mid-late 3rd trimester circumstances. 2. then we need to understand what \\"at risk\\" entails. because in the area of both medical and legal spheres being specific matters. So it must be a case of immediate or garenteed fatality to determine if the life of the mother is at risk. and from the \\"pro-life\\" side the \\"life of the mother\\" arguments are often as follows:  \\n2.A - non-viable start - medically not considered either abortion or even pregnancy cases. (a fertilized egg has implanted somewhere other than the uterus.) common case - ectopic pregnancy. these cases if left alone will 100% always kill both mother and fetus.  \\n2.B - mid-term complications - medically and legally not considered abortion but a miscarriage. some cases where the mother and fetus reject one another. causes vary but hemorrhaging may occur. once again if left alone both mother and fetus die.  \\n3.C - end or late-term complications - again not considered an abortion because it is at this point considered live birth. in a minority of cases the mother may develop medical conditions that may induce seizures or other life-threatening and immediate care is needed. most cases deliver a live baby and both mother and baby survive.  3. simply blanketing the entire argument as the mother is always at risk is a strawman. all life is risk. driving a car is a risk. playing sports is a risk. so painting with such a large brush will both obscure your primary concerns but also dull the argument as a whole.","title":"CMV: If your pro-life with an exception for when a mother life is at risk how do you determine when a womans life is at risk.

There, he helped craft expansive, ambitious spending packages, such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. In the process, he forged a close relationship with Biden, his principal adversary in the 2020 election, as the senator worked to include his legislative priorities in those bills. \\n \\n \\n Then, in 2023, Sanders took the helm of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, one of the chambers most influential panels, giving him the opportunity to chip away at his long-held and sweeping policy priorities related to health care. Sanders goal? To address the fact that, as he put it in the interview, in America we pay, in some cases, ten times more for the same exact drugs as people in other countries.\\n \\n \\n As Sanders, 83, seeks a fourth term in the Senate next week, its not his Republican opponent  government contractor and U.S. Army veteran Gerald Malloy  who poses the greatest threat. Indeed, Sanders has the highest home-state approval ratings of any U.S. senator, according to Morning Consult, and Vermont hasnt elected a Republican to Congress for nearly a quarter-century. \\n \\n \\n The real threat to Sanders influence lies outside the borders of Vermont  in Montana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  where Republican Senate victories could cost Democrats the chamber and Sanders his chairmanship. A Republican-controlled Senate could bring a quick stop to the momentum hes gained over the past decade. And a victory by former President Donald Trump, a Republican, would end his influence in the White House.","title":"As Bernie Sanders seeks a fourth term, his growing influence is threatened by national political headwinds"},{"text":"What appeals to me about Harris is that she isn't a fascist nutjob suffering from severe narcissistic personality disorder?","title":"What More Do You People Want from Kamala Harris?

Assuming most major powers are influencing elections, it would come down to who can enforce better. There are hundreds of reason from all different perspectives.

I believe every child of God deserves a shot here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and one of the best ways we can guarantee their success is making sure every child has a quality education,\\" Shapiro told Fox News in June 2023, late in the states budget process.The remarks preceded the Republican-controlled state Senates sudden passage of a budget deal that included $100 million in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for students in low-performing public districts.But once the budget reached the state House, Shapiro received hard pushback from the lower chambers new Democratic majority. In a politically embarrassing setback, Shapiro agreed to veto the voucher dollars in exchange for the rest of the plan's passage. That veto led to a nearly six-month budget impasse as state Senate Republicans claimed betrayal.In his February budget address this year, Shapiro called on the legislature to again consider vouchers, though a top Republican leader later accused him of being unwilling to use his bully pulpit to get such a program across the finish line.Now conservative groups bemoan his reluctant decision. They say he backtracked too. You call it a  negotiation, what it was is a concession to right wing ideology. Thats called having bad policy. You dont need to give in. And I guess teachers unions are just ungrateful idiots who dont know Easts best for public education?: On Wednesday, 28 education advocacy groups from across the country sent an open letter to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris arguing that it is essential that our President and Vice President be wholly committed to our nations public education system and willing to fight against school privatization in all its forms.What do you work for him or something?

The United States was founded under white supremacist capitalist ideals. Those were its building blocks and those facets of our society will never change.I don't disagree in general.  I would argue that those facets of society will *never* change, because I do hold out hope for the future.  I think it's possible it just will be a very slow transition.I think it's erroneous to claim that the Democratic party has always been a centrist party or center right party because it wasn't. Democrats used to advocate for the working class. They used to run on civil rights, womens' rights, and other progressive causes.I see your point with this, but I would argue the error is considering civil rights to be *progressive* in this sense.  Those are classic liberal principles, but in the US we were so regressive that they seemed progressive, in the same way that universal healthcare feels like leftism to the US populace today, rather than being a basic center-left principle.  I'll concede that basic worker protections were a progressive policy, however.It was sometime during the 80s that the party abandoned the working class for college educated professionals; and the party has been shifting more and more rightward as the Republican party tugs them along towards fascism.Neolibs got their birthing in the early 1970s after Nixon killed Bretton-Woods and ushered in the late-stage capitalist endgame we're in now.  It's been an unholy alliance between the Democratic Party and capitalism ever since, but the progressive push *has* been happening at a noticeable level within the last decade or so.  The election of openly progressive candidates in the House is evidence of this, as is their ability to force the party to the left on some legislature.  It's not where it needs to be, certainly not where anybody even remotely progressive *wants* it to be, but I think it's undeniable that it's there.But that doesn't change my original point, that the Democratic Party *is not* progressive, and so expecting it to be is folly.Now, the Democratic party could embrace leftist ideals and pull the country the other way; but they would have to resist/ignore the billions of dollars that are entangled within our political system to do so; and that's not likely going to happen. The reality is, the Democratic party is just the Republican party 4 years ago. Joe Biden ran on stopping Trump from building a border wall. Kamala Harris is now claiming that the border wall is a good idea and wants to sign a fascist xenophobic border bill giving more money to cops instead of addressing the root problems that cause immigration.This goes back to my original statement about there being a need for systemic change in voting and campaign finance before we can see any meaningful change.  I agree that money, especially in the quantities we're seeing in the last 3 general elections, is a fucking *problem*.  It needs dealt with, we need to eliminate private campaign finance *as a whole*.  We *need* RCV or STAR voting implemented nationwide, at least for Federal offices.I don't think the Democratic Party can effectively embrace Leftism and still remain a viable party at the moment.  I think that time is coming, but it's certainly not now.  We either need far, far more of the Gen Z voters (and Gen Alpha as they age in) to participate in voting, or there needs to be a serious decline in the number of Boomer/Gen X voters who have been steeped in anti-left propaganda for their entire lives.myself am not a democrat. In local and state elections I will usually vote democrat; and I have previously voted for democratic presidents in the nation election, but this current one I will not. And if Kamala Harris does not win, it will not be my fault or the fault of any other leftists or progressives that do not want to vote for her. It will be her fault and the fault of the democratic party for continuing a rightwing focus regarding their policy that they know is not popular and not moving the needle for them.Mathematically though yes, it *would* be partially your fault.  Harm reduction is a valid first principle.  Taking no action is a choice.  If you don't vote for Harris, it's zero net change in chance as you're not goign to alternately vote for Trump.  However if you *do* vote for her, then it's an affirmative action to *prevent* Trump from taking office.  And Trump taking office is inarguably a far greater harm for literally every aspect of life you can think of.","title":"Urging Vote for Harris, Sanders Warns 'Trump and His Right-Wing Friends Are Worse' on Gaza | \\n\\"Many of you have differences of opinion with Kamala Harris on Gazaso do I,\\" said Sen.

I live in Southeast Asia where I get to know are a fair number of Muslims from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. I wont pretend they are liberal by any western standards, but the differences between these Muslims vs the Muslims you may run into in English-speaking online communities is still shocking. For example, the Muslims from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have no qualms about women achieving higher education and going to work, they are ok with listening to music and taking out a mortgage. But if you listen to Muslims in the Anglo-sphere online, women going to university is suspect, women shouldnt work at all, you shouldnt listen to any music or draw any kind of living being nor animal, you cannot do anything that involves interest so no mortgage and honestly arguably no bank account, and so on. Anyway the reason for this, is that Muslims in Southeast Asia are told to defer to their local religious leaders for guidance, they have their own religious interpretations and mandates which may be in the Malay or Indonesian languages. But a ton of money and resources have been poured into English-based Islamic online educational resources by the oil-rich gulf nations of the Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia. So these resources reflect the ultra conservative school of thought known as Salafi islamism.  One of the main Salafi prominent online figures (think the Muslim version of Andrew Tate), Zafir Naik, uses English and leverages on online media spaces, he is very likely part of this Gulf-funded push into online spaces (he is at least commended and awarded by Gulf nation politicians). He is thus very popular among the English-speaking Muslim diaspora, but he is actually banned from coming to preach in Singapore because he is recognised as a hate figure. The Salafi school of thought is fundamentalist, but not in the sense that it has been around for thousands of years. It is a very conservative and very literal better safe than sorry interpretation of the scripture, but it is actually a fairly new school of thought, part of a modern Islamic revival and resurgence movement. This comment would go on too long if I delved deeper into which this revival movement occurred, but some factors include the increasing literacy rate in the Muslim world (you can just read the quran and hadiths yourself rather than relying on imams/preachers to tell you how to live your life islamically. Ironic but understandable that this can result in people interpreting the scripture very literally), geopolitical factors (conflict with the west in the current and past century triggering a kind of soul-searching that maybe we are suffering these conflicts because we have lost our way religiously + wanting to differentiate from the enemy of the west [an extreme violent example of this is the afghanisation and afghanistan-adjacent resistance movements getting more and more extreme in the evolution and offshoots, from al-Khidama to al-Qaeda to Taliban to ISIS] + opportunistic politicians leveraging on religion as control), and just gulf nations coming into a ton of money from oil so they can start spreading all this on a global scale. I actually wonder if in very recent years, the rise of the internet can be a key enabler, as the internet can give rise to monocultures and not necessarily always liberal progressive monocultures (an irreligious version of internet-enabled monoculture is that the slang among young Singaporeans is no longer based on our local creole, it is just Americanized internet slang same as what young people use in America). IMO the concerning thing is that, since it is so heavily promoted and funded to appeal to Muslims through English and via online means, it can easily radicalize young isolated Muslims in the west who may primarily get their religious knowledge from online rather than local religious leaders.Even for Muslims who are part of existing local communities, this well-funded global Salafi push has its effects e.g. in return for getting funds to rebuild after their earthquakes, the Maldives ended up with a huge uptick in Salafi schools and Salafi preachers in the past decade. In Malaysia, the hijab was actually uncommon a few decades ago but it is now ubiquitous. In Singapore and Malaysia, while the niqab is still treated as a rarity that is considered Arabic and you get kinda seen as weird for wearing it, there is an increasingly visible minority who partake in it (they are almost like fans of the Arabs, think the Muslim version of weeaboos/otakus).

In total, this round of funding will support 60 modernization projects for natural gas pipelines across 20 states.  \\n...  \\nSome of the grants awarded include:* $40 million to Philadelphia Gas Works to replace 20 miles of high-risk cast-iron pipe; combined with the previous funding, this grant is expected to save households an average of $250 on their energy bills.\\n* $15.7 million to the City of Richmond, Virginia, to upgrade natural gas mains throughout its service system with corrosion resistant materials and new technologies.\\n* $6.4 million to Toccoa Natural Gas, which serves ten communities in Georgia and two in North Carolina, to replace 9.3 miles of outdated gas service lines; grant funding is expected to save customers an average of $915 on their energy bills in the coming years. \\n* $6.4 million to Tallahassee, Florida, for major upgrades to the citys natural gas system, including replacing 49 miles of main and service lines made of high-density polyethylene pipe.\\n* $3.0 million to Sterling City, Texas, to replace 11 miles of higher risk bare steel pipe.The full list of awardees can be found here, which includes first-time recipients in Alaska, Montana Arizona, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.These awards are funded through the Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization grant program created by the Biden-Harris Administrations 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The law authorized a nearly $1 billion investment over five years to modernize community-owned natural gas distribution pipes, helping lower energy costs for ratepayers, reduce methane pollution, and keep communities safe from pipeline failures.This announcement brings the total amount awarded under the grant program to nearly $800 million across 227 projects in underserved rural and urban communities across 29 states since the program was created in 2022. Grant recipients are on track to repair, rehabilitate, or replace more than 1,000 miles of aging natural gas pipes and reduce nearly 1,000 metric tons of methane pollution, annually. The Biden-Harris Administrations Investing in America Agenda continues to grow the American economy from the bottom up and middle-out, not the top-down C from rebuilding our nations infrastructure, to creating a manufacturing and innovation boom powered by good-paying jobs that dont require a four-year degree, to building a clean-energy economy that will reduce costs for Americans and make our communities safer and more resilient.Funding these projects also advances the Biden-Harris Administrations U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, leveraging all available tools to reduce methane emissions while protecting public health, promoting U.S. innovation in new technologies, lowering energy costs for families by reducing inefficiency and waste, and supporting good-paying jobs for thousands of skilled workers across the country. Methane pollution has 80 times the global warming potential as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.Statement from U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg:Aging, leak-prone natural gas pipes can be dangerous, drive up energy costs for families, and harm the environment, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration is supporting funds to replace aging pipelines, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, were helping communities across the country carry out projects that will keep people safe while bringing down energy costs for hundreds of thousands of Americans.","title":"Investing In America: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $200 Million to Replace Aging Gas Pipes, Lower Household Energy Bills and Cut Methane Emissions"},{"text":"I'm the biggest stoner next to Snoop and I never forget to vote.

No one said other ideologies can't be extreme, but when you have an active extreme ideology, you have to point at the source that the extremism is coming from.Abrahamic religions are all too problematic than the average religion, but Christianity and Judaism or their followers have gone through reforms that Islam and Muslims simply had none of.Yes, societal and economic factors play a big role, but Nazism had societal and economic reasons too. The only way you can help the world is by acknowledging the problems of Nazism and their apparent source, and not saying if we solve Nazism, the problem is going to recreate itself in another form because of the deep societal reasons. The problem took certain form, and that's what we have to deal with.Being concerned about Islam doesn't contradict being sympathetic towards Muslims. Muslims are people who have many other features other than being Muslims. We can only be honest in order to prevent any damage that hasn't been done yet and have a chance for fixing the damage that has happened. By preventing further damage and any Islam-related instability in the West, you can give Muslim countries time to have reforms and at the same time keep an important part of the human civilization (the West) thriving, assuming other issues go well, which exports technology and science to the world, including Islamic countries, increasing the chances of prosperity, better education, and human rights.Yes, most traditional cultures (religious and non religious) have been hostile towards homosexuality, but they differ in terms of the extent of the hostility. You'd have an easier time discussing the issue in the modern era with a traditional Chinese than a conservative Christian or Muslim who can get furious or say, \\"God said so, and it's right here in the book.\\" Religion is just an additional, unnecessary barrier.I'm Egyptian and have a different interpretation of the history you mentioned and see the general scheme of the culture throughout all that period as not so bright. But there's no doubt there was a wave of Islamization that set us back. I think that's how it works; it comes in waves, and the culture is ready to absorb it. We have to be lucky once to keep progressing without a setback, which would allow the more permanent reforms. And again, the role of Islam in all of this is always negative; Muslims are different from Islam.So in summary, yes, most religions have terrible, outdated ideas. We're focusing on Islam because it's the one causing consequences today, not because we want to single it out. In practice, you're singling it out of normal criticism and pressure that's necessary for improvement.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"(the US has also done its fair share of interference in foreign elections/governments).Not just *has*, but actively *does*.

That's a nightmare scenario.The ideal case would involve something like a credible threat - e.g., Kamala wins the election but loses Michigan, the democrats \\"learn their lesson\\" and court Arab Americans more explicitly moving forward.  But that seems like too dangerous a game to play in this election. If withholding support results in a Trump presidency nobody learns their lesson and everyone is screwed.

The United States was founded under white supremacist capitalist ideals. Those were its building blocks and those facets of our society will never change. I think it's erroneous to claim that the Democratic party has always been a centrist party or center right party because it wasn't. Democrats used to advocate for the working class. They used to run on civil rights, womens' rights, and other progressive causes. It was sometime during the 80s that the party abandoned the working class for college educated professionals; and the party has been shifting more and more rightward as the Republican party tugs them along towards fascism. Now, the Democratic party could embrace leftist ideals and pull the country the other way; but they would have to resist/ignore the billions of dollars that are entangled within our political system to do so; and that's not likely going to happen. The reality is, the Democratic party is just the Republican party 4 years ago. Joe Biden ran on stopping Trump from building a border wall. Kamala Harris is now claiming that the border wall is a good idea and wants to sign a fascist xenophobic border bill giving more money to cops instead of addressing the root problems that cause immigration. I myself am not a democrat. In local and state elections I will usually vote democrat; and I have previously voted for democratic presidents in the nation election, but this current one I will not. And if Kamala Harris does not win, it will not be my fault or the fault of any other leftists or progressives that do not want to vote for her. It will be her fault and the fault of the democratic party for continuing a rightwing focus regarding their policy that they know is not popular and not moving the needle for them.","title":"Urging Vote for Harris, Sanders Warns 'Trump and His Right-Wing Friends Are Worse' on Gaza | \\n\\"Many of you have differences of opinion with Kamala Harris on Gazaso do I,\\" said Sen.

Now theyre taking him on tour."},{"text":"We, the people, are always working to build a better nation and world. One that recognizes and upholds our unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must find a way to work with one another again. Trump came to power because he has a unique talent for playing on fear, which has captivated the disaffected masses. His campaign message has *never* changed from 2015 to today: \\"Be afraid. America is in a dark place. The enemy is within. Only I can fix this.\\"This is plainly fascist rhetoric and I don't dispute that. It's also *fundamentally different* from the rhetoric and governing mindset of past Republican administrations. The power of fascism lies in weaponizing fear and using it to sow internal division. People who get sucked into it may be predisposed to it because they are driven by fear, but that doesn't mean they started out as fascists.Hitler and the NDSP didn't come to power in Weimar Germany through the people all believing in or espousing fascist ideology themselves in 1932; they were captured by fear. This was the crux of FDR's message when he warned the only thing we need fear is fear itself. Only when fascism was allowed to take root did people begin converting. But it was not a \\"natural outgrowth\\" of German conservatism, which was quite oppositional to the fascists. History aside, this isn't about being \\"America fuck yeah\\" jingoist. It's important to call out Republican policy failures as just that - policy failures that have hurt people and caused suffering. But to suggest that Trump \\"came from somewhere\\" and to suggest that place is half a century or more of conservatism, is just wrong. Conservatives love their country as much as anyone, but are driven by fear of losing a rose-tinted past instead of hoping for a better future. They have been captured by fascists that have successfully weaponized fear, and have risen to support them as a result. Goalposts are always moved in discussing conservatism, both by conservatives themselves and by non-conservatives. If the conservative mindset and philosophy was as much a problem in the past 40 years as it is today, then at what point was conservatism \\"okay enough\\"? When could you say \\"I'm okay with *this*  conservatism in my country\\"? You are in your right to say \\"never,\\" but doing so ignores reality and \\"others\\" half the country. Come what may next Tuesday, it's an inescapable fact that we will all wake up on Wednesday in a country where half its voters chose the \\"conservative\\" candidate. As a government and nation of the people, we can't pretend their voices don't matter. My message is about laying the foundation of changing the conservative mindset away from fascism. No democratic country is going to succeed under a one-party system, and it's unrealistic to expect  conservatism to simply wither and die out. If we are to succeed in preserving our democracy, we need to effect change within conservatism itself, so that our country can prosper and thrive as a whole. By presenting an alternative message that people of all kinds can rally around (as Democrats have done), and by othering fascists and separating them from conservatism writ large, we take affirmative steps to marginalizing fascists. When we label all conservatism as being \\"fascist or fascist-leaning\\" that's not going to serve us well. A house divided against itself cannot stand, in the immortal words of President Lincoln. We must excise the fascists, and embrace the wayward fellow Americans who need our help remembering our shared history of rejecting tyranny in the name of liberty.","title":"The Republican Party of My Father"},{"text":"So yes.

I suppose I couldn't really blame anyone for seeing the democratic party as an overall force of support for Israel, considering historical relations and the fact that the US is and remains, under Biden, one of Israel's main allies and weapons manufacturers. (69% of Israel's weapons are from the USA, under Biden! I assume this has more than a little to do with how these people see the democrats as supporting Israel.)As for the USA supporting Israel \\"because they support democratic values\\" and because \\"?it is the only Democracy in the Middle East\\". I highly, highly doubt that's the truth of the matter. Looking at it through the lens of realpolitik would, I argue, tell us that the USA is allied with Israel for much more cynical reasons of having a foothold in a region that's rich in ressources and strategic waterways, and one the USA has long had their eye on. And, historically, Israel mainly served as a foothold to hold back soviet influence in the region. If it were all about freedom and democracy, then the USA wouldn't have allied itself with authoritarian regimes over the years, or participated in overthrowing democratic regimes to the benefit of autocrats and dictators. I don't at all buy the premise that the USA aligns itself with Israel \\"because it's a democracy\\". Ressources, acquiring a geographic foothold and getting in on the potentially immensely important and lucrative Ben Gurion canal project? Much more likely. Democracy's got nothing to do with it, the USA's foreign policy has never been very concerned with that.","title":"cmv: If youre voting for Jill Stein youre a privileged person that has nothing to lose, and you dont care about Palestinians more than you care about your moral high ground"},{"text":" Well I disagree with your premise that its merely a religious conflict I know.Not sure what the Biden speech has to do with anythingWell, in the USA we just had an attempted coup last election.

Deontological ethics would find issue in the vote itself, not the implications, which would be utilitarian ethics. I'm a progressive and there are times when the deontological ethics of a thing have prevented me from doing that thing or supporting that thing. I'm just not a single issue tribalist. I'm also reasonable. I had said for years that if Democrats wanted my vote they had to do *something* authentic for progressive causes, like even just one thing. I didn't feel that Biden did, and I didn't vote for Biden. But Kamala has reached out to the left most certainly and I'm excited to vote for Kamala. Choosing Walz itself was a hand of offering to the left. She could have went with Shapiro. Plus you have the promise of legalizing cannabis federally. I don't even partake in THC right now, but that's definitely huge. Plus Kamala herself prosecuted big banks. That speaks to her heart and core. And as for Gaza she walked the tightrope pretty well at her campaign acceptance speech. It's the US and the US/Israel thing has to be supported for a candidate to have even the slightest chance at getting anywhere in the process. But she also said what has been happening to Palestinians is wrong and should end and said she thinks they should have self-autonomy. That's about as much as any candidate could say publicly in a speech and still have a chance at winning. But I've known a lot of people at the college age in my decade of teaching in higher education, and this Gen Z group seems full of people who want it all, immediately, and in ways that don't understand the current situation, current context, and overall process of accomplishing their goals. I was a protestor at that age too, and yeah we wanted a purely renewable energy grid and the end to all coal, but that was the war. The battles were things like getting places to divest in coal, getting a moratorium on mountaintop removal strip mining, working with individuals to show them their personal electric grid connections to coal and the effects of coal mining in Appalachia. Stuff like that. I once saw a group of students doing a protest on campus with a list of demands and one of the demands was for the college to hire all adjuncts as tenure track. It completely overlooked a core aspect of academia (TT is a research line and has a nationwide search, adjuncts are often local hires, often from a pool, and have no research requirement).So they have this deontological ethic \\"against genocide\\" but an expectation that ignores what's even possible or what steps need to happen before that one can take place. And I get part of that. I've quoted Dr King myself with his condemnation of white moderates. But what they are demanding is far beyond that. It would be like demanding a black president during the height of slavery, and refusing to vote for Abraham Lincoln because his campaign didn't choose a black running mate. Even a sprint has to be done one step at a time. Yes let's not take forever. Yes things are urgent now.But don't lose the battle because it wouldn't instantly win the war.Win the battles that you can, and then the next, and then the next. And before you know it you will have won the war.","title":"Urging Vote for Harris, Sanders Warns 'Trump and His Right-Wing Friends Are Worse' on Gaza | \\n\\"Many of you have differences of opinion with Kamala Harris on Gazaso do I,\\" said Sen.

It's only now that several Arab American groups have come out explicitly in support of Harris, and with similar reasoning. Bernie has been consistent in his criticism of Israeli atrocities in Gaza and his efforts to recognize Arab American voices/keep them in the lefty coalition.

They control every gathering place that has a substantial number of users in it. It seems they'll ignore small places with just a few people, but they've focused on where the larger numbers of people are.And they've co-opted and run all the socialist/communist communities of substantial size too. This is also at universities, those students who dress up like they're Lenin or something and end up advocating for real estate companies to be allowed to build without the usual permits, arguing that for example it leads to more housing units and this reduces living expenses for tenants. There's merit to that argument, but then you see the community input and why they have regulations in the first place, and can understand why there are development rules in the first place.But that doesn't matter to these cosplay communists who are actually Democrats. They just want to help deregulate so real estate developers can build for cheap, then sell and leave, not caring about impacts on the communities.The Democrats are running rampant across America, drunk with power, and just wrecking everything. People don't know how bad it really is. It's worse than people think.

Heck, historians can't even come to a consensus on how the renaissance period started in Italy. Sure, all my points are easily refuted (to some extent), but so are the arguments **for** them. It depends entirely on perspectives and the contexts etc.And do you think the Christians didn't?!?? Do you think it all went away due to the spread of Christianity? On the larger point no I don't, but discussion on the moral zeitgeist being independent of religion is well known.Well you brought up this ridiculous point (sorry but it kinda is).. However, that isn't to say Christians didn't do terrible things throughout the last 2000 years, **it was never really the point**.. And by the way, you never actually refuted it, instead you turned the argument around against Christianity. So yes I think you're right, humans don't have an inherently 'good' nature. Humans are simply a product of their time. Hunter gatherers were probably fiercely competitive, at least archeological evidence do suggest so.Anyways.. Since you only really addressed one out of my 7 I'll leave this at that.EDIT:   \\nFurther the protestant reformation was exactly part of the process I am talking about. It broke the power of the church. Protestantism is essentially the first flourishings of humanism, where human life started to be prioritised. That humans could be trusted to take the word of god without corrupting middlemen. That humans would be judged on their own merit rather than by how much they were subservient to the catholic church and how much they paid them.I forgot I just want to say we probably agree a lot more with each other than u think. I do share many of the same sentiments as u here.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"Nobody is posting this trash bro.","title":"Busted: The Inside Story Of How The Kamala Harris Campaign Manipulates Reddit (And Breaks The Rules) To Control The Platform"},{"text":"Nevada polling expert Jon Ralston has been sounding the alarm since Nevada early voting data has started coming in.

The moral majority and satanic panic were not core messages of GOP campaigns, they were minority influences. In the case of right-wing evangelicalism, the moral majority was less influential than Bush-era evangelical politics. That's because after the soviet union collapsed, they had fewer enemies to rely on.

They never represented all Americans, especially no LGBT folks dying of AIDS. And certainly not the black \\"welfare queens\\" they vilified even as rural whites took more welfare. Just racial hatemongering, same as its always been.That said, they at least did ostensibly believe in most of what you said. Reagan did offer amnesty to millions because he knew they were key to the American economy, for instance. The current GOP would rather start shooting than do that again, as just one example.Still, disingenuous as they often were I'd take them over the downright fascist MAGA types any day. Yet, we can't forget how the road that they paved inevitably led us here because it was *they* who got in bed with these crazies until the crazies got hold of the wheel. They knew they were making a deal with the devil, but considering both Nixon and Reagan betrayed their country (sabotaging peace talks, hostage talks, Iran-Contra), it's clear they always felt the ends justified the means in all things power and politics, and that dangerous way of thinking has only multiplied since.","title":"The Republican Party of My Father"},{"text":"Im just sayn, it worked","title":"Kamala Harris campaign to advertise on Las Vegas Sphere"},{"text":"Uhhh yes it definitely can lol.

The WoT was painted as a war of ontological good vs evil (see Axis of Evil).

After that, the MSM reaction was the WoT is not a war against Islam, dont antagonize Muslims. But for evangelicals in the U.S., this was a betrayal. 2001-2005 was a full indulgence of righteous anger, and yes, hate. Now that hate was being chided by the leaders as being wrongAnd I distinctly remember conservatives asking why Jesus didnt get the same protection in their Christian country. What was all the full-throated support for the war and its abuses for? I believe Evangelicals took that moment as the start of a betrayal that has never stopped, with Obamas election and the mainstream repudiation of their values adding to the resentment, and all of this building on decades of pre-existing hate until it erupted through the surface.Through Trump, hate is good.

Uruguay rejected allowing night time police raids, even with a court order.The political issue in Uruguay regarding nighttime police raids centers on a constitutional reform that was put to a vote in the recent elections held on October 27, 2024. This reform sought to allow police to conduct nighttime raids, which under the current Uruguayan Constitution are only permitted during the day, even with a court order. Election Outcome: Despite crime being a top issue, the Uruguayan electorate rejected this proposal. This decision indicates a preference for maintaining strong protections against potential police overreach, even in the face of security concerns. The rejection of the reform, with support just under 40%, shows that while there's a significant concern about crime, there's also a strong commitment to civil liberties and a skepticism towards policies perceived as \\"mano dura\\" or heavy-handed.\\nImplications: This outcome reflects Uruguay's unique political culture, where democratic values and civil liberties are highly regarded. Unlike other Latin American countries that might opt for tougher security measures, Uruguay's decision suggests a societal preference for addressing crime through means that do not compromise fundamental rights, aligning with historical trends where Uruguay has often chosen progressive paths in policy-making.","title":"Uruguay, one of Latin America's strongest democracies, heads to a runoff between two moderates"},{"text":"What is this bullshit?

Appointing Volcker and  letting him pursue his aggressive approach despite an election looming is without a doubt one of the most based things a president has ever done. I was focused more on fiscal policy though.   \\nJimmy Carter (and ofc volcker) rightfully deserve much of the credit for bringing inflation down.  \\nThe economic boom in the 80s however, were not the result of only deregulation, but also Reagan's incredibly business friendly tax policies, alongside increased expenditure on defense and infrastructure, DID have a definite effect on employment on economic growth.   \\nIt's pretty hard to deny that the economic recovery under Reagan [was well above the median in terms of recoveries](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2EEuMBPnGCpEW4kpN9XwRb-768-80.png.webp), what's also worth noting is that the highest tax rate was 70% when Reagan took office. Revenues *increased* from \\\\~$500b to \\\\~$900 billion. It's pretty obvious that the tax rate was well to the right of the revenue maximizing point, and cutting taxes was the pragmatic thing to do.Landslide yes, unprecedented, less so. Maybe not in terms of PV or total electoral votes, but 4000 votes from a 50 state landslide displays that Americans everywhere liked him a lot.The difference is the conservatives absolutely didnt see those tax cuts as a temporary fiscal stimulus, they wanted to drastically shrink the revenue and scope of government, and I think that ideology has had pernicious effects on the budget and outcomes we are still dealing with today.You could make the same argument against \\"tax and spend\\" liberals too. The looming debt is not only due to the trump tax cuts, but also Biden going ham with stimulus and subsidies and refusing to slow down despite the inflation spike. Democrats, at the same time dont offer any serious solution to the national debt. Simply raising taxes on the top 1% will not be the ultimate solution to the deficit ( [https://manhattan.institute/article/the-limits-of-taxing-the-rich](https://manhattan.institute/article/the-limits-of-taxing-the-rich) ) Without raising taxes on the middle class, or making Social security, medicare etc. financially self solvent, the debt can is only going to be kicked further down the road.ps- Most of the increase in revenue from a hypothetical hike in top rate taxes would sooner or later be consumed by the proposed expansions to medicare medicaid and all the other theoretical investments, subsidies, middle class tax cuts etc. you'll find in the 81 page policy book Harris put out.   \\nThat being said, somehow the GOP is even worse for the budget rn.  \\n All I'm saying is higher baseline revenues just arent possible without increasing taxes on people other than the wealthiest. Much of the welfare benefits derived might just get eaten up by tax hikes on the middle class. IMO, the budgetary policy from now should primarily be aimed at controlling the deficit, through both halts/tweaks/minor decreases in expenditure and meaningful increases in taxes.","title":"The Republican Party of My Father"},{"text":"Man, when the conservative bubble bursts and reality comes crashing into their echo chamber, gonna be bliss.","title":"100 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee Harris does brief news gaggles but hasn't held formal conference"},{"text":"Whats the point of a national poll these days?

That being said, if Kamala has lost people because of her positions on Palestine, it's more so her fault then the fault of the voters. That's how a democratic system works, no one candidate is entitled to any vote from the starting point. They have to work to earn them. If a candidate has failed to convince a voter, or a voter has found that candidate's positions on one particular subject (And I couldn't blame anyone for finding the democrats supportive of Israel...) repulsive, that is a failure on the candidate's part to convince that voter to vote for them, NOT a failure on the voter to support a candidate. This would imply the voter has a responsbility to support a candidate, that they OWE a candidate their support, which is a prospect I feel directly contradicts the idea of democracy. No candidate is owed votes.Are the democrats supportive of Israel? Yeah, it's part of their neoliberal-imperalist DNA. The USA, under either party, has been a long standing, enthusiastic ally of Israel. The USA is probably the Israeli government's most crucial ally. Are the republicans even MORE supportive of Israel?

Higher labor costs can lead to businesses raising prices for goods and services, which can disproportionately affect lower-income consumers. If wages go up but inflation rises at an even faster rate, are we really helping workers in the long run?Additionally, theres the risk that businesses might respond to labor shortages by automating more processes or outsourcing jobs. This could lead to job losses in the long term, which would negate the benefits of higher wages for many. Its a balancing actwhile some workers benefit in the short term, others could end up facing job insecurity as companies look to reduce their reliance on a smaller labor pool.Also, while its great that some sectors see wage increases, we need to consider that not all industries are equal. Some industries, especially those that are already struggling, might not be able to sustain higher wages without making significant cuts elsewhere. This could lead to a vicious cycle where businesses close or downsize, resulting in fewer jobs overall.Lastly, let's not forget that labor shortages often come with their own set of challenges, like increased workload and stress for the remaining employees. If businesses can't hire enough staff, that can lead to burnout and higher turnover, which might counteract some of the benefits you mentioned.So while I agree that there are positives to labor shortages, its crucial to consider the potential downsides that could arise for both workers and the economy as a whole. Its not just about supply and demand; its about how those dynamics affect the entire labor ecosystem.","title":"CMV: Labour 'shortages' are a good thing"},{"text":"China been out here destroying and re-educating the Uyghurs while we're sending them gobs of money for their sweatshop-made shit and not one of them is whinging as hard as they are for Palestine.","title":"Bernie Sanders: Vote Harris because Gaza is not the only issue"},{"text":"So who are they nazi'ing against?","title":"MSNBC is actively claiming Donald Trumps Madison Square Garden rally was a Nazi reunion and shared footage of the 1939 Nazi event."},{"text":"How many millions of people do you think should not be part of the country and you want to die??

The rise of emotional manipulation and personal attacks during election campaigns can certainly create frustration and disillusionment among voters. However, while it might seem like disengagement is a rational response, I believe that a proactive approach to politics is essential for preserving our democratic values.1. **Recognizing the Role of Voter Engagement:** Rather than alienating people from politics, we should focus on ways to make political discourse more accessible and engaging. Educational initiatives can help demystify political processes, making it easier for citizens to understand policies and the implications of their votes. Voter education programs that prioritize factual information over emotional rhetoric can empower people to make informed choices and engage in discussions about the issues that matter to them.\\n2. **Encouraging Civil Discourse:** The tone of political conversation can indeed be discouraging, but promoting civil discourse is vital. Initiatives that encourage dialoguelike community forums, town hall meetings, and debate workshopscan foster an environment where people feel comfortable discussing their views and learning from others. This could help bridge the gap between single-issue politics and broader civic engagement.\\n3. **Political Responsibility:** Its crucial for politicians to be held accountable for their communication styles. Voters can demand transparency and clarity from candidates by prioritizing those who engage in substantive discussions about policy rather than resorting to personal attacks. Supporting candidates who focus on constructive dialogue and evidence-based policies can reshape the political landscape.\\n4. **The Power of Collective Action:** When people feel disenchanted, its easy to withdraw from the political process, but history shows us that collective action can lead to meaningful change. Movements that advocate for voter rights, campaign finance reform, and greater accountability can combat the trends of emotional manipulation and alienation. Grassroots activism has the potential to reshape political dynamics and bring about a more participatory democracy.\\n5. **Learning from Other Democracies:** Instead of fearing that we might become apolitical like some authoritarian regimes, we should actively work to strengthen our democratic institutions. Many democratic nations face similar challenges, yet they have implemented reforms to enhance civic engagement, such as mandatory civic education in schools or more inclusive electoral processes. Learning from their experiences can inspire us to innovate our approach to politics.While its easy to feel frustrated by the current state of political affairs, a focus on engagement, education, and accountability can lead us back to a vibrant democracy where citizens feel empowered to participate. By taking these steps, we can resist the apathy that threatens our democratic values and ensure that politics remains a relevant and impactful part of our lives.","title":"CMV: The alienation of politics from the minds of regular people moves democratic countries closer to autocratic rule."},{"text":"Nothing ever happens.

Why? You said that in the 50's and 60's, there was the civil rights movement. You are correct. The ideas that the civil rights movement have pushed... BECAME THE DOMINIATE social standard. We now incorporated it into our everyday society, for the most part, notwithstanding the eternal vigilance needed to keep something like democracy going. But we didn't narrow our diversity of stances. We, or at least most of us, accepted them. We expanded them to gay rights, which happened after the time period you claim was the height. But there was also disability movements, neurodiversity movements, [CENSORED] rights, and just tons and tons more. Why are you hung up on leaders? Do you believe in the [Great Man Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) or something? That's hogwash. Nobody is 'born great'.

I still do think the tax cuts in 1981 did more good than harm.I mean I strongly disagree, but I think the US would  see aggregate welfare benefits from a baseline of higher taxes and spending. To me the optimal basis for (temporary) expansionary fiscal policy would be from a higher revenue baseline. The difference is the conservatives absolutely didnt see those tax cuts as a temporary fiscal stimulus, they wanted to drastically shrink the revenue and scope of government, and I think that ideology has had pernicious effects on the budget and outcomes we are still dealing with today.","title":"The Republican Party of My Father"},{"text":"Mankind","title":"WWE Legend Mick Foley Pounds Douche Bag Trump, Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Mankind pulling through again &lt;3","title":"WWE Legend Mick Foley Pounds Douche Bag Trump, Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I always say that I put about as much stock in them as tarot cards.

One of the two pro-genocide candidates is going to win, regardless of my vote and the Palestinians are entirely screwed.  However what you're flippantly referring to as \\"caring about my moral high ground\\" is what I call having a basic degree of morality which constricts my actions.  It is impossible for me to support something I perceive as absolute evil, regardless of other considerations.  I would never choose between two pro slavery candidates, two pro pedophilia candidates, two pro rape candidates, or two pro genocide candidates.  If you don't have that in you you're lost.So regardless of which candidate would be better and what dire consequences I'm being blackmailed with in the face of a Trump presidency I would be unable to support Kamala.  But the silver lining is, by my calculus Trump might actually be the better bet.  Aside from my general hope that eventually the right-wing capture of the ostensibly left-wing major party could be broken by enough left-wingers in this country withdrawing support and allowing the democrats' repeated defeat... there's also Ukraine.  I find it entirely likely that a Trump victory could force an earlier peace deal and bring an end to that horrible and senseless conflict.  There's a greater chance of that than Kamala secretly planning a less genocidal Gaza policy.

They would have had primaries, which would have allowed their voters to decide which candidate they found the most exciting, instead of pushing a clearly mentally incapable incumbent and lying to the American people about it. They wouldnt have chosen a candidate to replace him who couldnt even garner 1% of the votes in the 2020 primaries, the same person who had historically low favorability polling *while in office*. It is not up to the American people to fall in line and vote for whoever the elites decide gives them the most control while giving as little credence to the public as possible. They are supposed to work *for us*. The biggest problem I have with this attitude of voting for the lesser of two evils is that the Democrats will play that card in every single election, as they have for decades, with no accountability for themselves or their actions. Its a free pass to operate anyway that they would like knowing that they can snap the moral whip to get people in line to vote for corporate handouts and fake identity politics. The Democrats have had 12 of the last 16 years if the presidency. They had a super majority in Obamas first term. What did they do with it? There are issues that they pay lip service to, notably relating to identity politics, that they use to whip up votes but have no policy proposals that have made a concrete difference in the lives of the people they use to emotionally manipulate the white liberal voters who they rely on to get into office.TLDR the accountability of winning or losing elections should be on the parties who are running the candidates, not the people who vote. If they want to get people excited to vote they should run a candidate who is exciting and able to articulate their vision of good governance and a plan to get us there.

There are two choices in an American presidential election, and theres no such thing as not making a choice.Third-party voters suffer from a category error. An election is a choice between two outcomes. It is not, in an endless sea of social media, yet another opportunity to explain to the world how good a person you are. Third-party voters confuse vanity with morality. The end.","title":"cmv: If youre voting for Jill Stein youre a privileged person that has nothing to lose, and you dont care about Palestinians more than you care about your moral high ground"},{"text":"I haven't updated it but as of 8 months ago this is what the current [administration has been doing to alleviate the housing crisis](https://old.reddit.com/r/WhatBidenHasDone/comments/1ajg1qh/the_biden_administration_has_laid_the_foundation/).I'll be updating the [one on Port expansion and uprades](https://old.reddit.com/r/WhatBidenHasDone/comments/19dpn0d/the_biden_administration_has_updated_upgraded/) with the article above.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Selections for Nearly $3 Billion of Investments in Clean Ports as Part of Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"Going on Twitch on Sunday afternoon during NFL games isnt gonna work.
