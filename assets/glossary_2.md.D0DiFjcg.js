He knows he is not compassionate and a good Christian, and doesn't care if he is exposed as such publicly. In his mind, he is the sole authority and the religious ritual is just a flowery peagent. He doesn't ascribe any symbolic, moral authority to the bishop that publicly denounces his decrees. So he remains completely untouched by the sermon. He only feels hurt personally, as being disrespected.","title":"I know the event itself has been covered but what are these faces? just look at all their faces on that screenshot, they all look absolutelty either dead in the eyes, full of apathy or legit terrified/worried that all mighty trump is being lectured here about compassion."},{"text":"1) Negative DEI is generally just lip service. Nearly all companies/people would say they dont discriminate on the basis of gender/race, or such discrimination is bad, or they are gender/race-blind in their hiring and promoting policies. \\n\\n2) Companies with robust DEI policies have generally been found to outperform companies without them. Probably some common factors here, as opposed to a purely causal relationship, and its hard to prove given the relatively low sample size over time. But it makes intuitive sense to me that companies that actively and affirmatively look to counter unproductive biases would generally end up hiring better talent.\\n\\n3) If forced diversity harms minority reputations, what about minority reputations when minorities stop getting hired because companies dont bother to increase their outreach? DEI policies were created in response to the inequities routinely observed in a pre-DEI world.\\n\\nPart of the problem is that companies are being asked to do the governments job. I agree with you there. These inequities start early in life as a result of existing factors. If the DEI scolds wanted to try to correct problems at the source, instead of just saying its reverse discrimination, then I think we could have that discussion. But without affirmative action and DEI, well simply see race and gender-based inequities perpetuate further.","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"Why is this so common on reddit?\\n\\nYou say this:\\n\\n&gt;everyone must understand that its not left vs right \\n\\nThen follow it up with:\\n\\n&gt;its The 1% vs everyone else.\\n\\nThis is leftist rhetoric.

Instead, his presidency of empty gestures and moral failures has given us something far more dangerous: a reinvigorated Donald Trump armed with a popular mandate and a drive for retribution.\\n\\n&gt; In 1992, Donald Trump had a cameo in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Macaulay Culkins Kevin McCallister asks him for directions in the Plaza Hotel lobby, and Trump (who owned the hotel both on screen and in real life) tells him down the hall and to the left. The whole thing lasts seven seconds. According to director Chris Columbus, Trump bull[ied] his way into the movie, making the cameo a condition for filming inside the hotel. Trump hotly denies this.\\n\\n&gt; The real estate developer once known as the Donald has come a long way since 1992. Today hell start his second term as president under vastly more favorable circumstances than before. In 2016, he lost the popular vote. In 2024, he became the first Republican to win it since George W. Bush in 2004 and the first to win it when not running as an incumbent since George H. W. Bush in 1988. In 2016, he was the last survivor of a fiercely competitive primary. In 2024, he swatted away pretenders like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis without breaking a sweat. The man who once fought for a seven-second cameo has, to a remarkable extent, realigned American politics around his deeply odd personality.\\n\\n&gt; The potential consequences are terrifying. Trumps four years out of office have only solidified his followers loyalty and whetted his appetite for vengeance against political enemies. Meanwhile, the conservative Supreme Court supermajority (three of whose members Trump appointed) ruled last year that presidents enjoy emperor-like immunity from legal consequences for their actions in office.\\n\\n&gt; What hell do with this power is anyones guess. His habit of mixing genuine promises with whatever bizarre nonsense floats to the surface of his mind has left both supporters and enemies uncertain about his true intentions. Hes floated everything from revoking the broadcast licenses of unfair news networks to invading Mexico.\\n\\n&gt; As we stare down the barrel of whatevers coming in his second term, though, we should never forget how we got here.\\n\\n\\n&gt;Watching the Wheels Fall Off\\n\\n&gt; In early 2021, no one expected that Trump would again take the oath of office in 2025. After his increasingly bizarre attempts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election, culminating in the January 6th riot, he was widely seen as a disgraced figure who might become the first former president to land in prison. Joe Biden entered office buoyed by embarrassingly positive media coverage. His additions to Trumps temporary pandemic relief measures and promises of a Build Back Better agenda led to breathless coverage declaring him the second coming of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\\n\\n&gt; Today that feels like ancient history. Some welfare-state measures he promised during the election, like a public option for health insurance, were dropped the moment he entered office. Others fell to legislative wrangling with his partys conservative wing. Sometimes there may have been nothing Democratic leadership could do against their caucuss obstructionism. Other times, Biden and party leaders performed the political equivalent of a basketball player flopping after minimal contact. When Democrats had enough votes to push a $15 minimum wage through Senate reconciliation, for instance, they simply accepted the Senate parliamentarians nonbinding ruling that the measures budgetary impact was too incidental  despite having the power to override or replace her.\\n\\n&gt; His labor record was mostly a bright spot. His National Labor Relations Board appointees undid much of Trumps damage and issued numerous pro-union rulings. Even that comes with a massive asterisk  his disgraceful decision in late 2022 to break a railway strike by invoking the Railway Labor Act, a hideous piece of pre�CNew Deal union-busting legislation.\\n\\n&gt; When a descendant of the big Build Back Better legislative package that was originally sold as the New Deal 2.0 finally limped its way across the finish line, it was missing all of the exciting social democratic measures that had originally been floated. There was no universal pre-K, no paid family and medical leave, no free community college. As his increasingly pointless presidency dragged on, Biden even talked about these things less and less. More than anything else, the Inflation Reduction Act that was eventually passed was a grab bag of tax credits. There was some infrastructure spending, but very little actually got built. Meanwhile, the temporary expansions of the welfare state during the COVID-19 pandemic lapsed. Few of the Biden cheerleaders in the media whod breathlessly noted that this assistance had cut child poverty in half in 2021 paused to run the numbers in the opposite direction when it all went away.\\n\\n&gt; Bidens cognitive decline (already widely commented on in 2020) was getting harder and harder to deny. Even as the Democratic Party acted to ensure he would be coronated for his reelection run without any opposition candidates getting a chance to make their case and build public support, the president could hardly open his mouth in public without raising serious questions about his competence to do the job.\\n\\n&gt; All of this would have been catastrophic even without Israels genocidal war against the population of Gaza. As it is, Biden has spent the fifteen months since the October 7 terrorist attacks providing Benjamin Netanyahu with an endless supply of bombs to drop on schools, hospitals, and refugee camps. Even as millions of Palestinian civilians were driven from their homes at gunpoint, Biden stood by the policy of unconditional support for Israels war. Universal pre-K? Free community college? Biden literally might not even remember that hed ever promised those things.\\n\\n&gt; But through all the months of social media feeds filling with videos of Israeli soldiers posing in the lingerie of Palestinian women theyd killed or driven from their homes and playing with their childrens toys, Biden never wavered. Even as it became universally obvious that Netanyahu had a strong preference for working with Donald Trump and was only too happy to tank Bidens reelection chances, Biden stood by his proxy. By the time he made his far-too-late decision to step aside and let his vice president (who could at least speak in complete sentences) be the Democratic nominee, his Gaza policy had earned him the deep hatred of many Democratic voters. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, passed on every opportunity to undo the damage. A recent poll showed that, among 2020 Biden voters who didnt cast their ballots for Harris in 2024, the single largest subgroup (29 percent) cited ending Israels violence in Gaza as the main factor affecting their vote, beating even the economy (cited by only 24 percent).\\nThe Bernie-Shaped Hole in Our Future\\n\\n&gt; As hard as it may be to remember five long years later, in January 2020, Bernie Sanders was winning the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. After he won all of the first three contests, Biden was only able to beat him when the rest of the centrist candidates dropped out and endorsed Biden, a last-ditch consolidation to stop what they regarded as the unacceptable outcome of a democratic socialist running away with the nomination.\\n\\n&gt; If Bernie had won the nomination race and become president, what would the last four years have looked like? Maddeningly, well never know. But watching Bernie today railing against Democrats for abandoning the working class (and constantly calling on Congress to spend not one more penny on funding Netanyahus criminal war in Gaza), its impossible not to be haunted by a vision of what could have been.\\n\\n&gt; Not so many years before Home Alone 2, another Hollywood sequel, Back to the Future Part II, featured an iconic scene where a white-haired scientist who looks a bit like Bernie Sanders (Christopher Lloyds Doc Brown) explains how time travel can be used to change the present by drawing branching timelines on a chalkboard. Sadly, in real life, whats done is done. The chalkboard that would represent American politics as it exists just has one line.\\n\\n&gt; We get to decide what happens next, though. As awful as the next four years of Trump may well be, American history isnt coming to an end. We dont have to accept alternating periods of rule by right-wing authoritarians and alternately pathetic and horrifyingly hawkish centrist Democrats. We can keep fighting for something better, and we damn well should.","title":"Bidens Bleak Presidency Was Always Going to End in Trump"},{"text":"Elon knows voting computers well.

The current democrat party is a response to the right ward shift of the republican party that began before them.\\n\\nYou also aren't recognizing that Trump in 2016, wasn't some kind of 4D strategy by Republicans. No one expected him to win the primary. The republican establishment lost the primary and then they got in line, when they realized they can use the guy to get an agenda they've wanted since Ronald Reagan. They purged everyone who objected.\\n\\nThe last thing to understand is that Republican playbook two past decade has been to be a WASP's first party. Trump leaned into that.  This time they won some working class latino's/blacks, but I am not sure how long that will endure. There is somewhat of a backlash coming from DEI and what ever. But a bigger driver really is inflation than anything else. Incumbent parties did badly everywhere around the globe and right wing parties won around the globe. Trump lucked out by inheriting the best part of the Obama Recovery, so low information voters will equate him for being better at economics. Since he basically got to govern during a period of low inflation and when the economy finally looked better than it was prior to the 2008 financial crisis. Mean while Biden got to inherit the tail end of the over stimulated COVID economy, which enjoyed a good labor market boom, an asset price boom for anyone who is wealthy enough to have assets, and a whole lot of inflation for the 60 percent of the population that doesn't have meaningful assets.\\n\\nThe democrats do have some problems, but I cannot stress how much of this election stems more from Kamala Harris as a presidential candidate. Lets face it: Black is not a political advantage, nor is a woman. Kamala wouldn't make a bad president, but the reality is she inspired no one and has no electoral advantages. People expect her to mobilize Obama's base. But Obama inspired people through his gifts as a orator (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2gRYvcl5Yg). This speech from 2002, is what essentially made Obama a presidential candidate:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUV69LZbCNQ). He wasn't even in Washington then.\\n\\nThen add to that Kamala's message is she's not Trump. Like can you even come up for a campaign slogan for this person. What is the policy issue that a low information thinks they stand for?\\n\\nDon't give me her policy platform. Neera Tanden  wrote it, just like she writes every single centrist democrats policy platform.

Those orders are expected to result in a significant increase in the number of detainees held in CBP custody over the coming weeks.\\n\\n&gt; According to the CBP briefing documents, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is preparing to more than double its detention capacity by opening four new 10,000-bed facilities and 14 smaller sites with space for 700 to 1,000 people. The Department of Defense may also utilize military bases as holding facilities, the document says. Trump officials have told lawmakers they will need billions of dollars in additional funding to meet the presidents deportation goals by ramping up ICE detention capacity.\\n\\n&gt; One of the officials said that military officials are planning for as many as 10,000 personnel to deploy. The numbers roughly match a menu of options that defense officials have been assembling for weeks under the expectation that Trump would order more troops to the border, this official said.\\n\\n&gt; Trumps top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, huddled with Senate Republicans on Wednesday about the military deployment and the urgent need to expand immigration detention, according to Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota). Cramer said the goal of sending troops is to achieve 100 percent operational control of the border.\\n\\n&gt; Lawmakers have expressed frustration about the number of got-aways in recent years, referring to people who have crossed illegally without being apprehended.

I first want to say, I grew up very Christian. Through education, research, and being a woman with a reproductive disease I began seeing abortion from a place of sympathy and compassion for others, rather than a personal religious agenda.\\n\\nI lived in TX for 5 years. During this time- Roe was overturned. Im a nurse, specifically OR. I did GYN and NICU surgery cases in a level one trauma hospital in Dallas. We did abortions. Abortion is not just what you picture as women lining up killing babies. Abortion is a medical term. Miscarriage is considered an abortion. If you have a nonviable pregnancy (ecoptic) and your body cannot naturally expel it, you will need an abortion or known as a D&amp;C or D&amp;E to prevent you dying from sepsis. TX has one of the strictest bans stating that medical professionals can go to PRISON for assisting in such cases. When I was in GYN, I did at least 5 abortions a day- hospital. Meaning not a walk in clinic, this is LIFE SAVING care.\\nWhen you look at the stats, most abortions are medically necessary. All the women we operated on wanted their babies. But unfortunately their bodies couldnt carry and they didnt want to die.\\nAs far as NICU, we only accepted babies 23 weeks or older. A fetus cannot live outside of the womb without a host- scientifically they can be considered parasites bc as soon as they leave the womb, they will die. Fetuses can live outside of the womb at 23 weeks. They usually have underdeveloped lungs but most will be fine with steroids and other treatments. If a baby was born at 22 weeks, my hospitals policy was to let the baby stay with the parents but no life saving care can be given bc.. they arent developed enough. \\nThe point of choice is to allow others to make decisions for what fits their life and circumstances. If you had cancer, your treatment plan is between you and your doctor, just as abortion should be. Its a very personal decision. Do you think people who get abortions are Christian ? Many have their own internal battles they are fighting for their decisions.\\n\\nAnd just because you feel morally against abortion due to YOUR religion, doesnt mean it infringes on other peoples beliefs. This is a confusing time where separation of church and state are not being separated in todays politics. \\nIm not here to change anyones view, Im here to educate. But to play the religious card- Jesus said to love our neighbors and to treat everyone with love and compassion. When you allow people to make decisions like abortion for their own lives, its showing compassion. You are showing you value their life and maybe you dont agree with it, but you are being compassionate to their life struggles. Its only up to God to judge us, so let people use their free will and make choices that fits their lifestyle.\\n\\nOnce you realize abortion bans were never about it being morally wrong and realize its about controlling women, youve opened a new can of worms. Our generation is not having kids the way the boomers were. You force women to have babies ? You have more workers in your economy making the rich richer and the poor stay poor.\\n\\nFeel free to research anything and everything. Im proud of you for asking and wanting to open your mind. Education is freeing.

Red flagging a job requisition or job group because it shows 2 standard deviatons means to me look into and hopefully the applicant step analysis shows it just happened and we hired the best of those we looked at. Also ensuring that all steps are well documented. \\n\\nSo for chargebacks 1% of a random sample of a large number of chargebacks could be ok but based on my historic job experience seems low.

In an actual functioning insurance market, this regulation would make no logical or fiscal sense.

However, under Obamacare, anyone can get a plan after being diagnosed with something like cancer without ever having spent one dollar in the insurance pool.244 **This individual (now with cancer) wont even be charged $1 more than any other person for that same plan who perhaps has been paying for their plan for years.** Even though it seems like this person ends up being a winner, they will unfortunately drive up the cost of care for everyone else in the insurance pool.

Do not obey in advance. Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.\\n\\n2. Defend institutions. It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak of \\"our institutions\\" unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. They fall one after the other unless each is defended from the beginning. So choose an institution you care about -- a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union -- and take its side.\\n\\n3. Beware the one-party state. The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the start. They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents. So support the multiple-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections. Vote in local and state elections while you can. Consider running for office.\\n\\n4. Take responsibility for the face of the world. The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.\\n\\n5. Remember professional ethics. When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become more important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without judges. Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in cheap labor.\\n\\n6. Be wary of paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching with torches and pictures of a leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.\\n\\n7. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, may God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no.\\n\\n8. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. Remember Rosa Parks. The moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.\\n\\n9. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet. Read books.\\n\\n10. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.\\n11. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad). Take responsibility for what you communicate with others.\\n\\n12. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member of society. It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.\\n\\n13. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.\\n\\n14. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware on a regular basis. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Tyrants seek the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have hooks.\\n\\n15. Contribute to good causes. Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life. Pick a charity or two and set up autopay. Then you will have made a free choice that supports civil society and helps others to do good.\\n\\n16. Learn from peers in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends in other countries. The present difficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.\\n\\n17. Listen for dangerous words. Be alert to use of the words \\"extremism\\" and \\"terrorism.\\" Be alive to the fatal notions of \\"emergency\\" and \\"exception.\\" Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.\\n\\n18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. Modern tyranny is terror management. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power. The sudden disaster that requires the end of checks and balances, the dissolution of opposition parties, the suspension of freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Do not fall for it.\\n\\n19. Be a patriot. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.\\n\\n20. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.\\n\\nHe also has recording on his youtube channel reading his book: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tocssf3w80&amp;list=PLhZxrogyToZsllfRqQllyuFNbT-ER7TAu","title":"Bishop Who Confronted Trump: This Is Truth He Needed to Hear"},{"text":"Trump brings the negative part of the perfect plan of salvation for ALL, eventually, to pass at lighting speed ?? \\n\\nA temporal flesh human mind is only capable of taking in so much bull$hit and then it explodes ??","title":"Why do people in this sub support Trump?"},{"text":"What is the more reasonable conclusion?

You might know that 1% of charge back claims go through this process, but you don't know if that 1% is chosen randomly, or if there's a system thst flags certain requests based on patterns, or there's a monkey that throws darts at a spinning board covered in charge back requests and the ones that he hits get sent down.  So you get these requests, and you investigate them for fraud.  Let's say that 75% of the time, you gather evidence that indicates that the request is more likely fraudulent than not.  25% of the time, everything looks kosher. The qestion is this: Is it reasonable for you to assume that 75% of all chargeback requests (not just 75%.of the 1% that go through the process) are fraudulent?\\n\\nAlso, based on what I've read, there seem to be two interpretations of Trump's rule: one says it involves people whose work is involved in any kind of, let's say, EEO, that goes above and beyond the minimum as defined by the EEOC Act.and the Civil Rights Act, not anyone who was hired or promoted because of something other than purely their qualifications for a job, which I think would be literally impossible to implement, since if you have two candidates who are qualified on paper apply for a job, then what else the manager uses to make such a decision, whether it's team/personality fit, novel perspectives from life experiences (often very helpful, especially in creative roles, to encourage people from different cultural backgrounds to develop solutions that often view the problem from different angles), etc., doesn't really matter because the candidate was qualified.\\n\\nAlso, legacy admission is an extremely common thing at private colleges and universities, and has been for literally centuries (not exaggerating). Basically, if your parent went there, they will lower the bar for you to get in. In some cases, if a parent makes enough of a.donation,.that will ensure admission as well even if the student is in, say the 10th percentile (on paper) of admitted applicants and doesn't have any other experiences/challenges that would otherwise offset the added risk (most private schools are interested in creating a diverse environment,  so there's no \\"cutoff\\" for grades, standardized test scores, etc., there are just distributions. For things like race,.gender, sexual orientation, and cultural and national background, there's typically a goal to create a diverse student body as well. For example, if someone is denied admission, and they learn that someone with lower grades than them got in, that doesn't imply that there was some sort of decision to have someone else \\"take their spot\\", because unlike a company, there aren't a specific number of spots, and you look at prior years' acceptance rate to roughly figure out how many people to admit, since many who are admitted will end up going somewhere else. There also aren't quotas, at least in the schools where I've worked or done consulting (these were mostly tier-1 research universities and their undergraduate programs, so think of the private colleges in the top of the US news rankings, which, by the way, are utter bullshit lol)\\n  \\nSpecifically, I focused on statistically modeling the admitted candidate's likelihood to accept the offer to ensure that you don't send out decisions too quickly or too slowly and you don't run into a problem where you have unread applications  but if you were to continue to offer spots, you would put the school in a position where more people will accept than they have room for).\\n\\n I've been out of the higher education game for more than a decade now, and I currently lead a data science, machine learning, and AI group for one of the largest companies in the world, and i will say that working in stats for such a long time, I get skeptical when I see people automatically thinking that for some trait (say fraud) the sample of a population that they see is indicative of proportion of that trait in the larger population.","title":"Trump Cabinet will be mass firing anyone designated as \\"DEI employees\\""},{"text":"Being anti-fascist is not political.
