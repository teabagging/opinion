But for a lot of them, their indecision is not a result of brilliance or cerebral political ambivalence.Some undecided voters are incoherent about their preferences or concerns.  They claim they cannot decide between one candidate or another, but when you ask them what is most important for them to decide, they cannot or will not explain.  They keep saying they are \\"just not sure\\" or \\"just can't bring themselves\\" to support this or that candidate but never explain what the candidate has to do to convince them.  Not really much you can do with such voters unless you can read their minds and emotions perfectly.Some undecided voters are disingenuous.  They claim to be \\"undecided\\" but you notice that all their skeptical and hostile questions are directed to one candidate rather than the other and they act like it's the burden of that candidate to convince and please them. When we show them evidence why that candidate is better for the concerns and issues they claim to have, they shift the goalposts or say it's just not good enough.  If a candidate actually does change their position to mollify them, they may accuse the candidate of \\"flip flopping.\\"  They claim to be \\"undecided\\" and keep demanding a particular candidate jump and roll over to convince them, but somehow it's never enough.For authentic undecided voters who have trouble choosing between candidates because of genuine conflicting ideological positions, one can try, but there's only so much bending a candidate can do.  Candidates can't twist themselves into pretzels to please every self-identified heterodox person.","title":"Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris: \\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.

The only time I felt he was unhinged was when he went on the pet eating segway, but Ive come to expect that from him as much as Ive come to realize it from Biden.  Meanwhile Harris looked on the verge of tears the whole time and her constant repetition of the Not going back theme seemed weird when all she kept talking about was the past instead of the issues going on right now that shes a part of.  She had a couple moments where she almost got me with the concerned mother act, but Im not quite falling for it, because I know its just that, an act.  You get what you see with Trump.  Its definitely strange that I feel someone is more genuine when talking about making meals out of peoples pets than the other person telling me they are genuinely concerned for me.  I know neither are genuinely concerned for my well being , but one isnt trying to bullshit me about it or attempting to buy my vote by waving money in my face.  I find that kind of insulting.  I do know it sounds contradictory but it is hilarious that Rambling Man could easily win these debates by an even bigger margin if he literally did put his foot in his mouth at times.  Rambling Man vs. Thespian Gecko leaves a hard choice and its almost like I have to look past them both and just cast on if I want the past four years or the four years before that.  We basically seem to have the same thoughts, Im just not so willing to point out either  candidate as being a terrible person.  And like I said, Ive got to look past them both in order to make the right decision, so all that doesnt really matter.  Ill just say neither cares for myself, and both are not really my picture of the ideal candidate.  I guess fix the fucking country instead of offering me bribes.

To add on even more, I don't believe we think about how constantly and unforgivingly denigrating former Trump supporters or moderate Republicans looks to young voters raised in conservative families. The sort who are curious about forming their own views after they begin to buck the beliefs they were raised with.Personally, it took me two *long* years to deprogram myself from Republican talking points and beliefs for the most part. I was about 22, and that was almost ten years ago now. Politics on social media has become *far* more polarized since then. I'm not sure if I would have been able to stick through re-examining every single one of my beliefs and drastically changing many of them if I had been constantly shit on for it by the communities I was desperately trying to join. I mean, breaking from conservative beliefs is *hard.*And I don't think many who are privileged enough to be raised blue states or cities truly realize just how tough and isolating it is to do so. You lose friends, family, and even a sense of who you *thought* you were while you determine what beliefs you *actually* want to support rather than toeing the line conservatives enforce through things like social ostracizing, religious harassment, and even violence.I think Harris actually understands this which is why she's courting ostracized Republicans right now. We need to give these folks an exit ramp. A reasonable choice to help them come back to a kinder, more peaceful reality. Don't get me wrong, I do my fair share of shitting on active MAGA shitheels who are *currently* bullying and harassing other people around them.They're not who we're talking about.It's the raised conservatives, the moderate Never-Trumpers, the embarrassed former-Trumpers, all of *these* people who could and *are* being attracted by Harris's sane platform and are tired of the insanity just like we are. Turning these folk away or shitting on them will only leave them vulnerable to re-radicalization or complete disenfrachisement.We want to return to boring politics, right?

The transition to renewable energy in Germany is going on for about 25 years. It didn't fail, but is rapidly picking up speed in the last few years. In 2023, over 50% of the produced electricity in Germany was renewable, while Germany is still a net exporter. Today renewables are already in the 60% area.We certainly don't go back to conventional power plants. For example the percentage of coal has gone down from over 80% in the 1990s to below 18% today. The plan is still to be at 100% renewable before 2035.Oh. And don't get me started with Trump's claim that the world is laughing at the US under Biden, while having respected it under Trump.Just remember when Trump held a weird MAGA speech in front of the UN assembly and hundreds of top diplomats from all over the world laughed in his face.

If we cant acknowledge them doing good things even after a history of doing bad things, what motivation does that give to anyone who is considering that maybe the gop is kinda fucked up? Theyre just supposed to renounce their life long political affiliation but then also be rejected by the other side because it took them too long to find out? Like theyre essentially saying youre a horrible person and I will always think youre a horrible person but you should agree with me anyway because objectively its the right thing to do Even if theyre correct, eternal isolation from their old party as well as the one theyre considering supporting is just not a winning scenario.

The entire point of being a child and proving yourself is actually hidden in history. To me, if he did rise from the dead, its from stuff Im studying, how our health works. Its said Jesus had alien teachings, but thats covered up and they use meditation and spiritual practice to promote anything. If you want to believe that Jesus is the only one capable of that stuff, sure, free will doesnt exist. Knowing that scripture states that our genetics have the information the word of howd is written in the hearts of beast and men as it is in stone (blood beats our hearts, genetics, emotional information, emotional awareness is essential for enlightenment) states that to know, we must give up all our expectations in such a way, we learn something that scars us against all else, not that we dont feel for others, its the potential of time that gives us opportunity, so its important to stop following old rules that you cant even understand. I dont doubt the existence of but I doubt its how the Bible directly says, its likely a makeup of past stories, but, if Im saying stuff like this then it kinda further suggests the existence of, not that Ive met, Ive met this Black dude with a healthy stomach and sword, I was in a mediation as a child, learned stuff, earned the information, got thrown out in order to learn more and prove more, Im totally confused on how to proceed but Im in America so I just use whats happening to tell me. Im not into religion, at all, I dont see whats needed and I wont promote it because I havent seen anything beneficial. the manipulation of society shows me I cant say what I want to because of the religious beliefs, theyll pull back in a ooohhhh or go for a assassinate, so stuck on pretentious stuff that they think they got it all right or theyre safe because they are surrounded. Im not going to promote your beliefs when they speak nothing of the science they impose. I have not seen ANYONE actually learn anything about earth from the Bible, nothing actually naturally beneficial. Why the fuck am I the one talking about the science of how the trees affect us when youre religion has been around for 2000 years? I havent heard any of the other spiritual teachings talk about it. I thought the point of development was to study how our work affects nature and how to ensure we dont die? I cannot reveal the truth of our masters when those who want to learn are not healthy enough to teach themselves, it is not my place for I have not been given the power, my power is variant upon those around me.I study the science of war. I study all it does. I dont consider myself field ready because I havent earned my own respect, plus I have such knowledge that I want to see what Im fully comprehensive of. Entering a branch would be easy, just slip in and go get the usual looks, but this way I actually see what the fuck they want, if I even enlist. Everyone is so scared of a bad guy that I would much more wait to see if the war stops, but the war is useful to see what our leaders think about how to go about. Every citizen in the US is in line for presidency, I took study of this, and now I will stop talking about that because I actually kind of like how they set up and dont want to spoil it and I dont actually intend on being president. I just wanted to learn their system of empirialism, see how their empire would work, test their future, see what happens, communicate, try stopping the war, if there is a war, if I dont like stuff then ima j do whatever who needs me most needs me to, this is my point in sense of judgement, emotional awareness, i was supposed to stop the war while young but amnesia got me so I have to develop a new system and work around all the problems to remember or get access. All I cant remember is what everyone wants me to actually say. Ive been doing all the health study to make myself look weak but testing my limits, never actually at the peak of my weak to keep my maximum unknown to myself as those around me shouldnt be trusted with such information for how they display their elder self. The judgment of time is an acquisition of balance, not greed, I dont just what I want. I hear talk of spiritual stuff so I make a mind. Astral projection is apparently what they say has the akashic records. If none of these other spiritual people step the fuck up, my plan is to stop their shit, after the war is completed. My plan is to stop all the liars. In short, they already have access to our data, they already do this, they just want to test psychology and get everyone healthy but they arent showing us they know everything so Im shitballing them so I KNOW if I get Caesared, mfkrs aint know SHIT about HONOR so far, respect yeah, honor no. Until your savior is here, this is the plan if you dont believe in any other, so suit up as they withdraw their information or push it (apologies if I am rude, just gotta be funny).

You came in flexing legal expertise and everything after was pretentious.No one is disputing that SCOTUS at one point determined that. It also determined that racial segregation and Japanese internment were constitutional.Not relevant. Ignores my point with whataboutism.What we are discussing is whether the court decisions in question were correct, not whether they exist.I don't care to justify what legal experts and judges before me have already determined to be valid. A case giving rights cannot be compared to a right which takes away rights. That is a false comparison.OP is about constitutional law, not public perception.Again, I don't give a shit. If your argument is based purely on policy concerns, then you are admitting you have lost the legal argument.Yes it's convenient enough to latch onto some of the only first person sentences which in these cases I wrote when introducing an argument. My bad for discussing like you were a human being having a conversation with me. I knew you would do this with those sentences too lmao.It's not a social contract. By definition per Rousseau, the social contract is implicit. The Constitution is an explicit legal document governing our entire legal structure.My bad for not having exact correct terminology ? you got my meaning but decided to pretend not to. As indicated by this: At any rate, you still haven't explained why courts inventing terms of the contract are entitled to do that.Im gonna copy paste this:  \\"according to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a social contract could be broken or revoked, particularly if a government significantly deviated from the \\"general will\\" of the people and abused its power, essentially usurping the sovereignty of the citizens; in such a scenario, the people would have the right to return to their natural liberty and potentially overthrow the government.\\"I dont want to just restate what i said to apply this lens to it. Just apply it and if you cant you are just being a snob. But also what gives courts the right to do that? The constitution silly!Explain why that matters constitutionally. Your entire argument is policy-based. OP's argument is legal. All of government functions at the highest levels are policy based, including the courts at this point in time.At any rate, no one is talking about revoking the Commerce Clause. People are talking about enforcing it as something that does not grant Congress unlimited (or, more specifically in legalese, police) power.Well we are talking about it because i have made it relevant to the conversation. I have introduced the argument that the court decision (using powers given to the court by the constitution to interpret the constitution) to revoke a landmark case which GRANTS rights to one that TAKE rights is absurd even outside the obvious consent of the governed stance. Revoking the commerce clause when it has set precedents essential to our government functioning is as absurd as going back on the right to privacy which is itself a precedent which set other precedents. unlimited (or, more specifically in legalese, police) power.Please refrain from this again. I am not stupid. This comes off as pretentious the same way your initiation to this conversation did. If you just start using complex legal terminology to get back at me for this then your also just proving you are pretentious. I understand you supposedly have a background in constitutional law and you are passionate. You must understand that speaking the way you are right now is disrespectful. Just say police power and if I didn't understand this somehow I can look it up but you've made it belittling.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"He didnt want to shake her hand.

Well both be reporting back to the [British] prime minister, to President Biden in the coming days. He added that Biden would discuss the matter with Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, when he visits Washington on Friday.The UK has urged the US to grant Ukraine permission to use long-range weapons provided by its western allies deep inside Russia and believes Kyiv should be able to target Russian sites and assets. US sign-off is needed in order for Ukraine to use the Storm Shadow missiles provided by the UK for long-range strikes inside Russia.While the US state department is more receptive to arguments from Ukraine and many of its western allies, the Pentagon and US intelligence community have cautioned against the use of the long-range weapons deep inside Russia.The latter recently assessed that 90 per cent of Russian aircraft have been relocated to airfields at least 300km away from Ukrainian-controlled territory, outside of the range of ATACMS.I dont believe one specific capability will be decisive?.?.?.?we know that the Russians have actually moved their aircraft that are using the glide bombers beyond the range of Atacms, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said at a meeting of the Ukraine contact group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany last week.He added that Ukraine could target strategic targets inside Russia with drones and other domestically produced weapons.US defence officials say Kyiv should prioritise using western weapons to defend eastern and northern regions of Ukraine, as well as to retain access to the Black Sea and to pressure Russian forces in Crimea  the peninsula annexed by Putin in 2014.","title":"Biden administration split over Ukraines use of US weapons inside Russia"},{"text":"...except for all the times she did.Some of them even SNOPES debunked.","title":"Don't think.....Just do."},{"text":"You really cant believe a woman can speak coherently can you?","title":"Kamala Harris had an earring ear piece accessory"},{"text":"None of those are lies","title":"Don't think.....Just do."},{"text":"[/r/neoliberal/new](/r/neoliberal/new): [Biden administration split over Ukraines use of US weapons inside Russia](/r/neoliberal/comments/1fe2zmh/biden_administration_split_over_ukraines_use_of/)*Replies to this comment will be removed, please participate in the linked thread*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Go look at nova.audioearrings on instagram theyre literally identical.

Wade* was struck down. Trump didn't help himself with this: LINSEY DAVIS: I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe v. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, \\"I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\\" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn't trust you on the issue of abortion because you've changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?\\n \\n FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states. And through the genius and heart and strength of six supreme court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. 85% of Republicans do. Exceptions. Very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time you're going to see -- look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the supreme court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.The first part isn't even grammatical. He knows it's his Achilles heel, and that's exactly what the flash poll confirmed.","title":"Kamala Harris Trounced Donald Trump in Debate: Flash Poll"},{"text":"I would bet everything on it becomes even more divided if she wins.","title":"CMV: America will not be less divided after the 2024 election"},{"text":"I have a theory of an idea of a plan.","title":"Trump on ObamaCare repeal: I have concepts of a plan"},{"text":"But the Venn diagram of her fans and the voters Democrats need to appeal to in swing states has almost zero overlap.?And the turnout myth is essentially wrong.

It also determined that racial segregation and Japanese internment were constitutional.What we are discussing is whether the court decisions in question were correct, not whether they exist.I?like the precedent that was set as do the majority of americans.OP is about constitutional law, not public perception.The precedent stood until a court which is viewed the worst way by the american people than any other court in history (including the court which ruled black people even free can never be citizens and therefore don't have any rights) went back on it.It doesn't matter as far as OP is concerned, notwithstanding the complete lack of support you provide for that statement.The constitution is the american social contract, this contract had a right to privacy which was cited and upheld as legitamite numerous times.It's not a social contract.  By definition per Rousseau, the social contract is implicit.  The Constitution is an explicit legal document governing our entire legal structure.At any rate, you still haven't explained why courts inventing terms of the contract are entitled to do that.The commerce clause being revoked would essentially butt fuck every american as a landmark caseExplain why that matters constitutionally.  Your entire argument is policy-based.  OP's argument is legal.  At any rate, no one is talking about revoking the Commerce Clause.  People are talking about enforcing it as something that does not grant Congress unlimited (or, more specifically in legalese, police) power.But as you should prob know the renunciation of the right to privacy takes away a lot more rights than just abortion.Again, I don't give a shit.  If your argument is based purely on policy concerns, then you are admitting you have lost the legal argument.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"When I was younger, Taylor Swift fans were overwhelmingly conservative Christians, but then again I did grow up in NC.

The instant CNN poll indicated that 63 percent of viewers believed Harris won the debate, which is a significant shift compared to prior expectations. Her focus on issues like abortion, the Supreme Court, and personal freedoms seemed to resonate deeply with voters, especially independents. Her ability to convey passion and conviction on topics like reproductive rights appeared to make a lasting impression, as evidenced by several undecided voters praising her for her emotional and concrete responses. In contrast, Trump's performance was marred by factually dubious claims, particularly his false statements about post-birth executions and radical abortion policies, which fact-checkers quickly debunked. His more aggressive and often hyperbolic rhetoric did not play well with debate watchers, as indicated by the negative response to his statements on abortion and crime. While Trump did emphasize his strong economic track record, many of his claims were contradicted by fact-checkers, weakening his overall persuasiveness for undecided or fact-driven voters. His inability to effectively defend his positions, especially on sensitive issues like abortion, likely contributed to his lower performance in the poll.\\n \\n Ultimately, Harriss success in connecting with voters emotionally, particularly around issues like personal freedoms and the Supreme Court, allowed her to persuade a larger portion of the audience. The fact-checks further bolstered her credibility while exposing Trumps frequent exaggerations and inaccuracies. This combination of emotional appeal and factual consistency gave Harris the edge in both favorability and voter confidence, as reflected in the flash poll and in the broader post-debate narrative.","title":"Kamala Harris Trounced Donald Trump in Debate: Flash Poll"},{"text":"Its difficult to hate someone whose story you know, Ms. McBride said.

A complete reversal.\\"Harris' deputy campaign manager has also declared that the Democrat nominee won the debate.Harris was trailing Trump in favorability 39 percent to 41 percent prior to the debate, according to CNN. After tonight's discussions, CNN now shows her at 45 percent favorability and Trump at 39 percent.\\"Her favorability rating went up six points,\\" Chalian said. \\"Donald Trump actually kicked down two points by these debate watchers.\\"Chalian said Harris' uptick was \\"driven a lot by independent voters.\\" Prior to the debate, independent voters were -17 for Harris, but after the debate, they were +9 for her favorability.\\"A big movement change for her favorability with the independents,\\" Chalian said.The media outlet conducted a group session with undecided voters, who were sharing their thoughts live throughout the debate. The majority of the people in the group said their mind was made up thanks to the debate.\\"I strongly felt Kamala was more optimistic, more respectful,\\" one focus group member said. \\"I thought she had plans she tried to describe in the minutes worth that she had...I just felt more strongly for her as oppose to her opponent.\\"Chalian shared that the same percentage (54 percent) of debate watchers shared they either have a lot or some confidence in Harris or Trump lea's ability to lead the country.The voters were provided a dial to gauge their thoughts in the moment during the debate. If they turned the knob to the right, they felt positive about what they were hearing in the moment. A turn to the left pointed gave a more negative view.\\"I think it's important that we're voting for a leader of our country,\\" another focus group member said, adding that she was \\"better off\\" during Trump's presidency from 2016 to 2020 than she is now.CNN showed that the dials were turned \\"negative\\" when Trump talked about Governor Tim Walz, Harris' running mate's apparent views on abortion. He said there is an issue of abortions \\"in the ninth month.\\" He called it \\"genius\\" and \\"courageous\\" work by the Supreme Court justices to bring decisions about abortion to the states, calling it \\"the vote of the people.\\"\\"This is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years... they're radical,\\" Trump said. \\"The Democrats are radical in that. Her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after the birth... is okay.\\"After Trump finished speaking, ABC News debate moderator Linsey Davis pushed back by correctly pointing out, \\"There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.\\"The claim is so widespread that Newsweek published an in-depth Fact Check on the matter in 2023, finding it false that the Democratic agenda pushes for \\"on demand\\" abortions up until birth.The CNN group's views changed when Harris started to discuss her stance on abortion.Harris focused on how Trump \\"hand-selected\\" three Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, as they did. She discussed bans that make it criminal to provide an abortion, without the exception of rape or incest.\\"That is immoral. One does not have to abandon their faith or their deeply held beliefs to agree that the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\\" Harris said. \\"If Donald Trump were to be elected, he will sign a national abortion ban... I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about ones own body, should not be made by the government.\\"One undecided voter said it was her favorite part of Harris' responses throughout the debate, calling it a solid response and concrete with examples and passion.Chalian said 42 percent of debate watchers said Harris had a better plan to solve the country's problems. Only 33 percent said Trump did.Another undecided group member said she might not agree with Harris but she does think the government should not be in charge with people's decisions.\\"I just felt her impassioned response and that she would carry it out,\\" the voter said.[See also: https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/09/10/trump-harris-presidential-debate-tonight/cnn-flash-poll-harris-won-00178566]","title":"Kamala Harris Trounced Donald Trump in Debate: Flash Poll"},{"text":"Everyone is going bonkers over this but the last debate with Biden you can see his eyes following a teleprompter the whole time.","title":"Kamala Harris had an earring ear piece accessory"},{"text":"Almost like Kamala telling people to attend a Trump rally (and damn was that a masterful trap; he forgot everything else he was saying and got frothing about his rallies).

I have a basic highschool gov class understanding which is about the same as or better than most americans. That said I do not need to know the in depth background and fine details to know the right to privacy was determined to essentially be outlined but not outright stated in the constitution. Once this was determined by the institution which is the last say on interpretation, and then it was used in the ruling of numerous other cases besides abortion it became a precedent. I like the precedent that was set as do the majority of americans. The precedent stood until a court which is viewed the worst way by the american people than any other court in history (including the court which ruled black people even free can never be citizens and therefore don't have any rights) went back on it. The court also seems to have the most conflict of interest on the case as well. Funky.The constitution is the american social contract, this contract had a right to privacy which was cited and upheld as legitamite numerous times. This nation could literally never function without cases like it. The commerce clause being revoked would essentially butt fuck every american as a landmark case. Going back on the right to privacy fucked americans as well particularly the like 60%+ americans that support abortion rights. But as you should prob know the renunciation of the right to privacy takes away a lot more rights than just abortion.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"He appeared to be even more incoherent on live Hannity after.

It reads like an intellectually sloppy opinion, reminiscent of Iqbal, vibes without legal reasoning.  I wonder who wrote each?  Oh.Constitutionally speaking, in my opinion, we need to make Substantive Due Process stronger not weaken it with historically rooted theories from DobbsWhy should SPD exist at all?  What is the legal justification?And why should states decide?Because they possess police power while the federal government does not.Constitutionally speaking one purpose of Federal Supremacy is to prevent states from committing systemic atrocities against citizens.Uh...no.ETA: The other user blocked me, so responding here.All SCOTUS decisions intrude into policy, to believe otherwise is intellectually clouded and egotistically motivated fallacy.No one is disputing that SCOTUS decisions affect policy.  The question is whether and/or when policy should motivate or be considered by SCOTUS.Why should any constitutional analysis be based on originalist construction?Because no alternative is better, all things considered.Isnt that just an attempt at historical policy reasoning?   \\n  \\nNo, because it doesn't assess whether the historical policy is right or not. \\n \\nSDP gives name to thereal, historically and todayimplicit understanding that the People have a right to privacy from the government.I'm still waiting for the constitutional justification.  There are plenty of things that many people agree with that aren't protected by the Constitution.\\nLoving and Obergefell do rely on other constitutional bases, as you note to varying degrees.Such as?\\nThe SDP is implicit or skirted to some extent as well. Id argue, as other scholars have, that both decisions are on precarious ground if SDP falls.I am not familiar with any scholarhsip arguing *Loving* falls if SPD falls.  As to *Obergefell*, good riddance.  SCOTUS can articulate an EPC or other basis for upholding it if the decision is meritorious.\\nAs Thomas argued actually. Although he didnt go after interracial marriage as he has some personal investment there lolI admire your boldness in exposing your intellectual bankruptcy.  Again, *Loving* was decided on EPC grounds independent from any SPD reasoning.\\nWhy shouldnt SDP exist? I addressed this above.No, you didn't.  \\nOk states have police power, and? SCOTUS limits unconstitutional uses of that power. Thats not an argument for the states deciding abortion access over SCOTUS deciding a right is constitutionally protected. This circles the issue.Abortion regulation is an exercise of the police power.  There's no circling.\\nYour reply boils down to nit-picking, straw-manning, and you hate SDP. Cool. Well we know youre conservative and can venture a guess that incentivizes you to make the argument you make. Which ironically is reasoning dictated by policywait a minute didnt you have an issue with that or something?Feel free to identify inconsistencies once you unblock me.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"She clearly plays that association to her advantage.

The US was against the British and French fucking up the Suez canal. You can partially blame the US for the Shah, but I don't think you can blame the US for the Iranians deciding to be a theocracy. The inability of Shia and Sunni Muslims to get along and proxy war each other is not the US's fault. The US backing Saddam against Iran was it's fault, but it had no reason to believe he would invade Kuwait. Though Kuwait's existence is another fluke of Sykes-Picot. The US invading Iraq the second time was obviously the US's fault, but the new Iraqi government demanding the US military leave and create a power vacuum was not it's fault. The Arab Spring was cause by a drought and the ensuing upheaval was not the US's fault.

Supreme Court, Legislature, Sheriff, County/State/Federal Judges, Mayors, Governors, etc. Not just because old people shouldn't be making decisions for the other 90% of people in the country who are younger than they are, but because government stagnates when the same old farts can stay in office forever.

Kamala can explain why increasing the number of fracking permits was a good thing since it means diversifying our energy profile and limiting our dependence on foreign oil. Whether you like it, hate it, agree with it, or think its bullshit, the bottom line is she can lay out an explanation for policy. trump doesnt even know which side of the line hes supposed to be on with respect to a single type of energy.Zoom out a little and youll see that his deportation rhetoric - which implies an Eisenhower Interstate highway system level of government expense and intervention - has paper-thin depth to it. Theres no vision, no strategy, no plan. Just an idea that he wants millions of people forcibly removed from the country and a suggestion that all levels of law enforcement will likely be involved.

In fact, I believe the doctrine of jus soli derived from the 14th Amendment is the delineating point that establishes that constitutional rights begin at birth, not at conception. Religious people may see it differently but that's strictly a religious argument, and arguments against abortion not grounded firmly in secular logic shouldn't even factor into lawmaking based on the First Amendment. Laws must be secular while not disenfranchising individual rights, and the argument here is simple: if you're against abortion, don't have one.The default position IMO should be to leave the decision up to medical providers and patients. That said, I would support the right of a privately owned clinic not to offer abortion services if they object to it. There will always be debate about whether tax dollars should fund abortion at public clinics, but I think privately funded clinics should have the right to exist and offer abortion services nationwide.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"It was a surprisingly well thought out text.

Most people were very nice, and I never encountered any outright transphobia from coworkers (some from very stupid and meanspirited 30-to-40-something patients). But the company was subtly not super accepting. There was no way to indicate pronouns on name badges. There weren't a lot of resources for us to plug in with fellow LGBTQIA+ people. There was not even an acknowledgment of pride this yearCI know rainbow capitalism bad blah blah, but I'd rather have shitty pride than silence. And changing your name in the system was an enormous ordeal. Ihad no authority to fire people (not that i really needed to), and my company actively discouraged banning nasty patients. I didn't want to be a traveling pharmacist. I told them so in my interview. It didn't matter. But I've since left and am going to be based out of one store in a much more LGBTQIA+ welcoming space. One of my techs is a trans man even! I think that settling in and owning who you are makes a difference. Im still setting changes, but i think pretty much 100% passCyou can be the judge of that since I've posted pictures. Even still, I have never, not for one second, pretended I was anything other than trans at work. If the world won't ever forget, I won't either. Some trans boy or girl or enby out there *needs* to know that I'm not just safe, I'm like them. And they need to know that even if things can be hard for us, they can also turn out alright sometimes.","title":"Transgender Lawmaker Wins Democratic Primary for Delawares Only House Seat | Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, is favored to win in November.

Option A.If Harris wins, if not another Jan 6th type event, there will be violent protests. His hardcore supporters will go absolutely ballistic. Harris would also likely crack down on these protests/attacks with the National Guard. This will either lead to a civil war or they'll get clapped hard enough that they'll stop. They'll stick to flags, bumper stickers, and all that shit. Over time, especially if there's a blue wave behind her and *especially* if states like Texas go blue (which is actually possible, if you can believe it), the GOP will die or completely reform.

They dont matter anymore to Trump supporters. You and they do no t live in the same shared reality. Ill drop my blurb here on dealing with the more intractable ones, normally focused on close friends and family that have completely lost all touch with reality. Im k. My phone so the formatting is bad. But its still readable  -First, Rules of Engagement: Evidence and Facts dont matter, reasoning is useless. You no longer live in a shared reality with this person. You can try to build one by asking strategic questions about their reality. You also use those questions to poke holes in it. You never make claims or give counter arguments. You need to keep the burden of proof on them. They should be doing all the talking, you should be doing none.\\nYou can use ChatGPT or an LLM of your choice to help you come up with Socratic questions. When asking ChatGPT, give it some context and tell it you want Socratic questions you can use to help persuade a person.\\nThe stolen election is an easy one for this. There is no evidence, and they will have no evidence to site but wild claims from Giuliani, Powell and the Pillow guy. Trump and his lawyer lost EVERY court case, and when judges asked for evidence, Giuliani and Powell would admit in court that there was NO evidence.\\nSo, here is my interaction with ChatGPT on the stolen election topic, you can take it deeper than this if you like.\\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/377c8a82-e6e0-4697-a9ae-a0162aa36061\\nA trick you can use is to ask them how certain they are of their belief in this topic is before you start down the Socratic method. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that the election was stolen and there was irrefutable evidence that showed that? And ask the question again after youve stumped them. Making them admit you planted doubt quantifies it for themselves. And if they still give you a 10 afterwards it tells you how unreachable they may be.\\nThings to keep in mind:\\nYou are not going to change their minds. Not in any quick measurable time frame. In fact, it may never happen. The best you can hope for is to plant seeds of doubt that might germinate and grow over time. Instead, your realistic goal is to get them to shut up about this shit when you are around. People dont like feeling inarticulate or embarrassed about something they believe in. So theyll stop spouting it.\\nThe Gish Gallop. They may try to swamp you with nonsense, and rattle off a bunch of unrelated facts or narratives that they claim proves their point. You have to shut this down. How does this (choose the first one that doesnt) relate to the elections? Or you can just say I dont get it, how does that relate? You may have to simply tell them it doesnt relate and you want to get back to the original question that triggered the Gallop.\\nDo your own research is something you will hear when they get stumped. Again, this is them admitting they dont know. So you can respond with If youre smarter than me on this topic and you dont know, how can I reach the same conclusion you have? I need you to walk me through it because I cant find anything that supports your conclusion.\\nYelling/screaming/meltdown: I see you are upset, I think we should drop this for now, let everyone calm down. This whole technique really only works if they can keep their cool. If they go into meltdown just disengage. Causing a meltdown can be satisfying, and might keep them from talking about this shit around you in the future, but is otherwise counterproductive.

For much of Tuesday night, Donald Trump stepped on them.She overstated how much money the former president had been loaned by his father. I wasnt given $400 million, he said. I wish I was. She warned that Trump would implement the Heritage Foundations Project 2025: Thats out there, I havent read it, personally.She urged viewers to attend a Trump rally, so they could watch bored people stream out; Trump, obviously irritated, claimed that no one attended Harriss rallies, then meandered into a false, viral story of migrants devouring pets in southwest Ohio.In Springfield, theyre eating the dogs, theyre eating the cats, he said.Talk about extreme! said Harris, with a laugh.The first debate between Trump and his unexpected opponent was, at times, the antithesis of Joe Bidens meltdown in Atlanta. Harris was often the aggressor, getting in crisp talking points that landed as planned, and spending less time than Biden bogged down in the weeds of her record and opportunity economy agenda. Trump didnt get trapped in his thoughts, as Biden had, or leave as obvious an opening for Harris to exploit, but he struggled to make his own case consistently.For most of the night, Harris executed a clear strategy. She invoked a fact from the Trump years that Democrats felt had been forgotten by voters since 2020, she said something that would set her opponent off, and then she used his familiar eruptions in response to urge voters to take the offramp on the Trump era.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/10/2024/kamala-harris-baited-donald-trump-into-a-debate-on-her-terms?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Kamala Harris baited Donald Trump into a debate on her terms"},{"text":"He actually said \\"we\\" before correcting to they.

They seek justice for all and protect the freedoms and strengths of the institutions that make America the best country on earth. This is a direct contrast to Trump who cares only about enriching himself and his billionaire friends, and seeks revenge on anyone who does not support him. \\nOn their social policies: Harris and walz support reproductive rights. She supports LGBT peoples rights. She supports racial justice and fights for voting rights for all. The Biden Harris administration also pushed for the most comprehensive bipartisan border reform bill. \\nOn economic issues: she is an advocate for consumer protections and free trade. She works to bring down costs of living for the middle class. She advocates for affordable healthcare for all so that nobody needs to die simply because they cannot afford medical treatment. The Biden Harris admin led the largest bipartisan infrastructure bill in decades. She supports labor unions and higher minimum wages. The Biden Harris administration has added more jobs than any other administration in modern history.\\nOn foreign policy: she is an experienced diplomat who supports a strong NATO and strong relationships with our allies. She supports Ukraine against Russia, one of our greatest adversaries and a threat to peace around the world. She has called for a ceasefire in Gaza to allow for humanitarian aid for people starving in Palestine. She is a strong proponent of acting to fix climate change alongside international treaties. \\nIn each of these areas Trump is doing the opposite, hurting the American economy, international status, and security of our country. He is bent on dividing us and instilling fear between groups in this country. He is the most harmful president we have ever had, and the only meaningful piece of legislation he passed in 4 years in office was a tax break for himself and other billionaires, which inflated our deficit at the cost to everyday Americans.","title":"In the Lion's Den at a Debate Watch Party with my Republican Friends"},{"text":"The undecided voters talking about how the economy was better under Trump need to get a fucking grip, my god.

As if we didnt have a slew of Federalist papers to prove it: there was no more consensus on hot button issues historically than there is now. There was compromise.So constitutionally speaking the right to an abortion didnt just materialize out of thin air as its own fully formed right. It was the culmination of a long line of precedent called substantive due process. Part of this is theorized as an implicit right from the 14th and 15th amendments (and the penumbras) that the People have a right, essentially, to privacy from the government. This post-Lochner line of precedent gave us first the right to contraception in marriage, then contraception generally, then abortion. Its also the framework to allow interracial marriage and same-sex marriage. Additionally some rights around raising your children as you see fit descend from this concept. But it could be used to have big implications outside family matters in the modern tech era. 1984 level implications. Right now its being used related to modern tech in family matters via IVF.Constitutionally speaking, in my opinion, we need to make Substantive Due Process stronger not weaken it with historically rooted theories from Dobbs. I mean, what will such an analysis mean for the future issues presented essential to basic dignity that our Founders couldnt fathom? And why should states decide? Constitutionally speaking one purpose of Federal Supremacy is to prevent states from committing systemic atrocities against citizens. And pointedly there are states banning abortions outright or instituting such restrictive rules and limited resources that as a practical matter they are banned. That literally means more pregnant people are will die. Ectopic pregnancies, the leading cause of death for pregnant women is intimate partner violence, pregnant people denied life saving care during miscarriages. Its happening now. And we already had staggering maternal death rates for a first world country. Why have a federal government keeping states in check if not to stop states from killing people?","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"\\"solve the middle east's problems\\" I hate to break it to you, but the US is the root cause of the Middle East's problems","title":"Palestinian Americans waiting for Harris to show shes different from biden on gaza"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|3o7qDSOvfaCO9b3MlO|downsized)","title":"Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris for President"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|MZocLC5dJprPTcrm65)","title":"Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris for President"},{"text":"Ive been trying to get my parents to acknowledge what youve typed here.

I strongly disagree.First \\"The right to privacy\\" is often shortened to that. But the full right to privacy makes so much sense and you almost will always feel like you should have it when presented with a case of the government violating it.Legally, the right of privacy is a basic law[^(\\\\[45\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy#cite_note-46)?which includes:1. The right of persons to be free from unwarranted publicity\\n2. Unwarranted appropriation of one's personality\\n3. Publicizing one's private affairs without a legitimate public concern\\n4. Wrongful intrusion into one's private activitiesFor the health care sector where medical records are part of an individual's privacy,?All of those sound like right that you should have and want.Now to the constitutional part.First it is important to know that what made the US constitution so special at the time as a foundation doctrine was the idea that Rights weren't \\"given\\" to the people by the government, but that the people possessed them inherently and the people gave the government \\"powers\\". This idea that people had rights and the government only had the power to do what the collective populace wanted them to do was new at the time.In removing the Right to Privacy the Conservatives on the Supreme Court said explicitly in their ruling that because the Right to Privacy wasn't listed in the constitution it isn't a right, or at best is a weaker right.This actually directly flies in the face of the 9th amendment.The Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that?the Constitution's enumeration of certain rights does not deny or disparage other rights that people retain.?The amendment was ratified on December 15, 1791 and is part of the Bill of Rights.The proper question to ask is \\"Does the US Government have the power to tell you that in the privacy of your own home, or doctors office you can't make your own medical decisions\\" And does it have the power to \\"Demand to know about those decisions and your medical state whenever it wants.\\"Really the best argument that the decision to roll back this right is wrong is two things. This is the first time EVER that a right recognized by the courts has been taken away.Second, read the two SC rulings and the logic. The one in favor of the right to privacy makes sense and cites great legal theory and logic. The new one rolling it back cites some 15th century judge known for sentencing witches to be burned at the stake and ties itself in knots to rip away a right.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"Umm...

The Constitution says nothing about your right to marry someone of your choosing, or your right to purchase and use contraceptives, or your right to to be free from discrimination (be it racial, gender, ethnic, religious..etc) or your right to travel, but those are are basic, fundamental rights that are mentioned exactly nowhere in the Constitution that you have always taken for granted. So if abortion can be a state-by-state issue because it's not enumerated in the Constitution, so can most things that you would *never* suggest should be ok like that. I mean, I assume you would never suggest that anti-miscegenation laws should be state-by-state.The one thing the Constitution *does* explicitly say in the 9th Amendment is that that we all have a lot of rights that aren't enumerated in the Constitution, and that just because a right isn't enumerated doesn't mean you don't have it. So if your argument is simply that \\"nothing in the Constitution guarantees the right to abortion,\\" then it's a bad argument not only from a logical standpoint but also from a Constitutional standpoint, because that's not what the Constitution even says!","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"Based","title":"Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris for President"},{"text":"Ravens are trash","title":"Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"Tell me one thing that came from her mouth that needed fact checking?","title":"Don't think.....Just do."},{"text":"At one point that crazy old man screamed shes having them perform trans surgeries on illegal Immigrants in prisons!

Mass immigration benefits the financial interests of the unscrupulous ruling class because it drastically lowers wages / provides endless streams of cheap foreign labor, causes housing crises, and creates a vast sea of sheepish, easily-controlled people. Third world immigrants are exceptionally beneficial to the ruling elite because, when a society in the Global North is inundated with individuals from the Global South, it decreases social cohesion, hampers collective consciousness, destroys the nation's identity (people with a shared identity are more likely to come together and revolt against a corrupt government), lowers the public's expectations of the government (many third worlders don't know what an accountable government actually looks like because that simply doesn't exist in their countries), leads to the breakdown of worker's unions, and produces inter-group conflicts that distract the populace from the prolific crimes of the ruling elite. Ironically, even Karl Marx was opposed to mass immigration. He understood that it decimates unions and helps big corporations get rich at the expense of the citizenry. 2. There is a global plot  which is being purposefully orchestrated by criminal global elites and is currently underway in every single Western country on Earth  to artificially induce the ethnocide of ethnic Europeans on all continents.","title":"The establishment is trying to replace American citizens with 3rd world illegals.

If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country. Recently I was made aware that AI of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades. Ive done my research, and Ive made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find its much easier to vote early. Ill link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

Many would argue that the right to decide when and with whom to have children is so fundamental to people's pursuit of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that all Americans should have that right protected under the spirit of the constitution.You're right though that it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the constitution, which is no surprise considering that women were excluded from being represented in government at the time, despite them openly requesting to be included. In fact only white, land-owning men were represented in government, so of course the original constitution reflected explicit rights that would be mainly relevant to this group. That said, they did know the importance of allowing the constitution to be amended should the people decide that certain rights were worth mentioning. I think that bodily autonomy with regards to abortion is one such right, and many feel that it should be included as an amendment.It's also worth noting that at the time, nobody expected the issue of abortion to become controversial in the way it is today. Terminating a pregnancy was completely legal in all states under common law at the time before the \\"quickening\\" that typically happens between 18 to 21 weeks of pregnancy (not too far off of what roe v wade later established).","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"Oh man.

If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.?Recently I was made aware that Al of 'me' falsely endorsing Donald Trump's presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around Al, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.?I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.?I've done my research, and l've made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it's much easier to vote early. I'll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.??With love and hope,??Taylor Swift Childless Cat Lady","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 7 (Post-Debate Thread)"},{"text":"It's over now","title":"Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Took his lunch money","title":"Donald Trump Goes Off Script in Debate With Kamala Harris: Theyre Eating the Dogs, Eating the Cats"},{"text":"Yooo big shit","title":"Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris for President"},{"text":"FINALLY!
