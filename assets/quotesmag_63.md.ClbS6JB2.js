We had four years of Biden, and people are feeling the economy is worse than ever in their everyday lives, and people are feeling that democracy is under threat more than every in their everyday lives. They don't see four more years of the same policies as the answer to that.There are a lot of excuses as to why the Democrats couldn't do anything else than what they did. That to a degree goes out the window given that SCOTUS legalized the imperial presidency. Biden could have done literally anything, the president is no longer constrained by legality, but he was constrained by his own political imagination and a party that insists that even if their rivals don't have to play by the rules, they do. But even beyond that, even playing by the rules, Kamala could have split from the status quo and shown voters that she was going to be a radically different president than Biden.

Trump is up ~1-200k (largely from majority-Latino areas in NYC). Harris is down nearly a million from Biden. The \\"big swing right\\" in New york is apathy from previously-Democratic voters. More backlash against shitty state-level Democrats and the brutal housing market than any commentary on Harris.Exhibit 2: Texas: Estimated total vote counts are going to be nearly identical to 2020. Trump gained half a million votes by poaching from Biden/Harris, mostly among Latino voters. Immigration crackdown plays better than the left expected in that community, and cultural values align pretty well with evangelicals (the apparent bigotry from right-wingers is the big case to make for Latinos voting Dem... and they're not buying it anymore).Exhibit 3: Colorado. Vote totals AND vote share very nearly mirror 2020 for both candidates. Denver's economy/housing market have been more stable, state Democratic party isn't nearly as corrupt or inept as New York's, so Trump didn't make many gains.Exhibit 4: Pennsylvania. Slightly higher overall ballot returns. Voter %'s are incredibly close either way. But Trump winds up 100k ahead instead of 80k behind. Tiny-ass change relative to the national trend, but Philadelphia having some of that housing-prices/economic concerns shifted just enough turnout to flip it. Pseudo-exhibit 5: California is tracking to wind up looking a lot like New York as far as total vote percentages, but at only 57% reporting, it's less conclusive.

There are few anomalies like 2020, 1960, 1964, 1968 all of which hit 60-65% turnout. 2020 made mail in ballots easier in every state. People that are too lazy or apathetic to vote didn't have to show much of any effort to vote. Even with how easy it was to vote we only had a 62% turnout which is a tie with 1960 (percentage not by volume). People simply don't care. In my area it was raining most of the day and people had to wait in the rain to vote. For someone not motivated to vote they were not going to do that. Additionally, some states don't allow mail in ballots to be counted until the other ballots are counted. Some states don't allow mail in ballots to be processed at all until voting ends on election day (which logistically is dumb). The mail ballots have to have signatures checked, the ballots opened, tabulated, and if the machine rejects any of them the election staff have to fill out a new ballot and then whoever is the watch person for each party has to verify and approve that the new ballot matches the intention of the errored ballot. Since some states don't close their polling until 8-9pm they don't get to start this process until 8-9pm. Election staff and clerks offices are small.

Certainly on the level of all of society, this is a piece of advice that will have more negatives than positives. On the level of an individual, I do think you should have the personal right to choose not to associate with people for whatever reason - from them being racist to you being racist to you not liking the way they laugh. That is different from whether it's the morally right thing to do, however. I'm personally of the opinion that you should only go no-contact with people who are actually abusive to you or those you love. If your grandma believes Mexicans are entering illegally and stealing all the jobs, but treats your Mexican girlfriend with respect, dignity, and love, you shouldn't just abandon her. If anything, being around someone in a group they dislike can help them understand how their opinions of the group are flawed (as long as they aren't actually attacking or abusing that person). I also disagree that MAGA is inherently the same thing as racist. There is a correlation, but not everyone who wants America to improve and uses that slogan inherently is racist.","title":"CMV: Having racist family that you actively choose to hang out with is still wrong"},{"text":"Too soon to guess now; but id imagine they would be pretty gun shy about running a woman?","title":"The Miscalculations That Sent Kamala Harris to a Devastating Loss"},{"text":"Why are you asking us?","title":"The chair of the Texas Democrats just apologized for comments about transgender people.

And the mainstream dem?position has literally been supportive of universal healthcare since 2008, with every presidential candidate running so far saying they wish to expand it. Do people even understand what the ACA is even more??The ACA is literally supposed to be a copy of a European universal healthcare model. It is almost quite literally a copy and paste of the healthcare model used in Germany and Netherlands. I blame Bernie for destroying universal healthcare discourse. Everyone seems to think now Medicare for all is equivalent to universal healthcare, when in reality it is literally only one of the three models, and has probably been the least effective model demonstrated to date. Bernie is copying Canada, Obama was copying the Netherlands which multiple studies was constantly placing Netherlands at the top for healthcare.Kamala literally said she wanted to expand the ACA and that healthcare should be a right.

Bernie sanders comes to mind as an obvious choice an Im not even a bernie sanders fan personally but he would of won easy against Trump. He also would of broken records in campain funding as well. He also represented what Americans wanted this election as far as policy changes an a shift to supporting the working class more. Trump didn't win on the grounds that he got more votes then ever because he didn't. he won because for the first time in yrs dem an undecided voters didn't turn out To vote for harris like they did for Biden last election.\\n\\"For 4 years Harris was trusted to be the replacement for an octogenarian potus with age related health issues. It wasn't a stretch for her to step in in July, and she left nothing on the field.\\"That's misleading for one, harris was not chosen to be the replacement for a man with health issues. She was chosen to be a replacement for president Joe Biden if an only if he died an only as the presidential replacement not the canadiate. this is not new an saying that's how it works witch a lot of ppl seem to be doing is just not true an never has been. Most Americans were not aware Biden was actually senile until the bad debate. an that's what it is senile. It's not as you put it \\"an octogenarian potus with age related health issues\\" he's senile they told us all it was a stutter. If we disagreed with this their  supporters like trump supporters would yell at us aggressively until we let it go. An Unlike shady things trump does the media refuses to ignolage most of the time when Biden or harris do anything even slightly shifty. Making it hard for ALot of Americans to see when they do something wrong so when they get caught red handed it stings to us that much more.\\"She had 100 days to reintroduce herself to the entire country, and you think they should have shoehorned in a second primary election as well, and this doesn't seem absurd to you?\\"For the first time in over 100something years Americans didn't get to vote on the presidential candidates. When you say this to their supporters The only response they have in defense is to say what emounts to they only had 100days to fix a problem they spent years creating until it blew up in there face last minute. Well often ignoring the fact that Biden is a senile old man. In my 40 years of life I've known many many people that were senile at the end of their lives. not one of them was capable of taking care of them self's yet alone an Intire country. when it blew up in their face instead of admitting wrong they called him a hero and kept him in power. That's incredibly dangerous and shows a complete lack of caring about the well-being and safety of the American people. It's like putting someone with Down syndrome in the presidential office an refusing to take him out when ppl are worried about it. it's just as dangerous and stupid is anything Trump's done.\\n\\"She had 100 days to reintroduce herself to the entire country, and you think they should have shoehorned in a second primary election as well, and this doesn't seem absurd to you?\\"\\nAlso to answer the last part of your question yes 100%.another canadiate would of had a much better chance even in just 100days. I'm not a personal fan of Bernie sanders but he would of brought voters out even in just 100days. He would of won much Much more likely then not. They through harris in knowing she pulled bad an wasn't like as a canadite from the get go. After all There was large out pouring of ppl online expressing when they chose her.\\"I'm saying that as someone who would rather have had someone else, but I'm also grown up enough to be able to distinguish between less than perfect, and a total shit show, something my fellow liberals clearly aren't able to muster.\\"Problem is she wasn't less then perfect. she was an unknown when it came to policies an what she'd do an despite the claims of the Democrat supporters defending her baslesly during her Intire campain all she's shown to the American ppl is that she wiling to put the ppl in danger for her own means an she won't own up to any of it at all. Her Intire campain was about getting trump an had nothing to do with her as a person and or candadate. Even the prosicuter thing was used as a gimmick to say she was going to prosicuter Trump an not much more.\\"I'm also grown up enough to be able to distinguish between less than perfect, and a total shit show, something my fellow liberals clearly aren't able to muster.\\" \\" If your so mature why are you ending your reply with the implication that other librals aren't as mature as you because they don't agree with you.

Election abnormalities have to be challenged.  Notice I am not specifying anything in particular like fraud.  I said \\"abnormalities.\\"This was the big problem with 2020.  There were countless abnormalities, and most of it stemmed from late chances to voting procedures and allowances due to COVID.  Conservatives did not like that at all because on the one hand they were being told it was time to move past COVID while at the same time being told the rules governing voting needed to change because of COVID.  And it needs to be pointed out that years after that election those changes were found by multiple courts to be unconstitutional, so that only adds to the sense many have that 2020 was unjust.  You do have a problem with colloquial language and pedantic buffoonery on the other. Conservatives foolishly used a common, low brow vernacular to refer to everything they saw wrong about 2020.  That term was \\"fraud.\\"  Well, it wasn't fraud, not by legal definition at least.  But liberals pounced on that and used to declare people guilty of pushing \\"misinformation\\" and proceeded to have them censored or taken to court.  That was liberal being stupidly and dishonestly pedantic.  They knew damn well what everyone was referring to.  And at the same time Conservatives knew dam well that \\"fraud\\" was an insufficient blanket term, and they were too stubborn and lazy to address the issue properly.If liberals see any abnormalities in the voting or counting process, I strongly encourage them to avail themselves of their legal rights to file challenges and request recounts.  And unlike Georgia who violated its own law to deny people hearings, I would urge every court to speedily litigate any and all challenges.  Challenging election results is not inherently bad or wrong.  If something needs clarification, transparency, or reversal for faith in the system to remain healthy, then that's what needs to happen.  But anyone making those challenges needs to educate themselves first on the issue and speak to it precisely and properly.  And people who don't like the challenge should engage in the process in good faith regardless.","title":"Democrats denying the results of the election Part II"},{"text":"You think that advocating for trans people is how Dems lost this election?

Back when Biden announced his intention to run again, I believed he should have refused to run for a second term, instead choosing to throw his support behind whomever emerged as the primary winner, while laying low and putting up guardrails in case of a Trump re-election.But now the history books will see this presidency as a stop gap effort that tried to pick up the pieces before the next storm arrived. An economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped in and was forced to oversee a recovery. Republicans took advantage of these crises to point fingers and rally their voters around wedge issues and disingenuous campaign talking points, preferring to run on blaming their opponents for the fallout and outcomes that were rooted in causes spanning back years. And now Trump will be inheriting a growing economy, *again*, which is frustrating to say the least. He will take credit for everything he can take credit for, and will avoid taking responsibility for anything that might tarnish his legacy in the eyes of his supporters.Under Trump's last term:- The Natl Debt ballooned by nearly 40 percent\\n- He started a trade war with China\\n- He pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge \\n- He championed tax cut legislation that did not \\"pay for itself\\", and disproportionately and permanently benefitted the rich and corporations. This legislation is estimated to cost the government trillions\\n- His admin took several actions to make it more difficult for workers to unionize and for unions to operate effectively.\\n- He mishandled the covid pandemic at nearly every turn, and left office with the economy in tatters. *All of these things, by comparison, contributed more to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the next administration*- He cozied up to dictators and autocrats around the globe\\n- His foreign policy was disastrous, he escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our position as peace brokers, emboldened and enabled Putin's agenda, withdrew from the working non proliferation agreement with Iran, negotiated with terrorists, weakened our alliances, strengthened our enemy's geopolitical positions, and instituted tariffs that did far more harm than good, among other things.His presidency helped preserve a GOP agenda that's been redistributing wealth to the top and crippling the labor movement for decades. And of course, he facilitated an attack on our Capitol.Not to mention, he's been the most divisive, incendiary political figure in recent memory. He's been a beacon for hate groups, a leader for extremists and conspiracy theorists, a demagogue appealing to the worst impulses, the victimhood and the grievances of Americans, and he's empowered an ultra nationalistic, nativist, anti-intellectual, xenophobic, chauvinistic movement in this country. A movement of people who are extremely cynical, cautious, paranoid and intolerant of not just foreigners, but of a long list of fabricated boogeymen and deep state machinations. Trump is a symptom of a disease yes, but a symptom, nonetheless, that should send you to the emergency room. It was of necessity that Trump be voted out in 2020, two consecutive Trump terms would have been far more damaging. Biden's transitional presidency was supposed to be that trip to the emergency room... But now, he's been sandwiched in between two Trump terms, and we're leaving the hospital against medical advice. However, we should, at the very least, find some consolation in the fact that the last four years might mitigate some of the damage to come, or at a minimum, provide some obstacles for Republicans where there would have been none otherwise.But when all is said and done, Trump won with about the same amount of voters as the last election. Democrats, on the other hand, had considerably lower turnout. The \\"shifts\\" in demographics voting Republican have more to do with this statistically. Democrats did not do an effective job at informing receptive voters of basic things like Trump's true economic and foreign policy record. They also failed to communicate on immigration. Specifically the part about Republicans exploiting it as a wedge issue for years, preferring fearmongering tactics, and extreme, non viable \\"solutions\\" over practical, humane, economically considerate policies. What's more, Democrats were forced to shoehorn in a candidate at the last minute that millions of Democrats didn't turn out for because an effective case wasn't made and the party didn't account for things that should have been accounted for, like how in some cases, especially when it comes to low propensity voters, they care far more about their immediate circumstances than any threat to democracy, which is unfortunate yes, but a reality for some Americans.And sadly, this may also include the idea that some Americans just aren't willing to vote for a woman when the alternative is a perceived strongman, especially when a culture and \\"crisis\\" of masculinity is on the rise, regardless of its legitimacy. Democrats miscalculated how little Americans care about Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional rhetoric, how some may think Trump's absurdity renders him benign, because, for some reason, Trump has been sane washed and normalized by the media and general public. They also may have miscalculated how many Americans just aren't tuned into it, or how many Americans were verging on apathy. Either way, it was a miscalculation.Walter Lippman once called the general public an \\"irrational force.\\" A message that should resonate with some of us now more than ever. He was dismayed by the fact that voters don't often make politically informed decisions, they make *feelings* based decisions. And that's what got Trump elected, feelings.","title":"The Miscalculations That Sent Kamala Harris to a Devastating Loss"},{"text":"Might get downvoted, but wasnt Bernie just as much a part of this as loss the rest of the Democrats?","title":"Bernie Sanders crashes Kamala Harriss stubborn farewell speech"},{"text":"I'd like to add that as of now, there's 2% votes going to other candidates.

Too many people see them as captured resistance and  as effete elites who think neoliberal tinkering is preferable to systematic changes. Voters are turned off by a party establishment that feels entitled to the votes of minority groups and yet constantly fails to take aggressive action on their stated goals. Is that feeling fair and totally anchored in reality? A LOT of democrats are sitting around saying fuck no to that question right now. But the reality is that they lost, apparently fair and square, and the party needs to figure out how it is going to build an active coalition going forward. Its not going to be by propping up slimeballs like newsome and Shapiro and fetterman who spend their time and energy browbeating activists and courting conservatives.

Basically every party in control during the covid recovery got shellacked. I think the biggest take away from this election is that it was the Republican Partys to lose, and the fact that it was close at all is due to Trump continuing to be pretty unpopular.Lets also remember that neither Biden nor Harris is great at messaging. Both of them did remarkably few interviews, where they could have gotten their message about economic recovery out. Its pretty hard to shape the narrative if you just disengage from the media. Harris had a good debate, but shes not a great extemporaneous speaker and mostly avoids opportunities to do it. My sense is that voters never really felt like they knew her. Even just speaking for myself, while she definitely had policy proposals its hard to identify her with a signature policy proposal.Also, Harris has never been especially popular. She won over Democratic partisans this summer, but she has never gained national traction. Its not surprising that someone who flamed out early during her primary run also lost an election, especially with an unfavorable playing field. We can and should blame Biden for a) choosing such a mid politician as his VP in the first place, and b) not stepping aside early enough to have a real contest.I think the next move is pretty straightforward: have a vigorous primary and choose someone charismatic. Bonus points if they arent from California (its my home state but is not a good brand for voters). While were at it, lets fix blue state governance so we have a plausible case for voters that our policies actually work. Ideally all the dinosaurs retire to facilitate the rebrand.

They view the Democratic Party as the establishment, and people are increasingly suspicious and resentful of the establishment. This is true regardless of age, race, gender, or background. The Harris Campaign did a catastrophically horrible job of trying to address this. They did not highlight the work the Biden Admin did for working people; recognize the very real economic pain middle and lower income families face due to inflation; and refused to take every chance she was given to criticize the Biden Admin.There have been successful efforts to keep the far right from taking over governments in France and Mexico recently because the left-leaning governments at the time made an aggressive push to pass reforms and advocate for itself, and promise to change. This worked, and any critical effort to fend off Trump would have recognized this. I heard Bernie himself highlight these efforts as what the Harris campaign should model around the DNC.But the Harris campaign did not do this. They instead adopted the recently successful campaign style of the left-leaning Labour Party in the UK, which elevated center-left candidates and said, Well, Im at least not the other guy. You can highlight the reforms, cooperation with unions, and the picket line photo-op all you want, but I saw almost none of this in her campaign rallies or speeches. I hardly saw any of this in advertisement. It really felt like the campaign ultimately settled on, well, at least Im not the other guy. That was a foolish mistake. This only worked for the Labour Party because **they were not the ones in charge**. The conservative Tory Party was, for over a decade, and they were the ones who initiated Brexit, mishandled COVID, lost the people billions of dollars, and failed to address inflation. In the US, it doesnt matter if so much of the current pain was caused by Republicans and Trump's lingering policies. It doesnt matter if the Biden Admin cant directly regulate the federal reserve. It doesnt matter if Trump's economic plan is going to make things worse. None of that matters. People hear these as excuses to not help them now, and an adherence to institutions they no longer think benefit them. Polls and focus groups have said this for months. The Democrats are the ones in charge now, and they failed to reach this moment.","title":"Sanders Slams 'Big Money Interests' and Consultants That Control Democratic Party After Loss to Trump | \\"While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\\" said the Vermont Independent. \\"And they're right.\\""},{"text":"She ran a very good campaign.

Kamala Harris tardiness in?[giving a concession address?](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/kamala-harris-concession-speech-in-full/)was even worse than Hillary Clintons notorious no-show on election night in 2016.?[Joe Bidens half-hour delay to his national address today](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/07/joe-biden-speech-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris/)?was comparatively brief, but still remarkably careless.After the landslide victory of Donald Trump, with the likely possibility of the Republican candidate carrying the popular vote along with the electoral college, America would naturally be curious as to what their still-sitting President thought about the whole affair. He?*may*?have called[?MAGA supporters garbage?](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/did-joe-biden-call-trump-supporters-garbage-election/)a few days before polls closed, but anything can happen in a week.And so you may be disappointed to learn that Bidens speech was uncharacteristically to the point, lasting a little under ten minutes. After the obligatory nod to the centuries-long experiment of American self-governance, the President acknowledged that the will of the people always prevails with a remarkably upbeat expression.This was an appeal to unity, to continuing the struggle for the soul of America while honouring the institutions that bind the nation together. A barely-veiled admonishment to respect the integrity of elections and the officials who work in them may have felt targeted at the opposing party, but could equally apply to the[?paranoia of progressive activists](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/liberal-horror-at-trumps-victory-is-about-to-turn-into-elec/)?unwilling to accept the reality of a Trump landslide.Dropping to a comforting (and almost hard to hear) whisper, Biden offered a message of reassurance for his supporters. Giving up is unforgivable. Hes too old to be a father of the nation, but this was a pretty good bid to be its grandfather.Winking at the crowd of staffers, he looked a decade younger C not that that makes much of a difference at 81 C and spoke with a clarity rarely heard in the later portion of his doomed re-election campaign. It was hard to escape the impression that this was the happiest Biden had been in a long, long time.That shouldnt come as a surprise. It would be impossible for the famously irascible Joe Biden not to feel some degree of?[schadenfreude at the outcome of the election](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/01/is-joe-biden-trying-to-sabotage-kamala-harris-campaign/). As Harris jetted across the nation, Biden had been left sidelined during his own presidential term, moping around the White House.The Democrats took a schizophrenic approach to the sitting Presidents role in the Harris campaign. They were initially glad he had done the statesmanlike thing and stood aside (after the?*New York Times*, scores of senior Dems, and major donors demanded it, of course) and so ran a unified front, with Harris saying in an interview that there was not one thing she would have done differently had she been Biden.Unity could only last so long: campaign operatives were reminded that Bidens apparent senility wasnt the only reason he was pressured into handing the reins to Harris. Approval of the administration was at an all time low, with many?[experiencing Bidenomics as Bidenflation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/11/06/fears-fresh-wave-global-inflation-trump-victory/). Harris began stressing that her presidency would not be a continuation of Joe Bidens. Biden was a creature to be scorned, at the very least ignored: even the First Lady seemed to avoid mentions of her husband during swing-state stump speeches.And it was all for naught. The Democratic party machine failed miserably against Trump. Kamalas campaign of joy failed to inspire; the billion dollars raised might as well have been chucked into the Atlantic. Perhaps the Biden campaign had been right in suggesting that flipping to a candidate even less popular than the sitting President was a fools errand.Joe Bidens long lame-duck autumn will make the coming months easier to swallow. As the party cannibalises itself, there may be great comfort in resigning to his personal quarters and mapping out the location of his presidential library. To hell with em all C Obama, Harris, Pelosi. At least he can comfort himself that he managed to beat Trump once. That was more than they ever managed.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/07/joe-biden-seemed-delighted-that-kamala-harris-lost/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/07/joe-biden-seemed-delighted-that-kamala-harris-lost/)","title":"'Smiling, winking, Biden looked delighted that Kamala Harris lost'"},{"text":"Dude you cant be serious","title":"Joe Biden considers Ukraine and pardons in twilight of presidency"},{"text":"Hunter was already in hot water at that point.But they would have made it clear that they would remove him fast enough that he wouldn't be allowed to pardon Hunter, and they would really lower the boom at sentencing time.","title":"Biden is the happiest man in America today"},{"text":"For the record, I'm not against expanding the child tax credit.

You can't keep taking the progressive, black, Latino votes for granted and just assume they show up in sufficient numbers.

Harris neglected that voter base, confident the democratic core is enough or that those voter groups would certainly vote for her in force. Clinton made the same mistake in 2016. Obama did the same thing in 2008/12, but it didn't really matter bc the GOP was weak then. Biden tried to do it this year but dropped out and tried to do it last election, but was forced by the primary system to better engage progressives. And like, progressives still didn't like him, but it was enough to convince them the dnc isn't actively suppressing the progressive voice like they think the dnc did in 16 and 24, so they showed up in force.

This is a double standard because theres nothing different about these two groups that would mean one should get to drink soda in class and the other shouldnt When something situationally significant IS different about the two groups, no then its not a double standard.

Respectfully, thats a narrative I mostly saw discussed within this subreddit and in conspiracy-focused channels or Discords. I also noticed posts pointing out that both parties have celebrity connections, with photos circulating of both candidates in situations that could be perceived as questionable.For most Democrats, the issue is less about individual controversies and more about wanting a leader who embodies inclusivity, something they feel aligns with their values and way of life. Similarly, the majority of conservatives are focused on preserving their way of life, which they see as grounded in their own core values. Both sides are driven by a desire to support what feels like an authentic representation of their beliefs and priorities. And then theres those on both side just there to casually fuel the flames. I mean this from the bottom of my heart: the only way we move forward as Americans, and not as Conservatives versus Democrats (which, as I said, I very much agree with in your last statement), is by actually carrying the burden of responsibility and acknowledging when we, as AMERICANS, are wrong.As a Democrat, I will never leave this sub because it truly is one of the few places on Reddit where I see open and free discussion on issues that get downvoted in more popular threads. I acknowledge that our extremists (like you saw in those MAGA deportation posts on ULPT) have made the divide that much harder to bridge, but I will always want to hear what you all need as a society. For example, I fully embody most of RFKs health stancesas someone going to school to practice medicine, I religiously read through many of the concerns you bring up here about vaccines, food quality, Big Pharma, and so on.Unfortunately, I dont expect to get an answer here that acknowledges OPs point about this political tension being relatively peaceful outside of internet wars. Yet, Ive seen many posts from extremists on the conservative side claiming that the libs will start a civil war, refuse to hand over power peacefully, or try to overthrow the government.","title":"If the Democrats rig elections, why are they so totally committed to peacefully transfering power to Republicans?"},{"text":"Sure but line go steep or less steep doesnt require understanding of derivatives.

Maybe theyre the ones who no longer have an identity. Bernie seems to be saying Dems lost it more than Trump won it. Perhaps? They had the football and dropped it at the 1-yard line. Dems really need to pick a different identity than their woke, metoo, DEI nonsense and stop acting like social justice warriors.All the lib tears from young females is a repeat of 2016.

TikTok started to get more popular a few years later circa 2019-2020. These young females want to have abortions that can range from $500-$800 while most Americans cant afford groceries each week. Tell your man to use a condom or pull out! Use birth control. Damn. The 18-29 females who voted Kamala just want to be slutty like her 30-40 years ago. You can start doing the creampie finish once you start using birth control, you liberal skank.Reason why I dont buy Trump gear even though Ive been wanting to since 2020 is the fear of some random libtard with TDS waiting to vandalize my home or car. It only takes one. And I live in a city and county full of Trump supporters. Its almost like if we wear Trump gear, we are wearing a Nazi sign. Doesnt that suck? See how racists and bigots theyve become? But if they tell us theyre homosexuals, we need to accept it because were homophobes if we dont. Its ok to show gay pride but not wear Trump gear.We need to accept them for the freaks they are but they wont accept us if we support a so-called Nazi named Donald Hitler. DEI = Diversity, Equity, Inclusion. Dems give us none of that if we show support to Trump. We are not included. We will be censored, banned, suspended, ridiculed, attacked, vandalized, or fired like Gina Carano if we show any hint of supporting Trump.I ?? Mel Gibson. Im aware of his fall from grace. Said the n-word in his drunken tirade although hes still very good friends with Danny Glover. Went on an antisemitic tirade that got him blackballed in Hollywood which were started by Jews. But I love that he supports Trump.Maverick (1994) is one of my favorite movies of all-time and Im thinking of putting it No. 1 on my Letterboxd list thanks to Mel saying Kamala has an IQ of a fence post! My No. 1 was The Shawshank Redemption or Back to the Future Part II, but Tim Robbins and Lea Thompson have been against Trump. Zemeckis is a conservative from Illinois but who knows if he likes Trump? Jodie Foster is probably a lib too being a lesbian, but Jodie is still very close to Mel since filming Maverick over 30 years ago.Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel were blackballed from Hollywood after Mel did The Passion of the Christ and after as his drunken antisemitic tirade. Catholics like myself have been oppressed by American Christians who are mostly Protestants and Jews who control the media and entertainment industry.Ive seen Am I Racist? which was produced by Ben Shapiro. Matt Walsh basically pointed out that these libtards are a bunch of DEI grifters using race as a way to extract money from people. One happened to be a white lady writing books about racism. Racism only exists if you keep talking about it which the libs obviously do.As for illegal immigrants, how is that racist if Trump mass deported them? The keyword is ILLEGAL immigrants. Latinos for Trump INCREASED. They get it. How would you feel if a bus full of random strangers went to your property and decided to live there? We have immigration laws for a reason and they need to be upheld.Libtards have no education with the ins and outs of politics.

I believe Rudolf Steiner also predicted this time frame as the test for humanity against ahriman, who is an ancient zoroastrian (sorry for miss-spellings and typos) idea that represents materialism (and is the opposite evil of lucifer, who is the representative of G_d's \\"moral purity\\" and became the accuser who even Michael said nothing to defend himself against accusations by him, or even Yeshua (our salvation!) stayed quiet during the accusations thrown against him on the cross.  But lucifer is I believe what we see the secret societies (checkered board clubs) pushing behind the scenes, while materialism is pushed in the front scenes.  But we must learn to balance the two evils that are the two separate worlds colliding with Earth, and we must walk in between them as he did.  I've tried reading as much on different culture prophecies that point to the same thing as I can, so this post is awesome.  If I understand it correctly, we will be / are being tested between the material and the moral (body and spirit).  Jesus showed us the way to do this by remaining away from material possessions, but also was able to question morality by showing love and mercy as being the highest forms of morality that can overcome all (when he said the priests had cleaned the outside of their cups but the inside of the cup was unclean).    This is a side note that is my own thoughts, but I also think the Red-Man myth being a material path is fascinating when you consider that no human has put their name on as many bricks and buildings on this planet than Red-Man...a fitting tribute to materialism if there ever was one, especially considering all the passages about how inportant having a name on a brick in heaven is for the lampshades of Earth, I would imagine putting your name on a brick on Earth has some unknown implications, but again, this is more my thibking than anything I can directly point to.  Best of luck in your moral quest!  It is very difficult to walk the minefield of traps right now.

I don't know why people think Trump will bring about any positive change, but he was able to motivate most of the 74 million who voted for him last time. The Dems needed to pull their head out of their ass in 2016 after they failed with Hilary, who no one truly liked other than because, \\"she's a Clinton and a woman\\". But no, they ran Biden for the Obama nostalgia crew and ran on \\"end the Trump white house before they take it too far\\"  and it worked well enough. Then they dragged their feet with the legal cases and basically confirmed everyone's suspicions that the law doesn't apply to everyone, and let him slide, despite him literally being a traitor for MULTIPLE reasons. Then they run Kamala. Another candidate no one really likes or even knows anything about, but she's a woman, and a woman of color at that! Because what Hilary was missing was some pigment in her skin! That would've made her win! The Dems keep playing the same cards over and over and they wonder why the pattern has gotten old and they have to work so hard to get people motivated enough to care. They couldn't do it when threatened with fucking Trump a third time. They failed 2 out of 3 times. Everyone has been so focused on the live action of the death of the Republican party to MAGA, they failed to realized the Democratic party is/was/has also died. I think it died the day they forced Hilary upon their own electorate. Her nomination divided the party in subtle ways they failed to see. Again, I feel like I have to stress, the only reason Biden won, was because Trump was incumbent and had the negative associations that went with it. He seemed more threatening then because he was already in office. Biden could have been replaced with any Dem who had a slight level of recognition and nothing would have been different in the 2020 election. Biden was an awful choice the first time, even worse the second and they still tried to make it happen. The sentiment in 2020 was, anyone but  Trump and then \\"They're really going to make me vote for Joe Biden\\" or does no one else remember that song? Obviously that tactic only worked once.

Half of the job is directing the government, the other half is using the bully pulpit to communicate your goals and accomplishments to the people. Biden had one good State of the Union speech and otherwise failed as a communicator.Harris was well positioned to explain how the current administration has helped avoid a recession the commentators said was inevitable. At the same time, she had the chance to show the voters that the Democrats hear the fears of the people and understand that increasing inequality has to be reversed.  She could take credit for the good and recognize where substantial change is needed.Instead she relied on the strategies that gave us president Hillary Clinton. Appeal to soccer moms, promise to maintain the status quo, rely on the insanity of your opponent. The bright side of Clinton's loss, to me, was that the Democrats would have to recognize that concentrating on placating the donor class won't cut it anymore.

The fact that you still have that string of a desire to be around someone whos beliefs should make you extremely uncomfortable if you arent racist, means that theres a reason youre still comfortable hanging out around that person despite them feeling that way. You dont feel racism as something thats bad enough for you to not want to be around that person simply because they are racist. I feel this especially heavy if you have close friends or and even more so if you have partner that is a different race than you. That means you can look past the fact that they are using slurs that are  against someone you love. Even if you dont have close friends or a partner its still pretty crazy that you can listen to that stuff and say well its not me who thinks it. Let me just keep spending time with them!. If your family member had been behaving inappropriately towards children or verbally abusive to abuse family member would you feel the same? Probably not and that shows how you view racism 2. Its incredibly self centered. Oh I enjoy hanging out with this family member even if theyre racist. Yes because it doesnt affect you. Of course people want to justify looking the other way towards stuff that doesnt affect them.

Consider all of the demonstrably and objectively verifiable false information he spouts, and the length his followers will go to to triangulate between \\"he tells it like it is . . .\\" vs \\"what he really meant to say was . . . \\"So the problem this leads to is that calling out bullshit is effectively pointless - because the truth value was never the aim. Now those statements get amplified, and rebound around the social media sphere, and engagement metrics ensure that bombastic content will travel around the world thrice before the fact check get's its shoes on, and it becomes virtually impossible to meaningfully engage with what is objectively nonsense (eg. Haitians eating dogs and cats).So combatting this requires, I would argue, at least 1 of the following options 1) a set of \\"captured\\" social media personalities who can keep the message foregrounded regardless of the (tv and newspaper) news cycle, 2) the willingness of the party to effectively lie, or simplify topics to the point of virtual nonsense, to capture low-engagement or low-information voters, or 3) voters not demanding ideal (or sometimes even good) candidates and enthusiastically and consistently voting for the least-bad option.","title":"Harris Tried to Win Over Republicans.

He's a convicted criminal and there's literally no doubt that he committed these crimes and even more.Voting for him last time could be chalked up to an attempt to try something new.  A different kind of candidate.   But after witnessing January 6th and being given insider information about him from people on his own team.  After watching people who are even worse than him hitch their wagon to him because of his clout and pull.   How is HE specifically so appealing/?Why did he win over Tim Scott or Vivek to Gabby Tulsi  who are ALL  Republicans and conservative but DECENT versions of it?No contact is 100% the way to go.   Absolutely.   And cutting off financial support,  YES.   You know why?    Because people who are fans of his are so stupid economically I can guarantee you what is going to show up after he takes office in January.      Many government workers and teachers etc who get government funded paychecks will file their taxes in February.   And so they will get their tax refund early.  I guarantee you 100% that these idiots will suddenly see an influx of cash in their bank accounts and  say \\"See,  once he got back in office my fiances improved.\\"I know someone I'm cutting off for exactly this reason.

So now they turn around and vote for him again?    No problem.   I'll just keep my money for me then.A lot of us have realized that trying to talk reason into someone who is willfully ignorant and votes for  HIM specifically,   is pointless.   They are also usually selfish people.  So the only way they are going to LEARN is to personally feel the effects of voting for him.

And this includes yes, distinguishing themselves from Biden. That's the only way messaging on the economy would work while your own party is in the WH.Biden screwed us. I will never forgive his selfishness and arrogance. And clearly we were duped by him and the DNC into believing he'd be fine cognitively. I don't think people on the left understand the magnitude of how much Biden is despised by the American public (right or wrong), plus I don't think people on the left understand how damaging that debate in June was to his equity and the equity of Democrats. It was an embarrassment and it became apparent that Biden and Democrats duped the public into believing Biden was fine cognitively. The subsequent scramble to anoint a candidate just weeks before the convention and less than four months before the election was also an embarrassment, even if it was necessary.He helped get through the most legislative accomplishments that I can remember in a presidential term in decades, but he also now paved the way for Trump 2.0 which will undo a lot of that and do a lot more damage in the process, so overall Biden is a net negative when you compile the last 4 years with the next 4.","title":"Democratic strategist issues hard truth to party members after losing election | CNN Politics"},{"text":"He was old in 2020.

It's voluntary.What kind of reasoning is this?I know they think everyone should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but we can't expect them to live up to the expectations they have forced upon everyone else, we're morally obligated to financially support them. Not because they're good people or anything, in fact they don't even think of you as deserving basic human rights, but still, we owe them our friendship and support &lt;3What is this, how to be a doormat 101?No thanks.Also - just an fyi. Votes are private. You have no way of knowing who someone voted for. \\"Voting\\" isn't the action that's being responded to.

Partially thanks to social media, disinformation from China, Russia and the fact that we live in a fast paced, selfish reality that is alienating us while feeling no empathy towards each other.

Sholz the German chancellor is kinda the same thing, but you can see if you watch the past elections tendencies is that even in such civil societies they lose grip slowly, because the wealth gap grows and grows between everyday people and the rich, and also corporations bought us out of our voting power.

I dont like the idea of injecting bad stuff into your body, which is basically what they do.\\nBut in 2020 he did a public interview with a flu vaccine developer, in the context of developing the COVID vaccine, and lead the conversation to how ineffective the previous year's flu vaccine was, extrapolated that the 34,000 influenza deaths occurred because vaccines aren't effective. And keynoted the conversation withYou take a solid flu vaccine  you dont think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona?Which the experts obviously said \\"no\\" to, but that closed the interview with the attitude that a vaccine maker thinks vaccine won't make an impact on COVIDAnd as soon as he left office he was calling COVID a hoax, implying at various times that it was either gone (thus no need to vaccinate), made up (you wouldn't vaccinate against a fictional virus), or mild (so not worth the intervention.) and spoke about increased vaccination and declining mortality as a hoax to try and make the Democrats look good. Undermining the utility.\\nAnd he's surrounded himself with antivaxers who are left to push their message under his camp without challenge. If he was pro vax he'd either contradict their messaging or instruct them to knock out off, or remove them from his platform. Not to \\"bring Hitler\\" into this, but Hitler didn't kill the Jews, he didn't open a gas valve, pull a trigger, arrest a family. He was just the party leader at the time, but it was his officers doing the genocide, he wasn't pro genocide at all, he even had Jewish heritage. You and I both know that statement is absolutely untrue.His VP elect, a man who's very likely to inherit the oval office, was spouting off about how vaccines do more harm than good during the campaign trail. And cited an unnamed mystery senator who's permanently injured because they recently took a vaccine.\\nAnd Trump has campaigned on a promise to remove funding from schools that require childhood vaccination... Those measles vaccines were real important when he was pandering to a community ravaged by measles, but suddenly they're unimportant.\\nAnd he's campaigned to ban adult vaccine mandates... Which aren't a thing outside of occupational hazards (eg TB tests, which end up being an innoculation, for elder care/hospital employees if they'll have direct contact with the sick/vulnerable)As recently as July he's repeating that vaccines cause autism.To his credit in 2019, he did sign an EO that ensured access to flu vaccines, and told parents in a high measles outbreak area that it was important to vaccinateAnd early in the COVID pandemic described the on development vaccine as \\"basically a flu shot\\" and when asked said he got his flu shot. And he's been reported to say in private that he's proud of warp speed developing a vaccine so fast but that he doesn't talk about it publicly because it's bad for the party. So truth be damned, party before public I guess.But that's on top of YEARS of shit talking vaccines...If I said \\"vaccines cause autism, vaccines are dangerous, vaccines hurt people, vaccines are full of terrible things, vaccines are safe, vaccines shouldn't be trusted, you shouldn't vaccinate\\" what was the tone of my message? Apparently you think I just said \\"vaccines are safe\\" while I read that as antivax.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"Never put it past the party that waves Confederate and Nazi flags to pretend they aren't the party of the KKK.","title":"CMV: Voter Retaliation is Wrong"},{"text":"Any justification or answer to your question from people who think 2020 was stolen will be as crazy as their belief.

Trying to manipulate a persons vote is wrong.All persuasion is manipulation, and the core systems of democracy and free speech accept that people can do whatever they want, within the bounds of the law, to persuade others. Another part of freedom of speech is freedom of association. It's our absolute right to choose who we do and do not want to spend our time around, just like it's our absolute right to choose what political positions we want to support and vote for. If someone might be made a little bit uncomfortable by how we choose to exerise our rights, that doesn't obligate us to change our behavior.Now, whether choosing to act in such a way is a good idea or not is debatable; maybe it isn't. But the right of people to make the choice about who they want to associate with (based on anything, including voting) is just as sarcosanct as the right of people to choose who they want to vote for in the first place. It's madness to try to limit the former in order to promote the latter.","title":"CMV: Voter Retaliation is Wrong"},{"text":"To help them? Nothing.

And a lot of government spending was necessary.Now if you look at Biden, the record is in fact worse. In 2021, federal deficit as a percent of GDP was 12%. Given we were already putting Covid behind us, there simply was no call for massive deficit spending. (This reckless spending is in large part why we would have red hot inflation in 2022.) I guess if you're partisan enough, you can say all of the 12% deficit was justified. But you cannot defend the deficit spending in 2022 or 2023. It was 5.3% in 2022 and 6.11% in 2023! For reference, federal deficit as percent of GDP at 6% is what you would expect in national emergencies like the Great Recession or Covid.The truth is national debt exploded under both Trump and Biden.

On the other hand, systemic conditions like heart disease could be influenced by sedentary behavior, but they typically have a more complex set of contributing factors, including diet, genetics, and other lifestyle choices.This is why it's important to distinguish between causal relationships and risk factors. Sedentary behavior increases the risk of developing certain conditions, like cardiovascular disease or diabetes, but it is rarely the sole cause, nor the cause.

What on earth could you mean by this? Sedentary lifestyles exacerbating or leading to the increased risk for various health concerns and complications seems pretty straightforward. Research generally points out that prolonged sedentary behavior correlates with issues like cardiovascular disease, obesity, and reduced health related quality of life. However, these studies, particularly the observational ones, highlight association rather than direct causation.Poor eating habits and other lifestyle choices do the same thing, what is your point? Also, if something observed repeat repeatedly in numerous studies over decades. Why are you choosing to ignore this? This is not the third time Ive asked you what exactly is your point in saying this?Again, it seems like you are making the claim that sedentary lifestyle leads to absolutely nothing just because the evidence leads to, observable and repeatable mind you, strong association and not a direct link.Well, eating fries and a lot of sodium does the same thing because not everybody who does this will directly have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Like what is your point? For example, systematic reviews emphasize that while sedentary lifestyles can worsen health markers, they often rely on adjusted models that factor in other lifestyle components, like diet and physical activity levels, which also impact outcomes. When physical activity levels are controlled, the direct link between sedentary behavior alone and certain health risks can appear less pronounced, suggesting that lifestyle and physical activity habits collectively influence health outcomes rather than sedentary time alone?.Again, nobody is ignoring how other lifestyle changes impact your life.

See, now this is why Im confused because you made it very clear in some of your comments that you just straight up ignore research. If there is long-term observational data that being sedentary actively hinders your health why are you ignoring that?Also, yes, being sedentary can be a standalone cause for why certain things happen. Like I pointed out, if you have a patient that starts to develop a pressure injury and they are otherwise fine its just that they literally do not like to get up enough. Well, I hate to break it to you, but being sedentary is why that pressure injury has developed.Its unfortunate, but you also see this a lot in nursing homes with older people who unfortunately just due to the natural aging process they dont get around that often so, yeah, they develop pressure injuries. You also have people that quite literally cannot walk around so they have a sedentary lifestyle due to their limited mobility and, again, this leads to pressure injuries.It almost seems like youre saying sedentary lifestyles dont contribute to literally anything, that is just objectively wrong.\\n Im not denying that sedentary behaviors can have negative effects especially in extreme cases, like being bedridden, where physical immobility directly leads to pressure injuries. But these are often more extreme than the day-to-day sedentary habits of most office workers, where factors like diet and lifestyle choices often play a more prominent role.Nobody is ignoring how diet and other lifestyle choices contribute to your health.

The fear of appeasement hangs heavy in the debate over what to do about Russia - attempts to meet Putin halfway in the past don't seem to quench his thirst for rebuilding the Russian Empire.  \\nThe second problem is because Trump comes over as erratic it raises the possibility of miscalculation.

That is, arguably, what happened in Afghanistan, where Trump's \\"peace deal\\" with the Taliban left them far more sure than before that they could just take the whole country by force, which they did once Trump was out of office. America was then forced to escalate, and then decided to pull out. It was all a bit of a mess.  \\nOf course, it's possible that he really might strike a decent deal. But again, would he be looking at the small print? That's where the devil often is, and is he a small print person?  \\nRichard Spencer","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

As a leftist I've been screaming this for years but the left has become too obsessed with purity policing its own to look at the actual problem with why we don't win: demonizing the other side and trying to prove how bad they are is just keeping us divided when the actual issues that affect us all are something we largely agree on. Yeah it severely sucks we can't agree on social issues, as a trans woman I wish it were that simple but it isn't. We need to build bridges and win people over on what directly affects all of us rather than letting the bullshit culture war stuff *both* parties push to control a narrative that keeps us fighting each other. We honestly need to just to shift focus entirely to how unify with each other over our shared needs. 90% of people just want to be able to afford rent or to buy a home, to feed their families and pets, have access to decent healthcare that won't bankrupt them, and be able to have some recreational time and spare funds to spend on it. We all need and want those things more than we care about ideological differences and if we could get on the same page under a party driven to fulfill the needs of the people the progressive social ideas can be won over from that. People are more likely to listen and consider things when not being constantly kept stressed by not having enough money, fear of losing their homes, dying because they can't afford medicine, medicine, and so on. That push to the edge makes them latch on to whatever person says they'll make it better and whatever rhetoric they use to shift the blame from the wealthy who are our true shared enemy. Again, most don't even give a shit about the rhetoric, sure some deeply do and that's an issue, but like we've been discussing most people voted for Trump because of the economy and promises to working class people. We have to shift away from running on social issues and focus on addressing our shared, basic needs. Social change can and will only come after people don't feel desperately backed into a corner. We need a labor forward party that puts the people as people first Knowing that every other good thing we want can come out of that once we all unify over getting what we all need to live safely and securely. I honestly think the only sane thing we can do over the next 4 years is figure out how to make that happen. We need to start building a new party together. All the blaming of different sides, different generations, different segments of the population aren't going to ever get us out of this.","title":"Why Democrats Lose Even When Republicans Are so Endlessly Terrible"},{"text":"Obama's 1% annual economic growth being \\"the new normal\\" to suddenly taking credit for Trump's economy would be hilarious if these nuts didn't actually believe the propaganda.","title":"Reddit thinks Democrats will win once the economy tanks due to Trump"},{"text":"They probably wouldn't have been googling \\"did biden drop out\\" all day on Nov 5 if they hadn't seen on their ballot that he wasn't there.","title":"Some Americans Had No Clue Joe Biden Dropped Out, Google Trends Suggests"},{"text":"I as an Australian, after 30 mins of reading probably know more about your government and how it works (and how backwards it looks from my perspective but anyways) compared to alot of US citizens.","title":"Some Americans Had No Clue Joe Biden Dropped Out, Google Trends Suggests"},{"text":"She brought new energy to the campaign and it was awesome to hear when she said, how they need to close the gap between social classes and do justice to your avarage Joe or Joan and then a few days later when all the big guys expressed their dislike for such high taxes, she said it will be lower.

This directly contradicts your CMV because your CMV makes it seem like your opinion is specifically about sedentary lifestyles. But then you follow up by saying sedentary lifestyles by themselves. So what is it, sedentary lifestyles dont contribute to health issues or they alone dont contribute to health issues? These two things are fundamentally different.\\n Imagine a construction worker whos active all day versus a dentist who sits for hours at a time. Who would you assume has better health? Id argue that its not so straightforward.You can argue that its not so straightforward because a combination of things lead to how healthy a person is. But this doesnt negate that being sedentary can exacerbate certain health risks. Take dentists, for example. Theyre healthcare professionals, so naturally, theyre more conscious of health practices. Dentists tend to avoid processed foods or snacks with artificial coloring and sugars because they know the effects on their dental health. I dont really understand why any of this is important because being sedentary does not just affect your oral care. It affects other parts of your body. Dentists also do not go to traditional medical school and might not be as knowledgeable as say a cardiologist about how being sedentary can affect your heart. So what is your point? In contrast, many office workers or construction workers might not have that level of awareness. Theyre more likely to grab quick, high-calorie options, like chips or pastries that can be detrimental to long-term health.This doesnt disprove how being sedentary can negatively affect you. So, In my opinion, blaming a sedentary lifestyle as the main cause of health issues misses the point. No it doesnt. Being sedentary may genuinely be one of the leading reasons for why someone faces a specific health issue. If you have somebody who lays in bed all day and now suffers from a pressure injury, you can absolutely blame their sedentary lifestyle for that if they are otherwise healthy.Just like saying being obese might be the main reason for why someone now has diabetes. It depends on the person, just because some people have health issues that are not exacerbated by being sedentary doesnt mean that all people are in the same boat. So i s a sedentary lifestyle really the main culprit, or is it something deeper?You kind of added this main culprit thing last minute. Literally who is saying that being sedentary is the main cause for something? Because, as somebody who is a healthcare professional, being sedentary is usually considered something people do in addition to other things that lead to certain issues.","title":"CMV: Sedentary lifestyle does not really cause health issues"},{"text":"This is just doomer bullshit.

I'd love to know what they think.  \\nt's a difficult one - it could be the defining issue of the next few years if people on all sides get their calculations wrong.  \\nTaiwan is clearly nervous that Trump might either pull back from support for Taiwan (in keeping with \\"America First\\" and its dislike of \\"foreign wars\\"); or that he might strike some sort of deal with President Xi which leaves the island exposed. There's also the possibility that he might turn against Taiwan's semiconductor industry, which is so vital both economically but also as  \\"roadblock\\" to conflict given how important it is to China too. It's just the sort of industry Trump and Vance would want to \\"reshore\\" to America. That would leave Taiwan very vulnerable.  \\nMy feeling though is that at the end of the day Trump knows that the build up of forces on either side in the Pacific is dangerous and has to be managed carefully, and he will realise it would take too much of his attention, on a topic that isn't his first concern, if he decided to do anything to really stir things up. If I were in his shoes, I'd say I had a lot to be getting on with making America great again, and the conventional deterrence policy in the Pacific has worked so far, and leave it at that. One of the \\"MAGA-friendly\\" policy wonks in Trump's orbit - Eldridge Colby, and there's rumours he might get a job in the administration though I've no idea whether they are true or not - has said some very hardline things about China. But when you look closely, they are far more in line with conventional thinking than they look at first.That may be over-optimistic. We are in unknown territory, after all, this time round - many of the conventional hardline Republicans like Mike Pompeo became disillusioned with him first time round and probably won't work for him again, so we will probably have a fairly untested team around him.Richard Spencer","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

Marx never used the term and Engels only used it once.

In the German ideology Marx and Engels make clear that ideological developments only arise in correspondence with material developments. To put it differently, every ideology has a material basis. Marx and Engels discuss in their private letters that it is possible and natural for workers to become bourgeois-ified. By being included in the benefits of the surplus labor extraction process, workers are turned into both the victim and perpetrator. You are wrong, workers are not the majority in America. The majority of people who claim this status are actually bourgeois-ified in the way that Marx and Engels described. Therefore, they have a bourgeois material interest and vote accordingly. This not only explains why this election went the way that it did, but also why your idea of uniting \\"all workers\\" is historically impossible.Edit: aside from the ignorance of the other user, the reason that they call you a liberal is because the theory of false consciousness is today championed by the Democratic party.

You may have been thinking something different, but I can only respond to what you say, I'm not a mind reader. I take what people say to be what they mean. you seem to be interested in my own psychology so whatever Ill play.Not your personal psychology, but the reasoning behind why 73 million American voters do not find attempting to subvert an election automatically disqualifying for the presidency. If it seems bizarre it may be because I genuinely want to understand the reasoning rather than use it as a cudgel to demonize people I disagree with. What you provided is that it didn't work. This is hindsight bias. You assume that because it didn't work the first time, it can't work in the future. It would be hindsight bias for me to say it's guaranteed that he will try a second time. That's one reason I'm not out here screaming \\"America is over!\\" like I see some people doing. But he tried, and therefore he can never be trusted with the reins of power again. You also cited the constitutional term limit. The problem is, if Trump seeks to stay in office past his term, he has already shown that he is willing to disregard the law, so this would be no guarantee. This shows the corrosive effect his previous attempt to stay in office illegally has had; it has undermined faith in the rule of law. You cited other issues that you find more important, but to me, it's inescapable that these are secondary when you believe the President-elect is disqualified from holding the office in the first place. It's akin to saying \\"Mussolini made the trains run on time.\\" So if you don't understand why this was a talking point, I don't know how to explain it to you. It's a showstopper, it's a slam dunk. But, the results of the election show beyond a doubt that more people agree with you than with me. And that disturbs me deeply, not only because the majority of voters either don't care, or don't understand the gravity of what has happened to the United States, but also because there are two distinct and competing worldviews, the gap between which can never be bridged.","title":"Will Donald Trump destroy US democracy?

Democratic Support Collapsed Instead"},{"text":"Continuing:Trump wants a legacy too.  His exit from office after term 1 was not legacy material.  This one will be.  Here's why.When Trump made the July 4th celebration happen at Mt. Rushmore, I watched his speech and I watched his body language during other speeches.  He kept looking up at those heads.  In my opinion, taking mental measurements of what his will look like up there.  But, to get there, you have to not be a good POTUS, or not even a great POTUS, you gotta be epic.Why did Trump decide to put himself out there for office?  Ego?  Sure, can't get a bigger one anywhere else, can ya? Yet, the egotist would NEVER succumb to the character assassinations and drain on personal wealth and family relationships like that guy.  The egomaniac would have completed term 1 and gone on about his rich life.I think that Trump, if anything, is consistent.  He's had thoughts on politics since the 1980's.  Go back and watch both of his Oprah interviews.  Check out several of his magazine interviews.  He is also loyal.  JFK Jr. got himself into a plane crash.  They were very, very good friends.  And JFK was making some noticeable waves in George magazine very shortly before he forgot how to fly when flying.  I don't think Trump ever forgot that.  But, since the last initial in the name is a \\"K\\", ya think the true story of a crash is readily available?  You're gonna need some top-top clearance to get to see THOSE case notes.  This situation was a marker, in my opinion.Fast forward to a guy in the mid teens of this century, being courted by rap stars for video cameo, and everyone admiring the dude, watching some \\"The Apprentice\\" and whatnot, and I think he saw his opportunity to actually make a difference.  I'm sure he had a LOT of thought about the advantages and disadvantages.  Very few stupid people are billionaires.Making a difference would back up all of the rhetoric he'd thrown around about politics since the '80's, and he saw his window of opportunity opening.  And, since he's a go big or go home type of personality, he packed a bunch of bags of ideas to take through the window sill.Go back to his gilded escalator speech to when he was coming down to the basement to meet the press.  There's a store at the top of the escalator in Trump Tower.  What is that store?  What does the sign say?So, the rich guy with ideas and ideals is gonna drain the swamp.  Ha!  Boy did HE learn!  After losing, on his \\"thank you\\" tour, I think in Arizona, he said something to the effect of \\"you sent me to Washington to drain the swamp, but I had no idea how deep it was or how many monsters were in it.\\"  Now, he does.He's learning that money matters, but, power is worth more than wealth in people.  It can be fixed though.  Limit the power, and limit the money and you might get representative governance.Trump packed a straw the last time he went to DC.  I didn't think to pick one up myself.  If I would have, there would have been two people sucking up muck and spitting it out to dry in the heat of daylight against the dark dredges.  Want to make a difference?  Get a straw and help the dude help us.  Demand prudent changes to voting regulations to eliminate the argument of elections are (s)elections and your vote doesn't matter.  Demand responsibility with our tax dollars, and accountability for the power we award our overlords.  Where's term limits legislation?  Hell, I could go on all day! Of the people, by the people, for the people is you and me.  Not them.  It's time to remind them all of it, regardless of the D or R or I next to their name.  And, if Trump can get it done, and we do our part with our own straws, he will get an admirable legacy.And, if Trump tries any less than good for the people, he ain't exempt from getting sucked up in someone's straw and spit out on the banks as well.  But, I have a feeling I might have to buy a rock chisel, some climbing rope and take some basic sculpting YT videos with me on an unplanned trip to South Dakota in a few years, instead.  Making America Great Again benefits all of us.","title":"Theory: Trump rigged the 2024 election with help from Jill Biden. Here is my roadmap of that theory."},{"text":"They cheated. I know it.

He played the game well enough to survive in the cesspool.  In that career, it was not monumental.  Party line votes, limited sponsoring of legislation, basically, getting his own wealth to grow pig style rather than hog style.  You know, the old \\"Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered\\" thingy.But, he did have personal aspirations.  And hooking up with Obama got him the opportunity to flirt with hogging.  However, you ain't gonna go full hog if you ain't got the biggest chair.Biden had his machine in place.  A close knit team of family members with little outsider assistance in the inner circle.  If one of the cogs (Hunter) wouldn't have been so dysfunctional, the sky would have truly been the limit every time he hung his \\"Garage Sale\\" sign.He'd have been a one-term POTUS, for sure, but, maybe a two-termer if it wasn't for Hunter's spotlight shining down.HOWEVER, he wants his legacy.  He doesn't want to leave disgraced.  Jimmy Carter fucked up everything royally in his 4 years, yes, Reagan beat him, but, just about anybody could have.  And Ole Peanut Farmer is beloved, even until this day.  Jimmy's bad moves are long forgiven, they didn't self-enrich.And Biden, without Hunter, might have gotten that.  Now, Biden's in a quandary.  His kid ain't cracked up for incarceration, but, he's pledged and promised not to pardon.  Biden also never said he wouldn't pardon Trump, though.To protect his legacy, I foresee a backroom deal where Biden pardons Trump, and then Trump pardons Hunter.It's a win for Biden to protect legacy.  Sure, he's not going to go out and start building houses for Habitat for Humanity and whatnot, but, what he is going to do is take HIS 1B campaign chest that he turned over to Harris, take his 10 percent for the Big Guy and slink off to live happily ever after, family-wide.  The big short.  And, while everyone is scratching their heads over the Trump pardon, he'll be stashing his scratch with a smile.  He's old, he's fading, but, he's as conniving for self preservation as he ever was.","title":"Theory: Trump rigged the 2024 election with help from Jill Biden.

The old social-media platforms had been somewhat defanged, but action was happening on emerging platforms like TikTok, livestreams, and podcasts. These hypnotizing microformswhich captured most of young America, but also cut inroads across demographicsmade old cultural fault lines, such as A&amp;E versus HBO, look quaint. Conservative ideas popped up in a flurry of new fads and scenes: the manosphere, the tradwives, anti-woke comedians playing to cryptocurrency conferences. Livestreamers saw an influx of money from right-leaning interests (and, in some cases, Russian ones). When it came time for Trump to mount his comeback campaign, he could plug into a booming world of sympathetic influencers with enormous followings When Kamala Harris became the nominee, she did unleash a wave of coconut-themed memes that, more than anything, excited fans of the pop stars whose songs were in the background. Late in her brief campaign, she and her surrogates also made some forays into popular podcasts. But in any analysis, these were marginal efforts compared with the old-school influence methods her campaign relied on: ad campaigns, door-knocking, and rallies headlined by mainstream celebs.Now that she has lost, one of the many what-ifs to argue over is this: What if Harris had tried to court the millions of subscribers to Joe Rogans bro-beloved podcast? Trump and J. D. Vance each did their own three-hour conversation with Rogan. The host wanted to talk with Harris, but he and the campaign couldnt agree on the logistical details: Harriss camp had wanted Rogan to travel to her from his Austin studio, and to chat for only an hour. These were reasonable requests when judged by the standards of a traditional politician at the height of campaign season, but they were also a sign of the Harris sides inability or unwillingness to play by the rules of the new media. The refusal may have also been a strategic move to avoid the possibility of making a gaffe on micbut given who ended up winning the election, this, too, seems like an antiquated concern.After all, the hottest commodity of todays online cultural ecosystem is open conflict. Chitchat on podcasts and livestreams is transfixing because its unruly, argumentative, and unafraid of causing offense  Theoretically, its not hard to infiltrate the new conservative information environment: Rogan tried to talk to Harris, and the similarly influential podcaster Theo Von booked Bernie Sanders. But most Democratic surrogates seem stuck on a 20th-century performance style, defined by slick sound bites or soaring, cinematic monologues. They seem reluctant to do what these new formats require, which is *fight* Harris wouldnt have won just by going on a few more podcastsbut if more Democrats had spent more of the past four years in the mix, figuring out how to spar, complicating the rights narratives about inflation and immigration, finding ways to redirect attention toward their own agenda, who knows? This new ecosystem is now so visibleand so obviously connected to the rightward shift among young people that helped reelect Trumpthat to label it alternative seems ridiculous. Still, the temptation to ignore it, for people who are less than enchanted with Trumpism, will only grow under the new administration. Calls to disengage from X, now that Elon Musk has turned it into a white-supremacist haven, certainly have a moral appeal. But if this election showed how difficult it is to meaningfully deplatform speakers you disagree with, it also demonstrated the danger of ignoring the platforms where they speak.

I don't know much about this, but stipends while going through the process of attaining temporary status into citizenship isn't uncommon or a unique feature of the Biden admin. All of this and more is why you had Democrats lose voters to the GOP.I think that people voted with their wallets and price of rent, food, and flat wages mixed in with a sense of hoplessness about all of that is what sunk this administration, and regardless of the knock on effects of stimulus payments the perception was that the Biden admin had abandoned working class Americans and people made them pay for it.

The Democratic Party has ran on protecting democracy from Trump for 3 presidential cycles and every off-year cycle in between. However, there has not been concrete communication of what pro-democracy measures the party actually supports outside of stopping Trump. Examples of real policies might be real articulated policies of campaign finance reform, ranked choice voting, changes to gerrymandering, registration changes, etc.1a. The last three presidential primaries for the democrats have been questionable at best. The part banned together to elect Hillary, Biden, and then didnt run a primary for Harris. Whether real or perceived Bernie Sanders is seen as being undermined by party elites. Biden ran a primary largely unopposed despite people screaming that he was too old for 2 years. These are all seen/can be characterized as anti democratic. Also when questioned the party infrasture told everyone fall in line or let the fascists win (which may be true but can also come through as a hollow threat till people feel the consequences and its too late)2. The democrats have been saying they are anti corruption but did not denounce billionaire influence in elections (because they benefit too) and have not come out against congressional stock trades (because they benefit too). This allows them to cast as corrupt as republicans or unserious about stopping corruption.3. The Democratic Party continues to seek out the support of conservatives and corporate interests at the detriment of populist policies. Public health care was abandoned. Workers rights support seems fickle to industry and need (trains v. Teachers v. Automotive, etc.)4. Not everyone who voted for Trump is a racist. Some are. And there is a belief that one Nazi at a dinner party makes it a Nazi party. But most people are not terminally online, are not up to date on the constant news cycle, and decide who they are going to vote on undetermined reasons at best. Leopards may eat their faces but they will not see a causal chain between that nor be knowledgeable about the events or policies that led there.5. The powers in charge already seem to have not learned a lesson and are cannibalistic. The narrative is already that progressives, gen z, etc. did not turn out so fuck em. Let them suffer. This is not a unifying message.6. Generations of people are complaining about not being able to afford housing, food, have job security, access to health care. There are lots of reasons that has not been addressed but cozying up to conservatives, corporations, and blaming younger generations for not falling in line to vote for lack luster policy suggestions is a hard sell.7. People have watched forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The wars in Ukraine and Israel may be hard sells as they do not have clear end goals or points where the US stops being involved. These conflicts are very different but there is a general sentiment that life is hard here, why do we always have money for bombs over there.8. Anger is intoxicating and a powerful emotion. Trump encourages anger, gives into base desires to hurt/defame/blame others. I am not saying this is right (it isnt), but if youre poor and suffering someone telling you to be pissed off is probably a pretty good feeling.9. The media can sell stories about anger easier than nuanced policy. The media is owned by billionaires and corporate interests. Even if all of the above were addressed the democrats would still struggle in this media environment.10. And most importantly personally I do not trust in the democratic establishment to take any of the above seriously (with few exceptions) or change their positions to meet these moments.","title":"Where Did the Millions of Joe Biden Votes Go?"},{"text":"Sure you can.

Gabriel here at the Sunday Times. I sense you may have a particular view on this theme. Let me try answer in a way which doesn't just amount to a defensive riposte to your comment about \\"lies\\". The answer is, erm, yes. I am worried about the obsolescence of what you describe as legacy media. Nobody could possibly have watched newspapers haemorrhage circulation and withdraw from communities over the last two decades and conclude anything other than the fact we face an existential challenge, and have in the case of many titles already lost it - i.e. look at the number of local and regional tiles on both sides of the pond which no longer exist.  I am an official Millennial - I hate that term - and can inform you I don't know a single member of my age group who buys a print paper, which is possibly fine and no longer surprising. Just as stark however is how few people consume any traditional media full-stop.  Thankfully for you, and for democracy, the only way we can restore our role, and both retain and win back readers, is by earning their trust and reporting in an accurate, fair and compelling way. I promise we try harder at those things than you probably think, but don't take my word for it. Subscribe to the Times and Sunday Times and if you spot anything which is wildly wrong you can send me an email and I'll buy you a pint next time you're in the UK!","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

The other two parties vying for power were the National Socialist Party (the Nazis) and the Communist Party. The Weimar Republic was very similar to the US: A democracy with a constitution (based on the US constitution!), three coequal branches of government, etc.During that period a few things happened to enable Hitler to seize power:1. Conservative business/religious interests in Germany chose to support Hitler, reasoning that his policies would be moderated once he gained power and feeling that the Social Democrats were too liberal in their views.2. Nazi-aligned far-right politicians (Hindenburg, et al) planted stories that the German loss in WWI was caused by the Social Democrats (the \\"stab-in-the-back\\" myth).3. The Communist Party (comparable the US far-left), felt that the Social Democrats were too far *right*; and rather than aligning with them, the Communists sought to eliminate the Social Democrats and draw away votes. Being squeezed by the Nazi on the right and the Communists on the left, and with public sentiment turning against them from claims of them being responsible for the WWI loss, the Social Democrats lost elections and the Nazi's gained control.This is one of those situations where history really does repeat itself.","title":"New York Democrat: Far left has outsized impact in shaping perception of party"},{"text":"No!

Papers in the US used to be city-wide - New York Times, Baltimore Sun or whatever. That model's not sustainable in an internet world. Now the papers are trying to define themselves for bigger markets - but are being attacked by the left for not being left enough and the right for not being right enough, but everyone agrees they are biased (but for opposite reasons). It's a tough situation.  \\nIn Britain, papers have always been politically aligned so it's easier for us.
