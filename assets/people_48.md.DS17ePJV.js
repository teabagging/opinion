If the tariffs get put in place and things go up in price (they will) run on this saying how this didn't fix the economy and how things are more expensive than before.  If the Republicans dont do anything to make housing more affordable talk about plans or ideas to help with housing (this is more of a local issue than national issue but also goes back to point one about getting more dems in local  and state offices).

There hasn't been a Republican president that left the economy in better shape than they found it since the 80s and I don't think that streak will end. The tariffs Trump threatens will be hitting average Americans and to my first point, that needs to be in ads all the time. The effects of threatened mass deportations must be constantly publicized through the same economic lens.The injuries/deaths of women due to abortion restriction need the same constant publicity.3. and the most controversial one, what kind of presidential candidate are the dems looking for? its seems like america isnt yet ready to have a woman president.This is unfortunately true. I'm sorry to say it, but not having a man at the top of the ticket will continue to result in a loss for a while to come.

The first has no rights as it is not an independent person, just a work in progress totally dependent by the woman (who is a legal person, the only legal person in the discussion).The child is his own person, who has his own rights.

People finding it hard to afford the things they are used to having is a potential political disaster for whoever is in charge and it shouldn't be minimised. Inflation completely sank Biden's re-election chances even before it was obvious his brain had turned into soup. Harris has been left holding the bag to an extent as the bad vibes economically had already set in regardless of the fundamentals all looking great. We really do live in the age of vibes to an extent.The worst thing is, the Biden admin did an objectively great job riding out the economic malaise he had to govern through, from covid and the hangover from all that spending, the rampant inflation fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the mess that I/P has descended into with the Houthis trying to grind maritime shipping to a halt in the region. Look at how anaemic and stagnant the major European economies are for an example of how much worse it could be. He and his team should genuinely be commended, their legacy will be similar to Obama's in that is that the US economy is in a good enough position to potentially weather another Trump presidency that tries its best to run it into the ground with tariffs and general instability and uncertainty both at home and abroad.Trump's whole image is that he's the money guy and he just happened to govern in the only time of decent economic growth and stability of the post '08 age. His literal name and signature was also on the stimmy cheques, if you're an economic illiterate (aka a super-majority of people, not only Americans) he's the only guy who ever threw you a bone. Biden and Harris were in charge when you suddenly couldn't afford your private taxi for your burrito anymore.Also doesn't help that the only other issues people are moved to vote on is immigration, which is such a lightning rod for people's rage. I think that the democrats should have learned this lesson from looking at their European allies getting trounced for the past near-decade by now. Both the proles and bougie suburban types want less of it and want a big strong leader who is willing and happy to stamp the jackboot on the necks of the brown and black people if it means they don't have to see as many of them in their neighbourhoods, end of story. Appealing to people's humanity is a waste of time, they don't see these people as people for the most part.  They want the democrats to lace up and get stomping and they see the pro-immigration crowd as hopelessly naive and aloof to the issues around immigration at best, actively harming the country at their neighbourhood's expense at the behest of some other external power at worst. The Biden admin should have never lifted Trump's policies at the border as it literally did lead to a surge in crossings, even if numbers are back under control now. Such a stupid own-goal on behalf of people who were going to vote for you anyways.However, in this case I really think it's as simple as bad vibes due to inflation. The Democrats really need to get better PR and messaging when it comes to economic policy. They literally are the better economic managers but the average Joe is convinced they aren't. That is the biggest problem and most urgent issue. Sack all the useless professional-managerial class failchildren in the marketing and comms teams please. It is literally essential for global stability that these people shunned from decision making.","title":"Doomer-ing out hard"},{"text":"This fucker tried to overthrow the last election, and hes winning because prices are slightly higher.

I expect the backlash will begin quite quickly and we'll probably see blue wavelets in Virginia and New Jersey next November when those states vote, with similar results in other states in subsequent cycles. By 2026 when the midterms happen the electorate will back to full \\"fuck Trump\\" mode and any chance to suppress votes, manipulate outcomes, etc. at the state level in states that aren't already blood red will be gone because the GOP won't have the power to do it.

Abortion is fundamentally about bodily autonomyit concerns a persons control over their own body and the significant physical and emotional implications of pregnancy. By contrast, child support is a financial obligation aimed at ensuring the welfare of the child, rooted in the belief that both parents should contribute to a childs well-being, regardless of the circumstances of conception.This distinction helps explain why someone might support abortion rights while also supporting mandatory child support, even in cases where the male parents involvement was non-consensual, such as in cases of rape. Child support policies are often designed with the childs welfare as the primary concern, operating under the assumption that both parents bear responsibility for supporting the child, as the child has no agency in how they came into the world.Personally, I support \\"paper abortion\\" policies, which would allow men to relinquish legal and financial responsibilities under certain conditions, such as in cases involving abuse or lack of consent. But implementing such a policy raises challenging questions. For example, should the timeline for a paper abortion be based on the childs conception date, or should it start when the man first learns of the child? If its tied to the conception date, this could lead to scenarios where partners delay informing each other. On the other hand, if its based on when the man learns of the pregnancy, what happens if its too late for an actual abortion at that point? These are critical issues that would need careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences and ensure fairness for everyone involved.","title":"CMV: You can't be pro-abortion and support unconditional child maintenance."},{"text":"Israel starts shit that the US has to end.

The Democrats are constantly tied and brought down by their extreme left wing. Yes, Harris isnt socialist but she isnt explicitly condemning them either. We need moments where Democrats openly disavow themselves from DSA, the squad, defund the police etc. Not only that, but do it forcefully and convincingly.2. Drop the fucking DEI/CRT bullshit. Go back to the early 2000s, where the message was more dont concern yourself with what other people do and at least ostensibly it was about equality of opportunity, not outcome. Race and identity based politics is divisive in the best of times, theres a reason why AA failed in deep blue CA. In fact, its probably the single least popular policy that the Dems support. Stuff like Biden openly stating he wants to pick a black woman is anathema to the electorate, the majority of whom believe race/gender should be irrelevant.3. Move right on illegal immigration while expanding legal options. While not my cup of tea, illegal immigration is extremely unpopular.4. Stop with the progressive messaging on greedflation, evil billionaires. People outside of social media by and large admire business leaders, and starting a successful business is a core part of the American Dream. When people like Warren lick their lips at raising taxes on the rich, call it the fuck out in national camera.5. Clamp down on local governments that give Dems a terrible branding nationwide. National Dems might not be the one at fault for exclusionary zoning and high rents, but you can bet your ass theyll be blamed.6. No more career politicians whose opinions change with the wind. People hate fakeness more than anything. Harris did an okay job at ignoring the left, but people just see it as tacit acceptance. No, thats not enough; you need to aggressively refute and marginalize it if you want to win a general election. Democrats who win competitive districts or Republican favored ones are the ones most willing to buck the party and at least outwardly distance themselves from the national brand; you need to do this for the presidency as well because the Democrat brand is toxic.Try a popular governor in a swing or Republican state, not a progressive legislator from one of the most heavily Democrat states in the country.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"All their corrupt censorship and liberal propaganda blew up in their face, actaully majorly hurting them.

No way the energy and excitement behind Harris should be ignored. She had an uphill battle and made many of us very hopeful. She ran a great campaign and would have done a great job. Sad reality is that anyone tied in any way to the Biden WH, or probably even Biden himself, would have had a slim chance. Especially a black woman. Its simply that people are struggling if you put the racists and bigots aside for a second, the large majority will ignore Trump being Trump because groceries were affordable back then. When groceries are still not affordable in 4 years, maybe theyll blame finally see him for what he is.","title":"whats next for democrats?"},{"text":"Said demographic cant define boys and girls, sir!

America Trump and his supporters seem to love Putin and think he is a great and strong leader, to them I say go live in Russia for a while then tell me how you like him. Meanwhile im watching this unfold from Australia and one of my biggest fears concerning Ukraine is trumps love for Putin and admiration of guys like Kim Jong Un and Xi Jin Ping is this. If it really came to WW3 however probable or improbable it may be, will America be join the new Axis of baddies with Russia, North Korea and China. Where these countries can bully and invade their neighbours now that US is no longer a deterrent. Im sure other countries would ally with them as well leaving the remaining having to submit or fight against a new evil with the might of the American military behind it instead of the worlds superpowers keeping each other in check they join forces to and left unchecked to do as they please. Will nato be ineffective if the US abandons it? Maybe this is unlikely I hope but my opinion of the election was that if Harris won sure the government will still be shit but at least its the same old shit again that we familiar with to just business as usual it wont affect me really but with trump there is too many unknowns and I feel like it has potential to really upset the balance of power for the worse. I guess were lucky to live in a time of prosperity and progression when historically those times are always temporary but also shame on us if we lose it all willingly.","title":"Russia says Donald Trump's election win \\"useful for us\\""},{"text":"Same man","title":"NYT: Trump Projected to Win the Electoral College AND the Popular Vote"},{"text":"What happened to all the election fraud and cheating that he said was happening?

You may think that America is all big and powerful, and that is true, but compared to other big powers out there America is less relevant due to proximity and less stable (a democratic elections that flips the countrys direction every 4 years compared to a dictatorship-run superpower that has more control of their country). America has to keep themselves poking in everyones business to keep that influence and power going strong. That requires others to believe that America can be useful to them, and trust that America can lead the world towards progress. Now if the new leadership holds the same view as you, that we have power and we the next big bully in town, everyone kowtow to us! Then very soon America will lose its influence and power in the world. We seen this happening during trumps first term where many countries start to shift their loyalty towards China.

In California they're making $20-$25 an hour. Ag work isn't heavily done by undocumented because it pays so little that legal workers don't want to do it, but rather it's just a job that has a lot of challenges in general. It's seasonal, making it hard to do it as a part of stable work. You're also typically off to live 4 to a room on a ranch, separated from friends and family. On top of that, it's physically demanding and miserable. It's an unappealing job if your priority is having a decent social life and building a stable career in a job you enjoy. But it's an appealing job for a lot of undocumented workers because their #1 priority is usually making a lot of money to support their family, and it's a job that pays well and will hire you without question.","title":"Trump vows new 'golden age' for America as he nears clinching presidency"},{"text":"Hope?

It's expensive to build because of all the lawsuits, and regulations which make it easy for people to file these lawsuits. Democrats definitely need to find ways to streamline government.But also it's never going to come down to one issue. Electoral politics is extremely complex. Trump is a really good campaigner and always has been. He can convince lots of people that he's on their side. He can mobilize huge numbers of people who don't normally vote. He has succeeded in growing the tent more than other Republican politicians by making huge inroads with Hispanics, union workers, the working and middle class, even urban voters in some areas. But that also makes the reality of governing very difficult, which is why his support once in office falters. It's quite similar to Obama.I think Democrats also need to do some soul searching on how they approach gender/racial/generational politics. People increasingly make electoral decisions based on social factors. Targeting women voters is inevitably going to create the perception that the party is not for men. The party also needs to resolve the tension in the coalition which was still relying on a small, but important segment of social conservatives.Also the fact that people hate both parties so strongly right now should be a red flag. They will turn on Republicans just as fast, but that doesn't mean they actually like Democrats. That's a problem.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"1.

A Western democrat could carry on an intellectual debate with a Soviet Marxist. It would be impossible for him to do that with a Russian Orthodox nationalist.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington,** The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderSome Americans have promoted multiculturalism at home; some have promoted universalism abroad; and some have done both. Multiculturalism at home threatens the United States and the West; universalism abroad threatens the West and the world. Both deny the uniqueness of Western culture. The global monoculturalists want to make the world like America. The domestic mulitculturalists want to make America like the world. A multicultural America is impossible because a non-Western America is not American. A multicultural world is unavoidable because global empire is impossible. The preservation of the United States and the West requires the renewal of Western identity. The security of the world requires acceptance of global multiculturality.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington,** The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderParadigms also generate predictions, and a crucial test of a paradigms validity and usefulness is the extent to which the predictions derived from it turn out to be more accurate than those from alternative paradigms. A statist paradigm, for instance, leads John Mearsheimer to predict that the situation between Ukraine and Russia is ripe for the outbreak of security competition between them. Great powers that share a long and unprotected common border, like that between Russia and Ukraine, often lapse into competition driven by security fears. Russia and Ukraine might overcome this dynamic and learn to live together in harmony, but it would be unusual if they do.  \\nD **Samuel P.

Now directly fighting them doesn't work as it just creates a hydra effect, but out competing them could starve them out. The laws of supply and clearly show that people cocaine and ultimately are going to get it from somewhere. Wouldn't it be better if that capital instead of going to murderous criminals, went to federal government to be then used in programs like rehab centers? The cartel's have a variety of overheads that the federal government wouldn't have to worry about if we for example told the DEA to start growing coca plants(though I am horribly ignorant about if we have suitable places to grow stateside) and therefore we could be crush them without firing a single bullet.

It is basically an anti-Western ideology.  \\nD Samuel P. Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderIn the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash, Western belief in the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false; it is immoral; and it is dangerous.  \\nD **Samuel P Huntington,** The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderIslam's borders are bloody and so are its innards. The fundamental problem for the West is not Islamic fundamentalism. It is Islam, a different civilisation whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington**the situation between Ukraine and Russia is ripe for the outbreak of security competition between them. Great powers that share a long and unprotected common border, like that between Russia and Ukraine, often lapse into competition driven by security fears. Russia and Ukraine might overcome this dynamic and learn to live together in harmony, but it would be unusual if they do.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington,** The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderThe dangerous clashes of the future are likely to arise from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic intolerance, and Sinic assertiveness.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington,** The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderThe prevalence of anti-patriotic attitudes among liberal intellectuals led some of them to warn their fellow liberals of the consequences of such attitudes for the future not of America but of American liberalism. Most Americans, as the American public philosopher Richard Rorty has written, take pride in their country, but 'many of the exceptions to this rule are found in colleges and universities, in the academic departments that have become sanctuaries for left-wing political views.' These leftists have done 'a great deal of good for . . . women, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians. . . . But there is a problem with this Left: it is unpatriotic. It repudiates the idea of a national identity and the emotion of national pride.' If the Left is to retain influence, it must recognize that a 'sense of shared national identity . . . is an absolutely essential component of citizenship.' Without patriotism, the Left will be unable to achieve its goals for America. Liberals, in short, must use patriotism as a means to achieve liberal goals  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington**These transnationalists have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington**The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion (to which few members of other civilizations were converted) but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact; non-Westerners never do.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington,** The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderHistorically, American liberals have been idealists, pressing forward toward the goals of greater freedom, social equality, and more meaningful democracy. The articulate exposition of a liberal ideology was necessary to convert others to liberal ideas and to reform existing institutions continuously along liberal lines. Today, however, the greatest need is not so much the creation of more liberal institutions as the successful defense of those which already exist. This defense requires American liberals to lay aside their liberal ideology and to accept the values of conservatism for the duration of the threat. Only by surrendering their liberal ideas for the present can liberals successfully defend their liberal institutions for the future. Liberals should not fear this change. Is a liberal any less liberal because he adjusts his thinking so as to defend most effectively the most liberal institutions in the world? To continue to expound the philosophy of liberalism simply gives the enemy a weapon with which to attack the society of liberalism. The defense of American institutions requires a conscious articulate conservatism which can spring only from liberals deeply concerned with the preservation of those institutions. As Boorstin, Niebuhr, and others have pointed out, the American political genius is manifest not in our ideas but in our institutions. The stimulus to conservatism comes not from the outworn creeds of third-rate thinkers but from the successful performance of first-rate institutions.   \\nConservatism does not ask ultimate questions and hence does not give final answers. But it does remind men of the institutional prerequisites of social order. And when these prerequisites are threatened, conservatism is not only appropriate, it is essential. In preserving the achievements of American liberalism, American liberals have no recourse but to turn to conservatism. For them especially, conservative ideology has a place in America today.  \\nD **Samuel P. Huntington**","title":"Trump has won"},{"text":"This","title":"Donald Trump defeats Kamala Harris to become the next U.S. president, NBC News projects"},{"text":"I may write a whole post on this later. But the good news for Democrats is that this election was *always* going to be an uphill battle, and while Kamala Harris actually proved to have surprisingly good political instincts, she personally is a pretty weak candidate. So you can plausibly expect that a better candidate in a more favorable climate would be able to win. Biden's tenure has been awful, and him running for so long, I think, meant a lot of voters came to terms with voting for Trump back in early-mid 2024 before Harris took over [I mean, look at the search results for \\"did Joe Biden drop out\\"...]. The barrier was gone after that. \\nThe bad [well, if you're a D operative/partisan] news is that it's clear that the GOP's new economically populist, socially conservative agenda is in fact able to win large numbers of Latino and Black voters, as well as young voters. Consider this a categorical rejection of Bidenism at the polls. In addition, Harris' strategy to try to gain more conservative/moderate leaning suburbanites largely fizzled. I think we can place the blame here on first, the fact that Harris never really committed to any conservative policies, and second, that Biden's tenure obviated a lot of good-faith that suburban white voters had in Biden to \\"restore normalcy\\". \\nBasically there's two paths forward, but imo really only one path. The first is to abandon social progressivism and max out economic populism--the Bernie Sanders path, but with more Black/Latino appeal. The problem is, this is what the GOP is *already* doing, and they're better at it. Biden and Harris have both tried this path, Biden squeaked over the edge and Harris flopped hard. I see no reason why a future left-populist candidate would see any more success. \\nThe second is to see the path forward in the white suburbs [and multiracial suburbs]. These voters are *reliable*, they're very high quality in terms of showing up to the polls, but they aren't entirely comfortable with the current Democratic agenda. So mold the agenda to fit them, along with college educated voters that increasingly make up the base of the party. I'd say that the future Democratic Party should place at its three corners social liberals/left libertarians, fiscal conservatism, and liberal internationalism. A bit like a liberal version of the old GOP. Basically:1. the \\"I want gay married couples to own AR-15s on their private weed farm\\" vote2. the \\"my god I hate inflation and tariffs\\" vote3. the \\"I don't trust the GOP internationally\\" vote\\nCorresponding with these three, Dems should realign their messaging. Slam Trump's tariffs [get people to put Trump \\"I did this\\" stickers on tarriffed goods]. Pummel him on inflation and deficits. Hit him for restrictions on social issues, while saying you just want people to be free to do what they want (in the privacy of their own homes--try not to associate too much with big, open public displays, it's offputting to normie voters).  Maintain a *strong* line internationally that doesn't waffle about, try to out-muscleman Trump and support defense spending *and* diplomacy--go full Scoop Jackson. That's in addition to some of the stuff other commenters are mentioning, like focusing more on reform and administrative improvements--govern *smarter*, not *harder*. I also think Democrats should work to literally *change the language* they use to be flashier, more provocative, and antagonistic--part of Trump's appeal is that he \\"tells it like it is\\". It'll also help with the male vote if your talk about \\"bringing America together\\" is followed by \\"to sit upon a throne of the skulls of our enemies\\".","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"Add that Reddit is an echo chamber.","title":"How Donald Trump Pulled Off the Greatest Comeback in Political History"},{"text":"young female voters did move heavily towards kamala Harris this election. when she made this into a gender problem election, she should have at least addressed men's problems as well.","title":"Trump claims victory in the 2024 presidential election, NBC News hasnt called winner"},{"text":"You know you can post links to disprove it","title":"Trump will win Pennsylvania, CBS News projects"},{"text":"No copium left anymore I guess.

So according to Reddit, Trump is a rapist, fascist, nazi, who will become a Kim-Jong Un level of dictator after he gets elected. Women's right, trans rights, immigrants rights would cease under his regime. Some people even said Americans won't be able to vote anymore in 2028. Is that true or are you guys just being overdramatic?","title":"CNN: Donald Trump is elected as the 47th President of the United States"},{"text":"Honestly, think about his campaign this time.  While his rhetoric was still pretty self aggrandizing he did alot more praising of everyone else round him.  He relied on alot more people this time.  He teamed up with people I don't think he would have in 2016.  He attacked new vectors and made compromises.This wasn't just Trump that Khamela ran against this team.  They ran against a TEAM.  A united front of people, all of whom were acknowledged and given importance.  He even went to his kid to get more ideas of what podcasts and etc to get on.  And he didn't just hire celebrities, these were people he formed personal connections with or deeply believed in him.  Or Rogan lol.TBH, that takes alot of humility.  Humility I don't think he had in 2016.  And this also came across in how he acted.  He let his guard down more, got a little sillier, got a little more relatable.  And yes, sometimes cringey too.  Dancing to YMCA, riding in a garbage truck, appearing on podcasts, getting starlink to people affected by the hurricane, relying alot on JD Vance, etc.And then at his congratulations speech he gave ALOT of time to everyone around him.  He made sure that even the people who didn't like to be on camera hiding in the background got their praise and their due.  And he delivered a speech about unity, and improving the country for everyone.Maybe he's full of shit.  I didn't vote for him (I didnt vote at all).  But from someone outside of the box you're in and not inside the Trump box, he approached this election very differently.  Given what I'm seen, I'm willing to give him benefit of the doubt because he's put in the work to earn it.  Doesn't mean he doesn't have plenty of things to criticize.  But what I saw during the campaign and election is a better version of Trump than we had in 2016.  One who actually does have the potential to unite all the sane people in the country.  The political zealots online will never be happy ofc, but can't win them all.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump will be a bad president."},{"text":"Can we place a bad trump presidency on a scale with a bad harris presidency?

Huntington for the win!Nothing like the top Politicial Scientist at Harvard predicting the Trump era decades ahead of time.When he's not an advisor to the State Department, CIA, or National Security Council or LBJ's Vietnam Desk.# These transnationalists have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operationsD **Samuel P. Huntington**.American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony (1981)This stunningly persuasive book examines the persistent, radical gap between the promise of American ideals and the performance of American politics. Samuel P. Huntington shows how Americans, throughout their history as a nation, have been united by the democratic creed of liberty, equality, and hostility to authority.  \\nAt the same time he reveals how, inevitably, these ideals have been perennially frustrated through the institutions and hierarchies required to carry on the essential functions of governing a democratic society...Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity (2004)The book attempts to understand the nature of American identity and the challenges it will face in the future.Huntington argues that it is during the 1960s that American identity begins to erode. This was the result of several factors:a. The beginning of economic globalization and the rise of global subnational identities  \\nb. The easing of the Cold War and its end in 1989 reduced the importance of national identity  \\nc. Attempts by candidates for political offices to win over groups of voters  \\nd. The desire of subnational group leaders to enhance the status of their respective groups and their personal status within them  \\ne. The interpretation of Congressional acts that led to their execution in expedient ways, but not necessarily in the ways the framers intended  \\nf. The passing on of feelings of sympathy and guilt for past actions as encouraged by academic elites and intellectuals  \\ng. The changes in views of race and ethnicity as promoted by civil rights and immigration laws...In 2017, Washington Post book critic Carlos Lozada penned an editorial describing Huntington's works as \\"\\\\[anticipating\\\\] America's political and intellectual battles -- and \\\\[pointing\\\\] to the country we may become.\\" .....The Washington Post  \\nSamuel Huntington, a prophet for the Trump eraThe writings of the late Harvard political scientist anticipate America's political and intellectual battles -- and point to the country we may become.\\"This is Trumps presidency, but even more so, it is Huntingtons America. Trump may believe himself a practical man, exempt from any intellectual influence, but he is the slave of a defunct political scientist.\\"..By Huntingtons civilizational standard, Ukraine is a severely cleft country, divided internally along historical, geographic and religious lines, with western Ukraine firmly in the European corner and eastern Ukraine and Crimea firmly in the orbit of Orthodox Russia.Even though it was published years before the 2013 Ukrainian crisis, Huntingtons most famous book, The Clash of Civilizations, is rife with warnings about the dangers of the Ukrainian situation and predicts that Ukraine could split along its fault line into two separate entities, the eastern of which would merge with Russia. The issue of secession first came up with respect to Crimea...Alpha HistoryDuring the late 1960s and 1970s Huntington worked as a strategist and advisor for the United States government.He provided strategic advice on the Vietnam War, suggesting a campaign of defoliation and carpet-bombing that would force Vietnamese peasants into communities, thus undermining the influence of the Viet Cong...","title":"Trump has won"},{"text":"I mean, Obama was a great candidate.

I'm not moderate, I'm quite conservative to be sure, but I'm not a republican in any case. I'll answer in good faith because i feel like you asked in good faith. there's a lot of reasons but the biggest ones for me and many independents I know are: immigration, energy prices, and the competency crisis the catastrophe the policies at our southern border are inviting is self evident. it's not a partisan thing. it's purely objective. if you release millions of unvetted noncitizens into the interior for years and years, the damage to wages, the social fabric, and the economy is real and palpable and painful. the republican ticket offered a comprehensive and extremely aggressive plan for undoing as much of the damage of the last 4 years as possible and making immigration policy for the US way more restrictive and selective, like it is in literally every single country on the entire planet except for ours almost every aspect of the citizen's quality of life, ability to survive, and ability to thrive, is directly connected to energy prices. the cost of groceries, the cost of rent, the average citizen's carbon footprint, education quality, everything are immediately downstream of the price of electricity, gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas. the energy policies campaigned by the democrats are specifically and intentionally inflationary. I get that it's all in the service of \\"climate change,\\" but middle class americans don't (and shouldn't) give a single fuck about the temperature of the ocean 150 years from now when a gallon of milk and a gallon of gasoline are both $4 and the heat bill for the month is $350, especially when they happen to live in a country with one of the lowest per capita carbon outputs on the planet. the republican ticket  has been campaigning positively on an \\"all of the above\\" energy policy which, if it lowers the price of all energy they way it's expected to, would sharply reduce the financial pressure and GREATLY increase the quality of life for the poorest Americans, who i care about a hell of a lot more than some fish in the atlantic or whatever the destructive risk DEI programs and policies pose to sophisticated systems and institutions is self evident. if you don't believe me ask Boeing. discriminating personnel on any metric other than MERIT ONLY will necessarily reduce the merit in these systems. it's not a race or culture thing, it's just math. It's just literal basic logic. the democrat platform encourages or even prioritizes DEI in hiring and appointment, and the damage it's done to the national deficit, the military, private industry, industrial safety and efficacy, and the federal bureaucracy is not tenable. The republican ticket is outwardly hostile to the DEI philosophy and promises to eliminate it from the federal government at a minimum, hopefully to a maximum of making it illegal in private industry, education, and athletics as well. as a bonus, the democrats totally illegible approach to the conflict in the middle east, and totally escalationist approach to the conflict in eastern europe has caused these two conflicts to be a hair's breadth away from drawing the rest of the world into both of them. these policies will foment wider war, it's almost guaranteed, while draining the wealth of the American middle class. Ukraine and Israel get fresh new cruise missiles and planes every month while local teachers have to pick up night shifts in fast food. fuck that. The republican ticket actually has a proven track record for influencing relative peace worldwide and I'm anxious to return to a period of russia not invading things, and the korean leaders meeting in person, and arab terrorists not kidnapping and raping and cutting heads off because they're too busy getting annihilated wholesale by MOAB bombs before they can even get their slippers on look reddit, argue with me and tell me i'm wrong and stupid and brainwashed and a magat all you want, we won with an intense mandate so i really dgaf what you think, die mad, I'm just answering the question because it seems like it was asked honestly also abortion is a grotesque and horrifying criminal stain on our civilization and while I'm not thrilled that the republican ticket has resigned to allow states like Minnesota have laws like they do, it's good enough for now that minnesota style abortion laws won't get anywhere near the federal legislature for the time being","title":"Trump wins the election, to become the 47th President of the United States."},{"text":"By which metric was the economy worse under Biden than under Trump?","title":"Trump claims victory in the 2024 presidential election, NBC News hasnt called winner"},{"text":"I hope he seeks retribution against the liberal media first.To the down voters : this is supposed to be ironic, because of how many media sources have been riding Trump's dick up until the past week with their half-assed endorsements.","title":"Trump calls media the enemy camp in speech declaring victory"},{"text":"stop giving him any credit.

The majority of people see through the propaganda, the political persecutions, the lies, etc. They voted for him because he wants to put America first, while at the same time, brought more stability to the world than any president in recent history. No new wars. The Abraham Accords. Prevented Russia from expanding during his term. Opened dialogue with North Korea. Got most of the rest of NATO to pay their fair share so that it is not just America defending Europe, but Europe defending Europe. He pushed Germany to increase petroleum input from America instead of Russia. He strangled Iran's revenue sources which in turn strangled their terrorist organizations. He stopped the vast majority of illegal immigration and was only prevented from doing more by Democrats. Trump is also charasmatic, in that he comes off as genuine.

That is something I can confirm that I have seen and I find to be a problem. I think RFK behaves like he is out of his mind and has often marketed in bad-faith science that has been quite harmful to people, but I think youre right on the food additive point. The pharma point is honestly super concerning. Pretty sure well be welcoming back measles, mumps and rubella, which isnt great and will be pretty tragic considering it was nearly universally under control. Vaccine skepticism has cost a lot of people their lives and thats not me being partisan. We really should be making progress towards eliminating diseases that have been deadly and debilitating, and sowing doubt in vaccine efficacy doesnt really further that goal.

Imo, the only thing we can do is try to wound Capitalism by organizing a spending strike when Trump takes office.
