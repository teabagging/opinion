This is true for trump as well, he has been a rapist and criminal his whole life but has never risked prison until he became president and in the spotlight.That being said trump should not be pardoned either, right?

Did he happen to have help from known felons who smuggled endangered birds by chance? \\nBoyle had helped Kennedy rehabilitate himself, personally and professionally, after an arrest for heroin possession in 1983 at the age of 29. But now the two men were locked in a power struggle for control of Riverkeeper, the group that Boyle founded and where Kennedy had built a career as a crusading environmental attorney.Their battle at that nights board meeting was over Kennedys push to hire a staff scientist who had just been released from federal prison. His crime: running an international wildlife smuggling ring that prosecutors said had damaged rare bird populations.\\nBoyle argued that employing such a figure at one of New Yorks premier environmental organizations was like hiring a robber as a bank teller. Kennedy was equally insistent that the man be brought on.By the time Riverkeepers board adjourned that night, Kennedy had won, leading Boyle and seven other directors to resign. It was a pivotal moment for the group  whose board would henceforth be dominated by the faction of celebrities and socialites who had backed Kennedy  and for Boyle, who never recovered emotionally from what he saw as his former protgs betrayal, according to people close to himhttps://archive.ph/IyzND#selection-631.0-743.19It's weird how RFK tends to associate with felons huh. It's almost like this isn't about environmentalism for him, but rather creating his own legacy in the Kennedy family. Probably just a coincidence he's opportunistic enough to join a fascist govt! He tried to run as a democrat and was beating Trump head-to-head by 15 points in July. But democrats smeared, censored and marginalized him because he's a threat to their donor class - big pharma, big Ag, big food and military contractors.Yeah I bet his lack of support in the dem party had nothing to do with all the sexual misconduct or helping kill dozens of people in Samoa because of his anti-vax advocacy. Probably had nothing to do with that. Kennedy did not leave the democratic party.He objectively did.If you read his policies, he supported raising the minimum wage, stopping private equity from buying single-family homes, 3% mortgage for first-time home buyers, regenerative agricultureHe supported them SO MUCH he decided to completely stop supporting them by joining an admin that doesn't support them lmao They also colluded with CNN to keep him out of the June debate, despite the fact he was polling around 20% at the time. They left him with no choice with their anti-democratic actions. Meanwhile Trump made 'Make America Healthy Again' the key focus of his campaign. I urge everyone to please listen to Kennedy's August 23 speech. It was the speech that won the election for Trump.I can't get past how gullible you are. Trump won because of inflation, plain and simple. Make America Healthy Again? LMAOOOOOO how do they plan to do that, McDonald's on every corner? Maybe a diet coke in every kid's lunch. Or my favorite, no more vaccines in school! 20 years ago, democrats used to be anti-establishment, anti-war, anti-big pharma, pro-free speechNo they weren't. Now they're just parroting everything big pharma says without skepticism and celebrating Dick Cheney's endorsementThey have always done this, so claiming RFK left because of this tells me everything I need to know about your intellectual honesty. The only thing democrats campaign on anymore is obsessively hating Trump. Is it any surprise someone like RFK who has spent a lifetime taking on corruption no longer recognizes the party?So you think a reasonable solution is joining the fascists? Again, zero critical thinking skills or intellectual curiosity on why RFK would join Trump's admin. Democrats rigged the last two primaries in 2016 and 2020, then cancelled primaries in 2024, gaslighted us all about Biden's condition and then when they could no longer hide it, replaced him with a candidate handpicked by the donor class without a single vote.And your solution to this is to support a sexual predator who got kids killed by telling their societal leaders that vaccines are bad?

The lesser demons sometimes just ask for any type of blood to be dropped or something just soaked in blood, like you can take your stone and just rub it in your steak packages and get blood on it.Also demons have free will, they have a choice to like you or not. If you summon a demon that doesnt like you, you're fucked. Its probably going to trick you or get you into a path of destruction.Its crazy... the only reason i read the book is to know what these people are really doing (even if it works or doesnt work.)","title":"Selling soulDo you think that some celebrity really sold their soul?"},{"text":"Yes.

Canada endures over 750,000 cases of this every year. Nearly every one of these people becomes a permanent resident rather than deported. By 2040 it is anticipated that over 50% of Canadians will either be immigrants or the children of immigrants, with the total reaching as many as 30 million of a projected population of 45 million. By this point people of British or French descent will become the minority in Canada, thin still the plurality. Canadians who have spent 2+ generations in Canada have a negative birth rate.

Yes Hunter did commit crimes.  However, he is also been treated differently by virtue of his connections to the president. The tax fraud case is actually the more serious of the two cases.  But in federal practice it is exceedingly common for tax fraud cases to have a plea deal for probation only as long as the defendant can pay all the past due taxes, penalties and interest owed. The guns and drugs statute he was charged under is very likely unconstitutional under recent Supreme Court Second Amendment case law. Regardless, it is almost never charged as a standalone charge. It is almost always charged in connection with another criminal act pertaining to Controlled Substances or drugs.  However in Hunter's case the only other charge is lying on a Firearms form which again is rarely charged as a standalone crime.  Hunter had a plea deal to resolve both of those cases for probation and additional sanctions which fell apart for procedural reasons but then the prosecutor decided that he wanted to go for broke and put Hunter Biden in prison. That smacked of political influence.  However the plea deal is again pretty uniformly consistent with Federal practice across most of the United States in that they rarely want to put people in prison for lengthy terms for solely those crimes.If the plea deal hadn't Fallen apart, the pardon might not have happened.","title":"Hunter Biden gun case dismissed after President Joe Biden's sweeping pardon"},{"text":"They don't live in reality.

He restored the Hudson river from a sewer to one of the richest water bodies in the world, created the largest water protection organization in the world, set long-term environmental standards for ecosystem protection across North America, fought on behalf of fishermen, farmers, indigenous peoples and working class Americans wronged by giant corporations and government agencies in hundreds of successful lawsuits. He tried to run as a democrat and was [beating Trump head-to-head by 15 points in July](https://www.mahanow.org/july-poll). But democrats smeared, censored and marginalized him because he's a threat to their donor class - big pharma, big Ag, big food and military contractors.Kennedy did not leave the democratic party. If you read his policies, he supported raising the minimum wage, stopping private equity from buying single-family homes, 3% mortgage for first-time home buyers, regenerative agriculture... but democrats blocked him every step of the way, first blocking him from primary and then as an independent they sued him in 18 states to remove him from ballots, keep him in courts and prevent him from campaigning. They also colluded with CNN to keep him out of the June debate, despite the fact he was polling around 20% at the time. They left him with no choice with their anti-democratic actions. Meanwhile Trump made 'Make America Healthy Again' the key focus of his campaign. I urge everyone to please listen to [Kennedy's August 23 speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxNAdilyqow). It was the speech that won the election for Trump.20 years ago, democrats used to be anti-establishment, anti-war, anti-big pharma, pro-free speech... Now they're just parroting everything big pharma says without skepticism and celebrating Dick Cheney's endorsement. The only thing democrats campaign on anymore is obsessively hating Trump. Is it any surprise someone like RFK who has spent a lifetime taking on corruption no longer recognizes the party?Democrats rigged the last two primaries in 2016 and 2020, then cancelled primaries in 2024, gaslighted us all about Biden's condition and then when they could no longer hide it, replaced him with a candidate handpicked by the donor class without a single vote.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experience with this.I live in social housing in the UK for the last five years. And have experienced what you mention:1) Excessive noise (and anger) from neighbours. I live in a top floor flat (4 floors) and my neighbour for the past five years plays the same song on repeat for countless hours a day. Ive complained many many times and the last time I did the housing association said that I was being unreasonable. The neighbour has a learning disability and at one point an anti social behaviour order was raised but nothing came of it. Its been so mentally torturous that if Im ever anywhere else and it gets quiet, I think I can hear that exact song on repeat.I can hear my downstairs neighbours cutting up meat during the day, every day, usually in the morning. This is very unnerving. I can hear doors being closed and people walking about. Luckily Im on the top floor so no-one above me.Whenever I bump into my other long time neighbour he reels off a list of complaints about the building and how he is sabotaging the cleaners by dropping litter to ensure they do their job. He has also jammed the gate on the car park after the association banned access to anyone who didnt own a car (thus banning tenants from having visitors park there). Despite this the car park is nearly always full of very expensive cars most likely of people who dont live here (mostly elderly tenants in my block). After I speak to him, I am always incensed with rage.My doorbell is the most hideous high pitched buzzer. I have taped over it so no one uses it and knocks instead. Same with my entry bell. Just to caveat, I lived in private rented and owned properties for the decades previous to this and didnt experience any of these issues to this extent.2) strange formation of flatsMy bedroom is partially built over the stairwell. And as such is right next to this noisy flat, exacerbating the noise as well as always cold due to no flat underneath providing residual heating.  My other neighbour and I also have a strange balcony across both flats that leads no where and uncovered so he gets seagulls diving at him when he walks to his front door. Occasionally I fall asleep on my sofa in my living room and have a much better nights sleep because of it.When I was on the tenants association it was causally mentioned that there is asbestos in the building I live in but its under control. I have loft space, but Im not allowed to use it despite having access to it. 3) Water supply and wiringOur water supply is connected to mains powering. So if the electric goes so does our water due to it needing pumping upstairs. There is a back up generator but it takes a while to kick in and often breaks. The wiring is also constantly tripping. Until the blocked up the water/rain run off drains outside our upstairs flats there was residual smell of sewerage outside our main doors.There are often workmen installing wiring with no explanation. The last time was full fibre which was drilled into my flat which the housing association claimed to know nothing about.4) surveillance systemsWe have cctv inside the entrance but none outside. We pay a yearly charge for this. Apparently it is monitored live in a control room offsite. The camera is close to the lift system and the inside of the front door. Ive asked for external cctv as there is a covered/secluded walled area which low lighting outside entrance which attracts drug users especially in the colder months. Again, Ive complained about this several times with no resolution. There used to be an office for the housing association on the ground floor but they vacated in the pandemic and now work from home.Overall, Ive felt lucky to get social housing in the UK, like anywhere else it is in short supply. But reflecting on it, it has in many ways been quite torturous to live here on reflection. Ive considered moving out or transferring but cant really afford to live anywhere else. Im intrigued by your links to loosh harvesting. I live in a city with two large football stadiums and have read up on this topic (alongside rigging of professional sports), so it feels like not beyond reason to suspect this is more widespread and focused on particular demographics.Ironically, a member of the housing team just buzzed my deafening buzzer to check the fire safety of my front door. Hopefully, they can have a word with my neighbour who once again has the same song on repeat. When talking about being locked into specific chakras, particularly the root chakra what is meant by that? Best wishes.","title":"Public housing loosh harvesting"},{"text":"\\"We are only charging you with complicity,\\" the magistrate went on, \\"for the man who touched the electric wires burned his hand; that is a strong point in your favour.

Would Republicans in Congress be preparing to certify the result in the new year? Would the partys voters accept her as the legitimate president when asked in polls? On all three counts, there is enough doubt that posing the questions doesnt seem exotic.\\nWithout quite acknowledging it, American politics has arrived at an understanding. One side can ignore the rules of the game  to the point of challenging election outcomes without proof of fraud  and the other cant, or at least doesnt. In the language of the street, but also of game theory, the Democratic party is the sucker. If it were one of the two detainees in the prisoners dilemma, it would confess to a crime, the accomplice wouldnt, and jail would beckon for the former. The prisoner at least has the excuse of ignorance. Democrats are aware of being diddled.\\nThis isnt tenable. The ultimate risk to the American republic is that Democrats give up their unilateral observance of basic norms. The system can survive, just about, one of the two main parties going feral. It cant survive both. And so the story isnt that Joe Biden has pardoned his son, having promised not to. (Even Jimmy Carter, tower of Baptist rectitude, pardoned the first brother and Libya enthusiast Billy Carter.) The story is what far worse behaviours it might augur from the Democrats in future, given the incentives they face.\\nBehaviours such as? Giving up on normal leaders and elevating a demagogue of the left: a Huey Long for our age. Or choosing which election results to honour. Or embracing a leftist version of deep state theory: a total rejection of the US system. The federal judiciary is now permeated with Trump appointees at district, appellate and Supreme level. The tech and finance sectors, which together run much of the architecture of modern life, are pro-Trump to a growing extent. And all this is before his second term, during which his tentacles will spread. Soon, it might be senior Democrats arguing that institutional America is against them, and that survival is not compatible with playing by Marquess of Queensberry rules.\\nHere is a prediction. At some point, a Democrat of note will write a liberal version of Michael Antons Flight 93 essay. To recap, Anton is the conservative who told his peers in 2016 that Trump, however potentially harmful, was preferable to certain doom for America under godless liberalism. For all its histrionics, the argument had internal logic. If you believe the entire constitutional order is compromised, and the other party unscrupulous, it would be mad to act as normal. Antons disgust was less for Democrats than Republicans: for observing the usual niceties, for nibbling on crumbs from the enemy and calling it half a loaf, for revering Burkean decorum when Leninist hardball should be the model.\\nThe Democrats are ripe for a similar eureka moment. Even now, the trend of the partys behaviour is alarming. Aside from the unpardonable pardon, the Democrats tried to sneak an obviously too old Biden past the electorate until a televised debate exposed their lie. (Might the nation have so much as a sorry?) With luck, this is a phase, not a trailer for the future. This column doesnt suggest that Democrats should break the rules of the game. But their objective interests suggest they eventually will.\\nHow might I be wrong? Well, game theory assumes that all actors are self-seeking. It doesnt account for patriotism, or the capacity for shame, either of which might keep the Democrats in line. A liberal would say that Republicans havent played fair since Newt Gingrich untamed them in 1994, that none of the last three Democratic presidents were treated as wholly legitimate on the right, and that Democrats, despite all these provocations, have not retaliated in kind. Values guide human action, not just incentives.\\nTo which Id say: the incentives have never been as clear as now. Until a month ago, the Democrats could tell themselves that Republican rule-breaking incurs swift punishment from voters. 2018, 2020 and 2022 were proofs. All that changed in November. A man who tried to overturn a presidential election won the very next one. What reward is there for observing protocol, then? When does honour become a mugs game? For now, the atmosphere on the left is one of tired acceptance. But in a reversal of the stages of grief, it might be that anger comes later, as a generation of liberals emerges that despises their elders as civilised to a fault.\\nTwo reckless parties: it is unthinkable in a mature democracy. But so, just a decade ago, was the simultaneous debasement of Labour and the Conservatives in Britain. The culmination was Boris Johnson versus Jeremy Corbyn in 2019, the Iran-Iraq war of elections.\\nIt could happen in the US. In fact, the wonder of the Biden pardon is that Democrats havent done much worse, much earlier. Comparing Trump to 1930s fascists never captured the true nature of his threat. Those despots wanted such grandiosities as one people, one realm, one leader or  . . . nothing outside the state, nothing against the state. The danger for America is that Democrats succumb to a more banal motto, the eternal refrain of the cynic. Everyone does it.","title":"Americas nightmare is two feral parties: The Democrats might decide that playing by the rules has got them nowhere"},{"text":"lol okay dude Have a great day because I willTake care","title":"Republicans Are Taking the Hunter Biden Pardon in Stride, If Taking in Stride Means Losing Their Minds Over It"},{"text":"Charles Manson never left the spotlight and he was a pretty big loser.

That money is not coming back to you or your family. But the money did go to everyone around you. If you are a landlord it paid the rent. If you work at a business SSA money has flowed through it. You have to look at the big picture and beyond thinking of it as an IRA. The absolute biggest issue is that people will not voluntarily save for these things if SSA is not around. It HAS to come out of paychecks automatically. Sure some people will save. But not everyone and I'd guess **most** people will not save. I'm telling you. I see situations all day, everyday.

From what we publicly can access:Hunter joined Burisma when Biden was the sitting vice president, and was heavily involved in foreign relations pertaining to Ukraine.Interesting enough, the owner of the Burisma, Mykola Zlocchesky apparently was a suspect of scrutiny. Mind you, Ukraine at this time was riddled with corruption to begin with. Ukraine Authorities were already investigating money laundering, tax evasion, and other offenses pertaining to Mykola and it stemmed deep to his government positions prior. When Victor Shokin was appointed Ukraines prosecutor general in 2015, one of the big files on his desk was Burisma. The Obama administration were heavily criticizing Ukraine corruption at this time, and Joe Biden himself threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine if Shokin was not removed.All of the above is already shady and raises viable questions. To make matters worse, you remember the board member I referenced earlier? He testified already claiming that for ten years, Hunter  Sold the illusion of access to Joe Biden. In other words, he was accepting bribes to get Joe Biden to accept calls. I dont know the extent of Joe Bidens involvement, but Id bet my left nut Hunter Biden is a corrupt sociopath.","title":"Newsom and Schiff sharply criticize president for pardoning Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Its a pro pootin subI like turtles","title":"Biden has always been a liar and a Fraud.

I don't.  Democrats certainly cared about him (Or at least his audience) when they were trying to mine it for votes.He's making a point though that a lot of people, including myself, agree with.  Instead of arguing the point, Democrats decide to attack him personally, or like the above commenter did, call him a clown.  Would he be a clown if he were defending the President?  No, then Democrats would praise him and talk about how we should listen to him. If Don Jr. and Eric were facing similar charges to Hunter, and Trump pardoned them, would Charlemagne be a clown for criticizing it?  No, again, Democrats would praise him and talk about how we should listen to him.Democrats love you when they can get something from you, and Charlamagne has been useful to Democrats for years, but nothing he's done in those years matters today.  Today is all about defending Biden's honor, so if Charlemagne isn't useful in that effort (Why do we care about defending Biden's honor again?), he's a clown and nobody should give a shit about what he says.

About what actually happened in the air after that.Science is not, and can not be, about perfection.  It is as much about how to handle finding out that you're wrong about things that you think you know.It's about figuring out how to fully test things, to figure out if you're really right or wrong about things.But you hit a real snag when you can't ethically run the experiments necessary to really test chunks of knowledge.COVID researchers got around it, by doing their best and watching what went wrong.  It's a _horrible_ way to learn, but sometimes it's the only way that we do learn.Now, we _also_ had some serious problems with public policy handling the new knowledge correctly.  With some choices which were...  Suboptimal.Once you start to suspect that you've been wrong about it being airborne, and start to think that masks are going to be essential to keeping the spread down, and then you realize that you don't have enough masks even for the most vital personnel, what do you tell the public?In places, sometimes the decision was made to continue with the old advice, because they didn't want the limited supply that existed to be immediately grabbed up by people not required to keep everyone _else_ alive.Of course, that problem was caused by policy choices made in the years leading up to COVID.The US was supposed to be maintaining stockpiles of supplies to handle a pandemic very much like COVID.And then, well...  Those supplies were not kept up to date, and were generally not maintained.For example, some of the stockpiled items, like masks, were no longer usable because they were stored in conditions that allowed them to become moldy.And people responsible for those choices _really_ didn't want to be the ones to stand up and say that they are, at least in part, why a whole bunch of people are going to die.TLDR: The scientific community did their best, but sometimes you can do your best and still not do well enough.  COVID absolutely provided several such examples.","title":"Republicans stood behind Obama when he won?! WTF?!"},{"text":"Put the crystal in my pocket, keep the knife in hand.

Theres around a 0.4-5% decline in buying power indices in counties where Walmart opens (with metro areas seeing the lower, more negligible end of that spectrum, and the north having lower effects than the south) according to [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016604621200018X).On the other hand:In spite of presenting evidence of Wal-Marts monopsony power over its workers, the results presented in this paper do not advocate policy intervention for three reasons. First, given the relatively small magnitude of the wage-elasticity for the total supply of retailing labor and the large wage-elasticity of fringe retailers demand for labor in areas where the company operates, the losses in workers surplus are likely to be internalized in large part by the other retail firms operating in the market with relatively small deadweight losses. Second, the measures presented here are valid for a post-entry scenario and do not consider the overall impact on retail labor of Wal-Marts entry; there is no a priori reason to believe that in counties without Wal-Mart the perfectly competitive equilibrium wages paid by other retailers would be higher than the monopsony wages set by the company. Third, considering Wal-Marts depressive influence on retail prices (Basker, 2005b, Basker and Noel, 2009, Hausman and Leibtag, 2007) and incumbent retailers oligopoly power (Cleary and Lopez, 2011), there are doubts as to whether deadweight losses from the companys anti-competitive behavior toward workers would overpower consumers welfare gains.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It's easy to shoot from the hip if you don't want to hit anything.

They are the source for the common statistics that:  Nearly 300,000 minors, under age 18, were legally married in the U.S. between 2000 and 2018, this study found.  Some 60,000 marriages since 2000 occurred at an age or spousal age difference that should have been considered a sex crime.  Now, my first issue is with the first statistic, and to UcaLs credit, this is not an error they make, and is pretty pedantic on my part. The problem is really how the statistic gets spread, namely, that the definition of child is dropped. The *federal* age of majority is 18, but most states actually have varying definitions for the age of majority depending on the particular action. The [age of consent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent_in_the_United_States) ranges from 16-18. Hilariously, Puerto Rico and Mississippi define the age of adulthood as 21 (Nebraska and Alabama do 19), so although it is legal to marry at 18, these are all technically child marriages according to Mississippi and Puerto Rican law. Its probably good not to include this.^1Okay, but the second issue I have is pretty significant: that 300,000 number is *insane* cherry-picking. [Their own numbers confirm this!](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00341-4/fulltext) Here is the table for child marriages in the US by year:Year | Minors Wed (Actual + Estimated)2000 | 76,3962001 | 35,8092002 | 20,5422003 | 18,8672004 | 17,0332005 | 16,8712006 | 14,1912007 | 12,7102008 | 11,4212009 | 10,3252010 | 9,1022011 | 22,3612012 | 6,9622013 | 5,9332014 | 4,9432015 | 4,2752016 | 3,6952017 | 3,1042018 | 2,493Andhey, wait just a second. A full one third of the marriages are in 2000 and 2001! Whats this study that came out in 2021 doing including data from 20 years prior that shows a monotonic decline (excepting 2011 which is a weird year) to just 15% of the average value? And they dont talk about this anywhere. If just 2,500 child marriagesand again, a child is anyone under 18Care happening, andalso according to UcaLs statisticsIm really not sure how much I should care. I care a lot less than if its the 75,000 that were happening in 2001, or the 16,666 that are apparently happening if you take the average.Its weird because, shouldnt this be like Mission Accomplished!? Shouldnt we try to figure out what has already worked to decrease the rate so much?Now for the third point: 96% of the children involved are 16-17. This isnt exactly hidden, and its kind of the same as the first point, but this also isnt an issue of definition. Its an issue of focus. UcaL tells a lot of stories about 9-year-olds and one 5-year-old (what. the. fuck.) but works out to just around 100 people under age 16 per year for the 2018 numbers. In fact, their full data shows that 67% of children married from 2000-2018 were 17, 29% were 16, 4% were 15, and the total number of under-15s they have data for was 1321of whom 1223 were 14. 100 people under age 14 getting married between 2000 and 2018 is not a good thing, but how much does it matter? And what is the rate for 2018? Is this even still happening or did it stop in 2001 and were just now realizing how bad shit *was*?Now thats not really a good thing, but I also dont rank it highly on the list of social problems we have to triage. It is really easy to fix though? Idk.Anyway, next point. That 60,000 marriages that **should** have been considered a sex crime is sooo loaded. First, UcaL just openly admit that they took the data from California and added it to their preexisting data:McGill Universitys analysis of Unchaineds data found 34,943 to 40,224 marriages since 2000 occurred at an age or with a spousal age difference that should have constituted a sex crime under the relevant states law. In some 80%, sex became legal within marriage; in the other 20%, sex within the marriage was a crime. Unchained added to the analysis the estimated 23,588 children married in California between 2000 and 2018, all of whom fit in the first category.And like, sure, that technically makes sense, because California criminalizes all sex involving minors. But thats also why prosecutorial discretion exists. The state absolutely **should not** prosecute high school teens for posession of child pornography just because theyre sexting each other. It really should not even consider this as the same thing.[The data doesnt really get better from here.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21005528) Because they used each states own definition of statutory rape, its pretty hard to parse. Which states are representative of how much a marital exemption to statutory rape matters?UcaL state:Some 86% of the children who married were girls C and most were wed to adult men (age 18 or older). Further, when girls married, their average spousal age difference was four years, whereas when boys married, their average spousal age difference was less than half that: 1.5 yearsSo four years is a lot! But also averages arent a great tool here. The average of a set of age difference of three 16-year-old couples and one 16-and-35-year-old couple is 4.75. The median and mode are much better. This time I cant find any answer to what those numbers are, and this seems like the most important question.**TLDR** This is not really a super important analysis. Child marriage is probably bad for nearly everyone who does it, even when it is as rare as 2500 instances per year. Given that I cant really think of a great excuse, I doubt there are 2500 good excuses. And even if it is good for some people, its not really a *significant* good in a society where marriage matters much less than it used to, so blah blah harm prevention political philosophy etc. etc.I come to the shocking conclusion that child marriage bad.1: On the other hand, we could take this seriously. We dont let people smoke or drink until 21. Most states require you to be 20 to rent a car, and only ban age discrimination starting at age 25. A handful of populous states also have 21 as the minimum age for firearm licensing. Maybe we should encourage waiting longer to marry. ?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yet another government overreach into private business.","title":"Democrat-Appointed Judge Blocks Musk From Receiving Compensation Package Approved By Shareholders"},{"text":"Dont give them shit until they consent to background checks.","title":"Trump teams to deploy throughout government after reaching agreement with the Biden administration"},{"text":"All accusations are projections.","title":"Hypocrite Mitch McConnell Complains That Democrats Are Too Partisan"},{"text":"Have you considered the people's psychology is the problem?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"As you approach the door, you examine the lock, its a dial combination lock.

That means Harris was perceived as 3.18 points to the left of how voters viewed themselves, compared to Trump being perceived as 2.15 points to the right. While a one-point difference may not seem significant, these ratings are like a Richter scale, so when voters put themselves that much closer to Trump, its an indication of a real problem for Democrats.","title":"The Left-Flank Albatross"},{"text":"you might not remember me, but i remember you. i've been treating it as real the whole time. you didnt want to think about that tech five years ago, but unfortunately, it is real. reality is reality tho, we all share enough of it for it not to be easily shiftable. i'm more pissed that theyre hiding free energy while i cant afford to heat my apartment in fcking 10 weather","title":"I Told You About All Of This Half A Year Ago.

Once that precedent was overturned, people lost a human right that they previously had for 50 years.They recognized privacy as a constitutional right, and interpreted that to include abortion. Abortion has never been a constitutional right.The grounds for roe were *always* shakey and people have been talking about this for ages. They assumed that because it was politically relatively secure the supreme court wouldn't touch it. Then the instant it was no longer politically secure, the supreme court threw it out. Because it was never really good law.The argument came down to borderline Lockner logic of \\"The government can never do anything\\". Specifically in this case, one would simply need to gesture to;\\"If somebody has bullet wounds, can the government use that as evidence of a crime?\\" which has always been:\\"Yes.\\".Not;\\"Muh Privacy\\". The right to abortion was based on the latter interpretation and that court constantly used \\"Privacy\\" arguments as a reason to overturn criminal sanctions, which as a logic is fairly shakey if you don't commit to the bit and say all criminal sanctions are unconstitutional.Moreover it relied on the scandalizing nature of contraception, infidelity, and abortion to make these decisions, which again, \\"Why not rape and pedophilia?\\" says the swan chasing the court, but beyond that, those things aren't quite as scandalizing now.It was always going to be overturned.

They did everything wrong and if they did everything backwards we would have been much better off. They closed all out door activities like beaches and we learned from early on that Covid doesn't spread out doors. This kept people indoors where Covid was more likely to spread. Andrew Cuomo sent close to 9000 patients infected with Covid and put them in nursing homes. Seems to me like he wanted to maliciously infect and kill of the elderly in the nursing homes, that is the only explanation that I could come up with. It's not rocket science to realize that putting people that are infected with Covid with elderly people is a very bad idea. Stores also closed much earlier, so now you have people rushing to go to the store all at one time before they close. Stores should have had longer hours not shorter, so the immune compromised could go shopping later after everyone else already did their shopping. By shortening store hours they are cramming more people into the store all at one time. Lockdowns lead to more people drinking, substance abuse, and in some cases suicide because of depression. During lockdowns it was much harder for people to go to the doctor and get regular checkups and wellness screenings, which lead to even more illnesses. Crime also spiked very high during the lockdowns. Obesity also went up because people were not exercising and gyms were closed and people were eating more. The report did a poor job of explaining why lockdowns were harmful and didn't go into detail. I also posted a link of how children were harmed the most during Covid. https://www.childrenshospitals.org/news/childrens-hospitals-today/2021/04/7-effects-of-the-covid19-pandemic-on-kidsMasking was completely useless and none of the studies looked at how people used masked every day. For starters people would buy the cheap cloth masks and reuse them, so they weren't even using the N95 mask. At my work people would wear the mask and then when they went to the break room they would take the mask off and then put it on the table and then when they went back to work they would put the mask back on again. That can't be very sanitary, but people were doing it. Even my mom that was very pro mask would use the same cloth mask over and over again, so now she was wearing a mask that was accumulating bacteria. People would also constantly touch their mask and then rub their eyes, I'm pretty sure thats not going to help anyone. This is how people most people were using masks and none of the studies examined how most people were using the masks.https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/opinion/do-mask-mandates-work.htmlhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15409-xThe big box stores were the biggest winners during the pandemic while the small mom &amp; pop stores got totally screwed and many of them went under. They picked winners and losers during Covid. Landlords also got screwed as well because people were laid off from work, so they couldn't pay their rent and the landlord couldn't evict them due to special circumstances. Other measures were taken and once again were not backed by science. Businesses had Plexi glass and somehow people thought that would stop Covid. Stores had arrows on the floor that told people which way to walk down an isle, once again this measure was completely useless. I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. Everything went against logic and this is exactly why faith in the CDC and other government health agencies is at an all time low.","title":"House Covid-19 panel releases final report criticizing public health response to the pandemic"},{"text":"Ok?

I even think we've added an entirely new market just for upper middle class people. It's a market that didn't exist in the past, because the income gaps were not large enough to support it. The problem Democrats have speaking to the \\"working class\\" hasn't always existed. It's a result of Democrats moving to the center under Clinton, which was arguably necessary at the time. Back then Republicans were winning the educated vote and the middle-upper class vote that went along with it. So Democrats adopted much of the Republican playbook and the language for themselves. This includes a greater effort to appeal to the wealthy and corporations for campaign donations, since Republicans were destroying them here, as well.The problem today is that Democrats won't acknowledge that things have changed and they're afraid to tell their wealthy puppet masters what they don't want to hear. Kamala shifting to the center has been typical of Democrats for 30 years and so it was nothing new. But it's not what people want anymore, either. I just filled out a survey from Kamala's fundraising committee and it never even mentioned people in lower income brackets. Which you might say makes sense because they don't have much money to contribute, but it's also more of the same status quo that voters don't want. Of course it was probably only intended to raise money, but for what and for who? Many voters will just see it as another example of Democrats not understanding the predicaments of the \\"working class\\". The funny thing is that Trump wasn't afraid of telling people he would go after \\"elites\\", even though he'll actually protect them. But Kamala, who actually did go after elites with the Biden Administration, wouldn't think of saying something that might scare off big donors. I believe Trump fooled people, but what good did it do for Kamala to play it safe? Yes, Kamala promised to raise taxes on the wealthy, while Trump promised to lower them, yet Trump received the \\"working class\\" vote because they believed he was more likely to help them economically. My point is that you're right about Democrats not speaking the language.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"And filling every town hall with ruddy faced cosplay riots screaming their heads off about nothin (tea party mvmt).","title":"Republicans stood behind Obama when he won?!

There is no Soviet Union, so now it exists to oppose the successor state of the Soviet Union.  When the Soviet Union fell, Western leaders promised to not expand NATO towards Russia, a promise that they failed to keep.  NATO is led by the most belligerent of modern military powers, the United States of America.  The USA is responsible for the majority of military violence in the world since the end of WWII.  The USA still militarily occupies Germany and Japan.  The USA has created a ring of military bases around China.  The USA invaded Iraq in 2003 under false pretenses and had its leader executed.  The USA invaded Libya and allowed its leader to be horribly assassinated.  The USA currently occupies large sections of Syria and is responsible for fomenting and funding the rebels in Syria's civil war, which was the cause of the 2015 refugee crisis.  Prior to the Syrian civil war, American leaders broadly praised Vladimir Putin.  Then Russia aided President Assad against the aims of the American interlopers, and the Putin became the new Antichrist.  America controls the largest military on the planet, is greedy &amp; won't stop with Ukraine.  Your prediction about the aims and future actions of Russia are conjecture, only.  From all appearances, Russia invaded Ukraine to forestall Ukraine from joining NATO.  No one - no one - has attempted a dipomatic solution to the war.  On the contrary, Western leaders, starting with Boris Johnson, have encouraged Ukraine to conscript its men and throw them at the Russians, and they have given millions of dollars in bribes to Zelensky, his ministers, and his generals to encourage them to do so.  American intelligence has known since Bloody Bush years that Russia considered the entrance of Ukraine and Georgia into NATO as the bright red line.  It is the famous Nyet Means Nyet cable that Wikileaks heroically exposed.    Instead of guessing about Russia's aims and getting off on the violence, you should be taking a moral stance: Urge diplomacy.  Accept neutrality for Ukraine.  Reign in NATO, which became obsolete upon the fall of the Soviet Union.

Though Republicans won more than the 218 seats necessary to control the House, President-elect Trump wants two House members to serve in his administration, and a third, Matt Gaetz, resigned his seat this month.\\n \\n Mr. Duarte conceded on Tuesday, according to Duane Dichiara, a campaign spokesman. The congressman trailed by 187 votes in a contest in which more than 210,000 were cast.\\n \\n Mr. Gray declared victory on Tuesday evening, two days before counties in California were required to certify their results. The Associated Press had not yet called the race.\\n \\n The final results confirm this district is ready for independent and accountable leadership that always puts the Valleys people ahead of partisan politics, Mr. Gray said in a statement on X.\\n \\n Mr. Grays win was a reversal of the 2022 race in the 13th Congressional District, when Mr. Duarte beat him by the second-smallest margin in any House race that year.\\n \\n California notably takes longer to tabulate votes because elections officials are flooded with mail-in ballots that must be inspected and verified. The state gives county offices weeks to complete their tallies and reach out to voters whose ballots may lack a proper signature.\\n \\n In the initial election night count, Mr. Duarte led by more than 3,000 votes. But Mr. Gray steadily chipped away at that lead in subsequent updates until he went ahead for the first time on Tuesday.\\n \\n Both Mr. Duarte, an agricultural businessman, and Mr. Gray, who touts his early years working at his familys dairy supply store, campaigned on their advocacy for the regions farmers and their ability to be a bipartisan voice in Washington.\\n \\n They also both called for investing in water infrastructure in the Central Valley and pledged to ensure that the regions growers have access to water as the state plans for future droughts.\\n \\n While Mr. Gray has emphasized endorsements from local law enforcement officials, Mr. Duarte told a local television station that he was a pro-choice Republican who supports womens rights.\\n \\n Though Democrats lost the House, they had eyed the seat as one of the most promising to flip in the country, and they helped Mr. Gray rake in millions of dollars to unseat Mr. Duarte. About 41 percent of voters in the district are registered Democrats, while about 29 percent are Republicans.\\n \\n Mr. Gray had raised $5.4 million and Mr. Duarte $4.1 million, according to campaign finance filings through Oct. 16. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also spent $1.7 million on the race, records showed.","title":"California Democrat Flips Seat in the Last House Race to Be Decided"},{"text":"In December 2017, Fujimori was pardoned by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, shortly after Fujimori's son, Congressman Kenji Fujimori, helped President Kuczynski survive an impeachment vote.[128][129] The pardon was overturned by the Supreme Court on 3 October 2018, and Fujimori was sent back to prison in January 2019.[130][131][132] The Constitutional Court of Peru in a 4C3 ruling on 17 March 2022 reinstated the pardon.[133] On 8 April 2022, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights overruled the Constitutional Court and ordered Peru not to release Fujimori.[134] The Constitutional Court ordered on 5 December 2023 that he be immediately released.[135]Overruled, overruled, overruled, overruled","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Pete Hegseths mom in an email: I dont know where you learned to be so evil, certainly not from me, and somehow you will not take me seriously even nowPete Hegseths mom now: My son is perfect.

Democrats also couldn't seem to grasp that inflation meant that people felt financial pressure, even though the economy is doing well. It gave the impression of the Democrats being out of touch.When I was growing up, Democrats were the party of the working poor and middle class. Now, Republicans have shaped the Democrats' image as out of touch elites, and Democrats don't seem effective at arguing against that.My main argument is two-fold:1. Democrats are bad at messaging. Every issue is framed by Republicans, as are most of the words we use to talk about them.\\n2. Democrats mostly play politics like it's 1985. They're still running on governing and issues. They don't seem to realize we are in a deeply emotional, 10-second attention span, social media world.Most Democrats knew more about what Trump said than what Kamala said. Vanishingly few people could tell you a Kamala slogan. Most don't even know what she stood for, past women's reproductive rights.All of that is on top of the fact that Kamala got all of the negatives of being an incumbent and none of the benefits.","title":"CMV: Progressives Need to Become Comfortable with Selling Their Candidates and Ideas to the Broader Electorate"},{"text":"I don't claim to be poor.

In other words, some of these things are decent or well meaning sentiments, but theyre also kind of non starters.They're just not practical solutions considering how the next administration has already made it clear that their stance on the conflict is rigidly pro-israel. How can you realistically expect these measures to succeed?I don't think there's a reality where these actions officially succeed or prevail long enough to make any headway towards a two state solution, let alone receive the kind of bipartisan or public support that would justify them.These kinds of actions would face swift backlash by both the U.S. and Israel. And even their implementation can't be assured. Also, in terms of executive power, Biden might be overreaching with some of these suggestions. And not only is the MAGA coalition an obstacle, but so is the Israeli government, specifically far right figures like Bibi, Ben Gvir, Smotrich, even Maoz, etc... there just aren't any assurances when we know that these far right figures have no intention of even considering a two state solution, while in the past, efforts like Obama's were met with considerable public push back from Bibi himself, and Obama was excoriated for it. These types of actions would create a firestorm on their own, not only impacting Biden's legacy, but appearing desperate and disingenuous.

Notable instances include:Foreign Payments to Trump-Owned Properties  \\nInvestigations revealed that businesses owned by Trump received substantial payments from foreign governments during his presidency. A report by House Democrats found that these businesses accepted at least $7.8 million from 20 countries, including China and Saudi Arabia. Such transactions have been scrutinized for potential violations of the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits federal officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign states without congressional consent.Foreign Government Expenditures at Trump Hotels  \\nSpecific instances include six foreign governments spending over $750,000 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., during his tenure. These expenditures have raised questions about whether foreign entities sought to influence U.S. policy by patronizing Trump-owned establishments.Undisclosed Foreign Loans  \\nReports indicate that during his campaign, the Trump Organization owed nearly $20 million to L/P Daewoo, a company with ties to North Korea. This debt was not disclosed in campaign financial filings and was paid off five months into his presidency.Income from Foreign Business Ventures  \\nTrump's tax returns show that he received income from more than a dozen countries during his presidency, highlighting potential conflicts of interest.Earnings by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner  \\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both served as senior advisors in the White House. During this period, they reportedly earned between $172 million and $640 million in outside income, primarily from their business ventures. This substantial income, earned while holding official positions, has raised concerns about potential conflicts between their government roles and private business interests.Middle Eastern Investments in Family Ventures  \\nPost-presidency, the Trump family has pursued business deals in the Middle East. Eric Trump announced plans to expand real estate and hospitality projects in Oman and Saudi Arabia, including a luxury resort in Oman and a Trump Tower in Jeddah. Additionally, Jared Kushner's investment firm received a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, raising further ethical questions.Legal Controversies and Allegations  \\nIncitement of Insurrection  \\nRetention of Classified Documents  \\nEmployment of Individuals Without Security Clearances  \\nAny democratic president and his family would be in prison for it but you believe your cult leader is above the law.","title":"President Biden set to issue a pardon of his son Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Moscow Mitch?

Lawyer here. Your \\"straightforward format\\" is anything but. Let's take your marijuana legalization example. Does that mean that you have to allow sale to minors? Is medical-only marijuana sufficient? Does this mean that you have to allow smoking it indoors? Can a state create a monopoly on the product, like some do with alcohol? Could such a state set prices prohibitively high? How does this affect the penalties for driving while under the influence? What are the requirements for growing it? Can states enforce purity laws? Are vapes \\"marijuana\\", or is this only leaf format? \\"Simple\\" statements like that can't really be \\"binding law\\". There are just too many complexities involved in every law. Congress does their best to predict a lot of it, but even so, they have to leave a lot for the agencies to develop regulations for.

Republicans often weaponize the recall process, with Republican judges sometimes interfering to extend deadlines, giving recall campaigns more time to gather the required signatures. Governor Gray Davis was recalled in the wake of the 2001 rolling blackouts, an event that Republicans capitalized on to push him out of office.The recall ballot consists of two questions:1. Should the governor be recalled?\\n2. If the governor is recalled, who should replace them?At the time, Democrats underestimated the threat, assuming the recall was so absurd that voters wouldnt support it. As a result, they invested little effort in defending Davis. When the recall succeeded, the second questiondetermining his replacementfeatured a chaotic field of about 25 candidates. Schwarzenegger won with a narrow plurality (literally 10% of the vote), slipping into office amidst the disarray.Theres no question California is a progressive state. Our elected officials are frustrated by the status quo and actively work toward change. However, California's biggest problem is voter turnout for propositions, which is the failsafe of progressive legislation out here. The Supreme Court generally won't come for state legislation that was passed by a majority. While Californians tend to show up to vote for president, Senate, Congress, or state assembly/senate races, they often ignore ballot measures.This is incredibly frustrating because the average Californian likely supports measures like rent control, raising the minimum wage, or investing in affordable housing. Yet, these propositions consistently fail because only about 20% of voters show up for these specific races. A prime example of this dynamic was Proposition 8, the 2008 measure that banned same-sex marriage. It passed, not because it reflected the values of most Californians, but because low turnout allowed a vocal minority of bigots to carry the day. Many voters were shocked and appalled when they realized it had passed, having been unaware it was even on the ballot.","title":"Red States \\"quality of life\\""},{"text":"See, aren't these the modern conservative values that all the radio shows, TV shows, and personalities kept telling America that they loved?

Some movies pull off the physical badass female like Kill Bill or the Resident Evil movies and Black Widow in the original avengers, etc.  But those seem to be more rare these days because the kickass female type changed and what they changed into seems less compelling.Hollywood is also bad at making interesting women.

The [top 50-90%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WFRBLN40080) of Americans weren't hit as hard, but they were still about 8% poorer than they were pre-Recession.Outside of tech, the job market was pretty brutal- with so many people out of work, competition for even the most entry level jobs was intense.People knew that the recession had started under Bush and the Republicans, and the economy was growing again, but I can understand why they were not enthusiastic to turn out and vote for Democrats.The slow recovery from the Great Recession was the reason we got so much fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2020-21- economists and policymakers (and especially the Fed) decided that they didn't want a repeat of the 2010s.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 3, 2024"},{"text":"Literally every other country on earth is.

So the Harris campaign (and possibly you?) were so goddamn **out of touch** that they/you really honestly believed that the Democratic Party was *too left?*. That is such a fucking ridiculous notion that it borders on parody. The Democratic Party isnt left, period. Let alone is it too left. What an absolutely asinine notion. You just keep arguing points that reinforce that democrats are in a different fucking universe from everyone that isnt a Republican voter. That is completely and utterly out of touch. Real, actual people want actual progressive politics. Remember the statistics I spoke of in my original comment? Not only that, but look at the entire fucking developed world. There is not a single developed country on earth besides the United States without universal healthcare, paid parental leave, free or extremely cheap public universities, comprehensive public transportation, the list goes on. Not a fucking *whiff* of any of those policy items *any* democrats goddamn mouth. The United States stands alone.

I totally get you on how it upsetting it is to feel like people are talking down to you. I see folks in this thread telling you that you're being manipulated, etc.; I hear your story about being told you're sexist for disliking Captain Marvel. I can see why that feels unfair and frustrating. I also agree that it's not OK to demonize white people (or any group of people). Nobody's better or worse than anyone else just because of their skin color. At the same time, it sounds like you think the biggest problem in video gaming is \\"wokism\\", but... remember just how awful gaming culture was for women, 10 or 15 years ago?I watch a variety of competitive video game streamers, some of them women. One of them, 15 years ago, played in a regional tournament, sponsored by Blizzard, in which another team named themselves \\"rape\\" and then her name. She was 17 at the time. That wasn't a fluke; look up basically any female streamer and you can find them sharing horror stories about just how toxic gaming was for women not long ago.Sequels are becoming ever more popular with film and video game developers because they're \\"safe\\". It's risky to make new IP. That's a discouraging trend, and it seems more like the real problem to me than \\"wokism\\" in film. Put another way: which is worse, an actually very talented black actress getting cast as a mermaid - a fictional being - in the live-action Little Mermaid... or the fact that Disney has spent billions on relatively uninspired live-action versions of all its greatest hits?As recently as 2010, according to the?[Hollywood Diversity Report](https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2023-Film-3-30-2023.pdf), about 10% of lead actors were nonwhite, while 40% of Americans were nonwhite.?In other words, 14 years ago, nearly half of Americans weren't white, but almost all the leading roles went to white people. That seems actually kinda messed up.

Ditto 1956, 1967 and 1973. The last one held several important factors. One the Arab oil embargo that knocked out US economy resulting long lines in gas stations and hyperinflation. America ain't let this happen again. So begins American hegemony in Middle East. Two it happened on Yom Kippur the holiest day in Jewish calendar. And also for first time the Arabs nearly defeated Israel, Egypt did well it was Syria that fumbled. Israel promised never again she will be caught by surprise.Now the Palestinians have been also fighting Israel. And also their Arab hosts. After they were expelled by Israel in Nakba. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NakbaMost significantly Black September in 1970-71 which Jordan battled PLO. The PLO then relocated to Lebanon in which they set up a de facto state. In 1982 Israel lauched an invasion of Lebanon to destroy PLO. After defeating PLO Isreal decided to stay in southern Lebanon as a deterrent a of possible attack on northern Israel. This will give impetus to the formation of Hezbollah.In 2006 the abduction of 3 Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah sparked a war between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel being so many times defeating Arabs was supremely confident.Things started getting wrong when Hezbollah struck an Israeli Saar-class warship with Chinese-made antiship missile. Ground war isn't better when even the so-called elite Golan brigade having difficulties. But the real dent to Israeli pride was when their Merkava tanks were damaged by Hezbollah anti-tank missiles.Isreali Air Force with no one to fight them was conducting strike after strike especially to eliminate Hezbollah rocket launchers. But still those rockets rained down on northern Isreal. The Isreali Iron Dome system then wasn't good enough. So Isreal left. A draw isn't good enough. Hezbollah especially Nasrallah was top priority for Israel. From that day Israel would work to destroy them.So can you imagine on Yom Kippur that year Hamas breached Israeli defences and stormed across into Israel. No Arab country did before. Hamas know damn well the Israeli retribution that was why they took hostages. Hamas kmow damn well Israel will destroy Gaza they counting on world opinion (and hostages) to mitigate Israeli anger and revenge.To be caught pants down and on Yom Kippur again...But as later the conflict will Hezbollah showed the massive efforts by Israel since 2006. The exploding pagers and walkie-talkies. The assassination of Nasrallah.

Not so much the smell but the fact they didnt give a fuck and fought the man and fought dirty.I?mean as an example Healthcare for All basically just eliminates the health insurance industry and lets people use their money without a middleman leeching it. Lets kill the health insurance industry for a start. Then well try bringing Wall Street to heel, then Citizens United and the lobbyists, maybe strengthen unions while were at it.?A guy tried saying that stuff and the DNC flipped over the board game and said hes not allowed to win. I mean EVERY corporate dem dropped out except the one who was closest to Bernie (Liz Warren) so that the corporate dem (Biden) could win. The DNC did him dirty twice and then didnt let anyone run this time. Because they knew he was gonna do everything he could to fundamentally change things. Because they know what we the people want economically, and they wont allow it.The Clinton/Pelosi/Harris (and now regretfully Fucking Cheney) segment of the party absolutely will not allow the corporations to lose at all ever. At all costs. Thats their REAL priority. Get rid of them, and we can win. They want us to keep moving right and comprimising and meet the corporate republicans in the middle. Right where DICK FUCKING CHENEY is. Hows that working?People say But we need their money. We need corporate sponsors to buy ads?I dont think so. We need a winning platform and ideas people can get behind. We need votes. Harris had all the money, what she didnt have was a message that appealed to the working class.The Republicans have their outsider who claims to want to drain the swamp and change the lobbying, corporate and slimy culture in washington. He build a wall to stop immigrants from destroying the economy. Sure, we can tell hes full of shit easily (its billionaires who are the real enemy) but the idiots of the country cant.?My hypothesis is many of them would go for an outsider democrat too. And the drain the swamp bit is something many on the right and left agree on. Lets actually do it. Thats how you win back working class votes. But unless we can ditch the corporate wing, we will not be allowed to do this.This is also why the democrats get so easily pinned with letting biological men in womens sports and child gender reassignment and slavery reparations and this radical gender woke stuff. Its the only type of moderately extreme liberal the corporate donors will allow to speak. The economic near and medium left is muzzled and muted but the whole spectrum (near, middle, extreme) of the social left gets megaphones because its not as bad for the corporations bottom line. We dont have an economic platform other than corporatism so it looks like all are liberal policy is social issues.Summary of my rant is drop the corporate stooges and drain the swamp and we win.","title":"Jon Stewart on Biden pardon: Dems should f--- the norms but own it"},{"text":"I agree, its been delicious!","title":"Jon Stewart Hilariously Decimates the Democrats ??"},{"text":"This is going to get downvotes for you for sure...

Like, cool, she did have some policy. But most of it seems to be in response to Trump talking points? Like prices and the economy. And that just kinda reinforces my point. Again, I dont give a mother fuck about Trump. Not even in her 30 seconds of telling us what shed do in between the these are the reasons Trump bad statements could she come up with something independent of talking points that Trump controlled. Her giving us more tangible solutions to Trump talking points such as immigration and cost of living is just how she, *again*, insists on chasing moderate republicans. She was just being Donald Trump with extra steps. Again: Universal healthcare. Arms embargo on Israel. Radical action on climate change. Free college. These are things that progressives care about. If you cant tell me policies of your own accord without spending time kowtowing to Trumps garbage, then Im not interested. Shifting the Democratic Party even further right by appealing to people concerned about fake conservative problems is not a convincing strategy. And you say that she was let down by her ties to the current administration as if that wasnt her fucking fault. *DOZENS* of times, she was asked how she would do things differently than Biden. Every single motherfucking time she said that she wouldnt have done a thing different. She seriously fucking thought that the only reason we were fed up with Biden was his physical age. The frustration will continue until democrats look inward and blame themselves for their incompetence. Or until they are replaced by a progressive party. No longer are voters satisfied with voting between mean conservatives and kind conservatives. Its a fucking joke. Kamala Harris was just the temporary face of it the democrats issues. I personally do not care if the democrats end up turning into a progressive party, or if they keep clawing into the long-dead horse of neoliberalism as they predictably lose more elections, after which they pretend to be so confused about all of the factors of their loss. America will shift left and finally catch up with the rest of the developed world.

But doing it like this makes it look like the FBI agents who raided Mar a Lago and the people who cooperated with the J6 Committee (or who were on it) are all being hung out to dry, and that the country may descend into madness, but at least Hunter will be OK, even though he in fact did break the laws he's been convicted of breaking.

Effectively adding a 4th branch to our government that enshrines a direct majoritarian influence on our current government is something I think would have negative effects in the long run. We would at least need to know A LOT more about how it would be checked and balanced by the other 3 branches beyond the revisiting issues is blocked for 10 years rule. We also need to know a lot about how the top 5 issues get chosen. There is not an obvious way in my mind how these issues would be chosen that would not be susceptible to the partisan/moneyed interests that affect our current voting systems, let alone in a way that is fair to the many minority groups that make up the American electorate (age, ability, religion, gender, sexual identity, race, socioeconomic status, etc.)I try to think of how it may have worked in the past. I think something like this would have prevented things like the Civil Rights Act or greatly reduced its impact, or opened up the opportunity to claw back its advances immediately. The CRA was never popular legislation and Democrats have not won support from a majority of white people in a national election since it went into effect ~60 years ago. Other legislation concerning social progress is similar, often requiring political courage to push against popular opinion. Part of a national political party / national candidates job is to spend their political capital to get their agenda done. This system would make it harder to create change and less likely to make that change lasting. I think this system introduces a way to privilege majority rule, first in the selection of the 5 issues and then again in the passing of the new referenda. There would be no similar mechanism to make sure minorities have their voices heard, too (ex. a person with disabilities may consistently have a very different looking top 5 issues from a person who has no chronic disability. How would that ever be heard? Or is the point to privilege the majority in this way?). There would also need to be a mechanism to guard against minorities being targeted. Without that, this system would be very susceptible to something like a charismatic authoritarian pushing a policy that targets particular groups. This is something our country has seen many times. Funny enough, I think that your idea is a cool one without any actual legislative power behind it. I think it would be very interesting to see if there was just a running very public record of the top issues the population have voted on, American Idol style. It would make it way easier to sway candidates and just say see, stop talking about issue X, people actually care about issue Y.

How comfortable both Cheney *and* Harris were talking at the DNC really nails this home. The modern dems are pro corporate and pro stock market, over unions and people. They thought focusing on the middle class would win an election, when most of the country were eating hand to mouth, despite all those great signs on how well the economy is doing. Abortion is a big issue too, but anything that competes against affording food and rent is gonna lose and lose badly.Employment increasing just means more wage theft is happening, more price gouging on rental costs, food costs, medical costs. The poor don't see any benefit when share price goes up, those cash windfalls happen on the executive and shareholder levels. Out of touch morons can't even agree that Bernie might have a point about minimum wage needing to be raised...This has all meant that MAGA's attacks on \\"establishment\\" politicians work, really fucking well. It created the vacuum for populists like Trump, because once that \\"both sides suck corporate dick\\"/\\"it's rigged\\" mentality set in, people start wanting to see the whole thing get torn down and rebuilt, because living hand to mouth/1 week from eviction constantly, while at the mercy of random (but inevitable) medical issues that will likely result in bankruptcy - *desperate for change and fast*.So when Trump comes along with his carefully crafted \\"outsider\\" populist persona and his big promises for radical change, we get the election we just had.Democrats have to win, they take Stewarts advice, along with AOC and Bernie's as well. They drop the \\"polished politician\\" shtick, play dirty for the people, become more \\"real\\" and return to their trade union/for the people roots.
