At a bare minimum you can simplify a lot of things with the electoral college, like swap electors with votes, no humans involved, you can multiply all the state electoral votes by something like 100 to increase precision without affecting the relative weight of the states vs each other, you can give a vote to the territories, you can proportionally divide the votes up among candidates like if one candidate gets 40% of the vote in a state with 1000 votes, they get 400 electoral votes, you can make it so that say 2/3 of Congress in both houses have to vote to preclude votes from the count on motion of 1/3 of both houses without debate, and then the number of electoral votes needed to win goes down proportionally (IE if there are 53,800 electoral votes, then 26901 is sufficient to win, but if 1000 electors are removed, then you need 26,401 to win.You could set a harmonized date, you can define that all people who are say 16 or older who are citizens must be able to vote rather than complicated rules for who has the right to vote and leaving out constitutional protection for all others, you can say that the electoral votes are divided by a vote in that state at large rather than have the state legislature do anything funny with the process, you can make it so that if nobody happens to have a majority, then the two with the most electors nation wide go to a runoff three weeks later. You can define the size of the House of Representatives relative to population to avoid the issues with that apportionment such as the cube root rule every 10 years. And that is the complicated version. You could also just directly state that the electoral college is ended by amendment much like the election of governors became direct in the remaining states over time, same with senators.","title":"CMV: The US presidential election system is a joke"},{"text":"LEARN","title":"Pro-Harris Journos Resign En Masse After Major Papers Refuse To Endorse Kamala Harris | The Daily Caller"},{"text":"I know a lot of dudes that would happily give their life for him.","title":"Have the elites turned on Kamala?"},{"text":"Trad wives also think men should vote on their behalves.

At the same time similarities between Armenia's rhetoric and Russia's are dismissed by saying Armenian claims are factually true and the real problem with what Putin's says are that these are lies.

In the 60s and 70s their policies included and helped the middle class. Since then, republicans have focused on a smaller and smaller slice of the richest Americans neglecting the poor and the middle class. As I grew up the Republican Party has moved farther and farther to the extreme right and become the party of liars and hate. They use words like socialist, communist and illegals to paint broad swaths of the population knowing that their trained base will translate that to evil, lazy and alien without thinking for themselves. They invent social conflicts like the war on Christmas, woke and LGBTQ issues to keep their base angry.The party has degraded to accepting farcical stories like theyre eating cats and dogs and Biden gave away all FEMA money to illegals and accepting a fascist, terrorist as their leader. Many even support America becoming a fascist dictatorship. They now trigger hate instead of just anger, evidenced by the attacks on anyone who doesnt fully support their agenda. The democrats have become the only party that supports the value of everyone, not just the rich. They value education, rationality, giving. Theyre closer to the morality I grew up with and the core teachings of Christianity. The bottom line, for me, is that the Republican Party is no longer a viable choice, politically.","title":"Tell me why youre a democrat"},{"text":"This is true but if they ever succeed in getting rid of trans people theyll be back to trying to persecute gay people in a heartbeat.","title":"Ted Cruz falsely calls 2 cis teen girls boys in desperate search for trans athletes to demonize.

Hitler coined Lgenpresse (lying press) to discredit the media, Trump has fake news for any news that doesnt favour him and also referred to it as the enemy of the people.4. Both capitalised on fear to consolidate power; Hitler had the Reichstag fire, Trump has bullshit election fraud claims.5. Hitler aligned his views with Christian imagery to dupe stupid fucks, Trump does the same.6. Hitler centralised power and replaced government workers with those that are loyal to him rather than the country, so the when democratic elections were held, it was entirely rigged; Trump is to do the same according to Project 2025. Along with this, Trump has said I want generals like the ones Hitler had (loyal to him and not the state) and well as if you vote for me youll never have to vote again.7. They both led an insurrection attempt before making a return to politics. At least Hitler was imprisoned for the events of Beer Hall Putsch; Trump hasnt received any punishment for 6th January.On top of this, Trump was found to be libel of sexual abuse by a jury of his peers, failed to appeal twice and the judge residing over the case specified twice that he is, by both common and state law definitions, a rapist. Further to this, he regularly hung out with Epstein and also hung out with P Diddy.Hes also been convicted 34 times of federal crime; keeping in mind in many cases, felons cant vote until their sentence is complete, but apparently they can run for office that people are voting for.Hes also been colluding with Putin for years, even giving Russia valuable equipment like respirators during the covid pandemic when parts of America had a shortage.

Thats probably true for about 45% of Mizrahi Jews but Israel wasnt created for Mizrahi Jews, who needed to escape the Arab countries they lived in.  It was created as a project by western states and European settlers and then welcomed all Jews. The assertion that Israel is operating as a colonizer has a lot more to do with the fact that its a nation based primarily on right of conquestwhatever the justifying narrative. \\n England used its right of conquest to create Israel by allowing over 500k mostly European Jews to immigrate in the first half of the 19th century. It was only in the years before the war that immigration was capped at 75k a year and thats still high considering that there were only around 600k total Jews in the area at the time of partition.  \\nAnd then Israel expanded its borders via success in war. We can argue whether or not land won in a defensive war counts as conquest or whether theres such a thing as a defensive war when people are allying to win back land lost in mass migration that was only possible because of colonization. But either way, Israel was not created as a way to ensure the safety of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews but to ensure the self determination of a large relatively recent immigrant community who would not have been there but for Englands might and has since grown and  maintained itself by its own might.And colonialism is not attached to whiteness, its just behavioral. Japan was a colonial power and Koreans and Chinese people still feel strongly about their colonial past.I also think the western interest has more to do with:\\n- awful social media videos of people with western accents dispossessing people of their homes\\n- the wildly repressive response of US states to the BDS movement highlighting that not only do we support Israel but were willing to curtail Americans constitutional rights to signal how strongly we support it\\n- and most importantly, Israel blew a ton of good will with western media when it blew up the Gaza AP building on short notice in the 2021 war. Im convinced that decision is why this war has been covered in much greater detail and with less deference for Israel.

One thing he's definitely not is mentally impacted. He was really sharp, witty, and even though he talks in a rambling style, he does eventually weave everything back together. That's now something someone who has any mind if cognitive decline can do, certain not in a3 hour long form uncut conversation. Of course, now the anti-Rogan Mafia will join in, attacking him.

The government may NOT regulate private speech disconnected from official campaigns/candidates for office.- People do not lose their free speech rights when they band together into organizations. This is very important because there are ton of groups you can join to make sure your preferred political speech is heard - from the NRA to Planned Parenthood. From the Sierra Club to Unions.

The zionist/anti-zionist debate was exposed to a lot more people, there were mass protests and high-profile speeches, and the issue overall cemented into a lot of people's minds as a political leaning of note. It's also extremely important to point out that progressive *Jewish* voices were some of the loudest on the anti-Zionist side - it's not at all accurate or fair to characterize antizionism as something innately antisemitic.Antisemitism was much more pronounced in the right wing, in voters who resented Jewish people for not practicing Christianity, for being long-standing bulwarks of christian nationalism, and because Jewish people had a long history of seeking higher education and more advanced jobs in society, and thus broadly leaned liberal/left. Nationalist/populist conservatives mostly resented/resent Jewish people, as during the Holocaust, when many non-Jewish Germans turned against Jewish people due to the perception they were unfairly or illegitimately successful in business, the arts, and the sciences. It is therefore very strange to suggest that progressive college kids inherited antisemitism from their parents, as either their parents were conservatives, and their kids are already going against their other stances, or their parents were liberals/progressives, who were generally trying to stop rampant antisemitism. It's also just patently not true if you speak to an overwhelming proportion of progressive antizionists.The reason the actions of Israel are so scrutinized are more accurately as such - one, Israel was a western european project, was supported and brought into existence directly by these western powers, and is still supported by these western powers as a close ally. They are one of the greatest recipients of American foreign aid, and have been for a considerably long time. They are a nation the US directly calls an ally, and therefore, any perceived wrongdoing on the behalf of Israel reflects on the US unlike other nations that receive foreign aid, but are not in favorable standing. There's definitely a difference between assistance through humanitarian aid, world food program, etc. which is primarily what we extend to nations like Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Haiti, and foreign military financing, which represents a *large* percentage of what we provide to Israel. Further, the disregard the Western powers had for the people already living in the region, as well as the fact that Israel was placed in a part of the world generally unfavorable towards the western powers, all in addition to the fact that no European country volunteered their own land to form a safe homeland for Jewish people, all contribute to the view that Israel is indeed a colonialist project. At best, a militarized, expansionist western power that was just plonked down in the middle of already settled land, and at worst, a cynical project to create a west-aligned stronghold in the middle east. Now, you may suggest that this was good or justified, but I also think it should be clear why others don't feel that way for reasons that don't have anything to do with misappropriated anti-whiteness.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"He needs a job and needs to preserve his income so he can progressively date younger and younger women.

Trump was the first person to allow black and Jewish people into a nightclub in Palm Beach. He also sued the city. He was also one of the only people to endorse a black man running for president in the 80s, twice, when most people thought it was crazy. He also gave them free office space in NYC in his building. He also released a black father who was arrested and sentenced double life in prison, by Obama. He was declined to be released. When he was arrested, his son was only 2. After all those years, his son made a video asking for his father to be released, Trump released him shortly after and the father thanked President Trump many times in videos he made. Ive also heard that Trump was the first person to hire a woman to work on a building. Trump got unemployment rates, and black unemployment rates to be exact, to the lowest it has ever been in American history. When Obama was first elected, the rates were at 8%, he doubled it to 16%. When Trump became president, he lowered them to 4%. The economy was great under Trump. Interest rates were only 2%. Now they are at 10%.

If you're going to reference Keynesian economic theory, what is the second half of \\"lower taxes to increase the flow of money during bad times?\\".  Yes, that is right, it's \\"increase taxes during good economic times\\".So, if we analyze what happened from an economic stand point, we need to look what was going on before.  Oh, the economy was doing well and they lowered taxes.  Interesting... so that would add more money to the system, but inflation didn't go up?  Oh, but the stock market did go up... is that where the money was going?  Probably, so the stock market absorbed the inflation.Now, let's look at the pandemic.  The price of goods jump, and production is constrained... so that's some inflation.  Economists start to call this transitory.  Now, finally the pandemic is over, people want services, but there's only so much available.  So now that's more inflation.  These should moderate back down, but companies have no reason to lower prices, see there's less competition in the economy because we've allowed unchecked consolidation for years.What funded this?  The inflation of equities for years that was celebrated and the ability of companies to perfectly prices their goods, having used inflation as a reason to raise them in the first place.So no... it's not all on Biden, actually a lot was in place well before Biden.

It ultimately depends on what you think is worse. Voting Kamala will likely keep the status quo, which is lukewarm support for Israel, IDF operations, and saber-rattling when BiBi does something truly heinous. Youll hear a lot of words around a two party state that likely wont go anywhere. Protesting a Harris administration might get you a seat at the table.Voting for Trump would see America support Israel and the IDF even more, with more weapons, equipment and turning a blind eye to anyone who is caught up in the war. Dont forget that Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; that BiBi has campaigned for Trump, even in front of Congress. There would be no two state solution. America would support Israel annexing Gaza and other areas - which would protect them and enable them to do it. Protesting a Trump administration would get you arrested, murdered, or deported.So yes.

I recognize there is a difference between what a religion preaches in it's foundational texts and what it's followers actually believe.Some will adhere more closely than others. And this is true about any ideology including secular ideologies. I just think it's useless to talk about every esoteric point of view in every unique tradition.There are common themes we can identify. While there may be certain points of disagreement there are other views that are amost universally held amongst all traditions or at least those within the mainstream.This could be something like \\"Homosexuality is a sin\\" or \\"Jesus is the son of god and redeems man from his sinful nature\\".So yes, traditions vary. There are different theological points of view. But there is also a lot of commonality.  It requires a hell of a lot of mental gymnastics to argue otherwise when we have data showing the majority views on many of these issues. Either way, we can usually ascertain what the religion stands for. So whether followers agree with it or not they identify as a member of the group. It's on them to know what their religion preaches. If someone goes around declaring themselves a Communist but believes in property ownership that's fine but they are propping up an ideology that is fundamentally opposed to their belief. They have a duty to investigate what their ideology thaf they willingly associate with represents.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":" They are not which is normal and consistent with most elections#\\n In Nevada, for example, 24,000 more registered Republicans have voted than Democrats as of Friday in a state where Democratic strength in the powerful culinary unions has been thought to give them an edge C and where recent elections have seen Democrats lead early voting. In Arizona, Republicans are outperforming Democrats 42%-36% among the early vote  another reversal of expectations and trends. In North Carolina the GOP has a razor-thin lead, where the conventional wisdom would have had Democrats meaningfully ahead.The question is not whether in some key states registered Republicans are currently outvoting registered Democrats - they are.

They were definitely hit hard but those 1200 killed and 200 prisoners, Israel killed nearly 5x that many in the first couple days. That's not including allowing colonizers in the West Banks to go around killing West Bank Palestinians which likely reached that number in a week while they had nothing to do with the Hamas attack from Gaza.

That's... Just something they have to deal with. So was the United States. I don't think \\"Well, they're slightly related to a group that controlled this region for hundreds of years\\" makes it not colonialism: The region displaced the locals who are a bit more closely related to ancient peoples of the region (People act like the entire population of Judea was displaced by Babylon and Rome, but even during periods of Diaspora, really only Jerusalem itself saw mass exiles, while outside the lower class that made up the bulk of the population wasn't en masse removed from the land). But I also don't think blood quantum is a reasonable way to determine who should live where. But literally millions of immigrants came from outside of the land at the behest of a government which only really represented those immigrants, and have displaced pretty much all local groups in terms of both land and political power: That's pretty clear cut colonialism.It maybe wasn't a great idea to have millions of Jewish people immigrate to a place they had no connections with, have the government serve their interests at the expense of the locals, and try to establish a state right up against a group with geopolitical motivation to end that state. But we aren't considering making Israel. There is an Israel, and there are millions of Israelis, who've lived there for generations. I'm yapping too much, but my point is: Israel was absolutely founded as a colonial state. It's not really reasonable to compare it to standard historical conquests and find it equivalent.

However, If vote counts as a number matter, all those hearings would need to be heard because they impact the overall count. And you know that we would see challenges targetting every major city in the US with Republicans trying to throw out as many votes as possible.

This is the motivation behind, for example, the Balfour declaration in 1917.?The combination of this means a lot of the racist alt-right in the US and elsewhere (Victor Orban in Hungary is a good example) is very supportive of Israel as a model far-right ethnonationalist state.?In addition because Americans view Israeli jews as civilized white judeo-christians and Palestinians as evil brown muslims they support unconditional military aid and support to Israel, and care about Israels conflicts, while having much less care for the Palestinian victims of Israels actions.?That is why Joe Biden is so keen to talking about international law when defending the white European Ukrainians, but willing to ignore it when discussing the brown arab Palestinians.?That is why you are so keen to denounce all the college campus protestors as antisemitic and motivated by anti-whiteness, because you dont want to acknowledge that your own views might be motivated by racism.?It is very similar to how the American right initially argued the reaction to George Floyds murder was just anti-whiteness.??I genuinely believe a lot of the rhetoric around Israel being \\"colonizers\\" and all of this language about \\"oppression\\" and whatnot is purely driven by what really is a misplaced anti-whiteness.1. Colonialism: The entire movement of Zionism was started in Europe in the 19th century and directly inspired by contemporary European ideologies of imperialism and colonialism.?Hertzl envisioned a jewish state in Palestine as an outpost of European civilisation amongst Asian barbarism, in exactly the same way that Europeans viewed other European colonies elsewhere, and the Zionist strategy of taking over land legally at first, later by force, expelling the existing population, then replacing them with immigrants of the desired superior race is also exactly the same as in other European colonies in the Americas, Africa and Asia.?2. Oppression. The situation for, say, Palestinians under Israeli rule in the West Bank is almost universally regarded as equivalent to apartheid, by both South African supporters and opponents of Apartheid, by both international and Israeli human rights groups, and by former Israeli political leaders.?If you think that black South Africans were oppressed under Apartheid, you should - at the very least - think the same regarding Palestinians under Israeli oppression in the West Bank.?","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"Fox news has really done a number on this country and it's criminal they continue to do so. the amount of people completely oblivious to the bullshit done by the GOP blows my fucking mind.","title":"Ted Cruz falsely calls 2 cis teen girls boys in desperate search for trans athletes to demonize.

A cycle with no discernible reset point can be broken at any point. \\n  \\nAlso, Hamas does not need international criticism to think their actions are justified. Israels actions themselves are what they think is their justification. Do you think Hamas goal is to provoke Israel into killing every single person in Palestine? Has Hamas achieved great strategic benefits in the past year? Things seem to you to be going well for them? \\n  \\nHamas primary incentive to initiate attacks is that they have been attacked. Just because what youre talking about is part of their strategy doesnt make it their entire or primary motivation. For a long time there was very little public criticism of Israel and this was still going on. If inciting criticism of Israel specifically is not their primary reason, theres no reason to sacrifice basic human morality and refrain from criticizing them, because there will still be other factors. If everything about Hamas motivation relies on Israel perpetrating extreme and excessive violence to them and the citizens of Palestine, the obvious solution is for Israel to not do that. Not to mention the complicating factor of what allowing a country to do war crimes uncriticized implies for the rest of the world.

US military aid to Israel is largely from stockpiles we've already built up and paid for years ago. Same with Ukraine. The military industrial complex is raking in money hand over fist, but they're doing so by replenishing the now-depleted stockpiles, not largely making new bombs to send over to Israel. This means that the billions to the MIC will be paid anyway, because the military isn't going to just not replenish its stockpiles. Speaking of Ukraine, that's the other glaring flaw in your take. If the Ukraine war ends immediately - as it would when Trump capitulates - then the MIC no longer needs to make munitions to send to Ukraine. And Ukraine is a much bigger war than Gaza. So if this was really about dollars, then the MIC would be pushing more aid to Ukraine, and throwing their weight behind Harris instead of Trump because the war Harris wants to keep going earns them more money.","title":"\\"Let her talk\\": Biden defends pro-Palestine protester, adds killing \\"has to stop\\""},{"text":"Not a troll, okay.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris will win the election."},{"text":"My point is that Americans, as a group, couldn't care less about gun violence.

I would also point out that your discourse here highlights a lot of the bad habits that are making leftist spaces inhospitable for anyone who isnt already fully on board:\\\\-default use of hyperbole and superlatives  \\nNot everything has to be about making men comfortable is a logically incongruous response to I am a man and when X happens, I feel uncomfortable. Like, no one has said everything should be about making men comfortable, but here you are responding as if someone did, with a snarky, superior, dismissive tone. I would argue that this has less to do with the content of the speech youre responding to and more to do with learned discursive/rhetorical habits. You are just enacting the speech performance that the circles you move in have taught you to use when someone makes certain types of statements. Stop framing everything that represents any kind of challenge to any aspect of your position in outrageous, disingenuous, exaggerated terms. Its childish. \\\\-whataboutism  \\nThe issue in question is how men are treated, what will or wont drive men away from or toward leftist spaces, and how this relates to normative discourse in those spaces. Nobody said the biggest problem is the lack of accommodation for men; a man said this was a problem for me, and I think its a problem for lots of men like me. Why wouldnt men be interested in considering how spaces can be more accommodating for men? To deny this impulse is fundamentally unnatural. This is (in part) why conservatives often accuse the left of being completely insane and disconnected from reality, because people respond to reasonable questions and lines of discussion the way you have here. You managed to turn this into an occasion to discuss the hostility women experience online, even though thats literally not the topic of discussion at all. \\\\-inescapably, fundamentally comparative frame with an implied winner takes all mindset  \\nWhich is really the biggest problem: its clear from the content and tenor of your response that whether you actively realize it or not, your relationship to questions of societal power is based on the misguided assumption that recognition and acknowledgement are a zero sum game. You directly state that there isnt room to discuss both how to lift up the traditionally underprivileged classes, and attend with empathy and due concern to the complaints of members of the traditionally privileged classes. Why? I am perfectly capable of thinking about how society affects both men and women, why arent you? Believe it or not, setting aside a few moments to discuss how, say, white men could be made to feel they had more of a home in leftist communities isnt going to prevent anyone from continuing to think, first and foremost, about the needs of, say, Black women in those spaces.

Like many auto workers, I am deeply concerned about the future of our industry. With many jobs being outsourced as we speak, what action will you take to ensure that our jobs stay in America so we can continue to build the best cars in the world here in Michigan?DONALD TRUMP: So, pretty much as weve been saying, and what I want to do is I want to be able to  Look, your business  Years ago in this area, I was honored as the man of the year. It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didnt know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said  They said, oh  And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.It did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? Theyre taking your business away. And I didnt know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.And lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We cant let them take your car business away. Its such an important business.And you know its an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I dont know, its like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.You cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We dont have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They dont take our farm products for the most part. They dont take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesnt do anything, I keep saying, why dont you do?I saw Marsha the other day. And why didnt she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, shes on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.But I just say, lets go back. So we cant let them take our businesses. And were not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.So were not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of thats determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.And it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So well do the same thing.And you dont worry about it. Heres what you have to do. I only ask you to do one thing, and then you can sleep beautifully all night long, go to a job you love, and get a lot of money at the end of the week.

The president presides over congress, which is made up of representatives from each state. This means that the president must represent the interests of EVERY state, or at least the majority of states, not the majority of people. There is also the practicality issue of conserving the union between the 50 states. The original reasoning for the electoral college was an incentive for smaller states to join the union. None of them would have joined if they didnt get equal representation in the federal government, hence the electoral college. If the electoral college was abolished and replaced with a popular vote, there would be serious threat of smaller unrepresented states leaving the union, which is no bueno. The electoral college is actually a brilliantly devised scheme that is objectively more fair than a popular vote for the purposes of a federal presidential election. Look at the past results of elections. There is basically a 50/50 split between Democratic and republican presidents, or their respective historical parties. If that doesnt prove its fair, I dont know what would.Also, people only cry foul about the electoral college when they lose.

Excerpt: ....Democrats often overlook another dynamic at play here, and thats the role of place: Even if your own finances are secure, if you look out your window and see your city or town struggling, you believe you are, too. Some academics have referred to this as a sense of shared fate, and it could be a powerful force in this election, especially in small cities in the industrial Midwest  such as Reading and Erie in Pennsylvania, Saginaw and Battle Creek in Michigan, Oshkosh and Racine in Wisconsin  where Mr. Brown and other Democrats are fighting to hang on to their seats and where Kamala Harris needs to do well (or at least hold her own). In 2007, the academic Lorlene Hoyt and the city planning consultant Andr Leroux assembled a nationwide list of forgotten cities that were old and small, with a population of 15,000to 150,000 and a median household income of less than $35,000. Recently, the urban researcher Michael Bloomberg updated it. Of the 179 cities now on the list, 37 are in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And leading the way, with 23 cities, is Ohio. Pundits often overlook these sorts of places (they tend to focus on big blue cities, deep-red rural areas and the suburbs in between), but given how clustered these smaller cities are in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they will matter greatly in the battle for both the White House and for control of Congress. Lately, two of Ohios have gained special prominence: Middletown (population 50,000) as the hometown of JD Vance, and Springfield (roughly 60,000) as home to a large community of Haitian immigrants that both Mr. Vance and Donald Trump have made a target of their rhetoric. [...] Without a doubt, Mr. Browns and Ms. Kapturs understanding of such places has helped them survive as long as they have as the state turned redder. Its not as if their opponents have been offering these small cities many concrete solutions of their own. Far from it: Mr. Morenos ads center on his backing by Mr. Trump, and virtually all of the tens of millions of dollars in attack ads being run against Mr. Brown by outside groups focus on transgender youth.","title":"Democrats Finally Did What Sherrod Brown Asked For.

This so-called treatment does not address whatever their mental health issues are.

I never understood wind. And I know windmills, very much, I've studied it better than anybody. I know, it's very expensive. They're made in CHINA and Germany mostly. Very few made here, almost none. But they're manufactured TREMENDOUS if you're into this TREMENDOUS fumes, gases, are spewing into the atmosphere, you know, we have a world, right?So, the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You-toppa- you-talk about the carbon footprint. Fumes are spewing into the air right? sp-sp-spewing, whether it's in CHINA, Germany, it's going into the air, it's our air their air everything, right? So they make these things and then they put them up and if you own a house with a vision of some of these monsters, Uh your house is worth 50% of the price, they're noisy, they kill the birds.You want to see a birve grade yard? You just go, take a look, a bird graveyard. Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen, ever in your life. You know, in California, they were killing the bald eagle. If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years.A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true! And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That's true, by the way, this is, they make you turn it off after you and yet, if you killed one, They put you in jail, that's okay. But why is it okay for these windmills to destroy the bird population And that's what they're doing. I'll tell you another thing about windmills. And I'm not, look, I like all forms of energy and I think really, they're okay in industrial areas like you have an industrial plant, you put up a windmill, you know, Etc. etc I've seen the most beautiful fields, farms, fields, most gorgeous things you've ever seen and then you have these ugly things going up, and sometimes they're made by different companies, you know, I'm like a perfectionist.I really built good stuff and so you'll see like a few windmills made by one company General Electric. And then you'll see a few made by Siemens and you'll see a few made by some other guy that doesn't have 10 cents. It looks like. So it looks like. So you see all these windmills?They're all different shades of color? They're like sort of white but one's like An orange white. It's my favorite color, orange.And you see these magnificent fields and they're ruined. And you know what, they don't tell you about windmills after 10 years. They look like how, you know, they start to get tired, old. You got to replace them. A lot of times people don't replace them. They need massive subsidy from the government in order to make it. No, we're doing it right, we're doing it right. And you know, our numbers environmentally right now are better than they've ever been before. Just so you know, because I'm an environmentalist, I am.

I want the cleanest air anywhere.\\"","title":"Video of Joe Rogan defending Kamala Harris in Trump chat takes off online"},{"text":"-Sent from my giant mega yacht","title":"Leonardo DiCaprio Endorses Kamala Harris, Knocks Trump on Climate Change: We Cannot Afford to Go Backwards"},{"text":"Could be a Moldova situation where the late count of diaspora votes end up saving the day.

You cant go around telling people to stfu on the sole basis of their demographic markers; that is systemic discrimination and its not okay.By all means, marginalized groups need and deserve spaces that are just for them for a host of reasons not worth listing here. But if youre in mixed company, you kinda gotta accept that. Why have a group where white people are allowed, for example, if all youre going to do is tell them to shut up and stay out of it whenever discussion becomes controversial or someone feels upset/uncomfortable because they were disagreed with?And the performative line-towing is basically cultist behavior. Honestly, a lot of these people are just fucking weird and are really, really happy to finally have a forum through which they can exert social power and control over others. They then use identity politics to legitimize that project. We have to fix this.I know a woman of mixed European and Latina heritage who organized a mildly popular (couple thousand members) social media group. The point of the group was to create an accepting, fun space for fat women to talk about clothes and fashion. Along the way, the group instituted some practices for the benefit of BIPOC women in the group; there was a day of the week, Tuesday or whatever, when the white women were asked to not post. I think thats fine, or at least reasonable.But then ONE very vocal Black woman in the group started complaining that on Tuesdays, certain Native American women should not be allowed to post, as they were, in her view, actually white. This is bullshit of course; you dont get to decide what someones heritage is just because when you take a glance at their phenotype it doesnt immediately match your preconceived notion about what a Black or Chinese or Native or whatever person is supposed to look like. But this ONE individual basically went on to destroy the entire group. They wouldnt engage in good faith discussion, they constantly clapped back in an aggressive, take a seat hunty kind of way, and whenever it seemed someone might actually have a substantive and irrefutable point against their shitty exclusionary position, theyd use their Blackness as a shield and basically say if you disagree with me, youre racist.Not only was this person not kicked out of the group for such antics - MANY WHITE WOMEN WOULD SHOW UP TO DEFEND HER. Presumably because theyve been conditioned to blindly side with any BIPOC individual in a leftist space who is accusing others of racism or otherwise problematic behavior. This person, in my view, was clearly a narcissist whose statements about racial dynamics in the group largely made no sense and were just intended to center HER more specifically. Yet not only was she not corrected, her voice was amplified and well-meaning lefties came to her aid/support. Eventually the group completely dissolved because of course it did.Weve got to fix this bullshit. Its absurd. Sorry for the tangent, but I think all of this is ultimately relevant to the discussion of how the left fails to capture the interest and loyalty of so many young men. These are the toxic dynamics we need to remove from the normative culture. Replace white with male and black with female and I imagine a lot of my story tracks for disillusioned/frustrated young men today.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"If billionaires are scared of Kamala Harris than I think we want Kamala Harris","title":"Jeff Bezos Overrode His Own Publisher to Kill Washington Posts Kamala Harris Endorsement"},{"text":"Suspiciously far from the exit polls","title":"Georgian (?) election megathread"},{"text":"As Superman has said: if Lex wanted to cure cancer or [save humanity](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Frl5itoxvtsga1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1041%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dcf58d3324bd716aec76bcd304cea841e55c6927a), he could.

Just like your point about a genocide against queer and trans people I'll accept your characterization of the UK Labor Party/Cass Review issue.  I don't want to dismiss your concern about something you feel strongly about and know more than me about.  So I can understand being concerned and outraged.  My apologies for assuming that you were saying that both parties are the same but that is definitely the impression I took from what you wrote.  That said, I accept that you're not making that claim.  The other thing we agree on is that I am also disappointed in Merrick Garland.  Although I wouldn't go so far as to call him a fascist. The Liz Cheney thing I really view as a marriage of convenience.  Harris needs to court the Haley vote and Cheney isn't trying to extract any policy concessions.  I think it would be incredibly foolish to turn down the support. Still I agree that there's an optics issue with it especially combined with the thing you brought up about the UK Labor Party.  I also acknowledge that I'm approaching this situation from a position of privilege.  I am cisgendered heteronormative mononormative able bodied white man.  I'm going to be fine under a Trump regime.  This means it's easy for me to say \\"yeah, but...\\" So instead of saying\\"yeah, but...\\" I'll say \\"yes, and...\\"Yes some of the things you've mentioned are legitimate AND  I get to be mad about people who ARE willing to roll the dice on fascism.  Because even from my position of relative privilege I still suffer under fascism. So my concerns are also valid and those concerns are often dismissed by people who take your position but haven't voted and won't vote. You get to be outraged about things that impact you so that standard needs to be applied equally and I get to be outraged about things that impact me and that is where the outrage against progressives who choose not to vote or vote third party comes from.  And since we're talking about outrage and what were sick of im outraged by and sick of pretending like the thousands of Progressives (and non-Progs) who either voted for Stein or sat out the vote in 2016 didn't steal a precious margin that could have gotten Clinton elected.  I understand that progressives have built up a bulwark of post-hoc justifications for the action they took or did not take but it does not indemnify them of the charge of having pulled the lever and let five people die in the trolley scenario. America would be a better place if Progressives had not done that and there are people who have died from COVID and women who are currently deprived of certain rights as a result of the actions that Progressives took regardless of whether you feel content in your own justifications and people like me who are outraged by that and resent you for it have our justifications too.

It is one of the amazing aspects of whiteness is that who is in or out depends on when and where you were at in America. However, unless you are older than eighty, youll find that Israel has been at least monthly if not daily and weekly news your entire life. It is in the news because it is the nexus of treaties and agreements. It is the San Andreas fault line of international agreements. The occupied territories are not occupied Palestinian territories. The West Bank is part of the Kingdom of Jordan. The Gaza Strip is part of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Youll note that Jordanian troops are not fighting to get the land back, though Israel doesnt claim it as part of Israel. There are no Egyptian troops trying to storm Gaza. Indeed, they have walled it off to keep residents from getting out and back into Egypt. Israel is the edge of the world. It is where all the failures since the Second World War come together in one place. Israel is tiny. The Gaza Strip varies between two and six miles wide. It is a literal strip of land. It is also in the news because Israel did three highly intelligent decisions. It has been a close ally of the United States, it closely assists its Arab neighbors, and it is the Silicon Valley for the rest of the planet. If you are reading this, its only because of Israeli technologies. Grab old copies of the New York Times or Time Magazine and youll find stories about Israel long before Jews were considered white by anyone.

A trend worth pointing out is that those registered as \\"independent\\" have been [the dominant political force in the US](https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx) for quite some time. So just keep in mind when you see the divisions in the US, it's at maximum a story about the most ridiculous 30% of the US versus the most ridiculous other 30%, and the middle 40% is totally over all the chronic ineffectiveness and drama from both parties. It's also worth mentioning that the people driving particularly intense forms of discussion, online and in public, are generally the most vocal decile of each party, or 6% of the aggregate. So the general takeaway is that partisan takes are in the minority and most of the country (by far) just wants to exist w/o drama.Best regards from the US!","title":"Jaw-Dropping Rogan-Trump Interview Crushes Kamala Harris Campaign The full three-hour talk summarized in less than 10 minutes. ??

It is a very good book, with many insights.)I think that if Trumpists try to restart their rebellion, at the Capitol or elsewhere, all who are arrested should be made at the minimum to sign a version of the Pledge of Allegiance that further states that if they continue in rebellion against that United States, they will be considered in violation of parole and their acts plus this signed pledge shall be considered to be a confession of perjury, subject to the maximum penalties under the law.Signing the pledge should be a condition of release prior to trial.","title":"Jeff Bezos Overrode His Own Publisher to Kill Washington Posts Kamala Harris Endorsement"},{"text":"Yeah I was seduced and taken advantage of at 17 by a 25 year old man.

Like just this week there is video footage of patients still hooked up to IVs being burned alive, a child being shot (not killed) and used as bait to blow up first responders, (including the child and otjer teenagers) and a massacre of over 200 civilians. With videos uncovering digging up scores of mangled children out of rubble. There is just a generational/ media divide where people over the age of 50 are actively avoiding this stuff whereas people under the age of of 50 are in a traumatized addiction unable to stop looking at this stuff because every week seemingly is the most horrific genocide footage we have ever seen.Nobody who is watching this stuff is not radicalized and horrified and traumatized. People pondering why others are interested is just an admission that you are actively avoiding watching it, so its a deflection you shouldnt be wondering why people are interested in witnessing the most horrible and violent crimes of our lifetime, but rather just acknowledge and accept your role in compartmentalizing and avoiding it, which is fine for mental health, but going too far down that path leads to tacit support, and legitimization and thus the banality of evil.There could be an argument that boomers simply dont know that this daily footage exists, because of their insulated  and censored cable media echo chamber. But I find it hard to believe that 90% of these boomers dont have someone in their life who has told them that the genocide is being livestreamed.To compare it to other wars is not correct you have to look at relative statistics to understand the scale of the murder. 80% of all residential buildings, schools and healthcare facilities have been destroyed, 90%+ are displaced on a population about the size amd density of NYC. Food has not come into Gaza in 3 weeks now. Birtually everyone is sick and injured. Israel killed many times more women and children in tje first 40 days then Putin did in 500+, murddered more children in the first 4 months then killed globally the 4 previous years combined. Murders 7 women or children for whatever unknown fraction of the 3 remaining men went into Israel on Oct 7. They experimentally torture their prisoners including routinely amputating their hands and feet from handcuff injuries, have had mass riots to free guards who gang raped prisoners with dogs and electric cattle prods. The IDF has been caught running sadist snuff telegram channels (videos of sexualized soldoers showing muscles stomping on dead peoples heads, pulling them apart alive with vehicles etc) it just goes on and on, the raw carnal evil is completely over the top and unprecedented in our lifetimes and in this century since the Nazis.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"I hate the man with a passion, but his speaking style is that of someone constantly interrupting his own thoughts with asides, postulates, and parenthetical statements which are then further interrupted by asides, postulates; and parentheticals.","title":"Video of Joe Rogan defending Kamala Harris in Trump chat takes off online"},{"text":"I'm not a fan of Joe Rogan, but his point about the debates is absolutely true.

I think thats important, because if people didnt identify so strongly with party wed never have had a Trump candidacy.But when I was a child in school (I started kindergarten in 1968 or 1969) the civil rights era was still going on, people were moving upward financially, and many people who fought fascism in WW II were still very much alive.  By the time I was a junior in high school, though, the Reagan revolution was starting to take hold.  I was disappointed but not old enough to vote yet. But by 1982 as the AIDS crisis was just starting I came out.  While many men of my generation were buying the white resentment line and turning republican, I had a super strong motivation not to.  It wasnt just that I really bought into the civil rights movement (because MLK and Lincoln were lionized when I was a kid) but now I had been swept up into the fight myself.  I had gone from being a suburban white boy to an urban young gay man attending college - at the start of the AIDS crisis. As the rest of my life unfolded, it would still be decades before we saw any kind of embrace by either party.  Reagans silence for 7 years on AIDS was deafening -  and killing people.  Ironically, its when Anthony Fauci first became known, getting our community support.More and more as the GOP was contorted by what we then correctly called the radical right, they became increasingly hostile to the lgbt community, to atheists, and increasingly to science.  Part of me was naturally repelled, but part of it was the Republican party was moving away from me. All of my straight brothers and my father became independent or republican.  All the women remained democrats.  I was the sole cisgender male in my family who was a Democrat.  Part of it was I had some hope for civil rights coming from democrats. But another large part of it was the deep and abiding concern for civil rights from my early schooling.  As I got older and we studied WW II, the Great Depression, and the new deal, my admiration for the Democratic Party grew.It would be along time before I fully understood the transformation of the parties from 1932 to 1968.  When condoleeza rice said she was a republican because they signed her father up to vote and democrats wouldnt, I couldnt comprehend why.  But I think its only been very recently that people have truly appreciated the fact that between 1932 and 1968 that the parties basically inverted.  Rice should have known her history better, but when her father became a Republican, they were still the party that appeared to support black civil rights.Never mind she counted Strom Thurmond among her party mates - her party identification was so strong it overrode it.I, on the other hand, was born in 1964.  The Democratic Party was in its ascendancy as the champions not only of the middle class but increasingly of groups like women and African Americans.  Were it not for AIDS, I think LGBT rights would have come decades sooner.  But perhaps not - the AIDS crisis made coming out of the closet and into the streets a matter of literal life and death.  So despite being the scapegoats for a pandemic, we had powerful motivation to speak up anyway.Some aspects of my alignment follow the typical story of I was raised Democrat, but both my embrace of the civil rights movement and being a gay man were powerful forces that kept me from following the rightward shift of my male family members.","title":"Tell me why youre a democrat"},{"text":"I miss the split second when far left and Democrat were considered separate concepts.

I'm not intentionally avoiding or ignoring. I simply think that in general governments where the leaders and led are closer, along multiple measurements, are more compatible with human nature.  That also applies to situations where the Illinois state government has too much control over both Chicago and Carbondale where Carbondale is in some ways likely under represented.. Or even where the Mayor and city government of Chicago has too much control over each of the 50 wards. It's just that in my estimation... currently... the most damaging example of too much separation between the two involves State and Federal Governments.And as to your latter question... I'll say again that we chose to be more represented as a collection of independent states rather than as one large one. Most of the pro's and cons, and there are plenty of both, have been well articulated since before the first Constitutional convention and many times since. I still see the balance sheet leaning a bit more to the \\"pro\\" side and continuing to tip more in that direction as time passes. I just have little interest in re-litigating it all here.

Those are your words, not mine.I'm fine with most of the border bill. I disagree on the framing and think the Democratic Party should do better in pushing back on the idea that immigration is at all a problem.  Not pushing back on it leads to what we're seeing with Haitian immigrants who revitalized and brought a town back to life. That should be an amazing success story of how immigration helps us and helps the people who immigrate here. They're paying tax dollars and bringing communities back to life. Instead \\"they're eating pets\\" is dominating the narrative. The media is hugely to blame for this too so don't think I'm laying all the blame at democrats' feet.Then we have people like Merrick Garland who is a fascist plant from the Federalist Society whom Biden appointed as a show of bipartisanship.

Huge huge huge, do not pass go kind of red flag. 2nd Stonewall kind of red flag. UK Labour is implementing the Cass Review recommendations for trans care in a massive act of betrayal towards trans people in the UK who voted for them overwhelmingly. The Cass Review is bad science that ignored a majority of the evidence in order to achieve a certain outcome. That outcome is to ban transition entirely. Trans people who have been on stable care routines are losing access to hormone therapy and having to break the law to buy on the black market to survive (dysphoria kills). Trans children's suicide rates are skyrocketing and Labour is now trying to hide the statistics on it. I DO NOT WANT UK LABOUR INVOLVED IN DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING. PERIOD.

Antisemitism is basically the opposite of this, where Jews are believed to be extra powerful. Antisemitism works in the same pattern over and over; there is a societal problem, Jews are the scapegoat, blame, persecute.Right now in progressive circles (because white supremacy on the right is easier to understand while the progressive side seems newer) weve had years of learning antiracism which also includes a lot of discussions of racial oppression by white people, colonization by white people, etc this (racism against POC) is a really long, difficult, issue to solve and also causes a lot of guilt among white people about things they benefit from, and things they might contribute to.From a combination of things, but a lot from Russia and older far left ideas, Jews have become the scapegoat for racism. When openly hating Jews was no longer fashionable, it became antisemitism. When the holocaust happened, antisemitism became unfashionable. Antizionism as a concept and word existed for awhile, but in the 1960s Russia/The Soviets deliberately, consciously, created the concept of antizionism as a way to openly hate Jews without having to be unfashionably antisemitic.Even back in the 1960s, they would run conferences where they would pay to fly in delegates from other countries to listen to presentations about how Zionism was racism, Zionism was imperialism, Zionism was oppression. The same narrative exists today.So we are following the exact same pattern of societal problem (racism), and scapegoating that to Jews.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"The vague, ethereal Trump is a threat to democracy message doesnt work.

He had the active support of the powerful German officer class and of millions of everyday citizens who voted for the National Socialist German Workers (Nazi) Party and hailed him as a national savior in gigantic stadium rallies.\\"You'll see yet another difference, as Hitler had giant rallies.Plus, Hitler attended personally with a handgun when he attempted to stage a coup. Trump sat back and watched other people use weapons. Big difference.In all seriousness anyone with even a passing knowledge of real world history knows that we are seeing the motions of something truly awful. The bullshittery is so obvious, and all the hallmarks are all laid out, especially with language directly taken from Hitler himself. When Caesar took power to become dictator for life he did it as a matter of pragmatic protection of himself. When Rome burned Nero blamed Christians (heretics to the Roman world) and strung them up on crosses so he could have a scapegoat and profit while the flames raged. When Hitler took power he was aided by inflation, immigration and global instability and enacted policies that gave him absolute power in the name of saving the country.Anybody who is anti-bullshit should be able to smell the stinking pile from a mile off. Anybody who knows history should be able to smell it 10x stronger.

See for instance Ta-Nehisi Coates take on the conflict, which by his own admission is just projecting the history American racism onto a completely different country that hes visited in person for all of a week and a half - yet his entire explainer is based on identifying who the metaphorical Jim Crow black people are and who the metaphorical white Southern sheriffs are in this situation. You can criticize Israels treatment of Palestinians without such a reductive take on the history of this 140-year land dispute and ignorance of what the warring parties are actually fighting for - but the fact that hes uniquely interested in *this* bloody overseas conflict and not, say, one of the ones that *literally* involves black people, speaks volumes. And hes on the more benign end of the ignorant commentary spectrum, compared to people vandalizing synagogues, harassing Jews as Nazis or using the Holocaust to shame them for not sharing the opinion that Israel should be eliminated entirely, and excusing or even celebrating the mass murder of Israeli civilians by Islamic supremacists (like Jill Steins running mate did).","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"Lex Luthor from wish","title":"Jeff Bezos Overrode His Own Publisher to Kill Washington Posts Kamala Harris Endorsement"},{"text":"Im just saying, thats the only reason this is not a blowout as is: a grenade in Trump would happily be lobbed at DC by many otherwise were it not for that and trans issues.?","title":"What The Cat Said - This Isn't About \\"Liking\\" Trump"},{"text":"From my experience, majority of Christian Arabs are pro-Palestinian.

OK .The Orthodox in Israel make up about 16% of the population with an average family size of 6-7.  They marry and procreate YOUNG!Tthis is a population that isn't educated past the basics, then spend all day studying the Torah. They aren't required to serve in the military. Roughly about 10% have a university level education. Women have slightly more education because while doing all the housework, birthing(think what of pregnancy does to a body and doin it all for 9 months,) and caring for all the children work outside the home as the main breadwinner to support the many men studying the torah. They also have little say/power in things that affect the community - this means a society is using only 50% of its brain capacity.

If not then OK, it is what it is. The DNC ratfucked the 2016 primary to rig it against Bernie with superdelegates and then Clinton didn't campaign in swing states and underestimated Trump.I've heard this but have heard rebuttals as well.  Regardless, people who sat out or voted third party in 2016 are the proximate cause of HRCs loss.  We don't need to debate the merits of the argument to recognize that the lack of votes for Clinton is the reason she lost.To the extent we wish to engage the argument itself I would cede that Clinton should have run a better campaign.  I don't have a strong opinion about the delegates situation, so I'll grant that too. In the trolley problem you can either choose to pull the lever and cause the train to kill one or do nothing and let the train to kill five. Either way your action or lack of action is going to impact the situation one way or another. Our current politics is the trolley problem.  And you're right to be outraged about that. The two party system needs to be deconstructed and frankly I believe that we need to revise the US Constitution and radically restructure our government. But that's a pipe dream at this point and as I snap back to reality I hear the sound of the train coming down the track and look down at two levers by my hands and I look further down the track and see the one person on that left track and the five people on the right. In the words of Pink Floyd \\"Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.\\"the democratic party swings further and further to the right to the point where they're getting dangerously close to crossing red lines for me like adopting fascistic talking points regarding immigration; just totally conceding that there's any problem at all when immigration is at its lowest in many years.I don't agree with the part of your argument here where the relative rate of unauthorized immigrants is used to claim that unauthorized immigration isn't a problem. But I do agree with you that immigrants are people first and that they should not be dehumanized by the fact that they happen to be refugees asylum seekers seasonal workers etc. I definitely disagree with your argument that the Democrats are escalating in their treatment of immigrants to a level justifying calling it fascistAre you talking about the Lankford bill? If so,  I fail to see how funding for technology to detect fentanyl at ports of entry is fascistic.  I disagree with the claim that it's fascistic to hire more asylum court judges so that backlogs can start to get cleared and people who have a justified asylum claim can finally get closure and make progress. Immigration is low on your list of priorities but it is consistently high on the list of priorities among the broader electorate.   If that wasn't true then the millions of dollars spent attacking Biden and Harris over immigration was wasted and the strategists who recommended that were totally off base.  I don't buy that It makes a lot more sense to me to believe that the broader electorate does view immigration as a problem.  That doesn't mean that you have to agree but the Democrats have to run on the issues that voters by and large are responding to. Or the fact that they seem to be shutting out certain queer voices in the party, like trans people. Trans people are overrepresented in attacks from the nazis on the republican side right now. We should be allowed to defend ourselves. To speak out. We should be getting support. But did they let even one trans person speak at the DNC this year? No.I respect this.  You're right that the Republicans are going hard in some ad markets pushing anti-trans content and it's legitimate to say that an opportunity should have been given to speak out against that. You're right to be frustrated about that.  But at the same time, because we're trapped in the two party system, you have to choose which lever to pull. And it's disingenuous for you to claim that there's no difference between the parties as it relates to LGBT issues, rights, identities, etc. I can tell by the rest of what you wrote that you feel very strongly that there is an attempted genocide against trans and queer people.  You've clearly done some reading on it and I am not well informed so your point there is ceded for the sake of argument. But again there is a real difference between the way that Democrats govern as it relates to queer and trans people relative to the way that the Republican Party governs.  The claim that there isn't can be disproven with receipts. So to conclude, we have discussed Democrats shifting to the right on the issue of immigration and a failure by the party to give adequate voice to advocates.  And that's your reason for rolling the dice on actual fascism?","title":"The truth about whether Nikki Haley Republicans can hand Kamala Harris a win"},{"text":"It's not an election that people want to present the land lol.

This is admittedly reductionist, but trying to simplify his worldview in a brief message here while demonstrating this is the basic foundation of American conservatism. He viewed the French Revolution as problematic because it was a populist revolution that overthrew the institutions of the ancien regime and Chruch and created a secular society governed by the people. While in his view, not much changed in the colonies after the American Revolution other than who got to set taxes and policy (Congress rather than a monarch) as it still maintained social order and previous institutions as only land owning males could vote, while there was a separation of Church and state there was still a god fearing populace, slavery wasnt abolished (though his views on slavery are rather complex, he believed in gradually abolishing slavery but that Europeans needed to subjugate and Christianize Africans in order to civilize them prior to freeing them), and wealth was still concentrated in a new aristocracy of wealthy entrepreneurs. This is the fundamental basis of conservativism: maintaining social order, return to the old institutions, and opposing progressive change of society to adapt to contemporary issues and novel problems.","title":"Jeff Bezos Overrode His Own Publisher to Kill Washington Posts Kamala Harris Endorsement"},{"text":"so most exit polls show an opposition win but the pro Gov ones have a decisive GD winoof contested result","title":"Georgian (?) election megathread"},{"text":"I wonder what Katharine Graham would have thought.","title":"Jeff Bezos Overrode His Own Publisher to Kill Washington Posts Kamala Harris Endorsement"},{"text":"This is an absolute nothingburger.

US media tends to only focus on world issues when it involves the US (as is the case for most countries). for the most part, the average US citizen will hear more about Israel-Palestine conflict because the US government is supporting them financially and militarilysame as why the Ukraine-Russia conflict gets more media time than the sudanese civil war, the US is providing support financially and militarily to Ukraine, but as far as I'm aware is not supporting any of the beligerants in the sudanese civil war2nd, the Israel-Palestine conflict is heavily disproportionate in favour of Israel in terms of their military capabilities. so a powerful military using disproportionate force on mostly civilians is more news worthy than a stalemate situation like we currently see in Ukraine or a civil war between lower powered beligerants (as an aside, interestingly, both Iran and Ukraine are backing the Sudanese government forces)3rd, US having a large jewish population, notably in New York, means many were drawing comparisons of Oct 7th to 9/11 which shot Israel into the minds of US citizens. whereas the US has a much smaller Ukrainian population, and has a very small Sudanese population so would be proportionally lower priority in the views of what media thinks people would be concerned with4th from a media perspective, they love to frame things as one side vs the other. the Israel Palestine conflict is easy to frame as 'Jews' vs 'Arabs', again Ukraine vs Russia is also easy to frame, but the sudanese civil war is messy with various factions and there's no clear sides.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"\\npoor job numbers?Lol.

The conflict also exposes undeniable aspects of colonizationIf we're going to throw around terms like \\"colonization,\\" let's start with a look back. Jewish roots in this region go back over a thousand years before the Arab/Muslim colonization in the 7th-century. Despite waves of occupation...Romans, Muslims, and the fucking British, these Jewish communities endured in the land. When more Jews began returning in significant numbers in the 1900s, they werent showing up as colonizers. They were coming back to their homeland, often as refugees from Europe and MENA nations which were similarly colonized by the Muslims (whose religious text literally preaches Jew-hate), to a place they'd never fully left in their hearts.As Jews fleeing persecution in Europe and the Middle East resettled, they faced violent pushback, not just from Arab/Muslim locals but from surrounding Arab nations.  It's kinda like Mexican immigrants in the US, facing pushback from the white descendants of 16th-century European colonizers.  Fast forward to 1948: when Israel declared independence, the neighboring Arab states went to war, aiming to wipe it off the map. Arab leaders even broadcast calls urging locals to leave, saying they'd be able to return once the Jews were defeated. The result was a brutal mass displacement on both sides, with Israel absorbing Jewish refugees from Arab lands and Palestinians left in camps across the Middle East. This isnt a black-and-white story of oppressor and oppressed; its a knot of historical pain, survival, and conflict that simplistic labels cant even begin to untangle.EDIT:  also, for the record, fuck Netanyahu and the West-Bank settlers...that shit legitimately is colonization, and it's being done by extremists (though it's worth noting that many of them were likely pushed into such extremism by the existential threat and constant hatred directed at them by folks who literally want to cleanse the land of Jews).","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"More republicans voting doesnt necessarily mean more votes for Trump.","title":"Republicans Say They Are Winning the Early Vote.

Both scapegoat minorities;\\nHitler it was Roma, Jews and black people, Trump its immigrants and Muslims.2. Both expressed strong ideas of nationalism; Hitler promoted returning to Germanys former greatness, Trump has MAGA slogan.3. Hitler coined Lgenpresse (lying press) to discredit the media, Trump has fake news for any news that doesnt favour him and also referred to it as the enemy of the people.4. Both capitalised on fear to consolidate power; Hitler had the Reichstag fire, Trump has bullshit election fraud claims.5. Hitler aligned his views with Christian imagery to dupe stupid fucks, Trump does the same.6. Hitler centralised power and replaced government workers with those that are loyal to him rather than the country, so the when democratic elections were held, it was highly rigged; Trump is to do the same according to Project 2025. Along with this, Trump has said I want generals like the ones Hitler had (loyal to him and not the state) and well as if you vote for me youll never have to vote again.On top of this, Trump was found to be libel of sexual abuse by a jury of his peers, failed to appeal twice and the judge residing over the case specified twice that he is, by both common and state law definitions, a rapist. Further to this, he regularly hung out with Epstein and also hung out with P Diddy.Hes also been convicted 34 times of federal crime; keeping in mind felons cant vote, but apparently they can run for office that people are voting for.Hes also been colluding with Putin for years, even giving Russia valuable equipment like respirators during the covid pandemic when parts of America had a shortage.

We need to know why folks voted the way they did. Lets start with republicans.??Lankford, Sinema and Murphy introduced the bill earlier this year...But Trump opposed the measure, and after those senators released the legislative text, House Republicans said they would fall in line with the former president. Senate Republicans then?walked away?from the dealhttps://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/I think the order of events is relevant. Whatever their messaging on why they changed their mind about the bill, its telling that they walked away after Trump expressed opposition and after the House made it clear it would fail anyway (seemingly due to Trumps pressure campaign).?So in my reading this failed for republicans because Trump didnt like it and wanted it dead. Id say its fair to claim Trump killed it.?Why so many democratic defections though? ??Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no in a move that would allow him to make a procedural maneuver in the future to bring it back up.?Booker noted in his statement that he supported the original bill because it also provided critical foreign and humanitarian aid, a provision that doesnt exist in the current bill because Congress moved separately to pass a foreign aid package without border provisions.https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/05/22/politics/border-bill-vote-cory-booker-senateSo you have Schumer voting against because arcane senate rules make it possible to reintroduce. And other senators voted against because they felt it was giving TOO much to republicans and no longer gave them anything in return. This is common in the modern era. Democrats negotiate with republicans to make legislation as bipartisan as possible but republicans take those concessions, offer little or nothing in return, and refuse to vote for it anyway. Thats how Obamacare got as watered down as it did. ?But even if none of that convinces you, consider this: passing the debate doesnt matter. It also has to pass the House. And it is really the House where this died because Trump personally reached out to members to get them to espouse opposition to it. He engineered the end of this bill through the house so even if every senate democrat voted for and it passed, it still wouldnt be law because of the lobbying the former president did.?","title":"CMV: The Senate Border Security bill did not fail because of Trump"},{"text":"Creepy Joe Biden adored his baby sitter Jill Jacobs aka Jill Biden.","title":"Retarded liberal on X thinks 18 year olds who dates 17 year olds are pedos, calls me a pedo then has a TDS meltdown"},{"text":"I don't think the discussion about what kind of specific retribution he will take is important.

And, when shown that Republican opposition killed the bill, you just say that that doesn't matter because *four* Democrats voted against it. As opposed to all but one Republican voting against it.

The cycle of violence would continue regardless of whether the international community appeased Israel.And all this assumes Israel has no motivation for perpetuating the cycle of violence. The fact that the cycle of violence existed before Hamas, and that Israel inflicts this violence throughout Palestine including in regions where Hamas is not in power, contradict that.There's also the obvious conclusion that appeasement simply doesn't do what you think. If the blame is placed squarely on Hamas including Israel's own actions, then Israel has no reason at all to end the cycle of violence because it faces no consequences.And ultimately, what benefit to Hamas does international condemnation of Israel actually serve? Israel will never face the consequences of violating international law as long as it is shielded by the US. Israel's violence occurs regardless of whatever sympathy is given to Palestinians.

It does not mean the United States and France aren't morally culpable just like Israel, it's just that portraying any radical fundamentalist Islamic group that's dedicated to committing terrorist attacks on civilians as noble freedom fighters would be like calling brutal Mexican cartels as freedom fighters. These terrorist groups commit heinous criminal actions to raise funds just like the cartels.IMO, most Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and a good portion of their respective civilian populations, have fallen under the influence and power of far right wing ultra nationalist groups who are working to the detriment of their own countries and towards self destruction. Yitzhak Rabin was an Israeli prime minister who took peace talks seriously and genuinely tried to resolve the situation and was then assassinated by an Israeli ultra nationalist in the 90s, and from there Israel has grown more hardline.The only difference is that one side obviously is much stronger and will kill more and suffer less causalities or civilian deaths due to military strength, but if the power balance was reversed, there would be more Israeli deaths. Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran are as interested in peace and preventing genocide as much as ultranationalist Israeli troops and west bank settlers committing war crimes/ethnic cleansing are.","title":"CMV: Any attempt to criticize Israel's defensive measures, regardless of the well-meaning intentions behind them, ends up perpetuating the cycle of violence"},{"text":"But thats what happened.","title":"CNN Panel Explodes Over Suggestion Kamala Was Chosen By Dem Party Elites"},{"text":"What a complete douchbag that might have been with the didler","title":"Climate change is killing the earth and ruining our economy.

The notion that media coverage correlates with the perception of racial identity can simplify the complex geopolitical, cultural, and historical reasons why some conflicts gain more attention. For instance, while its true that conflicts involving Western nations may receive more coverage, the sustained focus on Israel-Palestine also stems from its direct ties to U.S. foreign policy, the Western worlds historical responsibility in the creation of Israel, and the global diaspora invested in the region. Furthermore, religious significance tied to Jerusalem makes it central to major faiths, keeping the spotlight on the region not solely due to perceptions of race but due to intertwined religious, cultural, and historical legacies.Additionally, framing the Israel-Palestine conflict as purely a racial perception misses the power of certain media narratives. Coverage doesnt always reflect realitymany humanitarian crises are overlooked, often due to political motivations, resource interests, or strategic alliances. Take Yemen, Syria, and Myanmar: media coverage has been inconsistent not only because of the racial identities involved but due to geopolitics and U.S. or Western strategic priorities.Lastly, while its true that some may inaccurately view Jews as white, this overlooks the diversity and intersectionality within Jewish identity and how this has evolved. Jewish identity is multifaceted and cannot be easily categorized through a Western racial lens. Shifting focus from race to shared humanity may actually foster a deeper understanding and empathy, emphasizing that conflicts are human tragedies deserving of compassion and attention regardless of racial or religious categorizations. This approach could help depoliticize suffering, urging more consistent humanitarian concern for all global conflicts, rather than selectively amplifying narratives that fit neatly into certain frameworks.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"Did you see Zuckerberg?

I'm a progressive. I'm so sick of y'all blaming us for the dems mistakes. The DNC ratfucked the 2016 primary to rig it against Bernie with superdelegates and then Clinton didn't campaign in swing states and underestimated Trump. That's on Democratic leadership. She could've swung left on policy and done outreach to bring in the disillusioned progressives in swing states who rightfully saw that as an undemocratic coup going against the will of the voters. She chose to meander instead and rub elbows with rich consultants.I've voted in every election since then. Every single year. And yet, the democratic party swings further and further to the right to the point where they're getting dangerously close to crossing red lines for me like adopting fascistic talking points regarding immigration; just totally conceding that there's any problem at all when immigration is at its lowest in many years. Or the fact that they seem to be shutting out certain queer voices in the party, like trans people. Trans people are overrepresented in attacks from the nazis on the republican side right now. We should be allowed to defend ourselves. To speak out. We should be getting support. But did they let even one trans person speak at the DNC this year? No. They didn't. And instead of defending us, they're silent or again, conceding the fascistic framing of their opponents that dehumanizes us. Queer people, trans people in particular, vote blue at higher rates than the general populace. We're extremely reliable. So why are our voices not represented at all? Why when we are facing an organized attempted genocide from the right (Lemkin Institute Paper on The Genocidal Nature of the Gender Critical Movement) are we not being defended?I mean this when I say it and when I write it:As a loyal progressive democrat who has voted consistently every year for years now, if the democratic party backstabs queer people or takes on fascist policy positions, it will show me that my vote has meant nothing all these years. That I'm taken for granted. That my life as a trans person at risk of losing my lifesaving medically necessary healthcare does not matter to democrats. It's not even about actual progressive policy like medicare for all, or a dynamic living wage, or green energy subsidies, or support for labor, or foreign policy that precludes working with autocratic states and states engaged in atrocities and human rights violations.  It's not even that I hate capitalism. It's not about policy positions.My red line is just: Don't backstab your minority supporters. Don't abandon the people who've donated time and money to you. Do not concede that some people are not people. There should not even be a debate about the humanity, healthcare and freedom of trans people. Immigrants should not be facing violence inciting blood libel. Never again is now.That's it. That's the line.Please stop slandering progressives who have legitimate criticisms and concerns about the direction of the democratic party.

I'm not conflating Israel hate with anti-semitism. People can protest Israel all they want. What I really said was that the antisemitism Israel is disproportionately facing is really misplaced anti-whiteness in my opinion. I think the response to this conflict is completely outsized in both media attention, care, sympathies and anything else to any of the numerous conflicts around the world that have as much if not higher civilian/innocent death and displacement.  My point was in my opinion people don't care about what's happening in Sudan, for example, is because it's a bunch of people in a Civil War fighting each other and there's no perceived power dynamic.But when you put whiteness on Jews, now Israel - Palestine becomes \\"white people oppressing brown people,\\" even though as I noted you can put an average Israeli and an average Palestinian side by side and probably couldn't tell the difference. But to protestors thousands of miles away who only heard of this issue last year, now it's a cause du jour to use words like \\"colonizer\\" and \\"genocide\\" specifically for this because IMO, it's once again misplaced anti-whiteness. if it was Muslim Arabs doing it to Muslim Arabs, which happens all the time, nobody talks about it.

No not the kind MatPat would write about.A classic example would be a linear beach with two ice cream stands on it. People will go to the ice cream stand nearest them without any other considerations and pay the lowest price. The beach has an even density in it. Imagine if the beach was split in half lengthwise, and each ice cream stand stood in the middle of their half of the beach. This would be optimal for both of them from a business perspective, and have maximal control over the prices too. But both of them are incentivized to cheat and move a little closer to the centre of the beach, to try to attract customers of the other while not risking their own customers. Once both of them cheat to the point of both being in the centre of the beach, they reached a nash equilibrium, both of them are losers and cannot improve their situation any more, and neither can go back to their original starting point or partway there without losing money. Despite it being the worst situation for both of them, neither can improve by moving away from it alone without confidence the other will as well.The electoral college winner take all design is like this too. No state can individually benefit much by moving away from this model, barring very small circumstances like Nebraska perhaps. If a reform is not done by states as a collective, and without a guarantee the other states will abide by it, they don't have the incentive to do it. The compact trying to get them to adopt the national popular vote is one attempt to fix this, but it is still a bit away from completion, and ideally federal law would help out here. Argentina did have an electoral college in the past and did split the electors within each state by the votes cast for each candidate (one candidate gets 40% of the vote in a province with 10 electors would give them 4 electors for instance), and that worked pretty well for them.","title":"CMV: The US presidential election system is a joke"},{"text":"Were the Beatles pedos?

I mean there's a whole Sudanese Civil War going on since last year that nobody cares about that has killed nearly as many people as those who have died in Palestine and has displaced over 7 million people in the African region. Very rarely do we get a modern European war nowadays, so the Ukraine Russia war is an example where discussions, regular news, and any sort of demonstrations have functionally ended. Like at this point nobody really cares.As gets said repeatedly when this whataboutism is trotted out: The U.S. is not arming the aggressors in either the Sudanese Civil War or the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are already actively supporting the resistance in the case of Ukraine.  Activists \\"don't care\\" about them solely because there are no domestic government policies they need to protest in order to effect change.  The first is the historical treatment of Jewish people, in particular Ashkenazi Jews. Right off the bat, Jews do not really fit into the racial paradigm of the US. There are jews of many backgrounds, from the Sephardi to the Mizrahi to even Ethiopian Jews, all a diaspora of colors. So to say \\"Jews are white\\" is already a mischaracterization. What people mean when they usually say this is they're referencing Ashkenazi Jews, who make up the historical majority of immigrants to the US. Ashkenazi Jews are Jews who primarily immigrated to the US from Eastern Europe.Except that the founding generation of Israel are in fact white Ashkenazi people from Europe who settled the region with the help of European colonial powers (namely the British) and imposed the inequitable partition of the land through their connections to European/American colonial powers who have then continued to be the ones who've been arming them and propping them up.  Additionally, that white Ashkenazi population remains the establishment power in Israel; look at a picture of every prime minister in the country's history and it's probably not a coincidence that they're all white and this white monopoly on power is going to have an effect on how they're seen.  The United States and most European countries also have some degree of ethnic and racial diversity in their populations, but people still rightfully seen as \\"white\\" powers in geopolitics and when they invade non-white countries they are perceived as such.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"She's going all-in on threat to democracy.

A blue ribbon commission of educated white men, called the electoral college, would vote for president and each state would get a number of electors proportional to their free population + 3/5 of their slave population. This gave the slave states the boost they needed to fend off any efforts to abolish slavery until 1860.","title":"CMV: The US presidential election system is a joke"},{"text":"We're entering the age of an American oligarchy.
