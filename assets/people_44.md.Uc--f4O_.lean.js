With COVID there was a **ton** of misinformation from day one about how effective we could expect vaccines to be, how many we might need, and whether there were serious side effects. We know the COVID vaccines were effective, but that lack of clarity in the public sphere allowed anti-vax and conspiracists to gain a foothold. In contrast, people are used to getting a yearly flu shot, and many have done so for their entire lives. People already have an understanding of how the flu shot works, that its only effective for certain strains, and that its very low risk. Hardcore anti-vax people will turn it down, but even folks who were skeptical of COVID vaccination will likely be ok with flu shots. Were also much better at quickly manufacturing flu shots, which means the massive social disruption we saw with COVID, which helped fuel public distrust and disinformation, is less likely with a flu pandemic. All that is to say, I hope we dont have to deal with a serious flu pandemic, and the risk of one should be taken with the grave seriousness it deserves. That said, I think theres some reason to be cautiously hopeful about our ability to handle one if it emerges.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"When I saw early voting numbers were evenly split on Monday I knew Kamala was going to lose.","title":"We know now why we lost: the Democratic Elite picked our candidate instead of letting the Democratic Rank and File pick them in the primaries."},{"text":"One joke","title":"Fox News just called the Election for Trump!

The campaign ran Spanish-language ads blaming Democratic candidate?Kamala Harris?for higher prices and saying that Trump will improve the economy. The Republican candidate said frequently that?cracking down?on undocumented immigrants would help Latino and Black communities.[You can read the full story here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/trump-ends-democrats-120-year-grip-on-hispanic-county-in-texas)","title":"Trump Ends Democrats 120-Year Grip on Hispanic County in Texas"},{"text":"Its called a phone","title":"Do the billionaire class have a looking glass device which helps them go one way together?"},{"text":"Biden should do it before January.","title":"Trump said he will release full JFK files almost immediately."},{"text":"I betted for Kamala not trump ( just 2k tho literal pocket money) cuz the pay out was crazy it was with like 2k if she won you could have been paid out like 200k, lost that money but my other bets are good, the pay out for trump was trash","title":"Trump has won the election.

The violence that happens here will not be alone. Many other nations will suffer as the bastion that once kept others at bay, such as Russia, Iran, China and North Korea will instead become their allies. The policies that will dictate this will be mirrored, unless you separate from us. Unfortunately tonight, America has become your enemy. We have whiddled away at our own education, and weaponized fear in concert with plans that were laid out by our own leaders these last seventy years to erode both.  The anger in this nation will likely see violence from those who stood against it. Brother will fight brother, and eventually the ones who are slain will be boasted as traitors and terrorists. And then when the violence from those who are angry does out, because it comes too late, it will continue in secret, out of the representation of media, and will make those in power smile. You must distance yourselves from America. You must be ready to fight this country immediately in the morality, and possibly on the battlefield in twenty years.

The majority of people who actually vote are not us, but rather folks who are of a wide variety of demographics and backgrounds. A lot of voters vote for different reasons (both single and multi.)In this case, there's many things to consider, but to keep it relatively brief (and correct me if I'm wrong):1. Harris, in general, wasn't that popular. She didn't do well in the 2020 primaries and seemed to have a hard time connecting with many voters this go around. Also, her not going through a real primary for 2024 might've backfired hard. Her being so close to Biden also killed her.2. The Gaza crisis might've played a much, much larger factor than we thought. The Dems were stuck being the party in power when the first attacks on Israel happened, and given how many leftists (especially Palestinians and other Arabs) despise Israel (some out of antisemitism, but certainly not all for understandable reasons,) many of them either stayed home completely, or even voted for Trump or 3rd party out of spite or whatnot. No matter the Dems's platform, the Gaza crisis was something that was going to be a dealbreaker to many left-leaning people.Furthermore, the Dems are not really a \\"progressive\\" party. They are certainly progressive compared to the Republicans, but in general, the Dems are still notably far to the right compared to most other parts of the world. Dems are mainly a center party with some leftist pieces by American standards. By most European standards, Amercian Dems may be soft-right, I think.3. A lot of voters, unfortunately, do not care about social issues or character when voting. Vibes and issues play a huge role, and the Dems got killed on the narrative and messaging fronts. Bashing a candidate's character flaws over and over again will only get you so far in swing states.","title":"Protest voters can pat each other on the back now while we wait for Gaza to turn into an oil refinery / strip mall combo for Israel."},{"text":"I was saying that white men were not given any kind of future by arrogant Leftists because the Leftists thought they had already won and I was warning that something like this (i.e. electing a fascist government) was the inevitable conclusion of angry young men that have lost their sense of identity and place in society and seeing nothing but rejection from the Left over things they didn't even understand.","title":"What Democrats must learn from Trumps victory.

Even when Joe Biden won in 2020, he won by a smaller margin than polls were generally predicting.In the post-mortem following those two previous elections, some polling experts thought that Trump was attracting voters who didn't consistently vote and so weren't sufficiently captured by pollsters as likely voters. Polling experts also talked about the possibility that a relatively large number of Trump voters are more suspicious of institutions, and that might carry over into less willingness to respond to polls. And polling experts said some Trump voters might be reticent to say they are planning to vote for Trump. The pandemic could also have factored into problems with 2020 because Democrats may have been more likely to stay at home and respond to polls.For the 2024 election, many polls tried to correct the previous undercounting, for example by adjusting polling results to take into account how people responding to polls say they voted in 2020. (It was a technique to try to make sure the polls were capturing a more realistic number of Trump supporters.) Some even thought the adjustments this time around could mean polls were now overestimating Trump support.What will the post-mortem on polling look like for the 2024 election? It could reflect some of the same possible issues we've seen before. But time will tell.C Aysha","title":"We are reporters from five newsrooms covering the 2024 election results.

Right now, they show him winning 45%.Nationally, Latino men seem to be driving this shift. In 2020, they voted for Biden (59%) over Trump (36%)  again, according to the exit polls. This year, they voted for Trump (54%) over Harris (44%).  \\nNow, exit polls can be a bit fuzzy  and pollsters have struggled to precisely quantify the Latino vote in the past. But if you look at counties where Latinos make up a majority of the electorate  places like the Bronx in New York or El Paso in Texas  you also see a 20-point shift in Trumps direction. In Texass much-smaller and almost uniformly Latino Star County, on the border with Mexico, that shift was something like 76 points.For an explanation of why Latinos swung toward Trump, this?[quote](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/09/07/latino-voters-shift-election-00177812)?from Mike Madrid (an anti-Trump GOP strategist who wrote a book about the subject) sums it up:Latinos, U.S.-born Hispanic men specifically, are not going to college at rates faster than any other race or ethnic group. Those with college degrees are increasingly Asian and white in this country. Those without are Black and brown. The white share of the blue collar workforce is shrinking dramatically, as is the voter base.

It's quite amusing","title":"DOJ moving to wind down Trump criminal cases before he takes office"},{"text":"So 3 things.1.) you are right in that technically it was not illegal - due to his lawyers successfully arguing a loophole in the length of the barrel of his rifle. My apologies for the original incorrect statement. I went and did some research after you commented to better understand why I misremembered. The result - theres some much needed context here. The law he was charged with breaking states that any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. It defines a dangerous weapon as any firearm, loaded or unloaded, as well as metallic knucks, nunchaku, pointed stars and other items. The charge was dismissed due to an controversial ruling by the judge stating the length of the gun barrel exempted him from this law, because the law had an exception built in so that minors could still use hunting rifles to hunt in season. This ruling was widely panned/condemned by legal experts because it clearly wasnt the way in which that exception was meant to be applied. Its controversial because while the law had the loophole for barrel length written in, that loophole was *quite obviously not written to be applied to Rittenhouses situation.* It was so that kids could hunt using long barrel rifles with their families during rifle season without being arrested - *not traveling to a riot with the intent of potentially shooting a person*. Compounding this - This was only a loophole in *Wisconsin*, where he was charged, but not *Illinois*, where Rittenhouse was from and also where he obtained the rifle and was coming from. Where and when he procured the weapon had no such exemption because it was in an entirely different state with different laws, and it is quite clear that he was not aware of such a loophole existing in Wisconsin. So it only became legal when he crossed over state lines into Wisconsin, and he was not aware of this technicality.This means, in his own mind, he already knew what he was doing was wrong. Knowing/believing you are committing a potential crime is admissible in court as evidence of criminal intent, even if you end up being wrong about that belief - you didnt think it was legal when you did it, and thats admissible evidence when trying to prove criminal intent.2.) he obtained the weapon in the first place through dubious means, utilizing the infamous straw purchase loophole. He had someone else buy the gun for him because Rittenhouse, as a minor, wasnt legally able to purchase the gun himself. The adult purchaser later pleaded no contest to a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor as it was a reduced charge. This is like if it was legal for you at 23 to go buy booze for your underage sibling. Its illegal for the vast majority of age restricted products, *but not guns*, and has been the subject of heated debate for decades.3.) every single thing about what Rittenhouse did screamed intent to use a firearm to injure/kill a human being. He intentionally exploited a controversial loophole to acquire it as he knew buying it himself was illegal. He then took that gun, knowing/believing he was potentially committing a crime, to a place he had no connection to and no reason to be with the express intent of *seeking out* a potential conflict/reason to use it, and then he *shot 3 people and killed 2 of them, with the latter 2 only becoming involved in an attempt to stop him after shooting the first*. Finally, he was only acquitted of possessing the weapon in the first place *in Wisconsin* due to a loophole that *he was not aware of when he procured the gun, that also was applied in a way contradictory to the spirit of the law*- he got lucky as fuck, pretty much. If he had picked a gun with a barrel even an inch shorter, or had gone somewhere other than Wisconsin, it wouldve been a crime, loophole or not.","title":"Donald Trump, candidate of retribution, is restored to power"},{"text":"Hillary was a significantly better candidate than Kamala and its not even close.","title":"Dont you find it weird that Kamala didnt even come out to say anything to her supporters?"},{"text":"You guys realize there wasn't a democratic primary this cycle right?

The Court affirmed that Trumps communications with the DOJ fell into this absolute immunity, rather than the presumptive immunity afforded to the outer limits category. That tells us that the Court definitely considers any military order to fall into the absolute immunity category.The Court also affirmed that these types of acts are non-justiciable - they cannot be reviewed by the courts. So in theory, as was referenced in oral arguments and in dissenting opinions, a President commanding the US military to pursue an assassination of a political rival would be an action that would be afforded absolute immunity from criminal prosecution and would not even be able to be reviewed in court.","title":"Harris to concede defeat to Trump in evening speech, sources say"},{"text":"I mean thanks for refuting each point, but hey at least we have a president that can speak without a teleprompter and doesnt have to know questions ahead of time!","title":"What Trump Understood, and Harris Did Not"},{"text":"we could stop giving our wealth and handing our entire society over to billionaires.... for a start.","title":"Trump has won the election.

They did things the right way, why should someone else get a pass? They've struggled from the ground up, why let someone else come in and lower the floor?

Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general, was quoted in the book saying about then-President Trump, Hes an idiot. Its pointless to try to convince him of anything. Hes gone off the rails. Were in Crazytown.Gary Cohn, Trumps top economic adviser, referred to Trump as a professional liar.John Dowd, Trumps personal lawyer in the Mueller investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, told Trump he was so untruthful that if he testified in person he would wind up in an orange jumpsuit and was a fucking liar.Maggie Haberman of The New York Times wrote that my book Fear depicts the Trump White House as a byzantine, treacherous, often out-of-control operation, and that the book unsettled the administration and the president in part because it was clear that the author has spoken with many current and former officials.Senator Lindsey Graham assured then-President Trump that I had not put words in Trumps mouth nor anyone elses. And to my complete surprise, Trump agreed to be interviewed for my second book on his presidency, Rage.I wish I met with you for the last book, President Trump said, seated in a burgundy chair behind the Resolute Desk on December 5, 2019. But well make it up, well make it up.Trump had props set out on the desk in front of him. There was a stack of judicial appointment orders in the center of the desk. Then on one side there was a binder of letters Trump had exchanged with North Korean president Kim Jong Un. And on the other side were large photos of Trump standing next to Kim shaking his hand and smiling.Trumps war was the coronavirus pandemic and his performance revealed his character. These interviews showed a man with no fidelity to the truth, fixated on re-election and unequipped to deal with a genuine crisis.Trump was warned by his national security advisers that the virus was deadly and a major threat to the country but he never developed a plan to respond. He did not know how to use his extraordinary executive power to prioritize saving American lives. Through defiant pronouncements, he downplayed and deflected any responsibility for handling it. There was no compassion. No courage.Oh, I have a plan, Bob, Trump said about the coronavirus in April 2020. I mean, you know it is what it is.\\nDuring national crises, people look to their president for leadership.This is war, Trump told me.I asked Trump if he had sat down to get a tutorial with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nations top infectious disease expert. Was Fauci his Eisenhower?\\nTheres not a lot of time for that, Bob. This is a busy White House, Trump said.By the summer of 2020, about 140,000 people had died in the United States from the virus and eventually the death toll would exceed 1.1 million.You will see the plan, Bob. Ive got 106 days, Trump told me in July 2020. In 106 days was the coming presidential election.His lack of action on the coronavirus almost certainly cost him the 2020 election, according to his own pollsters.I once asked Trump, Whats the job of the president? He said, To protect the people.\\nIts a good answer, but Trump failed to do it.Donald Trump is not only the wrong man for the presidency, he is unfit to lead the country. Trump was far worse than Richard Nixon, the provably criminal president. As I have pointed out, Trump governed by fear and rage. And indifference to the public and national interest.Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history and is demonstrating the very same character as a presidential candidate in 2024.","title":"Trump's election victory likely to halt criminal cases"},{"text":"*Will the Kingpin be held accountable for his crimes now that he's been elected mayor?*No, man.

But right now my answer  as boring as it might sound  is that Harris didnt lose because she did something wrong. She lost because Biden is historically unpopular (58% disapproval rating); because the current America is on the right track number is historically low (just 26%); and because voters associated Trump with change.To illustrate this point, the political scientist John Sides charted presidential approval ratings in June of an election year  going all the way back to 1952  against the incumbent partys final share of the presidential vote a few months later. He found that Bidens paltry approval rating was consistent with the Democratic candidate  in this case, Harris  winning 48% of the vote.  \\n  \\nHarriss current share of the popular vote? 47.5%.This doesnt mean Harris ran a perfect campaign. And it certainly doesnt mean people will stop floating other explanations for why she lost. But as Sides?[tweeted Wednesday](https://x.com/johnmsides/status/1854194919310799239), Trumps gains were widespread, so explanations should start with the broadest factors  not with bespoke stories about states, cities, counties, and groups.I would add campaign strategy to that list.","title":"We are reporters from five newsrooms covering the 2024 election results.

Trumps team knows that and regardless of who is helping him with that, it just won over America. Biden won because he is a white male. He won some of those voters back, but it wasnt a sign of change but more of white voters taking a chance on the status quo of American presidencies. Are country is young.

Yes, I voted for Hillary, Biden, then Harris.   \\n  \\nSome background. I immigrated here just under 25 years ago, gained citizenship just under 15 years ago. I work in higher education, I live in Texas.(might be moving, who knows?) I have been involved in polling, I have been an election volunteer, I go to local meetings, speak at my local boards. Before you read this. Some of it is obvious, but it's clear that our leadership hasn't gotten it through their thick skulls. We. need. to. change. The voting population is changing, so if the party is to survive and make the USA a more progressive place, we must take the longer road of winning back moderates again.   \\n  \\n!1. Stop treating young cis people like trash. There are so many that want to be allys but are off-put by the \\"#killallmen\\" type rhetoric. Allys come in a spectrum too, shitting on someone for being \\"not enough of an ally *yet*\\" pushes them away forever. !&lt;  \\n!2. Black Americans are not assured votes. A significant portion of the Black population are some combo of religious, gun-loving, and anti-immigration. !&lt;  \\n!3. Not all Latinos are ok with *illegal* immigration in particular, a big issue in this election, and being soft on it is losing votes. So many struggle to come here legally, just to have someone jump the line through some program that isn't open to them. Yeah, cool, this didn't feel great to me either. I watched people get their citizenship faster than me who came here illegally. Gotta tell ya, it is not a great look. !&lt;  \\n  \\nFor the sake of other issues we need to find a new platform that will be fucking popular. what do democrats going to do in the next few years preparing for midterms and the next presidential election?   1. Tougher platform on immigration, prepare to filibuster the fuck out of the fed, and actually pick a candidate through the primary system this time. It was perfectly legal to put Harris in the spot, but foolish. If we wanted her to be president so bad then Biden should have retired at midterm to give her a 2 whole years to earn the public's trust that way. Instead, she stayed in the invisible VP seat. what do democrats planning their top issues for the next decade?   1. Gun Control, reproductive freedom, and labor rights are still the path forward, in conjunction with a more popular (restrictive) position on immigration. With any luck, President Felonious Maximus will change things too quickly, people will feel the hurt, and push back hard. We need to be there to guide the pushback. and the most controversial one, what kind of presidential candidate are the dems looking for? its seems like america isnt yet ready to have a woman president.   1. Harris needs to never run again for federal office, first off. Help in the background. She is poison at this point. \\n   2. Pete fucking Buttigieg, or someone like him. Start looking at the Harris VP pick list. Kelly is another great option. Seriously, any one of them might have done better in the primary than Harris, but we will never know.

But the Supreme Court's July 1 presidential immunity ruling may also protect Trump from that risk. The conservative wing of the court ruled that Trump was absolutely immune from prosecution in his federal election interference case for his alleged conduct involving discussions with Justice Department officials. Maybe that means a president/former president can't be charged with obstructing justice for ordering the DOJ to drop a prosecution against him?Trump could also try to pardon himself in his federal criminal cases. Legal experts differ over whether that's allowed. The Supreme Court hasn't ever ruled on the issue.Those are two options Trump doesn't have in his New York and Georgia state criminal cases. But his election will still be good news for him on those fronts, too. Trump's lawyers can now argue that going forward in the Georgia case, or sentencing him on Nov. 26 in the New York case, is unconstitutional because it interferes with his responsibilities as president-elect and potentially later as president.??Because Trump is the first president-elect in this situation, we don't know how that argument about the state prosecutions would go. But the Supreme Court's immunity decision talks about not wanting the judicial branch to interfere with the executive branch. Trump's lawyers can say that means state courts shouldn't interfere with the presidency. And they can also point to a clause in the U.S. Constitution that says federal laws take precedence over state laws (the supremacy clause), and say that means state courts/prosecutors aren't allowed interfere with the presidency.C Aysha","title":"We are reporters from five newsrooms covering the 2024 election results.

I'm going off the evidence that they did, given that he's on track to win the popular vote. Personally I despise the man and voted against him. If I had to guess, it was mostly that he actually admitted how bad the economy is. The stock market may be great and wages may be up, but the cost of living has outpaced wages thanks to years of inflation (just objectively, no matter whose fault it is) so there are a lot of people like me where I can say I make $10 an hour more than I did 5 years ago but I'm just as broke because I can't afford groceries and my rent has skyrocketed. The standard metrics for our economy simply ignore the actual financial health of regular Americans, so Harris and the Democrats talking about our fantastic economy fell flat for a lot of people even on our side. Again, it's reductive to try and blame either side for that when most of it is due to the economic fallout of COVID and corporate greed.Another thing is that a lot of people, including people on the left, sincerely believe that ours is an empire in decline. Harris's campaign of joy and optimism attempted to dissuade that fear and in doing so came across as dismissive of it. Trump, even though he's wrong about so much, plays into that narrative and legitimizes people's resentment and frustration on both sides. On his side, he \\"calls it like it is\\" about who to blame and on ours, his very candidacy serves as evidence of the decline. If for that and no other reason, he meets the moment in his twisted way.","title":"I know why so many Latino men voted for Trump.

However, they are recommendations to real problems people are experiencing.What Trump does, and the Democrats fail to do, is identify and recognize real problems that Americans experience everyday. His solutions to them are laughable, but hes at least acknowledging real concerns and that is what is attracting people, even working class minorities to him.Go on LinkedIn and look at how many people with OpenToWork on their profile. Unemployment may be low, but underemployment is not. Just as outsourcing and low cost labor created downward wage pressure in industry in the 80s and 90s, its happening across the tech industry today. Ship a job to LATAM or bring in an H1B, and one less American is working. A lot of white college educated people are learning a lesson people in small mill towns learned three decades ago. On the flip side, people in the building trades know that illegal immigration == downward wage pressure. How do you think every house in Atlanta, Austin, Raleigh, Charlotte and every other fast growing city was built in the 1990s and early 2000s? How were they so inexpensive? Why do you think home building stopped after 2008? Because Pulte, Lennar, and every other big home builder was subbing to crews of illegal immigrants, and they all went home after the Great Recession. It decimated the domestic construction industry. Working class folks who are just starting to get a foothold in the economy again see the influx and see the writing on the wall. Every person that says, I wish we could have a kid, but its just too expensive., I wish we could buy a house, but its just too expensive - this isnt exclusively a student loan problem. My friends son is a plumber, a young man getting started with no loans, and Ive heard him say the same thing. This is a real concern for many young Americans.Trump sees these people. He acknowledges their concerns. He doesnt talk about structural racism, transgender equality, intersectionality  those are concerns for people that own homes and can afford to have kids. DEI doesnt help a town that lost their biggest employer to Mexico. Equity lenses dont help people that are living paycheck to paycheck because of high housing and grocery costs.No, Donald Trump cant reverse prices, unless he puts the country into a deflationary spiral. No, he cant fix globalization with tariffs. But he at least acknowledges these are problems that people have to deal with. He doesnt hand wave it away with, but the stock market, or have you seen inflation in the EU?","title":"What Trump Understood, and Harris Did Not"},{"text":"Trump won less votes this year than in 2020.","title":"Trump Has Humiliated His Foes"},{"text":"Last I checked there were quite a few people on that primary ticket.

Charisma and marketing  policy and morals.Gavin Newsom doesnt offer enough charisma. He offers a clean-cut, normal, Democrat/liberal. When you look up liberal in a textbook, it might as well be a picture of Gavin Newsom. Why on earth would you think that he would get voters to the polls. His charisma is what? A corporate smile, a nice suit, and a good haircut? And the fact hes a white man?We need someone who is going to ACTIVELY persuade voters. Someone who can solidify a winning message, and repeat it over and over. Trump won this election and 2016 because he has a solid, consistent message, and wins the media. He gets billions in free advertising from the news outlets, and his message never falters. It can sometimes shift (usually to be more extreme), but it rarely changes, and it is never inconsistent.Democrats on the other hand, cant decide what they stand for. Are you progressive? Are you centrists? Are you establishment? Are you pro-worker? Democrats say too much, and too wide in an effort to pander for votes. The reason Obama won, is because one of his most important messages was we are not the left and the right, we are all Americans. The list of candidates who have the charisma and tact to take on the 9-headed hydra that Trump has built is pretty short:- Bernie Sanders (has the charisma, but is too old)\\n- AOC (has the charisma, but also comes off as too edgy, and shes a woman)\\n- Buttigieg (the gay factor will be a big issue here, but his debating, public speaking, and charisma are excellent)We need to find our Donald Trump, and quickly before 2028. We need to look outside of establishment candidates.. the money is there to get any candidate the visibility they need. This thinking that someone needs to be a known name, is silly. When you have a billion dollars in advertising to spend, being a known name, isnt a question. Its about someones public speaking skills, and the emotion they leave you with.Biden left us with the emotion of really, THAT guy is our nominee? after the debate. That is why he was replaced. Kamala and Walz left us with the emotion of I mean, decent, cant see any huge issues. But what about XYZ. And that is why they got a meh turnout. We need someone who takes more questions off of the board than they add. Any establishment candidate currently involved in the DNC/Democratic party does not fit that criteria.If the Dems want to win 2028, they will go out and find either a white man, a white-washed black man (ala Obama), or a white-washed Hispanic/Latino man, who has excellent charisma and public speaking skills, and work with them on crafting a policy platform that doesnt pander to everyone, but focuses on the most important issues that voters have. Get rid of the DEI bullshit, get rid of the transgender and abortion arguments, get rid of the talk about social programs. What do Americans care about? Food on their table, roof over their head, gas in their car, affording visits to the doctor, sports, etc. Which of the candidates in 2024 talked more about those items listed? The winner. In 2028, its time to get rid of the Clintons, the Pelosis, the Obamas, the Newsoms, etc. We are going to have to come up with a JFK/MLK type candidate if we want any chance of undoing the damage from Trumps term.This entire election shows how Steve Jobs was right in his mantra the person doesnt know what they want until you give it to them.You cant ask people to decide on whats best for them. They are too undereducated, overworked, underpaid, etc to put in the energy required to wade through the bullshit. They arent going to sit there with a pros and cons list of the candidates and go well they support abortion, but they will raise taxes, and they support Gaza, but they will eliminate gay marriage. Voters will rally behind someone who gives them a better life AFTER it is given to them, NOT before. Elect a centrist, allow them to shift left and start implementing sensible progressive policies, and the American electorate will realize the benefits. Theyll go huh, my wages HAVE risen while they are in office. My taxes DID go down. I DID spend less at the doctor these past few years. Then they will start to come to their collective common sense and be able to rally around a candidate. But you cant expect them to rally around candidates who are unproven. Even Trump was semi-proven when he ran as a businessman, Obama had the pedigree of being a Harvard lawyer. Bush was a family name in politics. We need to elect a candidate based on their charisma, allow them to prove themselves, and rally around them to rebuild the party. Essentially exactly what the Republicans did to rebuild, but we need to do it less fascistly, and we need to get rid of the high-road BS. Its politics, its dirty, people lie, cheat, and steal to win.

While it reasonable to be concerned about the pandemic-causing potential of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, a pandemic from this virus is not inevitable.First, I would quickly summarize the main reasons to be worried: (1) H5N1 is extremely deadly in mammals, with a higher human case fatality rate than COVID-19, (2) H5N1 presently in dairy cows rapidly kills ferrets, the main animal model for studying influenza, even those inoculated with only a small infectious dose, (3) H5N1 is widespread in US dairy cows at the moment, and it's in wild birds all around the world, (4) prolonged transmission between mammals makes it more likely that the virus will acquire mutations that allow it to spread to humans, (5) the worst ever influenza pandemic, the 1918 \\"Spanish\\" flu, was caused by an avian lineage influenza A virus that spilled over into humans.However, before you freak out, there's some cause for optimism:(1) H5N1 was mostly confined Asia, but a particularly successful variant (clade 2.3.4.4b) spread to wild bird populations in Europe in 2020, North America in 2021, as well as the global south (even including Antarctica in 2024). Despite spreading really well among wild birds, especially waterfowl, H5N1 has so far caused only several isolated outbreaks in mammals, suggesting it may still be missing some properties that make it an ideal candidate to transmit between mammals, (2) humans already have adaptive immunity against influenza, as most of us have been exposed to H1N1 since it re-emerged in 2009, which offers some degree of protection, (3) anti-influenza drugs like oseltimivir (Tamiflu) work well at limiting virus replication and preventing severe disease if taken within 48 hours of symptom onset, (4) we know a lot about how to make flu vaccines, and even rapidly produce loads of mRNA flu vaccines in less than 12 months if there was an emergency, (5) so far human H5N1 cases haven't caused a high number of onward transmission events, suggesting that even those viruses in mammals have not yet got the right mutations to cause a human pandemic (although this one could potentially change).","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"Trump will withdraw the US from NATO before Russia attacks Poland though, so no need to commit troops.","title":"Trumps victory could mean US withdraws support for Ukraine in war with Russia"},{"text":"The Women's Health sub has the fear mongering down pat with posts about having to get their tubes tied because if they have complications with their future pregnancies, they'll end up dying.

These are college aged women who are likely supportive of LGBT rights. But would rather take a loss than playing against someone they think has an unfair advantage. They can still make strides in trans rights, and not be in peoples faces with it.
