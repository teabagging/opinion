It didn't take any one single form, but it sure looked to be widespread.  The way it most likely was happening pretty consistently was by simply increasing the total ballots in districts Democrats knew they'd win.  Let's say Biden is on the ballot in a random district in a heavy Democrat area.  He's going to win the district 80% to 18% with 2% other.  Normally you don't have to just print extra ballots for Biden, you can just up the total number of ballots for all candidates.  You maintain the vote percentages and keep turnout below absurd levels and you can avoid suspicion while juicing total vote numbers.  In close areas or areas Trump would win you just don't do it at all.  You can do this with paper ballots, you can do it with an algorithm in electronic voting machines, etc.  This way both candidates get extra votes that don't actually exist, but so long as Biden got significantly more fake votes in the places that mattered while keeping the vote split about the same it has the effect of benefitting Biden.  That was plan A. But since Plan A didn't work by the wee hours of the morning in 2020 they had to take emergency measures.  So you got mass vote injections in places like Oakland County (Detroit) where dozens of districts got 100% turnout or higher and the ballots counted late in the process all went 98-99% to Biden which is statistically impossible.  Or like in Pennsylvania where the state received about 700,000 more mail-in ballots back than it mailed out and then destroyed all the ballot secrecy envelopes in violation of SCOTUS orders and state law so that you couldn't match secrecy envelope numbers with the total ballots counted.  There are more examples.  We consistently see Republican vote totals increasing while Democrat totals stay relatively flat.  And Trump has enjoyed significant enthusiasm gaps in al three elections he's run in.  2020 is an aberration probably because Democrat Plan A was to inject fake votes for both candidates but more fake votes for Biden to try to keep people from being suspicious, but when that didn't work they just had to outright blatantly cheat, which we all know is exactly what they did.  The 2024 vote totals for Trump is consistent with the upward trend we've seen from Republican candidates for multiple elections now.  Biden's total is statistically impossible to have been legitimate.In 2024, there was a microscope on all the states that really mattered to the election's outcome, and a number of those states actively took measures to minimize Democrat's ability to cheat in the ways we all know they cheated in 2020.  When all eyes are on you you have to be on your best behavior, so we saw very little that was troubling on election night this year, at least in the \\"battleground states\\".  Could Dems still be juicing returns in places like California?  Maybe, but Trump wasn't winning the state anyways.  The point here is, the numbers look out of place because they are.  2020 was a sham, and anyone with triple digit IQ knows it.  It was obvious then, it's obvious now, and I think the results of the 2024 race are showing just how farcical the 2020 election actually was.","title":"Did 15-20 million democrats just stay home?

Does that justify ethnic cleansing? Any sane person will say no. if Israel sought to eradicate Palestinians, why did Israel concede peacefully to give their most holy site to Islam.  ? It's part of the process. Why did Ben Gurion agree to the UN partition? According to his own words, it was because it gave Israel a foot hold as a state and from there they can expand and take the rest of Palestine. Israel has never given up land it has only expanded. And that has been the plan. According to the plan at the time jerusalem was supposed to be in palestine but Israel expanded beyond the border defined and you talk like it is the Israels being the good guys by pausing their expansion temporarily.

After all, this is shaping up to be one of the worst defeats in a long time (losing the popular vote, likely losing every single swing state, Republicans on track for a 54-46 majority in the Senate, and they are looking like they will probably also take the House). I care a ton about LGBT rights (trans especially at the moment, but I'm concerned about them across the board), climate change, immigration, Ukraine, Taiwan, conflicts in the middle east around Israel, free trade, abortion, evidence based policing/prison reform, and the existence of the US as a liberal democracy. So...IDK. I'm not sure where to turn from here. Just try to hope these policies become popular again? Moderate on some so as not to sacrifice the rest? Somehow find a messenger who can change hearts and minds? I'm not asking rhetorically here - things seem pretty fucking dire. I think I disagree with the Republican party on each and every one of those issues...E - Like, fuck. Assuming Trump finishes up and wins in the states he is currently leading in, he will end up with 312 electoral votes. That's the biggest margin of victory since Obama, and the largest for a Republican since George H. W. Bush. That's fucking INSANE.E - E- okay, its been a couple of days. I think I regret this post, but I think the core is still valid: where do we go from here? Ezra Klein had a good talk about it on his show, which is probably worth checking out. I keep circling back to two ideas: 1. We almost certainly lost this race due to inflation. It sucks, its not fair, its stupid, and the consequences will be disastrous, but here we are. 2. Aside from that, we have been seeing a trend of young men and Latinos moving away from the Democratic party for a long time now. That trend looked stronger than ever in this last election. We need to do some soul searching about this. Something similar can be said for working class people. We will always lose some people due to homophobia, xenophobia, racism, and sexism. That's baked in, and we cannot and should not be going after these people. But, I don't think that explains what we are seeing. Not really. And if it does, we need to be asking some serious questions about why that number is a delta and not a constant, and we need to figure out how to change hearts out there. But most of all, we need to understand the thought process behind this movement, and see how we can incorporate it into The Tent. IDK what that looks like, but I'm hoping some brilliant journalists, thinkers, and politicians out there can crack this. I kinda think that it starts by crafting and showing and promoting a positive vision of masculinity, rather than defining positive masculinity as \\\\[not toxic masculinity\\\\]. But, maybe that's just my own bias creeping in here.","title":"Rule Clarifications"},{"text":"Basically, because Bidens' contain dead people votes.

And I don't mean this in the sense that we should have had a convention, I mean this in the sense that Harris-Walz was a quickly thrown together stop gap measure to stem the bleeding frim Biden's catastrophic debate performance. Imagine being a voter who had faith in your government and believed that the hardships you were experiencing were being taken seriously by the president. You're not happy, but you still have some faith and might show up for him. Now go to the debate where it was reveal it was clear Biden was, at the very best, too old for the job, and at worst, deteriorating into senility. And just in case you weren't sure if you saw what you thought saw, Biden proceeds to have senior moment after senior moment. Every accusation of senility from your dumbass friends and aquaintences in social media are vindicated and you're left looking like a fool. And now in response to this, the best thing the DNC can do is tacitly confirm that Biden was senile and throw out a last minute candidate, hoping that you would forget that the leader of the free world is currently asleep at the wheel?

They want to eat a certain minority,.While this may seem extreme they fully embrace the democratic process, there is no shady business behind the scenes, no thugs at polling stations, they just passionately believe that it would be a better tastier world, if a certain minority including you and your family was barbecued and eaten.Obviously outraged by this, you march, you campaign, you do everything in your power, to point out that these guys are crazy and by no means should anyone vote for them.And then it comes up to election day and the worst happens, the cannibal party wins, the electorate has decided that barbecue sauce, is in your immediate future.So we have a conundrum here, obviously you don't want to be the main course at a state sanctioned banquet, but it is undeniable the country has come to this terrible choice because they freely want it.So what is the reasonable course of action, some like our Atlantic author here would say something like \\"keep protesting and voting the system will sort it out\\" which is easy for them to say, because they are not likely to be on the menu.The issue is you can't defeat the problem through democratic mechanisms, if the problem is that the democracy is headed by a anti democrat, backed by a antidemocratic majority. Or you can recognise that the system worked fine, this is the choice made, and decided what combination of hide, fight, flee you want to do.","title":"Democracy Is Not Over.

And because wages haven't increased on average to keep pace with inflation, people are just poorer.Of course, a significant part of the \\"inflation\\" we saw was actually just heavily consolidated companies raising their prices because they don't have competition (ie leveraging monopoly/oligopoly power), so theoretically it should be possible to drop prices by somehow forcing companies to slash their margins (either via competition or some other method).But that was unlikely under Harris, and pretty much impossible under Trump.Instead, the Fed did/may continue to do what it typically does in response to inflation: raise interests rates. Which *also* hurts people because their debt payments get bigger. I don't think that is likely to help because the source of inflation is corporate consolidation, not excess cash supply. But that is their hammer, and apparently they look at every problem as a nail to be hit with it.Biden did what he could within the narrow range of neoliberal possibility he inhabits. And Trump will undoubtedly make it far worse if he actually enacts the tarrifs he has talked about.

They used to put NG tubes in them to feed them when they went on hunger strikes.   THAT is grit.  But today's women puffed themselves up and made a big deal of it and then shat on themselves, basically. The numbers were bad - Harris 54-37 among all women, but +1 Trump for white women.  White women are basically an entitled enemy overall.  This won't be forgotten for a long time.  They took the energy of the 2017 women's march and squandered it on petty infighting within two years.  They went from five million marchers and no violence to making a lot of noise but not getting enough people to the polls, and then getting double crossed by their own base when they did.No one needs to go to the trouble of repealing the 19th amendment when they can set tradwives against lesbians.  They fight with each other and their political power vanishes.Trump is unlikely to survive another term.  He's got dementia.  Fuck it, I'll say it out loud.

He totally flipped on Trump and lied through his teeth to get it.  There's no guarantee he'd return to his former self.  He probably doesn't have a former self.  That was what he thought he had to say to move forward when he said it.  Trump recognizes that in him - the amorality and untetheredness to reality.  No one actually knows who JD really is.

Nothing is static, many many voters are captured temporarily and not permanently, and any assumptions about why they voted a certain way and continue to vote that way are misguided and over-generalising.First, on the Republican Party. Donald Trump is unique and unconventional, which has been incredibly beneficial to him but carries a risk when it comes to finding his successor. Republicans right now will understandably be very optimistic about the future of their party, but no matter what they think there is no concrete way for them to retain the Trump formula in future elections. Its entirely possible that they find someone who can take over that mantle, its also entirely possible that that person pisses their voter coalition away because they dont have the very particular type of appeal that Trump has, and arent able to get away with the same unorthodoxies. I am not yet convinced that he has created a lasting movement.Second, on the Democratic Party. There are multiple problems here that people have already touched on: elitism, arrogance, populism, being tied to the far left, communication etc. I want to touch on authenticity.Trumps communication is authentic. Its dishonest, but its authentic. When you go to his rallies, watch his interviews, or read his tweets you are getting something that it is totally his own, and unique to that situation. Its messy and deranged, but its also unfiltered and improvised. He does not have a stump speech, he has talking points but thats the extent of\\nIt. Democrats are stuck in this old idea of message discipline that no longer applies, in part because Trump contrasts so heavily with that strategy that the constant repetitions and evasions become even more noticeable.Kamala Harris had a major authenticity problem because she:* Avoided difficult interviews* Evaded difficult questions* Wasnt able to seamlessly segue from an uncomfortable topic into one of her talking points (See Pete Buttigieg for examples of doing this effectively).* Failed to recognise the value of non-traditional media - podcasts are how increasing numbers of people and especially young people consume information. I dont think her going on Joe Rogan would have changed the result, but ffs its the most popular podcast in the country, with an audience that is there to be won. How can you not recognise the value in appearing on that sort of media? Additionally, you cannot leave social media to some marketing intern posting the same repetitive, boring stump speech clip from one of your rallies. No, the majority of people are not using Twitter or listening to Joe Rogan, but everyone knows people who do - you need to reach those people to control the entire online information highway (which includes work/friend/family group chats btw). Candidates need to be able to use Twitter authentically themselves, without focus grouping every bloody tweet.* Avoided the primary process (not her fault). Obama and Trump were able to come in and take control of their parties and the narrative. Harris was unable to do this, and so the election became Trump VS an avatar of the Democratic Party.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"Jill","title":"Why Kamala Harris Lost  And Why It Wasnt Close"},{"text":"She didnt her speech till Wednesday morning.

I'll never sell my house for less than $365 after the work I've done already. So my point is, is that home prices won't be lowered. It's been 3 years of homes being bought for double the price and someone like me won't sell for old prices (because I'd take a massive loss) and my neighbors won't sell for old prices because the couple houses on the street sold for $300-340. So why shouldn't theirs. Lowering thr interest rate will only cause over bidding again. Maybe they give loans that act as 20% down but it's paid off at the sale of thr home. But yea don't look for prices on homes to go down, no one can fix that.","title":"People are tired of wokery. Thats why they voted for Trump"},{"text":"As much as I hate it, I sort of get it.

My breaks are unpaid, hence why i work till 5:30 instead of 5. Also fairly standard practice. Grocery delivery is a thing yeah, but takes money, and i'm already scraping by. The other things you mentioned , birthdays/ celebrations and vehicle maintenance arent typically a weekly thing. Based on your other posts, it seems the DJ job is a second job? I might be wrong on that.DJ isn't my second job, also a weekly thing as it's like my 3rd wedding i'll be doing, ever. So i'll admit that this week is especially busy, my DJ gigs are mainly during friday or saturday nights, so they typically don't really interfere with my schedule, but the overarching argument stands, i mainly have to do my errands on saturdays, as it's the only day i have the time within the opening ours of stores. You dont like to hear this, but you have a time management issue. It happens to a lot of people. I struggle with it and have created systems that work for me so that I can get my tasks completed and still enjoy life.I truly don't see how the fact that i've got a single day in the week to do repairs to my car, 0 days during the workweek without taking PTO to go to the doctor or dentist or w/e, or 1 day in the week where i can go to stores for home supplies or other non-food products, all on the exact same day that i can take for rest or social events, are an issue stemming from **my** side.What you have described is life. Millions of people manage this all the time. I work full time shift work as a single mother in one of the most expensive cities in my country. I manage my schedule, and assist with my managing the co parenting schedule. I grocery shop, take care of a house that I own and am solely responsible for the maintenance of, and still find time to get a walk in and social time, along with a video game or two. It sucks sometimes, but its doable.If even you admit it sucks sometimes. isn't that reason enough to advocate for change? we're striving for a better life, no?As for your argument in this CMV that a 40 hour work week is too long, maybe.

( about 15 million less dem voters showed up than 2020 while Trump's vote count was about the same)In 2016 it was that \\"Hilary was too centrist\\" now it's \\"Harris was too progressive\\". If anything, I'd actually argue that Harris ran a far stronger campaign than Hilary did in 2016 and was more energic than Biden in 2020, but it largely didn't matter. All a lot of swing voters cared about was inflation and cost of living and those things were likely harming Trump in 2020 similarly to how they're harming the Democrats now etc.On top of that, over 40% of the electorate just doesn't engage in good faith and care more about obstructing the Democrats or empowering Republicans than they do about good governance or rule of law. A lot of these voters aren't even swayed as much by the details and impacts of policies as much as they are by very shallow vibes. While a lot of the Dem voters remain unreliable and only show up when they're sufficiently scared/angry with the Republicans.","title":"All icing, no cake.

Trump had months of proving his viability and favorability over his challengers, especially by winning the primaries without any notion of debating them. THAT was the big red flag that was overlooked, as well as those primary polls that said swing voters viewed Trump at being \\"better at the economy\\", while it was true that the Biden White House was busy covering up Joe's disengaged cognition (read up on Jen Psaki's interviews for references).Many comments here state that angry young (white) men were a key demographic that flipped the swing states. Well, that goes back to the perception that Biden was going to die before this summer. I don't think any cosplay by Kamala, Shapiro, or Kelly as being the reassuring auntie/uncle to this demographic was going to change that. American voters prefer lies and hyperbole over critical thinking, and I think I agree more now, in hindsight, that Trump should have won his second term where the Pandemic would have lingered longer and the dreaded inflation everyone's crying about would be worse thanks to Trump's fumbling at fixing the supply chain.The Democrats were in no fit form to grab the post pandemic ramifications by the horns and come out looking like champs. It's also apparent that the current Democratic party doesn't have a charismatic leader, and again, I don't think Shapiro, Kelly, or even Beshear resonate at all with voters.I didn't bother naming Newsom because his national brand is even worse than the other three guys, even though I think he's perfectly capable of running circles in D.C.","title":"Harris-Walz Post-Morten"},{"text":"They are where most of the people arein population centers.

When high paying jobs come in, land values absorb some of that growth, pushing values up. This is important because land in cities is finite and it's non-fungible. You can't take a square foot from rural Texas and drop it in San Francisco. In addition, we've largely stopped building new housing and what is built has a limit on density. The net result is that we've said b each person should have X sqft of land area in a place with extremely expensive per-sqft land values.This plays into homelessness because there's much more demand for housing than supply and supply isn't increasing. There are just mathematically more people than houses. Some will have to go without. If you can't come up with the very expensive rents, you don't get to have a home.

Since 1948, it is we who have demanded the return of the refugees, while it is we who made them leave. We brought disaster upon a million Arab refugees by inviting them and bringing pressure on them to leave. We have accustomed them to begging...we have participated in lowering their morale and social level...Then we exploited them in executing crimes of murder, arson and throwing stones upon men, women and children...all this in the service of political purposes... -- Khaled el-Azm, Syrian prime minister after the 1948 War, in his 1972 memoirs, published in 1973..","title":"CMV: Most People in the West that Support Palestine have no idea on the current situation in Palestine."},{"text":"Those Latinos, like so much of America, are just straight up racist or sexist or stupid?","title":"Opinion: Trump is president again and Democrats can blame Biden's ego"},{"text":"Absolutely!?\\nHealthcare here is only expensive because they have insurance agents making 25-30% off of your annual premiums.\\nUniversal healthcare means less hands touching the money","title":"Opinion: Trump is president again and Democrats can blame Biden's ego"},{"text":"I think we should listen to Trump when he said elections are rigged.","title":"I think its over: Democrats despair as Trump runs up the score in battlegrounds - Some members of Harris campaign began bracing for defeat."},{"text":"Sounds like 20 million votes are missing as well","title":"When will Kamala Harris give her concession speech?"},{"text":"Wow substantive.

This time, Donald Trump campaigned on an even darker agenda  the mass deportation of migrants, calls for more violent policing, and demands of retribution against his enemies  and he didnt have to try to steal the election in the courts or via a violent coup. In the battleground states, he appears to have run the table, and he will likely win the popular vote outright, something a Republican hasnt done in two decades.There are plenty of factors that could help explain why Vice President Kamala Harris lost  and why the race ultimately was not that close: Joe Bidens crushing unpopularity; pervasive sexism, racism, and xenophobia; an American culture that stupidly valorizes the ultra-wealthy and licks their boots. There was the Harris campaigns decision to run a safe, staid campaign, from Democrats favorite failed playbook, Be Like Republicans. There was her refusal to break from Biden over his support for Israels war in Gaza  carnage that plays out on our screens daily, and has particularly affected young people.The most likely explanation, however, for why Harris lost is the most basic one: Americans are deeply dissatisfied with a brutal economy.After Washington put an end to Covid-era pandemic aid programs, Americans suffered two years of sky-high inflation, impacting the price of nearly everything, alongside higher interest rates  which drove up credit card rates, mortgage rates, the costs of car loans, and more. Amid a punishing cost-of-living crisis, voters have now punished Democrats.Exit polls and other survey results coming out of the 2024 election are incredibly clear that this contest was, as is often the case, about the economy, stupid.Edison Research exit polls show that two thirds of voters believe the state of Americas economy is poor or not so good; 69 percent of them voted for Trump. Asked what the most important issue in their vote was, 31 percent of voters said the economy, and 79 percent of those voters supported Trump.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/why-kamala-harris-lost-election-2024-1235154713/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/why-kamala-harris-lost-election-2024-1235154713/)","title":"Why Kamala Harris Lost  And Why It Wasnt Close"},{"text":"Ive been told the language here is overly kind so to maybe distill this all the way:If you think throwing a group under the bus for votes is okay, youre an asshole and can go fuck yourself, we will be permanently banning that trash attitude.Much love, W ??","title":"Rule Clarifications"},{"text":"Because 15 million Dem voters mysteriously chose not to turn up to vote, of course","title":"Why Kamala Harris Lost  And Why It Wasnt Close"},{"text":"Except a lot of Americans voted for him because they liked their situation during his first term.","title":"Why Kamala Harris lost the election"},{"text":"It was too late for a primary so at that point, it *had* to be Kamala for Biden's war chest and resources. .Pelosi and the DNC should have pushed him out after the 2022 midterms.","title":"Opinion: Trump is president again and Democrats can blame Biden's ego"},{"text":"They didn't have the same resources this time around because Biden failed to mandate the experimental gene therapy.

If we had seriously evaluated Biden as a candidate, and rejected him like a year and change ago, then we would have seen serious competition with serious candidates and have had a better (not a guaranteed, but better) chance of finding a potential silver bullet. Instead, at every turn, democrats acted to minimize infighting. Minimizing infighting is great when you're clearly favored, but this was always an uphill battle.","title":"Harris-Walz Post-Morten"},{"text":"Im trying to come up with some jokes to lighten the mood because what else can you do right now?

Basically she got too drunk at the corporate holiday party after working  almost 24/7 the last 3 months for the last quarter and year end.
