It's generally considered that both candidates will support Israel no matter what they do, and you should see the things they show Israel doing in the Muslim news feeds. They voted for Trump because of three reasons mainly, the economy, immigration, and LGBT. It was a heated debate in my community. Many said that we shouldn't support any candidate that would support Israel. The issue with supporting Israel is usually more about the settlements than anything. They show us in the news Israeli settlers pouring concrete in Muslim wells to make them move. They show them forcing people out of their houses so they can move in. They show them burning Muslim crops to make them bankrupt. However, many Muslims just figured nothing they can do will stop Israel from annexing the Palestinian territories if only they could get rid of the people. So since both candidates support Israel doing these things they voted for the party that socially most aligned with their views.","title":"Muslim voters who helped elect Trump upset with pro-Israel and pro-war cabinet picks"},{"text":"EXACTLY.","title":"??BREAKING: President Trumps new White House press secretary pick, Karoline Leavitt, says when Trump is sworn in, hell implement paper ballots, same day voting, and voter IDs in all 50 states."},{"text":"Why are they alarmed now?

But that is a *completely different thing* from the professed belief these days that every fertilized egg is a human life with equal value to a living person, and the loss of every pregnancy even in the early days before the embryo is more than a single cell is an event with the same moral gravity as the loss of human life.Also, if you *did* believe the latter, and acted accordingly, I'd think that's crazy, but I'd respect that sincere belief.  That means, for instance, likely advocating to scale back most cancer research and other medical causes and devote that money instead to ensuring that fertilized eggs implant successfully, since that's the far greater cause of loss of innocent lives.  It certainly means fighting to stop IVF.  It probably means arguing that it should be a serious crime to remain sexually active when you're aware of having fertility problems, just as it's considered a serious crime to drive while drunk.  You might not intend to risk innocent lives, but in both cases you're clearly acting with reckless disregard for the risk of death to which you are knowingly subjecting the innocent.What churches have done, though, is effectively to behave as if they believe the former ethical principle should be enforced by the government, but publicly claim to believe the latter, while absolutely not acting in a way consistent with those professed beliefs.  And we let them get away with it!  If they want to tell us they believe that loss of fertilized eggs is the same great moral tragedy as the death of a child, we should insist they *act* that way and stick up for all of the implications, rather than turning a blind eye to the consequences of their professed beliefs except when it happens to justify enforcing their notion of unexpected pregnancy as a punishment for immoral sex.","title":"America's Catholic bishops say they will fight Trump's mass deportation of migrants if it becomes reality"},{"text":"Please for the love of anything being sacred, do not appoint him.

But in Brazil, things are complicated. In 2014 I preferred Marina Silva, but would have no issue on voting for Aecio at the time. I hated PT. Governador? Voting for PSDB as well. Then came bolsonaro. I voted for Amoedo on first round, Novo lawmakers as well. In second round I voted Haddad, because I always knew how awful Bolsonaro was, and it was never a choice to vote for him, especially as a gay men.But I had the illusion that a liberal party could be made. That Novo+Livres could be it. But I was totally wrong. The conservatives and reactionary destroyed both, and they even managed to expel Amoedo, the the former presidential candidate and FOUNDER of the party.Then pandemic came, at first, a lot of people though Bolsonaro would get destroyed, but the opposite happened: Bolsonaro still had support even with the awful pandemic management. And that was the moment that entire right-wing, center-right and even some center candidates all became bolsonarists. After all, to be elected in several states now you have to be a bolsonarist-conserative and keep talking about christian values.

In another parallel with Trump (and some other Republicans), Hoover's financial failures led to a massive tent city of homeless veterans and their families encamped in Washington DC. The veterans wanted early payment of their service bonus certificates for fighting in WWI, and they needed it sooner than the delayed schedule that Hoover wanted to stick to.\\nFrom Wikipedia:\\nMany of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. The World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1945. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.\\nOn July 28, 1932, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President Herbert Hoover then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned.\\nNotice the similarities between the Republican treatment of American veterans in 1932, and Trump and his sycophants' current attitudes towards the US military and its personnel, Trump's treatment of protesters, and the Republican Party's efforts to make homelessness illegal.\\nAnother example of the Republican Party's long-running schemes to install a christo-fascist authoritarian dictatorship over America:\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot\\nThe Business Plot, also called the Wall Street Putsch and the White House Putsch, was a political conspiracy in 1933, in the United States, to overthrow the government of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and install Smedley Butler as dictator.\\nButler, a retired Marine Corps major general, testified under oath that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization with him as its leader and use it in a coup d'tat to overthrow Roosevelt.?\\nIn 1934, Butler testified under oath before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the \\"McCormackCDickstein Committee\\") on these revelations.\\nAlthough no one was prosecuted, the congressional committee final report said, \\"there is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient.\\"\\n.... It [Bonus Army protest/homeless veterans tent city] was encouraged by an appearance from retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, a popular military figure of the time. A few days after Butler's arrival, President Herbert Hoover ordered the marchers removed and U.S. Army cavalry troops under the command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur destroyed their camps.[citation needed]\\nButler, although a self-described Republican, responded by supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 US presidential election. By 1933, Butler started denouncing capitalism and bankers, going on to explain that for 33 years he had been a \\"high-class muscle man\\" for Wall Street, the bankers and big business, labeling himself as a \\"racketeer for Capitalism\\".\\nI see that even back then the New York Times swung in the direction of the pathologically greedy elite conservatives....\\nCorruption:?\\nhttps://rantt.com/gop-admins-had-38-times-more-criminal-convictions-than-democrats-1961-2016?\\nRepublican administrations have vastly more corruption than Democratic administrations.

Bullshit. Coming up with controllable theories of why they lost offers hope that they might win again. But the truth is they had no control and their loss was nearly inevitable. The electorate has abdicated their civic responsibility for decades. Most voters couldnt tell you what the chambers of congress are, who has the majority, what the House or Senate do, how laws get passed, how the process of appointing judges works, or what the responsibilities of the three branches of government are. They do not understand the limits of what the president can and cannot do, and tend to think of the president as a king who is responsible for everything right or wrong in their lives (depending who it is, even if their lives havent actually changed very much).Voters dont see the democratic process as anything more than a means to an end for their own selfish wants. They no longer see their civic duty as a responsibility to their country. If their selfish wants are not met through democratic means, they do not care to uphold democracy. They will gladly trade democracy in fora misguided attempt at getting cheaper eggs. ?Americans dont care who they harm or what the consequences of their choices might be so long as they think theyll benefit.

If populism cuts across the ideological spectrum, so does the alternative media. This network of politically diverse independent podcasters, YouTube hosts and other creators connects with young, politically disaffected audiences by mixing politics with comedy and pop culture, and presenting themselves as embattled defenders of free thinking C?in opposition to mainstream media and mainstream parties. [...] While many of these shows have been around since the 2010s, the network expanded throughout the Trump era. Their popularity skyrocketed during?the COVID-19 pandemic, when?public distrust in government,?anger over pandemic restrictions?and?vaccine skepticism?surged. These shows hosted Kennedy frequently throughout his presidential run in 2023 and 2024. He was particularly focused on a class of male-dominated alternative shows sometimes called the manosphere.# Kennedy finds his audience I analyzed a set of Kennedys appearances for this story. Both Kennedy and alternative media hosts claim to care about \\"the real issues facing Americans such as war, corporate and political malfeasance and economic troubles. They condemn the mainstream for promoting frivolous culture war topics related to race and identity politics. Kennedy and the alternative media hosts also combine left and right arguments in a typically populist way. They claim that corporations control the government and that liberals and corporations censor free speech. For example, on a May 2024 episode of Stay Free with Russell Brand, Brand asserted that corrupt institutions are backed by the deep state. He asked Kennedy how he would fight these powerful interests. The major agencies of government have all been captured by the industries theyre supposed to regulate and act as sock puppets serving the mercantile interests of these big corporations, responded Kennedy. I have a particular ability to unravel that because Ive litigated against so many of these agencies. My research found that Kennedy often bonded with his alternative media hosts over his perception that liberal media sources C allegedly controlled by the Democratic National Committee or the CIA C were censoring his campaign. Like Kennedy, alternative media hosts often identify as former or disaffected Democrats. Many used to work at mainstream left news sites, where they say they experienced censorship. [...]# Left-to-right pipeline Trust in a range of U.S. institutions is at historical lows. Americans on both the right and the left are skeptical of power. As the 2024 election results showed, they crave radical change. Alternative media hosts tapped into this desire, helping to push some disaffected listeners rightward. The same left-to-right pipeline landed Kennedy in Trumps orbit. Trump and his allies were adept at harnessing the power of the alternative media ecosystem. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump appeared on male-centric shows like The Joe Rogan Experience, and This Past Weekend w/Theo Von, and many media critics see this as a big factor in Trumps success winning over young, male voters. Both Rogan and Von were personally thanked by name at Trumps victory celebration. Trump and his inner circle even form part of the alternative media themselves. Trump founded the alternative social media platform Truth Social and his adviser Steve Bannon hosts an influential podcast called the War Room on another MAGA alternative media platform, Rumble. Known for its fiery populist rhetoric, the War Room broadcasts live for an astonishing 22 hours a week. Bannon, who was briefly jailed for contempt of Congress in mid-2024 and now faces trial in New York for financial fraud, used his show as a soapbox to promote Trumps candidacy. He also praised Kennedy on the air, boosting the Democrats profile among his far-right listeners. For Kennedy, aisle-crossing is part of the solution to partisan polarization.

Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, and Trump now again, have dug the grave of American society through big and small shovels full of dirt each step of the way.Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden are, if there's still history books to be read, going to very likely, and ideally, portrayed as the four horseman of a very American apocalypse once all the dust of this era settles.","title":"Democratic leaders across US work to lead resistance against Trumps agenda"},{"text":"I think Vance is an extreme opportunist.?Like Lindsey Graham, but with more ambition to rise to the top instead of just latch on to whatever powerful figure and feed off his table scraps.I dont know if JD Vance even knows what JD Vance believes these days.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 16, 2024"},{"text":"Tough argument.

I hope that readers do not object to me weighing in on this unfolding crisis. I am in no way a bot or interested in destabilising the US for its own sake and my comments are meant to be constructive and are well meaning.Revolution is code for tearing up the constitution which has already been gamed to death by Trump MAGA and GOP shenanigans over decades. His contemptuous cabinet picks are looking like a trigger to do away with congressional controls over the presidency. His plan to remove generals that are not loyal to him and replace them with sycophants could blow up in his face. Senior military must be outraged at his pick for Secretary of Defense and it is both a slap in the face and an unfolding security nightmare. Placing Tulsi Gabbard as head of the intelligence agencies is utter madness as is Kennedy for health, Musk has bought his way into the WH and will run amok in dismantling the government and will plunge the USA, and the world, into recession so that he can gobble up distressed assets at pennies on the dollar.Should Trump try to mobilise the army against civilian protesters, political adversaries and activists it could be a bridge too far for him. Troops on the ground could face the prospect of rounding up family members, friends and migrant families for detention and situations such as this could result in mutinies. Officers at lower levels could also choose to ignore or refuse orders from Trump sycophantic generals.Just because he replaces generals at top levels does not mean that his regime could not be subject to a military coup. Lower ranking generals and colonels will have more access to troops than those at higher levels in the Pentagon and WH.Getting out of the country however is not so easy as migration is complicated by a number of factors relating to eligibility.The best thing to do is stay and fight. Protest in the streets, become politically active and prepared to have your head cracked and locked up. Civil disobedience and political organising is the only way forward. Should you become targeted for activism and come under threat, then you may become eligible for political asylum. Political asylum however needs to be earned by taking risks.This may seem a little extreme or exaggerated but everything that has gone on since his first term and the sixth of January makes it appear, for me at least, to be the greatest threat to the republic since the secession of the South and the civil war.","title":"Leader of the pro-Trump Project 2025 suggests there will be a new American Revolution"},{"text":"Straight relationship with extra steps","title":"Power Lesbian Murders Father in Seattle Over Trumps Re-Election"},{"text":"Wasn't his entire cabinet by a long shot.","title":"Trump just showed up at the Madison Square Garden UFC event with his entire cabinet."},{"text":"I think their plan to replace that labor is to use forced labor from the prisons and camps they keep talking about.","title":"I Study Guys Like Trump.

I don't see congress agreeing to correctly fund the immigration court system given they never have before.Just do so extra-judicially. Even if Trump gets here and predisposing they have enough planes &amp; busses to actually deport people (for reference a fleet of 200-300 737's would be required to deport 10,000,000 people in a year, they will need to rent American's entire fleet of 737's or half of Southwest) the next problem is getting countries to accept them back.Boats exist and could squeeze many more humans. Countries will not accept back large flows they have trouble providing assistance for, for instance Guatemala have a cap of 52,000 a year currently. They won't accept back people if they are not being treated appropriately, for instance Mexico have made clear they will cancel the existing removal treaty if due process is not followed.The people can be dumped on the shore, then it's Guatemala's problem.if the US has jurisdiction to remove them then their children born here are US citizensSimple, just separate people from their parents. Jail the children in juvie and toss the parents on the death boat.Based on the $82k/migrant cost congress would have to authorize a spend $820b/year to detain 10 million migrants. This would be the 3rd most expensive program the US government operates. This doesn't seem a likely outcome.It would not cost $82k to move someone at gunpoint between their home and a cargo ship. It certainly didn't cost the Ottoman empire that much to move the Armenians.it's simply not possibleWould this be a humanitarian disaster, absolutely crush America's reputation in the world, inspire copycat policies, and make the world a much, much darker place?

It's about whether abortion should be broadly acceptable and legal. In order to advocate for legalizing abortion totally, unless you want to argue that it is acceptable to kill children, you need to formulate an argument to make the claim that it is not a person. That is what the debate centers around. The pro-abortion crowd is not advocating for abortions to be allowed in cases of medical risk or necessity. They're arguing for it to be allowed at a whim, for any reason, or none at all. To say it is about healthcare is simply a dishonest representation of their argument.You can say that it is about 'bodily autonomy', but this is exactly where we get into biased framing. The anti-abortion side does not generally hold the belief that women shouldn't have bodily autonomy, but rather that the one specific act of abortion violates the bodily autonomy of what they view as another person. From a more moderate perspective, the abortion debate is about how to balance the rights of the child to live with the woman's right to determine what happens inside her body. One side is more concerned with one of these things at the expense of the other and vice versa. To label the issue by referring to it only in terms of the concerns of one side is pretty much the textbook definition of biased framing.Framing it as not a conspiracy is biasCalling something a 'conspiracy theory' is in fact biased. To call something a 'conspiracy theory' is a conclusion, not a presentation of a fact. You are presenting the reader with the conclusion you felt they should come to before, or instead of, giving them direct facts and information.  \\nit still gives the topic more legitimacy it deserves.To determine, as the writer of a news article, how much legitimacy one side of an issue deserves is the most clear definition of biased you could make. None of your arguments are actually supporting the idea of the liberal media *being unbiased*. They support that you think *they should be biased*","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"Honestly, this is some Big Chungus energy that is almost impossible to replicate.

Those are pretty serious headwinds for any candidate to face. Frankly, I think even Obama would have trouble.

Some of it racist, some of it batsht insane and a lot of it dangerous.As for the deaths he (and his wife Cheryl Hines) are responsible for in Samoa...He's lying and telling half truths about his role in those deaths, the ban, and the timeline.a couple kids in Samoa died from a 'bad vaccine'.No, the vaccine was fine.  They died because they were injected accidentally with a muscle relaxant.  This was in 2018.  Don't get your information from RFK Jr... he lies!RFK Jr used that accident to promote anti-vax fears that were published in Samoa well before he arrived and after as well.   Notably, these posts did not clarify that the 2018 deaths were caused by human error, not the vaccine itself.Due to the accident, vaccinations were temporarily suspended.  This ended in April 2019.   He and his wife arrived in June 2019 and instead of promoting that vaccines themselves were safe, effective and should be taken, he amplified their fears, all while not pointing out what caused the accident.Skip forward and as a direct result of his efforts, there was an entirely preventable outbreak and over 80 people (mostly children) died.At same time Tonga was also infected with measles yet nobody died because no one took the vaccine.  \\n  \\nSeveral factors were at play one of which was being far better prepared, which also resulted in vaccination in fact taking place.  Additionally, the outbreak was both contained and isolated mostly to young adults as opposed to children who are more vulnerable.RFK Jr's role in all of this is not a healthy questioning of anything and has long been established by scientific studies with published results and peer reviews.  RFK Jr (and nobody else) is presenting valid contradictory data with the same standard of peer reviews replicable results, etc...Likewise, spewing racist crap about targeting of Covid isn't being skeptical, it's dangerous, on multiple levels.I could go on an on here, but others have done this for me:  \\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/)My morals just say that ought to be non judgmental, open, and tolerant of different viewpoints, not just laugh them off as if we have a high ground as that's a very easy approach tonnes of people take these days.My morals tell me Jeffery Dahmer was a bad guy and rightfully wasn't selected to be in charge of our nations health.  I can pass that judgment just as clearly as I can with RFK Jr, because his actions will result in deaths in the future as they have in the past.As for pregnant men, I agree they arent hurting anyone (apart from themselves especially kids who take up surgeries which a large percentage later regret), but my larger points is I dont think those who disagree should be called haters. I'm sorry but that's creating enemies out of nothing.You were talking about an emoji and the left's not *protesting* its existence.  Like I said before, I'm struggling to figure out how anybody is at all negatively impacted by this or what would drive them to protest.So you tell me, how is somebody protesting this not doing so from a position of hatred, bigotry or intolerance? My point was that the left blindly accepts certain subjective realities while censoring sensible questions. What was the sensible question here?  You didn't ask \\"why is there a pregnant man emoji since men can't get pregnant\\".  There a multiple sensible answers to that.  You questioned the acceptance of the left of the emoji *without protest.*","title":"Bill Maher says 'my head's not exploding' over Trump picking RFK Jr. for HHS: 'We do need shaking up'"},{"text":"I've been trying to warn people of this invasion by russia for a decade.

See the letter below referencing Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)I've pasted this letter ALL over this thread, but I'll do it, again:THIS is the letter urging his confirmation:\\"The Hon. Charles Schumer, Majority Leader  \\nThe Hon. Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader  \\nUnited States Senate  \\nWashington, D.C.? 20510Dear Senator:The below civic organizations and scholars write to you out of concern that a year-long hold by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) on the confirmation of David Huitema for Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is placing ethics compliance of the presidential transition process at risk. We encourage the Senate to lift that hold and complete the appointment of fair and impartial leadership of OGE.Sen. Lee declared more than a year ago that he would prefer the appointment of the OGE Director be made after the inauguration of a new administration and has thus placed a Senatorial hold on the appointment of Huitema ever since.*Ethics should never be viewed as a partisan game*. In fact, the Directorship is a five-year term, specifically designed to overlap administrations to minimize the influence of partisan politics. And David Huitema, much like the prior Director Emory Rounds appointed by then-President Trump, has a seasoned career of impartial ethics enforcement. Huitema has long been managing the State Departments ethics program in a fair and prudent manner, without consideration of partisanship. Huitema is precisely suited to be the kind of balanced Director of OGE that ethics requires.One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGEs vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.We strongly encourage the Senate to override the hold of David Huitema as Director of the Office of Government Ethics and allow for the proper enforcement of the ethics process without undue consideration of partisan favoritism.Sincerely,American Federation of Teachers  \\nAmerican Oversight  \\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  \\nColorado Black Women for Political Action  \\nCourt Accountability  \\nAlexander B.

Charles Schumer, Majority Leader  \\nThe Hon. Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader  \\nUnited States Senate  \\nWashington, D.C.? 20510Dear Senator:The below civic organizations and scholars write to you out of concern that a year-long hold by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) on the confirmation of David Huitema for Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is placing ethics compliance of the presidential transition process at risk. We encourage the Senate to lift that hold and complete the appointment of fair and impartial leadership of OGE.Sen. Lee declared more than a year ago that he would prefer the appointment of the OGE Director be made after the inauguration of a new administration and has thus placed a Senatorial hold on the appointment of Huitema ever since.*Ethics should never be viewed as a partisan game*. In fact, the Directorship is a five-year term, specifically designed to overlap administrations to minimize the influence of partisan politics. And David Huitema, much like the prior Director Emory Rounds appointed by then-President Trump, has a seasoned career of impartial ethics enforcement. Huitema has long been managing the State Departments ethics program in a fair and prudent manner, without consideration of partisanship. Huitema is precisely suited to be the kind of balanced Director of OGE that ethics requires.One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGEs vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.We strongly encourage the Senate to override the hold of David Huitema as Director of the Office of Government Ethics and allow for the proper enforcement of the ethics process without undue consideration of partisan favoritism.Sincerely,American Federation of Teachers  \\nAmerican Oversight  \\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  \\nColorado Black Women for Political Action  \\nCourt Accountability  \\nAlexander B.

Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader  \\nUnited States Senate  \\nWashington, D.C.? 20510Dear Senator:The below civic organizations and scholars write to you out of concern that a year-long hold by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) on the confirmation of David Huitema for Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is placing ethics compliance of the presidential transition process at risk. We encourage the Senate to lift that hold and complete the appointment of fair and impartial leadership of OGE.Sen. Lee declared more than a year ago that he would prefer the appointment of the OGE Director be made after the inauguration of a new administration and has thus placed a Senatorial hold on the appointment of Huitema ever since.*Ethics should never be viewed as a partisan game*. In fact, the Directorship is a five-year term, specifically designed to overlap administrations to minimize the influence of partisan politics. And David Huitema, much like the prior Director Emory Rounds appointed by then-President Trump, has a seasoned career of impartial ethics enforcement. Huitema has long been managing the State Departments ethics program in a fair and prudent manner, without consideration of partisanship. Huitema is precisely suited to be the kind of balanced Director of OGE that ethics requires.One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGEs vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.We strongly encourage the Senate to override the hold of David Huitema as Director of the Office of Government Ethics and allow for the proper enforcement of the ethics process without undue consideration of partisan favoritism.Sincerely,American Federation of Teachers  \\nAmerican Oversight  \\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  \\nColorado Black Women for Political Action  \\nCourt Accountability  \\nAlexander B.

Trump will just fire them.  First we have the Doha agreement which the taliban billed as a surrender, this caused all of the civilian government officials to work with the Taliban for two reasons.  A: The agreement was so lopsided that many legitimately thought the US surrendered.  B: The Taliban will burn your family alive and the US is def leaving.  The troop cutdown to 2500 prevented the US from holding all the key assets, mainly the two airports.  By only holding one airport, it allowed the enemy to focus on a single target and limited the US's ability to move people out of the country.The third key issue was the date.  Biden allowed that date to slip, but as soon as A DATE (any date) was given our alliance partners were ready to pull out.  If Biden had stayed, it would have been JUST the US.  Further, if Biden had stayed the GOP would have taken a pound of flesh every time the war needed anything, and it was a republican war.  Basically had Biden remained, the Democrats would have been out of power permanently, and then the republicans would have staged a withdrawal in 2025 blaming the democrats for the whole fiasco.  IE: The GOP was playing politics with the Afghan war.  This is Benghazi all over again, the republicans setup America to fail and then successfully blamed the democrats.

Well whatever... Trumpism is basically its own religious order. Many of his followers liken him to a God, characterizing him as their prophet or their Savior for Christ's sake, and literally I might add.They elevate him to the status of a deity. His rallies are practically congregations, they superimpose his image over biblical portraits, they fucking pray to him, worship him, and sometimes even buy his overpriced, desecrated bibles.Then there's the whole sports team aspect of it. His followers literally wear his colors, his hats, shoes, t shirts and clothing, or should I say his jerseys that are embroidered with his name and his slogans. Hell, sometimes they even include his number!They plaster their homes, their walls, their vehicles, their businesses, their fucking boats, with Trump flags, banners and bumper stickers, not to mention the occasional cape worn around their necks!They incorporate Trump's face onto the most frighteningly garish and unnatural images of musclebound action heroes and hulking, ripped macho males posing with massive guns and standing in the same kind of postures that athletes and Greek gods are known to make.YES, you're in a cult. Stop this behavior! You're embarrassing the rest of us!Trumpism is a new religious order, making Trump a god in the eyes of his ardent supporters and devotees. The implications of this are dangerous, because as a god, Trump is beyond reproach, infallible, he can do no wrong, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar.This is why Trump is always made out to be the victim by himself and his followers. He's their incorruptible savior and martyr, how can he possibly do anything wrong? He's just the victim of the enemy's oppression.It's always so convenient isn't it?Every election, primary, popular vote he loses must be rigged.Every investigation or effort to try and hold him accountable is a \\"witch hunt!\\" or \\"the weaponization of the justice system!\\"Every unconstitutional threat he makes or autocratic whim he has is merely a \\"joke\\" or being misinterpreted and blown out of proportion by democrats (and any Republicans not concerned about the backlash of course)Every journalist or interviewer that doesn't provide him with softball questions that cater to his delicate sensibilities is \\"cruel,\\" \\"unfair\\" and biased!Every former staff member who chooses to speak out against him, sometimes previously working within the highest levels of government mind you, is always a \\"disgruntled\\" hack, \\"bad at their job,\\" an opportunist, or a vindictive liar.All negative coverage of him is \\"fake news\\"Every indictment or conviction is simply another deep state effort to persecute and undermine him!Every damning fact is a falsehood. When he facilitates a coup, it gets downplayed by his supporters.Every act of right-wing violence, in no small part inspired by Trump and his divisive rhetoric, is a \\"false flag.\\"When he cozies up to dictators and makes allies with brutal autocrats, it's because he's an alpha male strongman.Every time he rambles incoherently, it's \\"the weave\\" and not his dangerously deteriorating mental health.Every failure is blamed on some scapegoatWhen he inherited a growing economy upon entering office, then left office with the economy in tatters, he was not only faultless for x amount of reasons, but it turns out that the next administration is to blame. Every warning about Trump's anti-democratic rhetoric is exaggerated by the fake news, liberal mainstream media.Every grift is an, honest to God, business man's ingenuity at work!Dozens of sexual abuse, harassment and rape allegations are unfounded! All those women must be lying!His felony convictions were the result of a corrupt judge and jury.Every time Trump is embroiled in some scandal, there's always some Democrat conspiracy behind it.Every criticism is discreditableEvery act of adultery, every divorce just shows that he's a normal guy!Everyone else is corrupt!Everyone else is lying!Every fact is false, up is fucking down, wrong is fucking right, hate is love, every dictatorial or fascist impulse, every crime, every act of wrongdoing is rationalized to no end because Donald Trump, literally god's gift to this world, can do no wrong... Because *they* can do no wrong. They worship him, they worship themselves, his victimhood is their victimhood. it's a deranged and dangerous vicarious relationship. Their identities are so wrapped up in their support for him, in their politics, that the two can no longer be separated. Of course they lionize and worship him. They're nothing without him. He, much like a god, has helped vindicate their worst impulses, their hate, their prejudices, their phobias, fears and paranoid delusions.

He said he did, but it was little more than a cover sheet on empty pages.  4) Nothing was set in motion.  No tactical withdrawals, no staging areas, no logistics ships.  Nothing.  There was no way a smooth withdrawal could take place before the deadline.The rest is history.  5) The Trump transition team assured Bidens team that everything was under control.  They lied.  When Biden took office and his team got access to the programs they found dusty desks and cobwebs. 6) Biden hit pause on the withdrawal and got planning teams in motion.  Months after the deadline passed the time bomb went off.  The Afghan army staffing the bases we were at switched sides and the Taliban attacked.  7).

I believed in the science behind vaccines and have even voluntarily taken various of them, but grew suspicious when skeptics were labeled \\"misinformation spreaders\\" instead of being heard. I can understand disagreeing with people who refute gravity. But questioning how a vaccine can be developed so quickly and safely should never be suppressed in a free country, dont you think? Giving corporations and governments unchecked power like that isnt ideal.As for pregnant men, I agree they arent hurting anyone (apart from themselves especially kids who take up surgeries which a large percentage later regret), but my larger points is I dont think those who disagree should be called haters. I'm sorry but that's creating enemies out of nothing. My point was that the left blindly accepts certain subjective realities while censoring sensible questions. If my employer found out about this, I could risk being fired, even though Im not being hateful. Ive always been supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, but its becoming ridiculous that we cant question things without conflict.Not to turn into an RFK defender cos I'm not loyal to a personality but peace and freedom, I also watched an interview of RFK where he defended that story. I absolutely along with an alarmingly increasing rate of people take mainstream media's reports with a grain of salt but he also clarified that the vaccine ban in Samoa was already in place before he got there because a couple kids in Samoa died from a 'bad vaccine'. At same time Tonga was also infected with measles yet nobody died because no one took the vaccine. Again, I'm not a skeptic as I've voluntarily taken various vaccines and come from a pro vaccine family, but people should be allowed to freely talk about these things you would agree? It's not irrational to think multi billionaire medical companies are suddenly in panicking now that we have a questioner coming into office. We're just seeing the beginning of funding of misinformation because they know mainstream media is a huge tool for that. My morals just say that ought to be non judgemental, open, and tolerant of different viewpoints, not just laugh them off as if we have a high ground as that's a very easy approach tonnes of people take these days.","title":"Bill Maher says 'my head's not exploding' over Trump picking RFK Jr. for HHS: 'We do need shaking up'"},{"text":"Certainly a better candidate than Trump.

We as a species are plenty capable of identifying what doesn't work and trying something different based on some educated reasoning. We don't have to treat every moment like it needs economic theory created by philosophers, millenia ago, do we try capitalism our socialism?

Phyllis Schlafly actively courted the fundamentalists and evangelicals for Reagan. This was a means to regain voters after the GOP's unpopular policies on women's rights, civil rights, and president Nixon himself caused them to lose voters in the 1970s.Phyllis Schlafly directly scouted and influenced Jerry Falwell Sr. and other anti abortion groups who infused the church with their desire for political power. Noteworthy is that before the 1970s, churchgoers did not vote as one whole block and were all across the political spectrum. This changed that forever.The overwhelming 1980 Reagan landslide meant that Christianity and politics (including the church's sudden anti abortion and anti LGBTQ stance, issues not on the forefront before) have been inseparable with Christianity since then.Consider that the Bible doesn't castigate abortion explicitly and yet consistently commands believers to help the windowless, orphans, have compassion for others, warn about greed, etc in vivid parables. Not a peep about abortion. Same with LGBTQ being a handful of verses compared to Jesus explicit commands about greed. Which political party should they align with naturally if they didn't have this abortion propaganda?Further reading: \\n*  [Behind the Bastards](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ALI7qlbeSx9WsxYkQ0w6o) August 25, 2020.\\n* The Hulu tv series [Mrs. America](https://www.hulu.com/series/mrs-america-96f330fe-878d-412e-949f-fd8b69b3adf2?dl)\\n* [Schlafly Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Schlafly)","title":"America's Catholic bishops say they will fight Trump's mass deportation of migrants if it becomes reality"},{"text":"Her pronouns are about to be Lose/loser","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 16, 2024"},{"text":"But you felt better, right?

Rounds office similarly **refused to approve a disclosure** from then-Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\\n \\n David Apol, who served as acting OGE director in 2017 when Trump bypassed Finlayson, responded to Health and Human Services Department Secretary Tom Prices resignation following reports he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on private, chartered flights, and several other Trump officials facing allegations of abusing their posts, by **sending a letter** telling the administrations political appointees to act more ethically.

Like other self-interested autocrats, his remedies are designed to exploit problems instead of solving them, and hes surrounded by oligarchs who want to loot the system instead of reforming it. Mass deportation and tariffs are recipes for inflation. Tax cuts and deregulation will exacerbate inequality. America First impulses will fuel global conflict, technological disruption and climate conflagration. Mr. Trump is the new establishment in this country and globally, and we should emphasize that instead of painting him as an outlier or interloper. Out of the wreckage of this election, Democrats must reject the impulse to simply be a resistance that condemns whatever outrageous thing Mr. Trump says. While confronting Mr. Trump when we must, we must also focus on ourselves  what we stand for, and how we tell our story. That means acknowledging  as my Hong Kong interlocutor said  that the narrative of liberalism and democracy collapsed. Instead of defending a system that has been rejected, we need to articulate an alternative vision for what kind of democracy comes next. We should merge our commitment to the moral, social and demographic necessity of an inclusive America with a populist critique of the system that Mr. Trump now runs; a focus more on reform than just redistribution. We must reform the corruption endemic to American capitalism, corporate malfeasance, profiteering in politics, unregulated technologies transforming our lives, an immigration system broken by Washington, the cabal of autocrats pushing the world to the brink of war and climate catastrophe.","title":"I Study Guys Like Trump.

I knew Kamala was going to lose once she was appointed the candidate. She never got my vote in the primaries. Sheesh, she never got anyone's vote in the primaries. That is voter disenfranchisement. The same thing Democrats pushed against when the Republicans have done the same for years. But here they are. That is the pot calling the kettle black. How do you think that made people feel? It only added to the failures they saw in the people up for nomination.Look, just because someone might be on the no Trump train doesn't mean they are on the anyone but Trump train.
