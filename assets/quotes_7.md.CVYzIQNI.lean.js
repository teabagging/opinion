She's going to do what she wants and like what she likes, but I can do things too. Along the way, I found my way to being able to craft my own identity, and took some satisfaction from that. A lot of it was confronting things that I sucked at, not with a goal of becoming excellent at them, but of sucking somewhat less hard. That helped. I think that self-esteem comes basically from two things: Being able to do something well, and being able to tell truth from crap. My father's gentle nudge in that direction helped a lot. There's a whole universe of things you can't do anything at all about, but there's some that you can. Work on those.So I don't think reaching someone who's caught in the incel trap is hopeless.

Women are no longer as dependent on men to be caretakers for them (particularly with financial stability) as they were even 30 years ago. Women receive college degrees at a higher rate and are seeing success in the work force previously unheard of. So, men are required to offer more to entice a woman. The economics of relationships have shifted. There have been times where a career and moderate financial success was enough to attract a partner. Thats no longer always the case. Women can focus on their friends, their careers and even their pets and often be perfectly happy without a sexual partner in their life. In the economy of dating/marriage/sex, woman have found themselves in a position where they can ask more of a partner (and that is not just money) and a lot of men arent meeting that expectation.And most of the men in the Andrew Tate Right Wing Goober Sphere you mention are all about free markets and strong eating the weak, etc. Its not really any different in the world of relationships. You have something to offer, she has something to offer, and you both decide those qualities you offer are equitable and you form a bond. Those qualities arent just looks or money, theyre emotional connections, a good sense of humor, similar views on life, having mutual friendsall of it adds up in what you offer to a potential partner.So, men should stop blaming women, or how women feel, or how theyre being educated, or how cultures have shifted, or any other factors that are the reason they cant find a partner. The reason is probably *you.* There are 8+ billion people on this planet, many connected by the internet. If you cant find a partner youre either looking in the wrong place, looking at the wrong type of partner, or youre not offering enough to be worthy of being chosen as a partner.I say this as a manwe should work on some introspection and asking ourselves what women actually want and need instead of asking why have *they* created this problem and why arent they fixing it?","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Who?","title":"BREAKING: Democratic Rep.

That also means that man can lever financial means against women anymore. They have to be an actual benefit to a woman's life. For that they have to be a good person and by god, a man who thinks he is owed a woman is not a good person. Men are lonely because they fail at being a good human. And instead of working on themselves, challenging their views and examining why they feel like they are owed another human being like a stimulus check, they try to force women to lower their standards of \\"please be a good human and bring something good in my life\\" because they can't be bothered to put in the energy to actually work on themselves.

It would be interesting to see what time period and actions they specifically cover.I ask because as of now it appears that only Gen Milley and Dr. Fauci are the only ones to formally accept the pardons. But according to Burdick v US (1915) accepting the pardon has the following implications:1. Admission of guilt for the offenses (potential) pardoned2. Waiver of 5th Amendment rights against self incrimination because it will not be possible3. May not lose or have constitutional right impaired as punishment. 4. All punishments real (in progress) or potential are commuted. So potentially Gen Milley and Dr. Fauci could be compelled to testify to the items pardoned. And if its broadly worded and dated like Hunters it would be even more of a weapon than a shield. With all that said, I think this will be an unintended gift to this administration as it removes a distraction from their path towards their goals.","title":"Biden Burns Trump One Final Time With Last-Minute Pardons\\n"},{"text":"No but it was a war criminal so I'd see why you'd \\"forget\\" that one.","title":"This is how you know they're guilty--Biden pardons Fauci and others"},{"text":"Tea time!","title":"Inauguration Live Thread"},{"text":"What did they do to commit those crimes?","title":"Biden issues pardons to protect Milley, Fauci, Cheney from Trump retaliation"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/w7v1ggkhy5ee1.jpeg?width=728&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9d87cb318e04b38690e5993c4d5a5c28a8f2f6aMe when Garland gets prosecuted","title":"Biden preemptively pardons Anthony Fauci, Mark Milley and Jan. 6 committee members"},{"text":"lol ?? democrats are pathetic.

Now there is no legal right for Fauci to use the 5th amendment when questioned by Congress and if  lies you can charge him. The greatest thing the democrats did was go after Trump. In my opinion going after Democrats and having long investigations and trials would have sucked the energy out of getting things done. On top of that the Democrats will never be able to live down the shame of something they claimed 4 years ago amounted to admissions of guilt.

Directly aiming at happiness itself isnt a good way to achieve happiness, **doing** things that have as secondary result of making you happy , is.

Work, Clubs , volunteering, exercise, social hobbies - till you find ones you enjoy and *through which you meet other people*. With the attitude of enjoying the activity and meeting lots of different people who you might find commonalities with rather than doing it because you are looking for someone to have sex with. Im sure Im not the best example , but as an older (retired) man who ended up after many years of being in a relationship I ended up on my own in a different part of the country - I reconnected with family, chatted to people while walking the dog, joined a badminton club, volunteered at the local library and charity shop, started a pub quiz team , ended up helping a local,charity start a second hand book shop. Not specifically focussed on looking for sexual companionship just getting out and about meeting people who I now regularly go to the pub or meals etc with. In other words get off the internet ( except as it can be helpful with the following) and get out into the real world thinking about how you can stay active, meet and even help others rather than focussing on yourself or on how women have done you wrong. Maybe by doing so ,even though its not necessarily what you are aiming at , it might end up helping you building relationships and being happier?","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Maybe he can write a few checks out of the church funds to cover their care.","title":"Pope Francis condemns Trumps alleged plans to deport illegal immigrants.

They reject help at every turn. They scoff at advice to get themselves out there, they talk down to people for giving them socialising tips, they're so far into the rabbit hole of isolation that the mere notion of talking to people outside seems ridiculous to them. I've been there, I've talked to incels asking for advice and all you get back is \\"that's stupid, fuck you, pity me.\\" They're addicted to victimhood and self-pity, and they're stuck in a quick-fix mindset where they think one thing (mainly getting laid) will just magically solve all their problems overnight when it won't. And that's coming from someone who used to think that, did get laid, and it didn't transform me for the better. Incels just don't want to do the work.2. They radicalise themselves. Extended periods of isolation in any situation will eventually drive a person crazy, so incels don't have the most rational thinking to begin with. Then they start going online and reaffirming their crazy ideas with each other for why it's the world's fault for isolating them, why women are the problem for not just letting them fuck them, why they are somehow not the key factor in their poor circumstances. Elliot Rodger practically started the incel movement because other online loners idolised him, so it's not a stretch of the imagination to assume other incels will reaffirm each other's misery with the least self-aware bullshit imaginable.I agree that a lot of incels can be helped, a lot of them are just in shit circumstances and they might need a few helping hands out of that mindset, but there's only so far you can go. As they say with drug addicts, to get clean they actually have to *want* to quit. Incels have to be open to at least trying to change their circumstances, because their priorities often lie in getting addicted to self-pity online rather than taking the necessary steps for a better life.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"All of these people should be investigated and if found culpable it will at least become a part of history that they allegedly committed crimes that a president , a protected criminal himself pardoned them from.

I am not into typical manly things like eg cars or the gym (actually hate the gym, i prefer to run, ride a bike or workout at home). Id even go as far as saying i like rather traditionally \\"un-manly\\" things like reading, cooking, cleaning my flat, writing poetry, paint and whatnot. I am not rich (maths, econ and law college student) and am not some 6'5 trust fund baby (barely pushing 6'0, prop 5'10). I am not exactly a model either (been told i look like rege jean page, which i can only laugh at tbh). Hell i even sometimes cry when watching sad movies or animal videos. Point being, ive never had any issue going on dates; never had issues getting matches on apps. And yet ive still felt lonely at time.The gripe i have with posts like this is, that many men view relationships and subsequently women as the cure to their loneliness, in turn almost relegating women to a passive object, a means to and end if you will. Not only does this miss the issue, since you could just as much pursue male friends and connections, it also sabotages any potential relationship, because when loneliness is the foundation, it inevitably leads to envy and controlling behavior which turns toxic sooner than later. In other words, guys need to learn to deal with their dependency issues. Stop looking towards women to solve their issues and just work on themselves.The dating \\"market\\" is a constant battle against competing actors that are inherently unequal in terms of attractiveness, wage, age, social class etc.That is just not true unless you live in some ultra conservative region where arranged marriages are still a thing.This just leads to those not in relationships to view themselves as losers.Thats a YOU problem tho, if you define yourself based on having a - ANY - GF, then thats your issue to work out.I see posts/rants by women all the time that the depressed lonely men of my generation are just Andrew Tate watching, Steak and Egg chopping board eating incels who demonise women and blame them for the lonelinessBecause thats the truth.\\nI grew up with more girl friends than male friends, and thus indirectly experienced their dating history through them. The amount of dudes who are absolute creeps and weirdos... normal guys simply dont understand how dangerous and often vile and hostile the internet is towards women. Making fun of anyone who struggles with something is never the answer, but when these people project their own issues onto others, mostly women, and attack them bc of it, then yes, i will call them out on their bs.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Right, I'm sure that's all it is ?","title":"Fauci Pardoned"},{"text":"Yeah, thats a good point.

I've tried to have meaningful friendships with men, but it always devolves into sex. They claim they are 'friendzoned' if we refuse, *as if friendship isn't enough for them.*So many men expect women to solve their loneliness crisis, when they should look to each other, and treat women like full human beings, not just potential hook-ups, bang maids or at best, mothers to potential children. Women form meaningful relationships with each other, and offer each other emotional support, why can't men do the same? If you want female friends, BE a better friend. You get what you give in this life. The 'friendzone' is a good place, unless you weren't looking for that in the first place, and only came in with false pretenses.Finally, men are dangerous, and women are right to be wary of them.

Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential revenge by the incoming Trump administration.The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense, Biden said in a statement. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.The pardons, announced with just hours left in his presidency, have been the subject of heated debate for months at the highest levels of the White House. Its customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to Americans who have been convicted of crimes.

In China the CCP works closely with ByteDance to monitor the app's content. There was this incident for instance where ByteDance was forced to remove two of its apps for hosting content not in line with those values, and the CEO had to publicly issue a letter apologising for the vulgar and improper content.

For example, do we have evidence the algorithm of certain apps like youtube, Facebook, twitter, TikTok etc are being manipulated to show more radical/inflammatory content? I just read in another sub a comment that claimed TikTok pushes educative content to Chinese users, and nonsense to foreigners. I am wondering how much the effect of culture impacts the use of these apps and therefore the content consumed, which in turn impacts the content proposed by an algorithm. For example, an algorithm that proposes posts based on how many times they are shared would not be explicitly malicious, but might end up pushing more shocking content to an userbase that shares more shocking news, as opposed to one that finds not tasteful to, say, talk about disgraces. If you think algorithms should be regulated, what is your opinion on cases like these? What would desirable algorithm regulations look like?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Okay, now lets get you to bingo, Ill even get you some apple sauce","title":"Biden warns in farewell address that 'oligarchy' of ultrarich in US threatens future of democracy"},{"text":"Wasnt the time this happened before related to the leaks from Bibi's office or am i mistaking it for something else?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You've never been to Camden, I see","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS THE POWER TO STOP THIS.

The systemic, parasitic concentration of wealth, and therefore power, into the hands of fewer and fewer people. Who attempt, and view society, as something separate from themselves. Below them, despite it being the host of which they feed from.

If federal reserve banks raised interest rates like that overnight it would cause a crash like you've never seen before.Even profitable companies run on debt -- especially in the era where interest rates were so low. Corporations were literally borrowing money to buy their own stock, and all kinds of weird investment shenanigans because debt could be taken on at an incredibly low interest rate.But a lot of companies were running payroll on borrowed money. Again, even profitable ones.If interest rates went up like that it would cause a massive recession. A chain reaction. Businesses wouldn't have payroll and would close. Employees would be broke and couldn't pay their bills. Supply lines would dry up even further so people with money would face even higher inflation.But most importantly (for their economic class) -- it would be a risk.By injecting so much money into the economy while simultaneously raising interest rates --- it smooths out the economic crisis. Not for our benefit, but for theirs. It protects their investments.Remember, inflation didn't hurt them the way it hurt us. The wealth class doubled, tripled, and quadrupled their money during that time.Look at March 2020 when the stock market dropped nearly in half --- and then almost immediately recovered. Working people like us took those losses. People with inside information -- like in the house &amp; senate -- doubled their money.And remember, their campaigns are financed by people with a lot of money... Do you think they told their financiers what was going on? OF COURSE.So THEY all made enormous money during this process...And for us -- I don't know about you but I have 4 kids and I got THOUSANDS of dollars. It seemed incredible, except I know enough about economics to realize even then that it wasn't a good thing. That I would pay more with inflation.That money we got was temporary... But this inflation is with us forever.Anyhow, the short version is --- they did it that way to protect their own investments and maintain relative stability during their reset.I'm not defending them even for a moment --- they are parasites --- but I do have to admit it wasn't as bad as going through something like The Great Depression.Anyhow, does that make sense? Sorry I'm so verbose, but that's the answer. If they just raised interest rates withOUT injecting trillions into the economy it would have caused an economic collapse like we haven't experienced in our lifetimes... We would suffer. And they would lose their investments as well.So they did it in a way that was just mildly painful for us and doubled, tripled, and quadrupled their wealth.ughMeanwhile, 99.9% of people think it was all about a virus! Nope.","title":"Biden's farewell speech was quite ominous."},{"text":"And he literally signed over another weapons package to Israel too right? Like yesterday or today? While California burns.

Im saying that *voting* is the means, and the *end* to that means is policy. The legislator is just an intermediary tool between you and the enactment of law. In an ideal world we would have direct democracy and the legislator wouldnt even be necessary. Is it nice when a legislator is a voice of moral clarity? Sure, its nice when your neighbor or a your mail carrier is a voice of moral clarity too. Is it yucky when legislators are hypocrites? Yes, likewise if your car mechanic or doctor is. Can a legislators character serve as a proxy to indicate how they will cast votes and craft legislation? Maybe, sometimes. But the proof will be in the pudding. Just as with celebrities and other public personas, people develop illusory parasocial relationships with high profile politicians. But we dont really know these people, or what motivates them, or how sincere or Machiavellian they are. We cant. They have to develop an image and a persona that appeals to the broadest swathe of people possible to campaign and win votes. And my argument is at the end of the day, their private life and personal character isnt my concern, any more than the private life of my taxicab driver or bank teller is my concern.On one hand you advocate for harm reduction by voting for the lesser of two evils, but on the other hand you say its wrong to knowingly vote for an evil person. But thats what voting for the lesser evil is, definitionally. This line of reasoning leads to cop-out purity voting, in the form of nonviable third party votes or in the form of abstaining (do you advocate for this if both major party candidates are known to be evil?) This sort of performative virtue signal voting reminds me of Mathew 6:5And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others.

Are you talking about their personal actions in their personal lives, or how they legislate? When it comes to legislation, I appreciate it when religious believers don't insist on having their religious rules enforced by law for everyone.E.g. while people of some Christian denominations may not personally support it when their neighbors, coworkers etc. get married to a partner of the same sex, they should ideally still not be against politicians legislating for same-sex civil marriage equality, because not everyone in society is a member of that denomination.While in a strict interpretation, the politician's efforts are contradicting the Christian person's values, the overriding idea is that we are living in a pluralistic society, and as such laws should not be based solely on the moral teachings of a single (religious) tradition.","title":"CMV: Christians Should Hold Politicians to the Same Moral Standards as Everyone Else"},{"text":"Who supports what in congress is utterly irrelevant when it comes to public perception.

The subs that stayed online had basically no change in overall activity. The api changes affected maybe 5-10% of user.

The Republican platform to them are no different than Jesus' teachings and in some ways have overtaken them as \\"true\\" Christianity ie [Beatitudes are woke](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/jan/08/faith-and-values-the-beatitudes-have-become-a-divi/).  You challenge their hypocrisy in idolizing and supporting people like Trump who are antithetical to Jesus, and rightly so, but I would argue that their hypocrisy reveals their true held beliefs rather than the professed beliefs. Which in my opinion are mostly nominal.  A more charitable interpretation is that generally people's beliefs are not functions of carefully selected ideas and principles to create a cohesive worldview, but rather signals of social belonging and cohesion. It's a way to belong to a tribe and to feel good about professing similar values. If you take your typical evangelical and removed Trump or the GOP's label from the behavior, they would most likely condemn the immoral behavior. But to condemn Trump or their GOP leader with the label, is to essentially reject the tribe with which they feel they belong to and since people are social creatures, rejecting or being rejected by your community and social network has an incredibly high cost. Most people would rather change their beliefs than change their community.","title":"CMV: Christians Should Hold Politicians to the Same Moral Standards as Everyone Else"},{"text":"This is a bullshit response.

Trump can, and does, break every promise but they always give him a pass because they don't care about governance or policy either. I hope the Keystone XL pipeline does get approvedOf course you do. There is an impact to transporting 830,000 barrels of Alberta tar sands oil per day though. Oil which is high in bitumen and corrosive and increases the chances of leaks three fold. Leaks which are hard to detect, cleanup, and which sink into the water table. All for tar sand oil which emits up to 20% more carbon than other types of crude. And this oil was not for the US. It was to be refined in US refineries but then most of it was to be exported. There's no growth in US oil consumption which is no different today than it was in 2005 at 20m b/day so that oil was not needed in the US and why it would mostly be exported.Plus the project was only expected to add [35 full time jobs](https://democrats-naturalresources.house.gov/news/in-the-news/the-keystone-pipeline-will-create-just-35-permanent-jobs-dont-believe-the-lies) post construction which ruins that argument.

It was fought against the entire Arab League, who were allied with the Palestinian militias. It was basically a convergence of two opposing ideologies: Zionism (the desire for Jews to establish a country in their ancestral homeland) and pan-Arabism (a cultural movement headed by Nasser that advocated for the unification of all Arab people into a single state spanning the Middle East and North Africa). The Palestinian flag is quite literally the pan Arab flag. This is also why Palestine, Jordan, Sudan, UAE, Kuwait, etc have virtually identical flags and why these countries were so opposed to Kurdistan as well as Israel. Israels war of independence is called the Israel Arab war instead of the Israel Palestinian war since it was a war against the jews living in israel and the entire Arab League. After israel won the war, the Jews expelled Arabs from the territories it won (the Nakba) and the Arabs expelled Jews from the territories it won including the West Bank/gaza as well as most other Arab league counties (Saudis Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, etc). These Jews mostly went to israel (mostly on foot), though a small number of the richer Libyan and Moroccan Jews were able to go to Italy and France. The Palestinians expelled from Jewish lands went to the West Bank, Gaza, egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc. Most of these countries other than Jordan refused to grant Palestinians citizenships (Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc) with the hope that someday theyd leave and kick out the Jews who took their place in what is now israel. Should be noted that the majority of Israelis (something like 60%) descend from the Jews kicked out of Arab territories so there is no way they are leaving.  As to countries offering to repatriate their Jews, obviously no sane middle eastern Jew would dare to move back to any middle eastern country (other than the UAE) because of how insanely pervasive antisemitism is there. Most of them were persecuted through pogroms and as dhimmis before Israels creation. This isnt to justify the Nakba, it is simply acknowledging that the clash between pan Arabism and Zionism led to the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of both Palestinians and middle eastern Jews, which is what I think OP is trying to say.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Republicans have successfully run on a \\"populist\\" platform, but what we've been seeing in these months leading up to Trump's inauguration alone, is how this MAGA coalition epitomizes *the opposite* of some grassroots, \\"of the people\\" populism movement.For one, Trump's next administration is already estimated to be the richest in US history. Trump is filling his cabinet with ultra-wealthy loyalists, conservative tech and finance  \\"bros,\\" and corporate stooges backed by special interests, dark money organizations, conservative \\"think tanks\\" and advocacy groups, right wing power brokers, among other nefarious entities.These are people and organizations that have been using their wealth, immense power and influence to affect policy, to facilitate Trump's rise to power, to elevate MAGA extremists, and in some cases, to pave their own entryway into politics.In exchange for positions of power within Trump's new administration, these MAGA benefactors contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's campaign, while organizing election influence efforts of their own, and laying the groundwork for enacting a far right agenda that serves the needs of the few at the expense of many.Some of these people have the audacity to call themselves \\"outsiders,\\" but they are only outsiders in the sense that they've been infecting and inserting themselves into our politics from the \\"outside\\" for so many years.For all of their complaining and accusations against Democrats for being in \\"cahoots\\" with big tech and the media, Trump supporters are silent while he meets behind closed doors with billionaires, tech and news media moguls, social media owners, power brokers and the operators of some of the most massive corporations in the world.Trump is now working closely with some of these rich, soon to be oligarchs, to make sure they are in lockstep with his next administration.Trump has single handedly propped up Elon Musk to become one of the world's most high-profile political agitators. Trump has even offered Musk a director spot within a completely made up government agency that Musk himself campaigned for on his own platform. And all he had to do in exchange for it, was toss Trump a couple hundred mil, and transform Twitter into a hotbed of MAGA propaganda and misinformation.With the backing of these bankrollers, plutocrats, political organizations, special interest groups, opportunists, wealthy handlers and so on, the Republican party will have the best chance they've had in decades to consolidate power for the foreseeable future while setting up a system of one party rule. And a system that will afford them the power to enact a far right agenda through Trump.Many of Trump's former and new allies will be taking advantage of their positions, and exploiting Trump along the way, to implement a far right, authoritarian agenda that focuses as much power as possible in the hands of the executive, while restructuring the government in a way that best serves their party, their ideology and their own self-interests.They will take actions to erode the independence of most government agencies, especially regulatory agencies, putting the administrative state under their direct control. They will strip civil servants of their protections, and either cleanse these agencies of all non-partisan staff who will not pledge their allegiance to Trump and the MAGA movement, or they may take steps to eliminate these agencies altogether.Republicans will also do their damnedest to follow through on the number of unconstitutional threats they've made against their political adversaries, their naysayers in the media, judges, journalists and congressmen, anyone who has ever tried to hold Trump accountable, anyone who participated in \\"stealing\\" the 2020 election from Trump, hell, anyone who has ever hurt Trump's precious feelings for that matter.There's also no doubt that Republicans will attempt to challenge all kinds of legal precedents and legislative accomplishments that have gone a long way in protecting civil rights, expanding voting access, and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of marginalized groups.What's more, there will be a concerted effort that attempts to establish a Christian nationalist code and rule of law for this country.","title":"Biden warns of dangerous threat of new age of robber barons in farewell presidential address"},{"text":"Trump rhetoric isnt anti war, they just selectively listen to him.

A little rule of thumb to use: if theyre a Christian and practice Christianity well, look up to them, and give all the grace you can to any weakness they have (dont forget other Christian duties though). If theyre not a Christian, then dont defend their actions, even if you think theyre right in a way, theyre not doing the right thing for a reason outside of their own gain. Instead, if you cant reach the person directly, distance yourself from that role model and go over what they ARE right about from a Christian perspective (Tucker Carlson, Oprah, etc. are NOT good role models under this, even if you like a couple of their views on things)\\nNow to your point. I agree with you in principle, but disagree with where the conclusion leads us. While holding our politicians to a higher standard is always a good thing, it carries no actual weight except to stir up our self righteousness and lay back and let things happen. Things dont actually change if we just yell at them and tell each other he needs to do better. If you want real change, you will have to BE the change, which means potentially setting aside your life to help others. Sacrificial? Yes. Completely withing the Christian playbook? Also yes. One thing Ive considered recently is advocating for my county to switch to approval voting, and then see if its possible to get a few neighboring counties to join in. Might push my state to try something new. Wont expect approval voting to break up the lesser evil system unless it goes national, but theres no better way to start than to start from the bottom.","title":"CMV: Christians Should Hold Politicians to the Same Moral Standards as Everyone Else"},{"text":"The incompetence begins.

But the law really isn't the important thing in this case.The longer answer is that it's selection bias of stable societies sticking around. Monogamous mating makes for a stable society while polygamous mating, without strong mitigating factors, makes for an unstable society. The instability comes from the fact that humans have an approximately 50/50 sex ratio, so in polygamy a bunch of men won't have any serious mating prospects. They're typically young and when the situation becomes clear, extremely angry. Historically the excess of young men have been killed in wars and fighting, or shunned/excommunicated from their home society into the larger world (Mormons and some Islamic states), while the _de facto_ polygamy was also restricted to the extremely rich. Today with stable monogamous relationships at arguably an all time low in western culture, but not primarily because of polygamy. Instead we have a sort of serial monogamy where the cliche is that many monogamous couples divorce, the man often remarries a younger woman while the older woman often single. The result is still a lot of sexually disenfranchised younger men. These single men are sedating themselves with porn and modern weapons grade home entertainment (largely video games), though that has been much less effective at avoiding societal instability. Ultimately in any society where women have the nominal right to decide whom they marry or sleep with, it's up to women's collective choice of cultural norms whether we get a stable monogamous society, or an unstable polygamous society that self deletes. Unfortunately any significant minority of women can spoil it for the rest if they choose to share popular men, or to swear off the available men altogether. Because even if most women remain monogamous, we may still have enough disenfranchised men to cause significant problems.This doesn't _have to_ be accomplished through law, and as libertarians we view the law as a bad way to try. But it does have to be done somehow, so on the spectrum of bad things government does it's pretty low priority to legalize it. Aside from law, it's usually been some combination of women shaming other women if they aren't relatively chaste, low social status for sex workers and sluts, severe reputation or legal penalties for adultery etc.","title":"Why Is Polygamy Prohibited in Liberal Countries?"},{"text":"Childish arseholes.

So obviously those are promises we cannot make on behalf of the United States for any longer than the next five days. And so its critical that all of the parties to the agreement and the other mediators see that when the United States is in the room making commitments, those are lasting commitments that extend beyond this administration into the next one.I C let me C I will just say lastly I dont know if its unprecedented to have envoys from an outgoing and an incoming administration sitting at the same table negotiating a ceasefire agreement of this kind, but if its not unprecedented, its certainly unusual, and we of course thank the Trump team for working with this, on this ceasefire agreement.

A release into the public sphere would result in the pathogen acquiring a \\"bioweapon\\" status.It isn't as though the researchers *weren't* building a bioweapon.

Now, one would have to question how it is that we have a military that can recognize dual use research before it happens, and fails to recognize dual use research gone awry after the accident, showing symptoms such as the Chinese military building hospitals overnight and a pathogen with extreme contagiousness spreading rapidly overnight.

October 7th made it worse as it undermined the issue which he had the highest credibility in among the voting public, security. If he were to resign during the period, he would have been deposed and probably jailed. One simply has to look at opinion polls at that time, Likud would have been wiped out.Cynically, the conflict bought him time. He used it as an opportunity to rebuild his political popularity while also dividing and conquering his political opponents. Important to note that he had a thin 64 seat majority (61 needed to form a government). I group them as such: Internal Likud Opposition: Notably the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who broke with Netanyahu during the judicial reform crisis right before Oct 7th Hard-Right: Notably Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. While Netanyahu is no doubt a right-wing leader, even he realizes that Ben-Gvir and Somtrich are too extreme to be long term partners. However, he needed them as they were some of the only people willing to work with him to enact judicial reforms and keep him out of jail. Anti-Netanyahu Conservatives: Notably, Gantz, Lieberman and Sa'ar. All three formerly served in Netanyahu's government and share a similar political orientation as Netanyahu except for the fact they all personally see him as being arrogant, corrupt and tyrannical and refuse to work with him. International forces: Notably Biden in the US, along with other world leaders.Over the last year and a half, he has masterfully dealt with all of these forces while the world is focused on the conflict. He first convinced the bulk of the anti-Netanyahu conservatives to join him (Gantz and his National Unity alliance) which weakened the opposition. Although Gantz later left, Sa'ar and his party stayed giving Netanyahu the numbers to start punishing his internal opponents. Gallant was fired as defense minister. He waited long enough for his ally Donald Trump to be elected as President of the United States giving him additional leverage. Using the combination of extra seats (from Sa'ar), Trump's pressure and his recovering poll numbers allowed him to force Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to accept any type of Gaza ceasefire deal.You might see this as evil, but there is a reason why Netanyahu is the longest surviving PM in Israeli history. He is a ruthless political animal.","title":"Biden announces Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal"},{"text":"The Republicans do everything to help the oligarchy, then democrats do nothing to upset them.","title":"Biden warns oligarchy and ultra wealthy pose a threat to democracy itself"},{"text":"She aint wrong.
