Basically, you have to support every little aspect of x group, x cause, etc, or you will be labeled as homophobic, xenophobic, whateverphobic. A theoretical example would be: I support the LGBT+ community but I am against having children, anyone below 18, being on hormones or having any gender affirming surgery. This person would be labeled by a LOUD few as transphobic, homophobic, etc. I understand this is a small portion of the overall population but, nevertheless, is an issue that people are talking about. 2) The absolute shit dragging through the mud that anyone who voted for and or considered voting for Trump. This was noticeably happening more significantly in my life in about September. The better than them mentality really irked me and then people in my life.

Many were minorities as well AND STILL voted for Trump. Thats why I said I agreed with parts of what the other poster said. Democrats should have treated the LGBT community like the plague because trans rights are now attached to LGBT rights. Of course republicans were going to throw the previous interviews saying showing support for trans Americans on every screen. Most Americans are very conflicted on trans rights.

They ruled state courts aren't allowed to rule on partisan gerrymandering cases.**That 2023 ruling allowed Republicans to flip three of North Carolina's seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2024 elections  in which Republicans won a 220-215 majority in the U.S. House.

That...is exactly what Denmark has said it will do in response.  Not spending more to prep for an American invasion, but to take greater responsibility for arctic security.If Trump decided to attack territory of such a nationI mean...the big problem here would be that he wouldn't be able to get Congressional authorization.  We've become accustomed to Presidents kind of doing what they want in certain areas of the world under the 2001 AUMF, but there's just no way you can use that on *Greenland.*So to make it happen, Trump would have to ask Congress and Congress isn't likely to approve an invasion of Greenland.If Denmark decided to try to defend Greenland and internet would get flooded with imagery of US forces destroying Danish troops, who are merely defending their border, I don't believe that even the hardline Republican party members would be able to stomach it.Frankly, if this happened - and I don't think it will - it would more likely take a page from the Russian Gray Zone warfare playbook.  No airstrikes or anything like that.  Just a bunch of planes landing and all of a sudden guys in uniforms walking around everywhere.

Yeah, there are \\"averages,\\" but the data is not conclusive that this is owing to \\"genetic differences\\" rather than differences in the age at which cis men start training versus cis women, opportunities, funding (think being able to train more often because of sponsorship instead of having to work part-time on top of training), etc. In fact, AGAIN, some cis women perform at a level in soccer that is higher than some cis men, which raises the question of why those specific cis women can't compete with/against the cis men. Oh, right. \\"Averages.\\" Your incessant droning about averages is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. Which, again, in case I'm not being \\"coherent\\" enough, is the point.Edit: Oh, yeah. Queer folks are well known for creating all-gender softball games/leagues where anyone of any gender can play.

In his sleazy used car salesman mind, he is doing what's called anchoring. His initial bid (this time) is \\"I could just take Greenland and pay you $0.\\" This makes any subsequent bids seem reasonable and attractive by comparison.Second, if in some fantasy scenario Trump did want to invade, I have to think Trump's own cabinet would invoke the 25th amendment and remove him from office.However, if we're persisting with the idea that this is a possibility and the US did invade, we have to factor in the ability of Twitter, Fox News, and other platforms to spew misinformation and yellow journalism. Unfortunately, I believe that most of the people who voted Trump into office could be made to support an invasion like that. Especially if, say, Ukraine falls and Trump has a split with Putin and declares that Greenland is absolutely vital to our security and that they are not working with us. Greenland is pursuing it's own sovereignty, but it is strategically important for it's control of waterways and it's rare minerals; they don't realize that they need protection. If the US doesn't step in to protect it, it will be next on Putin's hit list. Then the Russians will have missiles right next door and we will have no idea whether there are nuclear-armed Russian subs within striking distance of New York.See how easily the narrative writes itself?America's relationship with Denmark is fantastic, and many Americans appreciate it, but the majority only have the foggiest notion of it. Our Republican congressmen sat on their hands and even protected Trump after he tried to overturn an election; are they going to stick their necks out for Greenland or Denmark? So while half of the nation would be outraged and many Americans would even be radicalized against the government, I don't know that it would be enough to immediately force the collapse of the government.But like I said, it would never happen. Trump, as much as I hate him, is notoriously anti-war.

The Democratic Party has to account for that in their future campaigns.The Right Wing can run idiots, ogres or others from the bottom of the barrel and continue to give them their solid 30% support even if they have a track record of failure.  Examples are GWB, Trump, Reagan, Ted Cruz and in Canada Rob and Doug Ford.  And then there's Berlusconi.  Their standards and expectations are low to non-existent.But everybody else has to be more perfect than God to maintain their support from their own.  Obama's expectations were so high, he got the Nobel Peace Prize.  But a lot of Democrats were disappointed with Obama because he watered down the ACA and didn't push the fight on climate change hard enough.  He won his second term but barely.Between Harris and Trump, specific groups like Latinos and Arabs are measuring Harris by a different standard they are not giving Trump.People continue to be worried about the economy under the Democrats even though the historical record shows the past 10 recessions started under Republican Presidents.  The latest Democrat was Carter.Even when they agree with Harris' position on many things like climate change and abortion rights, they can't support her because of her non- commitment against genocide.  You can't argue with that. Paraphrasing  from interviews, Harris had to earn to votes from democrat supporters.  But Trump is not subject to the same judgement.  Trump doesn't need to earn anybody's vote.  He's got the Republican vote locked-in regardless of his track record of failures.Meanwhile, Trump gets a pass because they think the institutional checks and balances will keep Trump from becoming a dictator.  (Haven't history taught them anything about that?) They disregard his past actions of stacking the Supreme Court and appointing judges who are loyal to him personally.  Those two alone are why he has survived and gone so far in this election.  And if elected, he'll go further for which his supporters will continue to be in denial.But talk of Harris stacking the Supreme Court, the argument against that is that it would set a bad precedent for each successive President to keep doing.And interviews with voters the day after, it's the same things: the economy, not speaking to/ resonating with common people.Post- mortum analysis says the Democrats disregarded the situation of normal people.  Huh?  I thought I heard Harris address that many times.

I hate doing this but I'd like to try and draw a similarity between what happened in DBH and the world we live in today.  The reason I hate doing this is because no matter what I can't draw an exact example, but I hope you'll give me some leeway.Let's say that in a few years just about everyone is driving an automated vehicle.  Then some event happens where these vehicles gain some sort of consciousness and start making decisions nobody can explain.  Fill in the blank I suppose as to what those decisions are, but they result in some deaths and the destruction of every automated vehicle.Now, in this scenario, what can you imagine happens next?  What I imagine is that people need to get compensated for the deaths as well as failures of their vehicles.  How much will this cost the company?  Well, given that a sizable amount of families had them let's say they held half the car market so about 120 million vehicles in the US alone.  Say the average cost is $20k.  That amounts to $2.4 trillion dollars in compensations required just in the US.  Take that globally like CyberLife was.  Let's not even talk about the loss of confidence in automated vehicles in general, how could a company pay for this?  They simply couldn't.  They'd go into bankruptcy and disappear forever.In the Kamski ending, all the same things apply.  CyberLife had an issue that required the decommissioning of all androids for civilians, companies, and nation states.  The cost of compensation would be mindboggling, but the game doesn't address that.  The legal problems beyond that are just as bad given broken contracts and death/destruction caused to property and lives.  Yet another issue is loss in faith and even worse in this scenario is that the entire global economy WILL collapse due to the loss of workforces which doesn't happen in the automated car scenario.  Also, do you really think you're getting back into an automated vehicle soon after they all gained consciousness mysteriously even if the company says they fixed the issue?  No chance, at least for those who value their own lives.  The android market is dead for years after what happened in DBH if we're trying to stay realistic.Try and give me a realistic write up for what would have happened in the Kamski ending that somehow results in the ending shown by DBH.  The only way it works is if the company somehow avoids all financial and legal liability and despite being utterly screwed over by CyberLife people still immediately return to trusting them.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"Hollywood and all of socal is always on fire bruh.

Democrats (of which I consider myself one) clearly can beat someone like Trump - it literally just happened one election cycle ago, so that isnt the problem that needs to be figured out. What seems more accurate to me is that people in both parties tend to be dismissive of the sincerity of the opposition party. In some cases, thats an effective strategy as it isnt completely wrong, but in other cases, it can lead to parties becoming dismissive of ideas that they should not be. This isnt a Democrat or Republican thing, imho. The Democratic Party needs to tap into the motivation for supporting someone like Trump and understand that for their own politics (like you note with Bernie and his stronger union and workers rhetoric).  There should also somewhat obviously be a more established wing of the Republican Party that is supportive of more mainstream abortion laws as a libertarian principle (vs a religious belief about the nature of life and the soul).So - I dont think the issue here is about blame (thats just venting and human nature) nor is it about an inability to win (which is demonstrably false).  It is about adapting and updating platforms and positions as the electorate realigns (which has been happening for many years). I think this likely would have played out more prominently this cycle if the process hadnt been disrupted by Biden running as the presumptive favorite right up until the last minute, eliminating the ability to have a more natural debate in the party about these issues. That isnt a structural flaw in the party overall - it was just an unusual set of circumstances that we most certainly will not see repeated in the next cycle.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"But hey at least the price of eggs is going down","title":"California is burning.

None seem to want to say exactly what he was charged with and ask the people how they would feel if it was their mother, wife, girlfriend, or child that had this happen to them.

Say Connor ends up becoming the president of the country after the events of DBH.  That seems as unlikely of an event as him begin decommissioned and poses the question of whether we should make an unfeeling robot president.  Now, is that a good ending as far as writing goes?  Not really, because it makes no sense.  What events led to him becoming president?  Why would a population of people who just got betrayed by androids make one president?The problem with the scenario is that even if I did want to make the player think about a certain question, they aren't actually going to do it because the situation I setup trying to pose the question is so out of left field that they'll end up thinking about that more than the question itself.That's what would be happening here as well.  It makes no sense to decommission Connor so I don't spend time thinking about that and instead wonder who exactly thinks it makes sense that they would decommission him.Also I'll point out that there are multiple times in this story where we get to ask ourselves personal and moral questions.  We find out Alice is an android so how do we feel about her now that we know she isn't human?  Chloe asks to be set free.  Should we do that?  Even in chapter 1 we can sacrifice Connor to save the child.  Is that acceptable especially when you play it through a second time and may believe Connor is far more than just an android even if he hasn't made that transition yet in the game by chapter 1.The writer knows how to pose these sorts of questions in ways that fit the game.  That isn't at all what is happening in Connor's bad ending, at least in my opinion.  If that is what they are trying then they failed badly and since this game is so well written I'm not really going to entertain that is what they were going for here.  What they did with Connor's bad ending was very intentional.  It was intended to make the player not like this ending and want to go towards one where Connor becomes deviant.  There is ample reason to think this is the case as well since the writing is very heavy handed at times trying to push the player towards making the androids deviant.  I could list them extensively but Hank might be the best example.  He doesn't even like androids but every time Connor does anything that doesn't align with making himself deviant he'll get criticized by Hank for it.  Heck, I killed the Traci's on my first playthrough because I thought Hank would approve of it only to get shouted down.  The Traci's literally killed a person and attacked myself and Hank.  I was desperately trying to keep us both alive when the Traci charged me and I had to shoot her.  Hank then decries what I did because I'm such a heartless machine even though in my mind I was trying to save his life from a known killer and an android that is still actively trying to attack us.I do wish the game had been written more realistically for when you want to keep Connor a machine, but the writing just doesn't want you to go that direction.  I don't mind so much Hank's reaction in the Traci scene as I do the ending though since that really is the final word you get in the game.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"I really hope the Democrats will learn their lesson on bending over backwards to union interests.Union pork is one big reason why not a single wire of rural broadband has been actually laid down, 3 years after the bipartisan infrastructure bill was signed into law.

Villifying and isolating the actual New Deal and working class orientated Democrats that comprised the coalition that once gave Democrats a nearly 60 year permenent congressional majority.They spent a decade trying to force Hillary as the nominee, then it was Biden. Who they then went on to continue propping up despite poll after poll indicating he should step down.  Then when he did did the Democrats try and do a brokered convention or a mini primary? No, they immediately said they knew best, pushed Harris out front. Moved over all the establishment friendly staff, sought the blessing of donors than told their voters it has to be this way and we know best, don't question it.When a surrogate is being really honest they will admit to this but say that it is the right of a party to do this. Which is true, but 1.) in a two party system you are admitting that democracy in America is even more of an illusion than it already is and 2.) they absolutely suck at it.Obama was the only one that managed to break through and ultimately part of that was because he was always establishment friendly. Had Hillary gotten through in 08 like was attempted by the party leadership I have zero doubt that McCain would have won that election. When the establishment and Obama(who was then kingmaker and making all the same mistakes) told Biden to sit it out and the DNC cleared the field for Hillary then gaslit Bernie to primary voters as \\"unelectable\\" they did lose and gave us Trump.I am not a conspiracy person, so I have to conclude that it is sheer incompetence, corruption, and being out of touch that has turned the Democratic Party into a party that appears more like controlled oppositon than an actual party trying to advance a core set of ideals and appeal to the most voters possible.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Not just that, but it contributes to the population being more conservative.  Many that go to college leave their more sheltered life (I did) and go to places where there is much more diversity, both racial and socioeconomic.  This experience helps people to understand different backgrounds and struggles that others might have in life and leads them to more understanding.  This tends to add to more liberal voting blocs.  It also can challenge things like a person's faith as they meet others with different faiths, as well as other reasons.  So, two big parts of conservatisim are undermined by a higher education (neither of which have to do with the actual education part itself).  So, if conservatives can keep people in their own little bubbles and keep them 'in the faith,' then they are likely to groom a whole new generation of voters.","title":"Trump wants to change colleges nationwide.

A fear that human rights and provisions for trans people will crumble. Or wider concerns a cultural tipping point is underway in which minorities will become a target for street violence and unfettered discrimination.Trumps team rejected such concerns during the 2024 campaign, saying he would uplift all Americans regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.What no one knows is exactly what will happen. Those with concerns point to three indicators: what Trump has said and done (which is not always consistent), what Republican?politicians have declared, and what organisations supporting his presidency have advocated.Proposals have included removing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) schemes and other anti-discrimination protections (which could affect employment, housing, healthcare, and education), ending gender treatment (particularly for under-18s), banning trans people serving in the military, and defunding schools with LGBTQ-inclusive programmes.Trump declared last month, it will be the official policy of the US government that there are only two genders, male and female. His rhetoric on same-sex marriage has varied over the years, but many expect him to oversee its reversal. In his first term, he nominated three conservative Supreme Court Justices, bringing the balance of conservative-to-liberal judges to 6-3 C some of whom have stated their opposition to same-sex marriage.The Project 2025 policy document by the Trump-supporting Heritage Foundation said the Department of Health should maintain a Biblically based definition of marriage and family C 574 anti-LGBTQ bills have already been introduced?across the country in recent years, according to the?[American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2024).Which policies will be implemented is unclear, but those who spoke with this paper describe 2025 as a precipice, with 40 years of progress towards LGBTQ equality in peril.# Rise in hate crimesRyan Gierach wont be there to see it.

Beyond the Italian islands lemon groves and ancient ruins, lies a more basic attraction for him: safety.He knows a thing or two about violence. In 1979, while serving in the US Air Force, he was raped by an officer. At the time being gay was illegal in the military, so rather than seeing justice, Ryan was discharged for homosexuality. Then in 1985, he was stabbed in the chest and left for dead by an escaped convict in a homophobic attack. I saw the flash of the blade coming towards my neck, so I jumped back, he says.

He wants to avoid another.But during?[the first Trump presidency](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/america-better-off-trump-2020-3450881?ico=in-line_link), Ryan was subjected to a hate campaign in his neighbourhood.

Ryan, a 66-year-old retired historian, says he foresees a new social reality in which LGBTQ people are at risk, once again.I can predict with some confidence that well see an increase in hate crimes, and an increase in harassment that wont go charged as hate crimes.

He also knows his history, he says; the waves unleashed by certain types of leaders.Trump made trans people a focal point in his re-election campaign. Republican candidates sank a reported $65m on anti-trans television adverts, the most prominent of which came from the presidential campaign: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you. Its a classic technique using a wedge issue to provoke hostility against the whole LGBTQ community, Ryan says.It creates the base atmosphere of hatred, distrust, and permission to punch down, he adds.

You can mandate behaviors  and we do, and we must  but the more you mandate the less democratic, the system becomes (which is at the heart of conservative complaints).When a player like Trump enters the fray  someone who refuses to play by the rules and whose violation of the rules seeks to serve anti-democratic and corrupt behaviors  the system breaks down because it is not designed to exclude such a player.  It depends on other players and, most importantly voters, to decline to play along. And, playing along (as so many MAGAts are doing today) while disrespectful of the rules is not automatically or, in some cases  even practically, a violation of the rules or laws.Democracy and self-representation exists and operates in a grey area that expects, but has a hard time enforcing, fair play and honor.   Sure, if you break a rule or a law you can be punished, but if you decide to play an entirely different game, the system can be befuddled into submission.  The worst thing Trump has done is to expose that weakness in democracyif you have no honor, no willingness to be contained by rules  never mind the laws  and you refuse to be defeating, by either you opponents or the system itself, , democracy can really turn out to be defenseless.  This is because to defend democracy against such an out of control player, almost by necessity, requires becoming less democratic.Its a damn hard Catch 22 to defeat.And when others, either out of weakness or corruption, play along, with the out-of-control player the democratic systems  \\nstart to break down in ways that accelerate with each capitulation.Having been rejected by the natural flow towards liberalism, (call it democratic entropy and societal ambiguity) Conservatives have given up adhering to self-enforced democratic rules and behaviors and with each day they hasten democracys demise in America.

It's also the one that makes the least sense, since both Denmark and the US are part of NATO and already have an agreement regarding defence of Greenland. Meaning the US already have a base up there and would pretty certainly be allowed to expand their military presence there as they see fit without the need of owning it\\n- The second most popular reason is because of their minerals. However, the Greenlanders have already banned drilling/mining for oil, gas and uranium there. For some reason Trump Jr claimed that it was Denmark not allowing them this, but he has either been misinformed by some of the more ignorant young locals there (which are in the minority btw) or is just straight up spreading lies. Most Greenlanders is heavily against ruining the nature by exploiting their natural resources too much. I think Trump is either ignorant of this or he doesn't care, but it will make it hard for him to get most Greenlanders on his side if he doesn't show he respect this to some extent.?\\nThen we have the conspiracy theories, which ranges from\\n- Being a good place to hvide in bunkers for some coming disaster\\n- The opening to inner earth or otherwise an important land to own regarding some upcoming event with UFOs\\n- A part of the NWO agenda to get closer to form some kind of one world government\\n- Libarate the world from liberals/the Elite, which is stupid since Denmark is a much smaller country and the politicians try really hard not to offend Trump this time around, because they know he is the most powerful man in the world soon, and they need him against Russia.?\\n- Lastly, there's a theory that says that Trump saw a map of America with Greenland belonging to it and decided he wanted to expand the US in order to \\"make it great again\\". Some even say that Greenland belongs more to the US than to Denmark because of its location. However, Greenland was a part of Denmark looong before the US was even a nation.?\\nDenmark and Greenland has ties that goes long back. A lot of Greenlanders has danish family members and friends. A lot of Greenlanders are a mix between greenlander and danish ethnicity. A lot of the culture on Greenland is part of the danish culture and vice versa.?\\nSo to say that Greenland belongs more to than US the to Denmark, is to be ignorant about the history between Greenland and Denmark. Sure some of it is bad, and that is what all the focus is on atm, but a lot of it is also good!!\\nHowever, if the citizens of Greenland feel like they rather be part of the US, then they are free to do so. Denmark doesn't own Greenland. It's more like they're part of a federation, where every Greenlander has the same benefits of being a danish citizen as danes does, when in mainland Denmark. That's probably why 1/3 - 1/4 of Greenlanders live in Denmark and not on Greenland.?","title":"Why Trump wants Greenland"},{"text":"Imagine being the vice president and still being looked down on because you're black.

The Democrats have lost the messaging war. Not only that, but they have actively contributed to their own demise year and year (messaging wise).I agree they lost the messaging war.

They have to shit on their own economy to agree with all the people saying it's terrible, even though any economic indicator did not corroborate that feeling. There is no win there that doesn't devolve into two garbage populist parties. \\nThere is also a grain of truth in what he's saying - you and I both know that the democratic leadership isn't TRULY going to the mat for working people. A vast majority of party donors are extremely richThey did go to the mat for working people. They passed beneficial NLRB reform. They passed drug pricing caps. They were taking price gouging seriously. The President joined a workers strike and helped them negotiate to get what they wanted. They had expanded and increased child tax credits. They passed legislation that bolstered working class jobs through the IRA and infrastructure bills. REAL wages were up under Dems. They can do more of course, but to say they aren't truly helping is just wrong and is exactly their voter problem. \\nSo, the answer is while yes - things can't change overnight, what CAN change overnight is dem messaging, AND their commitment to economic justice reform. What messaging do you want them to do? Because touting all the positive things they did while in office just made people dislike them and caricature them as calling all voters stupid.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Global warming","title":"Help me understand the interest Trump has in other countries"},{"text":"When I see Trump's Tweets/Truths, this SpongeBob quote always comes to mindActual quote:\\nNO WATER IN THE FIRE HYDRANTS, NO MONEY IN FEMA.

The president-elect first named lawyers who have represented him in recent years to the key positions of deputy attorney general, principal deputy attorney general, and solicitor general. Then, with the quick death of the Matt Gaetz nomination, he announced a new attorney-general nominee, Pam Bondi, who was a member of his legal defense team in the first impeachment. The Justice Departments responsibilities have always been subject to competing expectations: that it would keep politics out of law enforcement but, like other departments, would loyally serve the president in the implementation of his governing program. The results have been uneven, and at times disastrous, as with Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal. But when problems arose, they were relatively localized: the product of poor appointments, or the failure of particular presidents in particular situations to respect institutional values and norms. What the DOJ faces now is different in kind: a vision of White House control achieved through the appointments of individuals the president has chosen because they have worked for him and demonstrated their loyalty. The pressing question now is whether these lawyers may be, as the president-elect likely hopes, the presidents lawyers in more than one sense.The DOJs special status as independent is not provided for in the Constitution, but is also not solely a product of norms established in the post-Watergate era, as many standard accounts would have it. The office of attorney general was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and this context is meaningful. The attorney generals function, which involved rendering legal opinions and representing the United States before the Supreme Court, was perceived to be quasi-judicial. The Senate version of the bill even provided that the Court would appoint this officer. The final bill called for the attorney general to be a meet [fit] person learned in the law. This language points clearly in the direction of expected professionalism, and historians have noted that legal opinions the attorney general rendered to executive-branch agencies were expected to be impartial and judicial....How, then, will these nominees manage the unique pressures they facein which the presidents perception of their loyalty is grounded in service to him as personal counsel? At the least in the case of the solicitor general designate, John Sauer, the signs so far are not encouraging. On December 27, as personal counsel to President-elect Trump, he filed a brief with the Supreme Court in the pending TikTok case. The Court is preparing to decide whether Congress may constitutionally ban the platforms domestic operations unless, by January 19, 2025, it arranges by divestments to end Chinese-government control. Sauer argues that the Court should take action to prevent the ban from going into effect, giving time for Trump to take office and resolve the issue through some unspecified form of negotiated settlement. The nominees personal representation of Trump in a case involving his second-term presidency is sufficiently troubling, but his brief also brims over with adulatory language about Trumps personal skills and successes: his consummate dealmaking expertise, his resoundingly successful social-media platform, Truth Social, his first Term  highlighted by a series of policy triumphs achieved through historical deals.This is the lawyer acting as a publicist, or perhaps just bending far in the direction of the personal clients desire for plauditshardly the right posture for someone soon to come before the Senate for confirmation as the senior DOJ official to represent the United States in the federal courts. Even The Wall Street Journal, far from unfriendly to the new administration, flinched: The SG isnt supposed to be Mr. Trumps personal attorney, and Mr. Sauers brief wont help his credibility with the Justices if he is confirmed by the Senate. We trust the Justices will ignore this amicus sophistry....The hope now should be for a serious confirmation process in which these fundamental institutional stakes, not purely partisan differences, should be front and center. All too often in recent years, the debate over institutional questions of this kind has become a referendum on Trump himself. This is not altogether avoidable: These are Trumps nominees, reflecting Trumps plans for the presidency and for the DOJ, and the parties are deeply divided on his politics and governing program. But if the debate is framed in the simplest termsfor or against Trumpthe larger implications for the institution of the Department of Justice will recede into the background, if they are not lost entirely, and the prospect for responsible bipartisan deliberation will be lost. The public deserves better than that.Should these nominations proceed unopposed as proposed, this would be another step to the transformation of the political apparatus of the nation into an autocratic one. Pressure needs to be brought to bear on the politicians tasked with this vetting, otherwise they may make decisions that will fundamentally damage the functioning of the nation.","title":"Trump Is Poised to Turn the DOJ Into His Personal Law Firm | The question the Senate confirmation process must address is whether the departments tradition of independence will be supplanted by a new value: loyalty"},{"text":"A lot of those voted people tRump.

The \\"I don't hate _ people BUT\\" sentence is often very telling. To actually address what your original comment says... Overall, yes, the things you bring up do exist (drag queen story hour, This Book is Gay, etc.) but those things are so overblown it's become tired to point out how overblown they are. You even mention it, but I think you don't appreciate just how overstated it is. Like this: The same for some of the books in junior high schools, that literally depict and have instructions for how to suck a dick, etc, ... who thought that was a good idea ?I believe this is from *This Book is Gay* but I don't recall the title. I recall it has a little drawn comic of characters using a strap-on. I don't recall it having uh instructions, though. Is this appropriate for children? Maybe. Experts seem to think so. Children by the age of 12-14 should be pretty familiar with various forms of intercourse. But lets even put that aside. This was not a book taught in the core curriculum. Nor is it usually one taught in a class (I think there was a single instance where a teacher read portions of it in a high school elective.) It may be in a school library, though. Sure, students can access it. But they also could just not. This is not something being pushed on children. And even if it were, it's not absurd to teach children proper sexual wellness education. My main point here is that these are not actual causes for concern. And to actually repeat trans panic topics is to fall into the social panic of the moment about an extreme minority of the population that occasionally catches everyone's attention because they are outside the norm and people are confused. It's right up there with \\"they are eating the cats!\\" in terms of cause for alarm. So do you \\"hate\\" trans people? No, I don't think so. But you are repeating anti-trans agendas. Which, in practice, is the same thing. So when these discussions come around and people get (rightfully) emotional, distinguishing those two becomes irrelevant.","title":"'I'm physically afraid to live here': The LGBTQ people planning to leave Trump's US"},{"text":"I think it was Covid tests, but your point definitely stands.","title":"Trump Cares More About Starting Fights Than Fire Victims"},{"text":"But think of all the sweet maple syrup.","title":"If Trump annexes Canada, thats gonna bring like 100 million Indian nationals presently scamming the Canadian PR system directly into the US job market"},{"text":"\\n(Article)---As Republicans prepare to take control of the federal government, Democrats are assessing what went wrong in the 2024 election and what they need to change. If they want to win future elections, its essential for them to get the story right.The predominant view of the election among Democrats goes like this: While Kamala Harriss campaign managed to recover much of the ground that Joe Biden had lost, her record and a handful of strategic mistakes limited her appeal, opening the door for Donald Trumps return to the White House.Two bodies of evidence complicate this narrative. First, pre-election surveys consistently showed that Ms. Harriss ceiling was substantially higher than Mr. Trumps, meaning a higher percentage of voters said theyd consider voting for her than him. Ms. Harriss eventual share of the nationwide popular vote was much lower than the percentage of these persuadable voters. Postelection surveys show that late-deciding voters broke decisively for Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris failed to win over a small but vital share of the electorate, which was disproportionately younger, male, Hispanic and non-college-educated.Second, the election involved two different contests: one in the seven swing states, the other in the rest of the country. In the latter, where advertisements and voter mobilization were scarce, support for Ms. Harris receded from the high-water mark Mr. Biden had established in the 2020 electionespecially in blue states. In both Illinois and New Jersey, Ms. Harris received about 400,000 fewer votes than Mr. Biden did four years earlier. In New York, Ms. Harris fell short of Mr. Biden by about 600,000. In California, the shortfall reached 1.8 million votes, a 16.5% drop from 2020.By contrast, in the swing states Ms. Harris came close to matching Mr. Bidens performance, falling short by only 0.3%. This wasnt enough, however, because Mr. Trump improved on his 2020 showing by 6.2%. Yes, Ms. Harris lost all seven swing states, but its more accurate to say that Mr. Trump won them with a message strong enough to overcome the Harris campaigns edge in funds and organization.In the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, Ms. Harris fell short of Mr. Bidens 2020 performance by only about 35,000 votes, while Mr. Trump improved on his 2020 performance by about 166,000. In Luzerne County, a microcosm of the working-class revolt against the contemporary Democratic Party, Ms. Harris fell only about 2,000 votes short of Mr. Bidens 2020 performance. Meanwhile Mr. Trump continued to expand his working-class base, improving on his 2020 total in the county by about 5,500 votes.Mr. Trump has substantially expanded the Republican vote in Luzerne County. In 2012, about 58,000 voters in the county picked Mitt Romney. In the 2024 election, more than 92,000 picked Mr. Trumpa nearly 60% increase over 12 years, even though the countys population size has barely changed and Ms. Harriss vote was only marginally smaller than Barack Obamas. The story is less about Democratic erosion than Republican mobilization.This is part of a larger storythe transformation of American politics during the past two decades of intensifying partisan polarization. In the seven presidential contests from 1976 to 2000, voter turnout never came close to 60%, averaged only about 54%, and fell below 50% in 1996. In the six contests from 2004 to 2024, turnout averaged 61.8%, in 2020 reached its highest level since 1900, and has fallen below 60% only once.Voters with high levels of education tend to vote regularly, even in lower-intensity elections, while less-educated voters are more likely to turn out when they feel a strong and direct stake in the outcome. Through most of the 20th century, intensity benefited Democrats, who performed well with voters without college degrees. But now the Republicans hold the edge among working-class voters and do best when these voters see clear differences between the parties.Although the share of college-educated voters in the electorate has risen sharply in recent decades, Americans without college degrees still made up 57% of all voters nationally in the 2024 electionand 60% in the swing states. If Democrats wish to rebuild their national majority, they cant continue to give ground in this crucial portion of the electorate.The past four years should teach party reformers that abstract appeals to the benefits of long-term economic investments wont suffice. Working-class voters have little slack in their family budgets and dont have the luxury of waiting. They need to see tangible improvements in their lives within the span of a single presidential term. The onus is on Democrats to produce a new economic agenda that credibly promisesand then producesthis result.","title":"Harris Didnt Lose the Election So Much as Trump Won | If Democrats want to win in the future, they need to grasp how he did it."},{"text":"Thank you!","title":"Hayes: The trans population is far smaller than the right would have you believe"},{"text":"CIA subsidiary at this point","title":"Are You for or against Trump labeling Drug Cartels as Terrorist organizations"},{"text":"I dont think of all time.

You can criticize certain policies (like allowing biological men to play in women sports) and still support the LGBT+ community. Now I also disagree with a lot of what he said as well. If parents want to give their children puberty blockers because they feel its the right thing to do, so be it. That is their right. They are their parents. Parents get to make decisions for their children that we dont agree with. Do I think someone should feed their child a diet full of lard, McDonalds and fried food? No. But thats their right as a parent. It does not concern anyone but that family. We need to just leave them alone and allow parents to make the decisions they believe are right for their children. Isnt that what small government is all about?A lot of hate surrounding the trans community is because of the unknown. People fear what they dont understand and they believe normalizing transitioning will make it ok for their straight children to somehow call themselves trans and start transitioning. They also dont want their children to see the trans movement be supported and celebrated, particularly when it comes to school. My opinion is that the trans population make up less than 1/4% so we are spending far too much time, money and energy talking about it and it has turned otherwise moderate voters to Trump voters. If it was up to me, I wouldve told democrats to completely stay away from trans policies. It cost them the election. Its really not something any political party should focus on. If we stopped talking and focusing on it so much, it probably would make things SAFER for trans people. Im tired of hearing about something that affects so few Americans but democrats supported so many pro-trans policies we will ALL suffer for the next 4 years and beyond.","title":"'I'm physically afraid to live here': The LGBTQ people planning to leave Trump's US"},{"text":"There's various reasons:- good portion of Turks are conservative / religious- Erdo?an / AKP did some solid job in the 2000s, earning them some \\ngoodwill with his base and moderates.

This will violate the neutrality treaty, international law and it will lead to chaos.In a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump demanded that US vessels be given preferential treatment.He also accused the authority of overcharging US ships and of separately seeking funding from the US to repair the waterway. Vsquez Morales denied both those claims, telling the Journal that the authority funds maintenance from the fees it charges and that Panama hadnt requested funding from the US for improvements.Ships are charged between $300,000 and $1 million depending on their size and type to pass through the canal.Those charges apply to all ships from around the world and there are no exceptions, Vsquez Morales told the Journal.Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of retaking control of the canal, calling the fees exorbitant and a rip-off.The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the US, he said on Truth Social in December.At Tuesdays news conference, Trump also downplayed Panamas control of the canal and refused to rule out using military force to retake control of the trade route, expanding on a threat he made last month.Chinas basically taken it over. Chinas at both ends of the Panama Canal. Chinas running the Panama Canal, the president-elect said.Vsquez Morales told the Journal: China has no involvement whatsoever in our operations.In response to Trumps comments, Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martnez-Acha said on Tuesday that only Panamanians operated the canal, adding: Our canals sovereignty is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest.Trump has also refused to rule out using military force to take control of Greenland, which he said the US needed for national security purposes.The 51-mile Panama Canal was officially opened in 1914, creating a new trade route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.The US transferred control to the state-owned Panama Canal Authority in 1999 in accordance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, initiated in 1977 by the Carter administration.Under the treaty, the US has the right to defend the canal from any change to its neutrality.","title":"'No Exceptions' For Commercial US Ships Passing Through The Panama Canal, Canal Authorities Says In Response To Trump: This will violate the neutrality treaty, international law and it will lead to chaos"},{"text":"I veto any notion to subdue these forest fires and reject any reports of forest fires burning houses and homes.

How many stories were about the Dems not being able to appeal to young voters?Lots of stories but it isn't because of entitlement. It's because young people, at least the vast majority vocally online, do not want politicians. Young Dems and progressives are the exact same as young republicans, they want a populist leader to change everything overnight. This isn't what the established Dems do, they reform within the system given. That isn't good enough for young voters whicu is a shame. She would probably RATHER have a trump presidency because people on the left want to do things like banning her from trading stocksAgain just wrong. You would only believe this if you're someone who thinks both sides are the same. If she wants power she feels entitled to having the people most likely to harm and strip her of that power elected would not be preferable. Banning stock trading is just a distraction from actual issues to be fixed. it is why Biden refused to step down. He felt ENTITLED to continue to be president because they have some absurd idea that seniority should be the only thing that means people get promoted. He had some absurd idea that because he spent so many years in public service, he was OWED being president and people like Nancy agreed!He technically was entitled, every encumbent is basically entitled to running for a second term. The fact that he did step down, even begrudgingly, shows that the Dems do listen to the voter base. However, it didn't matter because the talking points went from he should drop out to he should've dropped sooner. Then the voters couldn't even rally behind the candidate and bother to show up and vote. the dems KNOW why they lost. They are defenders of the status quo and believe that is the best path forward.I agree here, but the status quo and changing from within a functional system is good and unfortunately that isn't a selling point to much of America. The Dems know why they lost, it was because Americans want a populist leader and are indifferent towards authoritarian rule. They do not want gradual changes in positive directions, they want to be able to enforce their will now or let it burn.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Look, I'm American, I love living in America (recent years not included).

He had some absurd idea that because he spent so many years in public service, he was OWED being president and people like Nancy agreed!Im not a Democrat so OP can take what I say with a grain of salt but to expand on this one point, there is an attitude of we-know-better within the Democratic Partys candidate selection process that plays out through the primaries, which I think is a big turnoff for a lot of people. Only the Democratic Party primary system uses super delegates to put their thumb on the scale and make sure the right candidate gets selected. Democrats have been far more willing to gamify and interfere with their party primary to block or promote certain candidates that party leadership thinks are best despite the wishes of their grass roots. Over several cycles now, Democrats leadership have shown a willingness to disregard or minimize the primary process so they could get the candidate that they deemed the right fit for the moment and, more often than not, it seems to have been to their own determent. Republicans could have done the same thing to Trump in 2016 when he ran in a crowded primary but they let it play out and if a similar populist candidate had tried to do something like that in the Democrats primary, I just dont think theyd have been allowed to succeed.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Yeah he just happened to turn his head at the right second....

Its just a technique that politicians use to win people over (claim something, e.g. that all Greenlanders think its great, keep repeating it and at some point they really believe it) ... only this rarely happens across national borders ;)In any case, politicians, regardless of party, are not ?friends of the people but usually pursue their own interests (maintaining power, influence, money, etc.), so I would be careful when evaluating all these strange actions.

This is, for sure, their fault. It is, to be clear, still not universally agreed what! There are people who think they would have won if Kamala has denounced Israel, or if she had been willing to say something different about DEI or gender issues. There are people who believe that Biden could have won if he hadnt dropped out or that Bernie would have won or that if Harris had chosen Shapiro she would have won, and so on.The truth is that we will never run the 2024 election again, and so the navel-gazing is useful to a point (because the party, insofar as it is organized enough to do anything and its politicians made unsuccessful decisions), but there are strict limitations. In 2005 after Kerry lost Dems thought they needed major reform to come back, and then Bush sucked in his second term and Obama won and ushered in a period of relatively progressive change and some significant legislative achievement. In 2021 I suspect the median establishment republican thought that Trump and Jan 6th would cost them control of the government for a generation - and many of them said it! - and now we are where we are.One major lesson is every election is its own special flower and we need to run them on their own terms, not on the terms of the last one.

You should not be bankrolling your businesses off the backs of illegal workersPeople have this vision of what illegal immigrant farmers' lives are like, and it's just not quite in line with reality. A lot of these workers actually get paid a perfectly decent wage. They have (stolen) SSNs, they're subject to tax withholding, they're subject to minimum wage laws, so on and so on. You come to some big ag towns in Texas, and you honestly could not tell the difference between \\"illegal\\" and \\"legal\\" workers who just happen to be hispanic.Is their life all roses and unicorn farts? Of course not. But it's actually shockingly hard to treat people as _feudal serfs_ and have it fly far enough under the radar. I had a neighbor who was an illegal migrant farm worker for about a decade and the only clue that I had was that their English wasn't really up to scratch - but I knew enough non-immigrant hispanics with sketchy English that I just brushed it off. If your business cant survive with legal workers then its not a good business and should close. If nobody wants to work for you thats your problem.You're saying this from the perspective of thinking \\"if you just pay well enough, the workers will show up,\\" and for some work, _that's just not true._ You walk into any small town in Texas, and you'll find white people working the drive-thru at McDonalds for less money and less hours than they'd get on the local farms. Sometimes _substantially_ less. You'll see a bunch of barely educated idiots who are \\"too proud\\" to work the land or the herds, even when you point out that the ranch is paying $20/hr for guaranteed 40-50 hours a week, while they're begging for 10 hours at a time at $13/hr at the local McDonalds.Also, there's some some labor that isn't about profit and isn't about \\"business.\\" Food production, especially for staple food items like corn, wheat, milk, eggs, are industries that it's important to keep running for public policy reasons _even when they're unprofitable._ The problem in these industries isn't the illegal workers, it's not even necessarily the wages being paid, it's the introduction of profit motive into a bedrock feature of civilization.","title":"Some Texas business leaders are apprehensive about Trumps pledged deportations | \\nWe wouldnt survive without undocumented workers, one South Texas produce business owner said.

Though Trump breaks the mould in some ways, his shock tactics do follow a script, and one that is familiar from other countries that have had rapid changes imposed under the cover of crisis.[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/06/naomi-klein-how-power-profits-from-disaster](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/06/naomi-klein-how-power-profits-from-disaster)","title":"Theres no way these fires are a coincidence.

Thats not how it works!! AND, if a kid needs any type of medicine in school, they have to go to the nurse and get the parents written permission first!! I couldnt even give a student lotion yesterday when his hands were dry because he might have some type of skin sensitivity that we didnt know about.

Because not all cis women have the same genetics. While there may be a bell curve, there are cis women who fall on the tail ends of that bell curve. And if you ever travel to Sweden (where I live), you'll notice Swedish cis women tend to be taller on average than your average American cis woman. Unfair genetic advantage! Swedish cis women should be banned from competing against American cis women! Are you only going to allow people to play in sports if they fit right in the middle of that bell curve on every characteristic? Which characteristics are relevant? Besides, there are other factors that effect the development of things like height, bone density, lung capacity, etc. Genetics are not the only factor. 3a) Not mention that even if someone fits right in the middle of some bell curve, even if they train every day at a sport, they could still end up being a mediocre player at best. Biology isn't destiny. I had an ex-boyfriend that was 6'6\\". He sucked at basketball. And if you want to talk about advantages in sports, class advantage is fucking huge one. So rich people shouldn't be allowed to compete because they have an unfair advantage? 4) Historically, the reason why cis women ended up having their own leagues was less because of \\"averages\\" between cis men and cis women and more because of sexism and because cis men couldn't handle losing to cis women (an oppressed minority), just like white people historically couldn't handle losing to black people (an oppressed minority), just like some cis women now can't handle losing to trans women (an oppressed minority). This has always been more about maintaining a social hierarchy than anything else. The \\"genetics\\" argument is just obfuscation. 5) Larger hands and feet are not always advantages in every sport. It depends on the sport. Trans women have been banned from competing against cis women in fucking darts because of \\"unfair genetic advantage.\\" Wtf does lung capacity or larger feet have to do with playing darts?6) You all only ever care about \\"unfair genetic advantage\\" when the topic of trans women in sports comes up. Which raises the more important question: why do you only care about this when it comes to trans women? Could it be--and I'm going to go out on a limb and hazard a guess here (/s)--because of transphobia","title":"Hayes: The trans population is far smaller than the right would have you believe"},{"text":"They leaked the questions and he STILL answered like an idiot? God help us all","title":"Fox News Insider Leaked Town Hall Questions to Trumps Team: Book"},{"text":"Nope. Ugh, this is just complete obfuscation, either intentionally or unintentionally. I'm going to hope it's unintentional.1) You're conflating different things here and then trying to justify your conclusion by doing so. You talk about average puberty for cis boys, then you assume that young trans women have the same average puberty as cis boys. That's an assumption. What are you basing that on? Because studies show that young trans women tend to have higher rates of eating disorders, which tend to impact things like \\"lung capacity, height, bone density,\\" etc. So, you're assuming the average for group B is the same as group A, and then because of this assumption, you're assuming the only possible conclusion is C: that group B should only ever compete against group A. This is called a logical fallacy. So, you're conflating different groups that have different experiences, different social conditions (which impact development), different rates of eating disorders, different gendered experiences, and then, on top of this, you're conflating averages with individuals (which I'll get to below).1a) Bone density tangent: And here we go again with the \\"bone density\\" crap. I'm not sure why bone density really matters anyway, unless we're talking about high contact sports. And even there, bone density variation isn't so substantial that it would make a difference. It's not like all cis women suffer from brittle bone disease and are delicate flowers. And it seems like higher bone density for swimmers, if anything, would be a disadvantage. At any rate, studies show trans girls tend to have lower bone density even prior to starting puberty blockers. Supposedly, the concern is that puberty blockers cause lower bone density among trans girls and so this is a justification for denying them puberty blockers. The research actually doesn't show this. It was that trans girls tended to have lower bone density to begin with (likely in part due to higher rates of eating disorders). So, apparently, trans girls must be made to have higher bone density, so their bone density can then be used against them. Cool.2) Averages are just that. They're actually not as important as you think, especially when it comes to sports, especially when you consider athletes tend not to be average to begin with. There are many cis women who are taller than some cis men. Just like how there are some trans women that are shorter than the average cis woman. I've actually met a few. I've met trans women that are so short and so petite that they probably weigh 120 lbs. soaking wet. There are some trans women who have smaller feet than some cis women. There are so few trans women that play sports that, at that point, we're actually no longer even talking about averages anymore but are talking about individuals. And at the individual level, even when it comes to just cis women competing against cis men, there are some cis women athletes that would absolutely beat some cis men athletes in many sports. So, again, averages aren't as important as you think they are.","title":"Hayes: The trans population is far smaller than the right would have you believe"},{"text":"The people voted for thisIf your business cannot survive unless you break the law, then your business has failed and should close.

The US economy recovered faster than most from COVID, but that inflation spike still happened and prices are still high. Everyone wants change. Trump ran as someone who would change things, he had like 2-3 big ideas that he kept harping on: immigration bad, tariffs good. Dems ran as the defenders of the status quo, not just because they were the incumbents but because the party is centrist at its core. They're fine with things as they are, and they're happy to fall back on economic recovery numbers to try and convince people we're doing great even when no one?*feels*?like we're doing great.So they lost, because the candidate saying things are bad when things are bad has a better message, even if his solutions won't fix anything. Now the question isn't whether Dems can figure this out, because that's easy enough. The question is whether they're actually going to step up and take some big policy swings to show voters they're not happy just sitting in the middle of a wildfire chanting \\"the economy is good.\\"Given the unwillingness of the old guard to relinquish power to younger and more radical politicians, I think the answer for now remains a resounding no, so they'll continue having no message to resonate with angry voters and they'll keep losing.

I grew up part time in a rural East texas ag town. Lots of corn, cotton, sorghum, and cattle. And lots of illegal immigrant workers.Theres a squeeze here that people often dont get. Most of the illegal workers in my community made OK money. Not necessarily great but also not necessarily terrible either. The problem is that no locals want those jobs at _any_ wage because its a shit job and a well paying shit job is still a shit job. My high school class was more than enough kids to staff all the local farms for decades to come, but not one of them grew up thinking I want to be out there picking cotton or tending the herd. Their parents push them to do good in school so they can go to university and not have to work the fields. They want a better life for their kids than that. A lot of them are working somewhere else _for less money than the farm would pay_ because theyd rather an easier but lower paying job.The undocumented workers usually have stolen SSNs and the employers cant/dont/wont validate them fully even if they wanted to, so they just roll with it.The real solution to the problem is to legitimize the flow of labor into the country, or stop trying to produce this stuff domestically (the latter of course would be suicide).

Behind him, in his living room, stretches a world map covering an entire wall.I feel Ill be safer in Europe, he says. Im encouraging all my gay friends to leave the country.Ryans preparations are underway. And hes not alone. LGBTQ people across America have told The i Paper of their plans to leave.The reasons vary: the prospect of same-sex marriage being overturned like federal abortion rights. A fear that human rights and provisions for trans people will crumble. Or wider concerns a cultural tipping point is underway in which minorities will become a target for street violence and unfettered discrimination.Trumps team rejected such concerns during the 2024 campaign, saying he would uplift all Americans regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.What no one knows is exactly what will happen. Those with concerns point to three indicators: what Trump has said and done (which is not always consistent), what Republican politicians have declared, and what organisations supporting his presidency have advocated.Proposals have included removing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) schemes and other anti-discrimination protections (which could affect employment, housing, healthcare, and education), ending gender treatment (particularly for under-18s), banning trans people serving in the military, and defunding schools with LGBTQ-inclusive programmes.Trump declared last month, it will be the official policy of the US government that there are only two genders, male and female. His rhetoric on same-sex marriage has varied over the years, but many expect him to oversee its reversal. In his first term, he nominated three conservative Supreme Court Justices, bringing the balance of conservative-to-liberal judges to 6-3 C some of whom have stated their opposition to same-sex marriage.The Project 2025 policy document by the Trump-supporting Heritage Foundation said the Department of Health should maintain a Biblically based definition of marriage and family C 574 anti-LGBTQ bills have already been introduced across the country in recent years, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.Which policies will be implemented is unclear, but those who spoke with this paper describe 2025 as a precipice, with 40 years of progress towards LGBTQ equality in peril.Read more here: [https://inews.co.uk/news/lgbtq-trump-usa-leaving-3466598](https://inews.co.uk/news/lgbtq-trump-usa-leaving-3466598)","title":"'I'm physically afraid to live here': The LGBTQ people planning to leave Trump's US"},{"text":"Don't forget the raking. https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-blames-california-fires-on-unclean-forest-floors-907506/","title":"While Trump is busy blaming Biden, and try to invade North America &amp; Greenland, Biden canceled end of president term trip to Italy to focus on fires in California"},{"text":"Im physically afraid of being here now, says Ryan Gierach, glancing out the window of his apartment in San Pedro, Los Angeles.

I have no idea what the real point of this goofy expansionist talk is but there's no way we're taking military action against Canada or Denmark in the foreseeable future. If that was a remotely serious objective everyone (including Trump) understands you'd need to lead with the \\"clear and present danger\\" rationale. He's not even trying.This is probably in part a distraction from something else. Or, maybe the stuff with Canada is trying to look powerful to a domestic or international audience because Trudeau was about to resign anyway? Maybe all of this (individually and collectively) is just aggressive positioning with the hope of influencing more mundane agreements (like a pipeline to bring North American gas closer to Europe in the case of Greenland)? Worst case maybe Trump's just trolling (a domestic or international audience, or both) while openly fantasizing about territorial ambitions like some authoritarian leaders he's expressed admiration for?But whatever it is we're definitely not gearing up for military action in Greenland. (Unlike some other equally disturbing and ill-advised comments he's made) Trump isn't even convincing when he suggests otherwise. Sure, that's a battle the US could win - so much so that NATO may not bother to try to stop them - but it would be absolutely disastrous to the US material, economic, military and strategic interests - even in the short run. No first-order or second-order participant - the US, NATO/European nations, US or global corporations, oligarchical billionaires, the Republican party, their donors, the global economy, Trump himself - none of them benefit. Even China would probably suffer in the near-to-medium term from having their largest trading partner embroiled in that mess and its aftermath.I can't imagine Trump is sincere about this in the first place. And I don't see how this could possibly serve the interests of any above-board power (government or private) that has influence or control over any part of this. G. W. Bush spent months making the WMD case to the American people and the international community. G. H. W. Bush did too, the previous go-round. A presumptively anti-war president is not about to trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter - as the aggressor - over GREENLAND of all places- without a massive hearts and minds campaign to change foreign and domestic perception of that action. It's not even a question of whether his advisors, cabinet, Congress or the American people would go along with that. I sincerely doubt the military leadership would blindly comply. Its 25th Amendment and \\"unlawful order\\" territory.Don't fall for this gambit. I don't know what he's trying to do but it's definitely not a military invasion of Greenland.","title":"Is there any way to stop Trump from invading and annexing Greenland?"},{"text":"I just cant think of any time period in our modern historyHistory does not repeat - it informs.","title":"The GOP will ban same sex marriage"},{"text":"First time all night ive actually seen a reasonable theory including my own, I think they wanna keep us fighting red vs blue so we dont realize its actually rich vs poor","title":"Is Trump the greatest psyop of all time?"},{"text":"Like for real!

Russia was fortifying its economy under Trump and Trump was helping Russia prepare to dodge sanctions Trump brokered the OPEC+ deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia making it so instead of them competing on the World Oil market they now work together to inflate and set Oil prices to fund the wars in Ukraine and Yemen avoiding sanctions. Russian Oil to the US also increased by 39% under Trump. You must also forget that Trump assasinated an Iranian general and had our military base getting bombed almost sparking all out war with Iran. Trump was also droping the MOAB bomb in Afghanistan. The reason the wars seemed less active during Trump is because our enemies were fortifying their economies with his help. The Israeli/Palestinian deal Trump made with Beni in Israel and declaring the capital of Israel also increased tension in the middle-east. He also had our allies calling us unreliable.

They've made that clear.One of the big beliefs behind groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society (who push these far-right conservative judges) is that for the last century, the court has been too liberal, has destroyed state rights, and created law from the bench. These conservatives believe if something is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, then it's the state right. Period. And they are determined to wind the clock backwards. They feel they finally have the court makeup to do it. That's why the red states are getting so bold with these laws. They want these laws to be challenged so they can kick it up to their friendly SCOTUS.First it was reversing voting rights. Then it was abortion. Now it's transgenders. Next is homosexuals. And then it will go to race. These people want to wind society back to the first half of the 20th century. That's where they believe legally, politically, and socially America should be.Seriously in the coming years I would not put it past this court to eventually chip away at Brown vs Board of Education.
