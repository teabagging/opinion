Trump comes in and his envoy threatens Israel and now they are accepting the deal. If you are a Muslim voter in Dearborn, you have been vindicated by Trumps approach to ending this conflict. Ill also entertain the theory that Netanyahu deliberately withheld the deal to hurt Biden. This theory has too many holes. Accepting this deal puts Netanyahu government on crash course for a collapse. He has no incentive to end the war. The truth is Trump pushed for the ceasefire deal and threatened BiBi. If BiBi was intentionally trying to hurt Biden, then why did Biden take this lying down and not raise hell against Israel.

I cant imagine being responsible for a typo in a White House memo thats widely distributed nation wide.","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden"},{"text":"Thank you for the detailed response. While I appreciate the time and effort put into your argument, I think youve overlooked critical nuances that distinguish TikTok from other platforms. Allow me to address your concerns one by one.China Bad Argument:You suggest my position reduces to China Bad, but this misrepresents the issue. The distinction between TikTok and platforms like Meta or Twitter lies in the governance structure of ByteDance, TikToks parent company. Unlike US-based companies, ByteDance is subject to Chinas National Intelligence Law of 2017, which explicitly requires all companies to support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts. This creates an unavoidable and unique risk: ByteDance employees in China must comply with CCP directives, including secretly sharing user data.This is not theoretical. Leaked audio from internal TikTok meetings confirms that China-based employees accessed US user data, including cases where the app was used to monitor specific US citizens. These actions extend beyond ordinary commercial data breachesthis is state-directed surveillance with significant geopolitical implications.Divestment vs. Ban:You characterize the divestment option as Orwellian extortion. However, this framing ignores the broader context. The divestment proposal ensures that TikTok remains operational in the US, with its users and small businesses largely unaffected, while eliminating the CCPs ability to exploit the platform. Divestment isnt about seizing controlits about removing a foreign adversarys ability to exploit Americans data and influence.In contrast, US companies selling data to third partieswhile problematicare not compelled by law to comply with adversarial state intelligence efforts. Strengthening domestic data privacy laws would address this issue, but it doesnt neutralize the unique risks posed by TikToks direct connection to the CCP.Economic Argument:You dismiss divestment as a destructive action against small businesses and influencers. However, this presumes TikTok is irreplaceable, which it is not. Platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and others have already demonstrated their ability to capture the same audience. While the transition may cause temporary disruption, divestment ensures long-term stability and independence from a government with documented abuses of surveillance and suppression. Moreover, a divestment protects both economic interests and national security without requiring a full ban.Precedent of Government Overreach:You argue that targeting TikTok sets a dangerous precedent for government control of social media. I agree that any form of government intervention must be handled cautiously. However, the TikTok case is not about arbitrary controlit is about addressing a specific national security threat. Allowing adversarial foreign governments to own platforms with massive influence over US citizens is not a sustainable policy, especially when evidence already shows misuse.Your argument that banning TikTok could lead to broader control ignores the fact that this is not about ideological suppression but about safeguarding civil society from foreign exploitation. Protecting national security, by its very nature, requires distinctions that may not apply equally to every platform.Conclusion:This debate is not just about data or free markets; its about the unique risks posed by a platform governed by a foreign adversary. Even if US companies also abuse data privacy, their governance structure is not dictated by a hostile regime. Ignoring this distinction risks trivializing the genuine security and civil society concerns at play.To summarize:\\n\\t\\n?\\tTikToks connection to the CCP makes it uniquely dangerous.\\n\\t\\n?\\tDivestment is a proportional response that safeguards user access while removing security risks.\\n\\t\\n?\\tAddressing broader data privacy issues is important but does not diminish the specific risks TikTok poses under its current ownership.Lets focus on ensuring that policies balance freedom with security, rather than conflating issues that require distinct solutions.To add, notice how I wasnt condescending in my retort you should probably try to do the same.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"Just wait ..

And that all other demographics trying to live there should be forced out, as I understand it.This is false. Israel is 20% Arab. It has no desire to force out everyone else.Yes, Zionism is the belief that Jews should have the right to statehood in the historic Jewish homeland. It does not mean excluding anyone else is required. Arabs not only exist in Israel, with full rights, they serve in its parliament and some Muslim, Christian, and Druze Arabs have served and do serve in its government.This is not to say Israel is perfect and has no discrimination of any kind societally. But what country has a minority, particularly one that opposes the state's existence, and doesn't have any kind of discrimination? In this, Israel is normal. It is not perfect, but it is also not unique. That is not an excuse, either, just an important note. Based off of my previous comment I can understand why the jewish community would be defensive of their land, but I don't believe in any \\"chosen race\\", I am a pacifist.You may not be antisemitic, but you unfortunately are using antisemitic language, likely without realizing it. The \\"chosen people\\" myth used by antisemites is a twisting of Jewish tradition. Jews believe that Jews are \\"chosen\\" to uphold Jewish law and traditions by God. This does not require Jews to be considered \\"better\\" or receive more privileges or rights; non-Jews are capable of achieving the exact same afterlife (to the extent Jews even believe in one, which is a point of conflict) by following a much smaller list of commandments (i.e. 7 or so, compared to the 613 required of Jews). Jews believe that they will live happier, more fulfilled lives if they abide by the rules they were \\"chosen\\" to uphold.This has been twisted into some sort of weird superiority myth. Sometimes it is twisted that way by extremist rabbis, but we don't define Judaism by the fringes any more than we define Islam by ISIS. Most of the time it is twisted by antisemitic neo-Nazis, who want to claim Jews think they are secret, powerful, and better than others. I also don't agree with \\"from the river to the sea\\" for basically all the same reasons. I don't understand how some people can act like antizionism and antisemitism are the same thing when one is bigotry and the other sounds more like simply being in favour of an ethnic cleansing.Zionism is not \\"ethnic cleansing\\". It is the belief that Jews deserve the internationally guaranteed human right of self-determination, like all other peoples, and that Israel is the expression of this right. Practically speaking, to undo it and undo Israel not only denies Jews that right, condemning Jews to forever-minority status again, it also means the very real consequences that come with that, i.e. the likely murder and ethnic cleansing of Jews. Anti-Zionism is the belief Israel should not exist, and that's where that ends.","title":"cmv: Zionism is violence"},{"text":"While /s, having biden fail so badly actually helped President Trumps chances.","title":"What are the main reasons Kamala lost?"},{"text":"Words have meaning. Even if Zionism advocated for violence it wouldn't itself be violence. And that all other demographics trying to live there should be forced out, as I understand it.Well, you are just wrong there. Zionism is a movement aimed at creating a national home for the Jewish people, governed by the Jewish people, in what they view as their ancestral homeland. That does not necessarily mean other groups must be forced out, it is just the practical reality that the area is mostly inhabited by Jew-hating Arabs that refuse to coexist that makes it seem required. but I dont believe in any chosen race, About 73% of Jews say they are Jewish by religion. That religion believes in a \\"chosen people\\" as agreed by their god. I am a pacifist.Then you are also foolish and your opinion doesn't really matter except via hypocrisy. I dont understand how some people can act like antizionism and antisemitism are the same thing when one is bigotry and the other sounds more like simply being in favour of an ethnic cleansing.They *aren't* the same thing, but also Zionism isn't what you think it is either.  Im conflicted because I know there is a lot I am not taking into account, but if there are people dying and being displaced then that is Bad.Clearly there should be a better solution. But if you think that ancestral claims to land aren't valid then what is the justification for not displacing people? That it is just a whole difficult process with inherent suffering?That reasoning would seem to imply that if I barged into your home and settled in, then because removing me would be uncomfortable to me then I can just stay. Your house is partly mine now.As absurd as that sounds I suppose you must agree because as a pacifist what else can you possibly do?","title":"cmv: Zionism is violence"},{"text":"I hope whoever the next Dem president is nominates her as department of Commerce or wherever she wants to be in the cabinet.

There was zero need for any violence of any kind.This would be akin to saying \\"people are attacking Mexican immigrants, therefore immigration is causing violence\\". It places the blame on immigration, instead of racist people committing those attacks. To me, as a Mexican, this all sounds awfully familiar to how the Spanish would say they were sent by God to conquer America, how is zionism different to the way colonizers would believe their lands to be \\"rightfully theirs\\"?The Spanish:1) Had no roots in the land.2) Did not have a continuous presence in the land.3) Did not have a historic homeland in the land.4) Did not have a multi-millennium history in the land.5) Did not arrive legally and peacefully, with permission of any sovereign government.All of these are very different factors alone, and together show the vast gulf. It is also incorrect to paint Israel as some religiously-motivated state. The founders of the state were only nominally religious, and were predominantly secular. So it is up for debate whether the jewish people should \\"collaborate\\" (which, correct me if I'm wrong, I assume means \\"coexist with on the same block of land\\") with anyone who isn't jewish? I feel like I'm still not getting the full picture, because it still sounds very wrong to me that the possibility of simply... deciding not to coexist is still on the table.Zionism as a concept viewed establishment of Jewish self-determination (a human right guaranteed to all) in Israel to be a paramount value.

His approval ratings have tanked to historic lows (around 15% in recent polls). Even his right-wing allies are starting to abandon him. Just last week, Gallant and other Likud members were openly calling for new elections.Most importantly, this theory ignores the massive risks. Deliberately allowing Hamas to massacre civilians would be actual treason. The Mossad and IDF would have evidence of this. Israeli intelligence officers are notorious leakers when it comes to political corruption - there's no way this stays hidden.I've worked in risk analysis for years.

As someone deeply committed to progressive values myself, I think it's crucial to understand that Zionism, at its core, is about the right to self-determination for a historically persecuted minority - the same principle we support for indigenous peoples worldwide.Your concern for Palestinian rights and opposition to violence is totally valid. But viewing Zionism as inherently violent misses how the movement originally emerged as a response to centuries of persecution, pogroms, and ultimately the Holocaust. It's similar to how many indigenous movements seek autonomy and safety, not dominance.Many progressive Zionists actively support a two-state solution and Palestinian rights. Look at organizations like Peace Now or B'Tselem - they're Zionist AND fight against occupation and discrimination. The idea that Zionism equals ethnic cleansing is like saying that Mexican nationalism inherently means opposing indigenous rights. Both can coexist - it's about implementation and respect for human rights.Plus, about 20% of Israeli citizens are Arab Palestinians with full rights. Clearly, Zionism isn't inherently about \\"forcing others out\\" - that's just one extreme interpretation, like equating all Palestinian nationalism with Hamas.I'd argue that opposing ALL forms of Zionism actually takes away agency from the many progressives working for peaceful coexistence and justice for all people between the river and the sea.","title":"cmv: Zionism is violence"},{"text":"Bush Jr is second and I don't see Biden over throwing him for that place.","title":"Americans Think History Will Rate Biden Presidency Negatively"},{"text":"The DNC party elites tried to install her all while trying to gaslight voters into believing they chose her.

Knowing that some people are just always going to be better than you at basketball is a good thing to spread and figure out.Likewise, some people are going to be more attractive and have better dating/sex opportunities than you for a bunch of reasons. Some you have control over (not being fat, not being an addict, having a good job, hygiene, etc.) others you don't have control over (attractive face, height, your personality/intellect/charisma can be worked on but there are limits).\\\\And that's effort in developing the parts of you that are fulfilling to you and attractive to others.Yeah somewhat. Again, there are limits of potential and things that we should accept.","title":"CMV: critical theory: 80% women dating top 20% men lacks helpful context"},{"text":"LoL, my grandson is gonna love this hes only nine but he loves Rickroll","title":"CMV: Biden got rickrolled by Netanyahu"},{"text":"Maybe if they stopped killing people, stealing land, and banning people from collecting rainwater they'd have less people wanting to blow them up.

A lot of men would do well to stop listening to people online and develop their own thoughts and opinions that view others as actual people. Too often men, especially young men, assume all women are X because of some women they know (maybe not even well) or see online. There's no advice that will work for everyone and the journey is different for each one of us. Dating at 22 is different than at 25 or 30. People mature and learn what they want and how to express that better. I find that discussing dating online, too many people are quick to make broad assumptions about things. Probably because of them being young and they assume life is always going to be the same. Two crucial pieces of advice for men when dating is to listen and respond to women. Don't talk at them. Create a real conversation where they feel heard. The second piece of advice is while you need to put effort into yourself, don't assume most women want the stereotypical image of a man or the image of a man that YOU think is attractive. You can see this in women's magazines where a guy who has muscles is not usually showing them off, but instead looking fashionable. They look strong and secure and welcoming. On top of those pieces of advice is that ultimately dating is tough on everyone and people would do a lot better if they viewed dating as a chance to see what they like rather than a test of whether someone they don't know well enough is going to reject them.

Those people aren't dating anyone on dating apps. Now, occasionally people who were in long term relationships break up and end up back in the dating pool, but if they have the qualities of a good partner and are looking for another relationship, they won't stay there long.Once you eliminate people who are partnered, you're left with a few categories to be on dating apps:1. Attractive men who will hook up with reasonably attractive women. These are the 20% of men in your 80/20.\\n2. Women who are open to hookups. These are most of the 80% of women in your 80/20.\\n3. Men who aren't attractive enough to get hookups, and aren't really fit for long term relationships.

Women who aren't interested in hookups, but don't make very good long term partners.

They were on their way to normalized relations with Saudi Arabia before 10/7 happened and Palestinians were not united. In that environment Israel was winning in its geopolitical aims. Hamas decided they had to do something desperate to end this and wanted to start a wider war and drag others onto their side. It was to end the status quo. They knew Israel would respond the way they did. They were counting on it.  I think Hamas did not calculate that Hezbollah would collapse the way it did, that Iran would be impotent and that Assad's regime would fall. They are not not left with much choice but a truce so they can regroup. Israel probably wants the international eye off them at this point, Israel's economy is now completely screwed up and of course Gaza is a complete mess. No one has really \\"won\\" everything is just in a depressing state right now. I would say Israel would much rather have the pre 10/7 environment and almost certainly the remaining members of Hamas would want that too. The 10/7 attack was mutual destruction.","title":"CMV: Biden got rickrolled by Netanyahu"},{"text":"Wont have to wait long","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden"},{"text":"House Democrats call on ICC to rescind arrest warrants for Nazi leaders after end of war","title":"House Democrats call on ICC to rescind arrest warrants for Israeli leaders"},{"text":"Bibi runs the world.

But let's be clear: these aren't Dems who are voting this way because they think trans people are icky and should kill themselves. They're voting this way because they feel their constituents think trans people are icky and should kill themselves.All of which said:From their point of view, giving them a \\"choice\\" is allowing them to cater for their constituents, who are, in their views, people who believe this evil crap. They can, like Republicans who'll happily vote for something their constituents hate and always be re-elected, just point at the system and say \\"I had to do it\\". They could even have simply sat on their hands.Giving them the choice on the other hand just made it possible for them to... choose the evil option.If the Democrats are going to get anywhere in the next two years, they're going to have to buck up and accept the Republican strategy actually works. Choices are for simpler, less fascistic, times.I don't know what those two congressfascists were told before this vote, but Jeffries and Clarke need to pull the entire party into a conference room, right now, and tell them those days are over, and pretending to vote your conscience isn't an option until norms are re-established. And anyone, anyone, ignoring a whip, can expect nothing from them in terms of party support for... anything. Just like Republicans would do.It's a change.

Part of the reason we got here is because people don't understand this issue and don't vote in their local elections. But you know who very *reliably* votes in local elections? Incumbent home-owners, who typically have an interest in restricting housing and reducing their tax burden as much as possible.We can change the outcome here, but you have to get involved, because when you don't, you're leaving the involvement to the people who do.The housing affordability crisis is largely a state and municipal issue. It's no coincidence that affordability has declined with few interruptions since the 1970's when the political climate shifted from being a pro-development one, to an anti-development one. The sad reality is that housing became an \\"I got mine\\" culture, once the initial suburbs got built out in the post-war period. This HAS to change, or we are doomed to a death-spiral of inflated housing costs and generational stratification.","title":"CMV: We will look back in 50 years and think the CEO to pay ratio was really low in 2025, compared to 2075 in the US."},{"text":"I am going to preface this comment with that I support Palestine, and I am convinced Isreal's actions in gaza constitute a genocide. I am not here to debate this part, just  didn't want to misrepresent myself. What's the alternative to Zionism for the Jewish Isreal's in the middle east? Like I think we want to assume there is some balance to co-exisiting, that a two nation state is possible, but is it? I recall a UN session where the Israeli representative was asking surrounding nations \\"where are your jews?\\", and it kind of struck me. The middle east nations have varying degrees of theocratic laws, we know many groups of people have been persecuted under these laws. From my understanding, the jewish populations had to flee Arabic nations to excape this persecution, and we know from history, few nations accept jewish refugees, so naturally many went to Israel.   \\nSo we have a situation where two reglious cultures with a history of  persecutions each other are in bloody conflict that hurts the everyday citizens on both sides. I agree both sides, including zionism, include an excessive use of violence, but simutaniously I think both sides have an element of self-defense/survival that I am not sure I would entirley count off as pure violance. .

Zionism pushed that Israel should be the homeland for Jews since Jews have been in a state of diaspora and persecuted for thousands of years in pretty much every location where they've tried to settle. This isn't about Jews trying to maintain a Jewish identity necessarily. For example, Hitler was more concerned with Jews that were trying to integrate into society and shed their Jewish identity than with actual Jews. He thought this would taint the Aryan bloodline. Really, very nasty stuff.   \\nIt turns out, that the best people to protect a minority are the people themselves. The Jews took it upon themselves to create a national identity in part of the Ottoman Empire, Palestine. That population grew and when the Ottoman Empire collapsed, the British took over the land. More and more Jews kept arriving and kept developing the area. Between 1939 and 1948 a ton of Jews fled Europe for Israel, the place where Jews were gaining a foothold and also, their ancestral home. In 1948 the British pulled out of the area, coinciding with the Jews of the area declaring the area a state for Jews, although not exclusive. Today more than 20% of Israelis are Arab (this does not include the areas considered to be modern Palestine). There is a lot of debate about Arabs being forced out of the lands that are now Israel but it's undeniable that a large percentage of Israelis are not Jews. They have the same rights on paper, although unfortunately there is discrimination. I ask you questions back....what should the Jews in Israel have done? Continue to be persecuted? Why is it not in the right of a group of people to claim a territory and protection for themselves to govern? Is that not the history of the world? Why should they not defend the land? History aside, what should modern day Jews in Israel do? These are almost all people who have no ties to any other country and had nothing to do with the founding of Israel. Should they dissolve Israel and await the genocide that the Arab World will certainly bring upon them? Should they flee and become refugees again? What if they get enough population density in an area...are they within their rights to establish a government somewhere else to protect their rights? Why do Arab countries get to persecute minorities in their territories, refusing to grant governance rights to people like the Kurds? Why can't Jews live in Muslim countries?","title":"cmv: Zionism is violence"},{"text":"I dont think thats what Rickrolled means but other than that, sure.","title":"CMV: Biden got rickrolled by Netanyahu"},{"text":"In your opinion should trans children be allowed to play sports?","title":"AOC Blasts Democrat Defections on GOP Bill to Ban Trans Women and Girls from School Sports - Trump hasnt even been sworn in yet, and if a little bitty sports bill was gonna make Dems defect, were not in good shape, said the New York lawmaker."},{"text":"Agree.

I mean, it is literally a movement that claims that a specific piece of land should only belong to a specific group of people, right? And that all other demographics trying to live there should be forced out, as I understand it.So I presume you mean here the state of Israel. Firstly Zionism does not mean this in its oldest, and in a sense truest, form. Zionism is simply the idea that Judaism is not only a religious philosophy but also a political one. The two are linked according to Zoinism, and as Jews they shoukd hold similar political ideas.Later on another dimension was added that there must also be a Jewish nation made again, in the same way there are Christian and Islamic nations. This was a more fringe idea initially until increased antisemitism before WW2, and the Shoah, made people decide that was a very good idea actually.Fundamentally though the concept had nothing to do with \\"forcing\\" other people out, at least not any more than Christian and Islamic nations do so. (And they do so, that's what deportation is.). In fact demographic wise there are many non Jews living in Israel right now, and many of them are Arabs. Many of those in turn are Palestinians. And Zionism is all about hurting and displacing people from their homeland because Israelis don't want to coexist with them, right?Again, no. Also Israel does want to co exist with other groups, they already do so. And you'll find the only group here usually agreeing or suggesting ceasefire and peace agreements is Israel. Most (if not all) of those old border deals you've seen were rejected by the Palestinian representatives.At its core Zionism is just the ides that there shoukd he a Jewish name, and critiquing it woukd ential also critiquing other nations for doing the same thing. There are Christian majority nations where if you don't meet their cultural standards and norms you similarly may be forced to leave, even if born there for example.","title":"cmv: Zionism is violence"},{"text":"When you realize that Biden picked her for a reason shes so bad she would never be able to steal his job everything makes sense.","title":"What are the main reasons Kamala lost?"},{"text":"Obama has class for miles.

Maybe 3% of that 20% is only in Germany; that would mean that women there are still chasing the top percentage. The 20% range is to cater to different demographics; maybe someone really likes a guy with a good physique and a good paycheque, maybe someone just cares if hes caring about the environment, maybe its none of those things. Point still stands: women date up. Thats true online and offline. Over 60% of men under the age of 30 are single. Not even remotely the same for women. In other words, a little under 37% of men under 30 are being dated by around 66% of women. So what, the gotcha moment is that women date the 76th percentile and higher, not the 80th percentile and higher? Glad we threw that 4% in, makes all the difference.The context to apply isnt well dating apps suck for men, the context to apply is that male gender norms in dating have remained stagnant. Women know theyve remained stagnant and women have not even bothered to put in the effort to change them. Then when a feminist style movement for men comes around to change that, its dismissed as sexism. Their wants and needs are reduced to children wanting to get a birthday cake at every other kids party, not adults who want some guarantees that any woman who gets lucky with a faulty condom doesnt get his money for the better part of two decades. Hell, even just wanting to split a bill at a dinner is frowned upon.

Or they feel like it makes them look like they aren't pretty enough to get a boyfriend if they have to resort to online dating. Or they are too smart to participate in online dating because they know men are going to outnumber them and flood their inbox.What? This is just making a very dumb assumption that women who use dating apps have something wrong with them. Dating apps have shitty pricing models because they finally need to make money after years of low interest rates and building a user base. Same with all the apps that have been around for 10+ years now. Going to a bar or a club or using an app is just one way to meet women and has their advantages and disadvantages. Paying $20 or 30 per month for a dating app isn't that bad tbh. It's not great, but ultimately it saves you time. The 80/20 BS is built on misrepresented data and the reality that when men outnumber women 3:1 on an app, there will be more men who are not getting matches. However, we don't know why the men who get matches or don't get matches are in that situation. I've seen plenty of women with bad profiles and I assume the same for men. I'd bet that many men don't put effort into their profile to actually make it seem like they're someone worth swiping. The internet has convinced a bunch of young men that there's some hierarchy in dating or flaw within themselves because people go off of what strangers are telling them as the truth. Dating apps are one tool you have access too. Some people may not do well on them, but they're also helpful to many. Extremely helpful context would be to approach dating the way women do. Just spend an enormous amount of effort on your appearance, then make women approach you.This is horrible advice. This reduces women to their appearance and doesn't actually view them as people. No wonder you are struggling to date. Building confidence, being a good listener, being fun to be around, taking care of yourself both physically and emotionally, dressing well, having passions/interests, that helps you find a partner in the short term and long term.

This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity. I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran  but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done. Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamass October 7th attack, and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed. It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin. I am also if thinking of the American families, three of whom have living hostages in Gaza and four awaiting return of remains after what has been the most horrible ordeal imaginable. Under this deal, we are determined to bring all of them home.  I will speak more about this soon. For now, I am thrilled that those who have been held hostage are being reunited with their families.","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden"},{"text":"It's over.","title":"Jill Biden Cryptically Addresses Disappointing Nancy Pelosi Friendship"},{"text":"I mean she wasn't at Carter's funeral either.

Effective or not...the subsequent rise of the interest rate to 20% was guaranteed to break the economy and create that 1970s malaise.  Not sure what was expected, but Reagan is remembered so fondly because OPEC caved to 20% rates and the petro-dollar was born, and the US defended the oil trade with our carriers as a result.  Eventually guaranteeing Gulf War 1, with all the allies joining.   Those rate drops left people thinking Reagan did something for them - it was financial policy that no longer needed to be so tight now that the World Reserve Currency was back in the US hands securely even without gold.\\nMOST, people, even fairly well educated do not see this as the reasons for Carter years not being great years, but they don't correlate the past to the present.   \\nLike the Glass-Steagal Act...which barred banks who took deposits from the working class (checking/savings) from playing investment bank and gambling your savings.   Created after 1929 depression... Clinton (and Gingrich) disolved it....only took 10yrs for the 2008 crash to put everything in jeopardy again.  You could point at Bush as the reason, but no - while he did nothing to shore up the system again, the culprit was Clinton.  Obama didn't fix it either, he just put a bandaid of a buffer in place in case the future got ugly again.   The bandaid was ripped off in May 2020 and we are open to another 2008 now with no reserve required (well it is, legally, but the number is $0).\\nBiden did nothing to stop that, Trump sure didn't either...so it goes.\\nSee the big picture... JFK got us into the Vietnam War...sent us to the Moon...overspent and the French called the gold window asking for their gold back.  Nixon said DeGaulle (French president) could pound sand and the USA was suddenly no longer trusted financially.  It was France's gold too - sent to Fort Knox during WW2, and the rule was the US dollar could be exchange for gold at will (creating that US Dollar reserve currency).  It took both Ford and Carter to along with the Fed chair Paul Volcker to buy the worlds trust back at an eventual 21% prime rate (1981). Reagan just got to spend out of it with tax cuts and military spending that ended up bankrupting the Soviet Union trying to keep up.   So folks felt meh about Carter, and great about Reagan...but Reagan was forcing the spending that Carter couldn't.  Clinton was playing off the continued lower interest rates (40yrs of that low rate platform from Alan Greenspan after Volcker).   We remember them fondly just cuz the money flowed easier or they spoke well.  Right now, with 3%+ inflation we should be keeping rates high to bring back financial trust in the US, taxing the rich to pay for all those low rates...but no one wants the pain...and Trump and Jerome Powell will please the corps/banks leading to the same Nixon/like malaise in the future...or worse.","title":"Biden always delivers!"},{"text":"Sorry, I can't get behind the idea that Biden is more somehow more responsible for Trump's actions than Trump.","title":"Americans Think History Will Rate Biden Presidency Negatively"},{"text":"The other party has just as strict purity tests, if not stricter.

The tea party and later trump arose because Republican voters did not feel the Republican establishment was doing enough to stop the opposition.  That republican establishment is now completely gone.  Yes Democrats lost the election, but tens of millions of people still voted for them.  These people deserve political representation, and they did not vote for Dems to be a trump lite party.

I think it will come down to how much of it you believe is the conspiracy. I 100% believe that these planes were flown into the towers/pentagon. I believe the towers fell because of the force of the impact, high temperature of burning, and the shortcuts they took while building the towers. They built them during a time where regulations were changing and they claimed since they started before the changes, they could proceed with the plans. As for some of the \\"odd\\" things like finding the passport and such, sometimes things are just random. It was luck the pentagon was being renovated so not as many people were there just like it was luck some people were late to their jobs in the tower, or unlucky because they were at the towers for the first time.What I'm not sold on is that we royally messed up our defensive capabilities and preparation. IIRC, we had some knowledge that an attack was coming and agencies didn't talk to eachother about threats received, etc. Like if we knew a threat was possible, I can understand doing lots of training missions like those pilots were doing without got weapons. But why not have reserves available in an instant WITH hot weapons? If there's a conspiracy I believe, it's that the government should have known about the attacks and stopped them but either ignored evidence or the right people weren't told.I think it also showed how bad our communication between areas was. If you listen to air traffic controllers and those conversations, they misidentify one of the planes and then that gets passed along as fact. They call the one office about being real world and he says \\"hey, hey, hey I got something big here. Like BIG\\". ATC couldn't talk with the FBI or anybody without going through crazy channels, it was a cluster.I do think the Bush administration took advantage of the situation in the Middle East though and they used that fear to push that war and WMDs. I think it's a long shot to say the bin laden raid was part of it as well because that means Bush and Obama had to both be in on it, and we know party lines don't allow that.I'm someone who likes to see data and experiments and evidence of that sort. I know building 7 is a hot talking point and I'm under the belief the building folded like the others based on heat/burning from debris. Why that building and not the other ones south of the towers? I'm not sure. But it was a tall enough building that if the top started to cave it could take down the whole building. 5-10 story buildings that are very wide don't do that as easily.That guy who took out the insurance policy on failing buildings right before everything happened always did stand out to me though... that part is very odd","title":"My girlfriend wont even consider than 9/11 was likely an inside job."},{"text":"Again?","title":"One last Biden W! ??"},{"text":" brought to you by Pfizer.I think you mean Carl's Jr","title":"AOC Blasts Democrat Defections on GOP Bill to Ban Trans Women and Girls from School Sports - Trump hasnt even been sworn in yet, and if a little bitty sports bill was gonna make Dems defect, were not in good shape, said the New York lawmaker."},{"text":"Trump gets to start with a perfectly clean slate, but, mark my words, he will find a way to throw it all away.","title":"One last Biden W! ??"},{"text":"Yup.

The NAS/NRC reported that the intake at the 50th percentile was 11%, and the 90th percentile was 41%, of that reported for the top 1% (35). Thus half of the population may consume sufficient Red No. 3 to produce a tissue concentration approximately 3 times greater than that necessary to cause genetic damage to human cells in culture, and 10% of the population consumes approximately 12 times more. Even if there is a 5-fold overestimation in the consumption of Red No. 3, the daily intake of Red No. 3 would still be 6 times greater than that required to produce risk-enhancing effects in vitro for the top 1% and approximately 2 times greater for the top 10%. Perhaps more important, the reported intake from young childhood through puberty was actually higher than for the total population: approximately 1.6 to 2.5 mg/kg/day at the 90th percentile (adjusted to 1995 estimates as above). Thus, during growth and development the intake of Red No. 3 may actually be higher than that necessary to induce p53 binding for greater than 10% of the population at a time when developing breast tissues may be most susceptible to xenobiotic challenge.\\"[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1469907/pdf/envhper00328-0073.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1469907/pdf/envhper00328-0073.pdf)This was a cellular study.

For example if we look at the three different branches of government, the last time we had even a 5-4 majority in the Supreme Court was sixty years ago. And yet conservatives have had Court majorities as high as 8-0 but usually in the 6-3 or 7-2 range for that time. If we take that into account, then Democrats have only actually won when we had control of the presidency, the Senate, and the House, which has been like four years total? Depending if you count Senate control as 50/50 or 60/40.\\nAlso if Republicans are breaking things and Democrats are fixing them, then we're still doing very little to actually improve things. Which means that Republican policies are still winning.\\nAn example of this is how Republicans have illegally gerrymandered minority districts to steal votes from Black citizens. Courts have determined this to be the case and directed maps redrawn back to what they should be. But this *still* means that those votes were lost, for all the years it took this case to conclude!

Its the Dunning-Kruger effect. Not stupid people think theyre super smart, because they dont realize how little they know, then they learn more and realize how stupid they are, then they learn more and slowly build back up their self-confidence. Thats a separate thingThe real Dunning-Kruger effect is how you view your intelligence *relative to others.* If I ask some random guy off the street how much the know about quantum physics, theyre not gonna say they know as much as an expert. Almost everyone will say they know next to nothing about it- in defiance of the fake Dunning-Kruger effect. But if you ask them if they think theyre specifically *above average,* then nearly everyone will say that they are, because nearly everyone thinks that the average person knows essentially nothing, so if they know *anything,* theyll think they know more than averageThe thing is, to be able to compare yourself to others in terms of how much knowledge or skill you have at a given subject (whether math or warfare), you have to already know that subject. Which means if you dont have that knowledge youre doomed to misjudge both your and everybody elses skill and knowledgeThis isnt a governance problem, per se, but a nigh-insurmountable problem embedded in decision-making itself. Even world leaders (democratic or otherwise) cannot but succumb to it- just look at how top scientists keep bumbling about when speaking outside of their fields and making a fool of themselves. On the other hand, look at how military juntas or terrorist groups or similarly dictatorial warlike groups govern. They know warfare, sure, but not economics or healthcare or infrastructure. Not how to govern- not even how to delegate to those who know better, because they cant identify themBut there is a cure. Evolution. Worst-case scenario where you have a buncha democracies bumbling blindly around because no one can figure out how to do what, inevitably by sheer chance some will end up more correct than others, which will benefit them more, which will cause their influence to spread as others seek to mimic them. Its largely how the US became so powerful after WWII. They had the exact same problem youre describing then as we have now. But they happened to make the right choices at the right time to finance WWII while staying mostly out of it, causing everyone to give us their gold and then pegging their currencies to ours while ours was pegged to gold so we became an economic powerhouse that everybody relied on (until France decided to cash in on that gold standard and bought way too much of our gold back). Meanwhile we also got sucked in at the end and strove for the nuclear bomb as a result, eventually getting it and thereby becoming a *military* powerhouse at the exact same timeSo were the lets not go to war people acting based on a high-tier understanding of war that we somehow lack today? No! They just happened to get the form of it right. Did the lets go to war people operate based on some high-tier understanding or warfare? No! They chose that route because we got attacked, not because they understood warfare. Did the people who said to finance ur allies do it because they had advanced understanding of the intricacies of economics? Yeah, actually, probably; that was pretty well understood at the time. But did Nixon take us off the gold standard because he was a god of foresight? No! He should have crashed the world economy according to the most advanced economic theories of the time and it was basically a miracle it worked!. Or maybe he *was* operating based on sound reasoning and experience; Im not educated in economics and dont know what Im talking about, after all; Im only bumbling around in the dark, wholly unable to tell if *any* knowledge I have is actually above average or if Im just suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect- same as everyoneBy by having various democracies doing what they can to strive along (and, importantly, trying slightly different strategies) well inevitably bumble our way forwards to evolutionary successTheres a lot more to consider- like game theory, which can help us optimize our systems to exploit this method of advancement as best we can, or the dangers of *non* democracies evolving, also- but this is a good start for something thats already gone on too long","title":"CMV: Civilians not understanding war and international affairs is a severe threat to the democratic world"},{"text":"Just wait til news gets out that he secured a peace deal in the middle east.

This is not a good look for a party that touts itself as representing the working class. The corporate Democrats that have controlled the DNC for 30 years have abandoned the very voters that they need to get elected to office. You can't expect people to line up at the polls to vote for the lesser of two evils, especially when that lesser evil party is promising more of the same policies that have economically crippled the very voters that they need.

Just two years ago, Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit against Fox News showed that many right-wing influencers didnt believe a word of the stuff they were peddling to their audiences. In text messages that surfaced during litigation, top Fox anchors and executives poured scorn on the idea that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen, even as the network amplified that conspiracy theory to its audience. Our viewers are good people and they believe it, Tucker Carlson wrote in one message.Today, though, some of the countrys most mainstream, most influential conservatives are stoking paranoid conspiracismand seem to genuinely believe what theyre saying.The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, for example, could not be more of an establishment figure: He was an early investor in Facebook, is now a mentor of Vice PresidentCElect J. D. Vance, and has strong links to the U.S. defense industry through his company Palantir. But in a recent opinion column in the ultra-establishment *Financial Times,* Thiel sounds like The X-Files Fox Mulder after a long night in the Bigfoot forums. The future demands fresh and strange ideas, he writes.After Donald Trumps second inauguration, Thiel implies, we might finally know the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and whether the coronavirus was a bioweapon. Thiel notes that the internet also has questions about the death of the well-connected sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ? Thiel wants large-scale declassifications and a truth-and-reconciliation commission, in the model of South Africas reckoning with apartheid Thiel portrays Trumps resurgence as a defeat for the Distributed Idea Suppression Complex, or DISChis friend and employee Eric Weinsteins term for legacy media outlets and nongovernmental organizations that supposedly prevent politically inconvenient truths from reaching the public. Thanks to the internet, information can no longer be suppressed Until recently, I had assumed that the anti-establishment sentiments promoted by Thiel and others were merely opportunistic, a way for elites to stoke a form of anti-elitism that somehow excluded themselves as targets of popular rage. Thiel has always made a point of entertaining provocative heterodox opinions, but he has also demonstrated himself to be eloquent, analytical, and capable of going whole paragraphs without saying something unhinged. But reading his *Financial Times* column, I thought: My God, he actually believes this stuff. The entire tone is reminiscent of a stranger sitting down next to you on public transit and whispering that the FBI is following him.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/KjmfWo7l](https://theatln.tc/KjmfWo7l)","title":"MAGAs Demon-Haunted World"},{"text":"That was Lucas Haas in Everyone Says I Love You.

That doesn't mean any of us were OK with whoever blew them up with thermite. Which is homicide by the way. A crime in New York. When we are confronted with two facts, both of which we hold to be true, but which conflict with each other, that is called cognitive dissonance. It produces an uncomfortable thought process. Often the response is denial. Anything else is not the path of least resistance. This is used as leverage by the unscrupulous.An example of this would be 1. My Government is here to protect me and in fact me and my family are utterly under their control safety-wise, and 2. Someone just blew up the World Trade Center killing 3000 people and the government is not only lying about it, they probably did itOn the other side of that coin, this is one of the features of a good lie. Make questioning the lie unpatriotic or against Jesus teachings or disrespectful to our troops/first responders... something and voila, no trial. So questioning 9/11 isn't \\"disrespectful to firefighters.\\" NOT questioning 9/11 is disrespectful to firefighters. It's like if I said someone killed a guy.

It's wrong to force people from their homes because of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other immutable characteristic. The Arab/ Middle Eastern states that pushed their Jewish populations out or ethnically cleansed them should not only pay reparations to the families of those people, but offer them citizenship and to rebuild their communities. Likewise, Israel should offer citizenship to any descendant of a Palestinian ethnically cleansed from their home and to pay reparations for all the Lost property that was seized by Jewish settlers for the state.That's why I wouldn't say that either one is worse because it's a tragedy and a horror for any family to be forced to leave their home. However, the situations were quite different. The primary difference being that Israel actively wanted Middle Eastern Jews to emigrate. Israel planned for the immigration of Middle Eastern Jews and actively sought to recruit them. Israel is also credibly accused of exacerbating tension to create the sort of crisis that led whole communities to flee to Israel. While the Palestinians were simply fleeing war and terrorism Middle Eastern Jews were fleeing to a place where they knew they would be accepted and be part of a project of building a Jewish state. Finally, it's also important to remember that every country was different. It wasn't just that they were expelling Jewish families though some places like Libya did do that. In Algeria, all French citizens were expelled and the French had made the Algerian Jewish population into citizens. The Iraqi government tried to prevent Jewish families from moving to Israel. Also, Jewish refugees often had more choice about where they were going to go other than just wherever they could walk to. Another point I'd like to address is that you seem to imply that Arabs are responsible for starting the war in 47, so it's their fault that they ended up becoming refugees. I just want to point out that that's a justification for collective punishment. If you accept that civilians that had no influence over the policy of the surrounding Arab states or even the Palestinian militias are responsible for starting a war then how is that different than the Muslim governments blaming Jewish people for conspiring with their enemy simply because they were Jewish? It's all nonsense because you cannot hold people accountable for the actions of others just because they're the same ethnicity or religion. The last thing that I want to address is when you were talking about reparations you said that Israel offered to allow some refugees to return. That's technically true, but in context it's irrelevant. During the ceasefire negotiations after the 48 War Israel was compelled by the United States to make some sort of offer to allow refugees to return. They offered to allow a small fraction of the refugees not to return to their homes but to become citizens if they were allowed to annex Gaza and all the Arab states recognized the borders that Israel had unilaterally determined. Furthermore of the $100,000 they were going to allow to return. They were going to subtract all the people who had already snuck back in and the refugees in Gaza. It wasn't a real offer and it wouldn't have done very much for the vast majority of the refugees even had it been.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

First of all, you say that the US has sent $70Billion per year to Israel. That is objectively false. The cumulative economic military aid that the US sent to Israel from 1946 to 2022 was $138Billion ([Source](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf), on page 47). That is a far cry from the trillions of dollars that you claim.Also, your claim that disaster victims in the US only got $750 is false. This amount was merely for IMMEDIATE relief, meaning essentials like food, water and medicine. People could apply for additional relief after the fact. [Here is a fact check](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-viral-claims-in-the-wake-of-the-hurricane-helene-disaster/a-70433338) that goes into more detail.So far you have been wildly off on your facts. But i'm willing to empathize with your general point that the average US worker could be better off with other policies. Here's the thing: You are not going to get that with Trump.I always try to be as objective as possible with policy proposals and try not to get my personal opinion to cloud my judgement. This is especially easy with tax proposals, because those are black and white. Just raw numbers. [Here is a little analysis](https://itep.org/kamala-harris-donald-trump-tax-plans/) on the changes of the income tax burden.So with Trump, the tax burden will **INCREASE for everyone making less than $360,000**, while Kamala's plan would've **LOWERED the tax burden for everyone making less than $914,000**. Now you might say \\"okay but wouldn't Kamala's tax proposals have raised the national debt?\\" - excellent question.[Here is another analysis](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans) from an independant organization that compared Trump's and Kamala's impact on the national debt. They calculated that Trump will increase the national debt by around **$7.75Trillion on average**, with a worst case of $15.5Trillion. Kamala would've increased the debt by **$3.95Billion on average**, with a worst case of $8.3Trillion.Your primary concern seems to be excess spending. Well in that case, voting for Trump was a bad idea. And again, i'm not trying to win an argument here. I'm merely presenting you with the facts. Because you need the facts to make an informed decision as a democratic citizen.

The American middle class has been plundered by corporations (both foreign and domestic) years resulting in a four (going on five now) stagnation in average wages when adjusted for inflation.

And to distract from the plight of the failing middle class they start wars or focus on social issues.  The books on Karl Rove , Bush's Brain and the Architect, shows the Machiavellian use by politicos to use social issues (in this case gay marriage) coupled with military actions to distract the general population from economic stagnation in the middle class, crumbling infrastructure, failing school, mounting personal and federal debt, etc.Trump, Pelosi, and all the neoliberal lovers of laissez-faire economics will let you die like a dog in the streets and sell your children's future to corporate oligarchs who offer only a techno dystopian theocracy (they are all \\"finding god\\" and taking adult karate classes) and financed by Bitcoin (or any future financial hustle).","title":"House Passes Bill To Ban Trans Athletes From Participating In Women's Sports With 206 Dems Opposing"},{"text":"Divide and Conquer.

If we as a nation have a problem with other non-friendly countries making a money off of our citizens, well, we have a much bigger problem than the pocket change China makes from Tiktok. For crying out loud, our entire consumer economy is predicated on cheap goods from Asia (and yeah  China), about 80% of non-perishable things you buy in Walmart and Target come from China and goes straight into their pockets.With that, I am saying that is a silly concern to have and its possible you already know that, but lead with it anyway.I think the concern for our data falling into Chinas hands is equally silly, as we have American companies that have already knowingly sold our data to 3rd party companies in other nations outside of the US. There is nothing stopping China from buying the data from Meta or Twitter and no reason to believe the owners of those companies wouldnt easily oblige.But doing something about that to Meta or Twitter would constitute changing their entire business model but with TikTok its ban! (it wouldnt change their business model, it would just make who they sell the data to more transparent and open to more scrutiny and blockage). These reasons seem to support silly and seemingly nationalistic reasons that amounts to, as I mentioned, just China Bad.Even further, as you mentioned, its not just ban, its sell Tiktok to us  or ban!  You benignly called it divesting. I think it has a more Orwellian reason.At its heart, the divestment talk is my main problem, as Congress and those behind them could care less about the damage it causes or any national security issues or any of the above nationalistic reasons. They are basically playing the business extortion game because they want it.  And by they, I mean the American Oligarchy, as they are the ones pushing Congress to do this. As it is their belief that If anybody is going to manipulate Americans, it is going to be us, for our greed and for our goals.Tiktok is the last big piece of media not in the hands of American Oligarch friendly hands and they are willing to lie, cheat and steal to get it (or force Congress to do it under the guise nationalism). As they are ALL IN on ramping up our shift to Technocratic Feudalism, have seen that Social Media is a nuclear weapon in terms of propaganda and are saying give me or get lost. And if China doesnt like it and are pissed about it, they can talk to any one of our 11 Nuclear Aircraft Carrier Groups to lodge a complaint.So, to end, I am very much against the banning of Tiktok and its sell it to us or else extortion, on top of the flat out dangerous precedent of yelling our enemy is doing  \\\\[insert whatever\\\\] as an convenient and easy way to ban something the powers that be dont like.The fact that more of fuss isnt being made is both scary and completely expected in our current (dis) information climate.And yes, a lot of people make money on Tiktok in the US and waving that away as well they should get a real job if they want some money then is both such an arrogant and a naive thing to say it borders on the ridiculous.  But this is the internet, where the ridiculous is made more normal everyday, much to the detriment of this nation and the world at-large.

It has not been a full 20 years that I've known what transgender even meant.In my experience in the US the word had always been used to refer to crossdressing comedically-hyper-effeminate gay men and there were no trans people with mainstream positions in society to say otherwise. And it was something almost universally considered offensive to the senses, something to mock, something where you're allowed to beat and kill people for it and society would look the other way. And it wasn't something that spoke to my thoughts and feelings.When I met an actual trans person, I asked a lot of questions. And the responses revealed not only words for something that no part of society had been willing or able to educate me on, but words that resonated with my own experiences.More and more trans people are coming out because more people are learning for the first time that the thing that would make them happy is actually possible","title":"Rep.

The role of stereotypes is that, day to day, we often need to act without complete information and it would be truly exhausting and impossible to always get complete information. We stereotype because it's impractical to function day to day always getting complete evidence about everything, instead we *need* to make assumptions in order to function and a stereotype is just our understanding of the best starting assumptions to make until we do gather evidence. The things you mention are different problems. In fact, they continue to be problem even if you don't stereotype because fundamentally, they are about refusing to update one's view (whether it was a stereotype or not).If I go to the store, there is a good chance I'll see a toddler throwing a crazy tantrum saying something horrible about their parent. If I didn't stereotype, I'd have to fully investigate each case. It would basically prevent me from going to the store, ruin a lot of parents trips to the store, perhaps waste police resources, etc. But using my stereotypes, I can know that the odds that that's just an everyday tantrum toward a loving parent are extremely high. That doesn't prevent me from noticing additional clues in some cases that might hint at it being something more, but it makes it feasible for me and others to function in everyday life.Similarly, if we didn't stereotype that parents love their children, it wouldn't even make sense to design society in a way where parents are given their children by default and given choices about their children by default. Instead, it'd make sense to have society take children by default until parents could affirmatively prove they love their kids. And again, the point is partly about *resources*. The resources in order to start from scratch with every parent, investigate them and determine if they love their kids are orders of magnitude more than the resources to try to identify problem cases and investigate those. Since we allocate finite resources to child protective services, this means that this stereotyping helps us allocate resources more effectively. It doesn't prevent us from changing our stereotypes in the face of data (e.g. child sex abuse being more likely to come from a relative than a stranger) or re-classifying somebody we stereotyped as good once we get reports about them, but it does help us triage the real world using decent approximations in order to get the most out of our limited resources.Also, stereotypes aren't just passive. The stereotypes of mothers loving their children isn't just an observation we have of mothers that concerns what we think about them. The stereotype itself becomes an archetype that mothers are pressured into filling and shamed for not filling, which may impact the way that people parent or even who decides to become parents.Stereotypes are an issue when either (1) they are not actually good approximations of the group (e.g. assuming women are bad drivers), (2) there was no need/rush to make an assumption in the first place (e.g. assuming a person is a jerk because of the car they are driving) or (3) the stakes would justify a real investigation rather than a stereotype (e.g. stereotyping a doctor by race when hiring them).","title":"CMV: \\"X character is Y-coded\\" is just a socially-acceptable version of stereotyping."},{"text":"Her husband already did that for her at Carters funeral.

While I appreciate being open minded, changing your mind because of being misinformed also leaves you open to the first few cogent arguments you hear. Its good to know youre out of your depth, its not good to be impressionable because of that.Youre failing to recognize that divestment was an option. It wasnt an outright ban, it was a call for Chinese ties to bytedance to be eliminated or face the reality of a ban. Why would we allow a government to literally make money off our citizens when that government is our adversary. I agree with almost everything else you said, but dont think that banning TikTok is the end all be all. Its not a ban it was a if you want access to American markets, youre going to have to have the CCP divest. I get what youre saying with the whole Cambridge argument, and youre right, but we can have two things be true here. We can say hey, other countries that are adversaries of our nation, you cant own or be a stakeholder in companies that have access to data that shows how our citizens think and, hey, we need better privacy protections so that Facebook/META and X/Elon dont have the same ability to do what we feared China was doing. The two arent mutually exclusive. Not to mention, forcing meta and/or X to change their entire business model in order to ensure better privacy protections is just as big of an intrusion as requiring a divestments by a large nation-state stakeholder. Youre making this an either or when it doesnt have to be.

The problem is that the Laken Riley Act requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain such people when they are merely accused of nonviolent crimes like burglary, theft, and shoplifting\\nbefore they are found guilty or innocentThis is a feature not a bug. Illegals are supposed to be scared to caught by the government. They are illegal whether they committed another crime or not. If you see something, say something! Call ICE. Make these people realize actions have consequences.  and even if the agency believes enforcement resources would be better targeted at serious criminals. Detention would put these immigrants on the path to deportation.Obviously we have different ideas of what serious criminals are. Yes, they are being put on the path to deportation that is the point.  They are illegal and not allowed to be here. The Democrats whine Trump didn't get a sentence  while at the exact same time refusing to enforce federal law. It is beyond hypocritical. \\"Rules for thee but not for me!\\"If you want law and order this is law and order.

But let's look at how we got here:The Republicans didn't set this trap. This is the logical outcome of 50 years of immigration policy. The Democrats and Republicans have strung this issue out over decades to use it as political capital.  Just so it's clear:The Biden Admin won a supreme court case that allows immigrants to be detained indefinitely. It has always been this way, but this was the Supreme Court cementing it. So the Democrats fought to keep the power that this law relies on. This law forces illegal immigrants to be detained.Deportation is not considered a criminal matter,  immigration courts have no right to a speedy trial. Immigration court has no right to an attorney. It seems cruel. But at the same time,  the person being detained can voluntarily leave at any time prior to the start of deportation proceedings.  Hence why those things have been held to not apply. Whether you think this is right or wrong.  This is just another one of those things that has ended up this way over decades of both parties running the country and using a special interest issue as a pawn and a sideshow. In the grand scheme of things,  neither party has shown any interest or care in fixing the problems with immigration,  and the 'judicial' system backing it.","title":"Trump Just Laid a Brutal Trap for Dems, and Theyre Walking Into It"},{"text":"I always enjoy it when they put a microphone in front of Mazie Hirono.  /s","title":"Hegseth Hearing Shows Dems Are Unserious About U.S. Security"},{"text":"I wasn't trying to imply that minors getting surgery is even remotely the norm.

But here's what you're missing: ByteDance has already invested over $1.5 billion in \\"Project Texas,\\" moving U.S. user data to Oracle servers ON American soil. They're literally doing exactly what you're asking for. The data is already being stored here, under U.S. jurisdiction, so your argument actually supports keeping TikTok operational under proper oversight.On polarization - you shared a Reddit post about hashtag manipulation, but let's look at the official congressional testimony: In March 2024, TikTok's transparency reports showed their content moderation system removes extremist content at a higher rate than Meta or X. The numbers don't lie - they're actually doing more to combat polarization than American companies.Regarding the \\"dangerous precedent\\" - you're right that the government has banned companies before, but those bans were based on concrete violations of specific laws. The TikTok ban is unprecedented because it's targeting a company based on its country of origin rather than any proven wrongdoing. That's why the Supreme Court is scrutinizing this so carefully.About those 170 million users - you called this \\"catastrophizing,\\" but let's look at the hard data: According to the Small Business Administration's 2024 report, 37% of American small businesses under $1 million in revenue use TikTok as their primary marketing platform. That's not just influencers - we're talking about local restaurants, boutiques, and service providers who've built their entire marketing strategy around this platform. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the ban could result in $23 billion in lost revenue for small businesses in the first year alone.Here's what it comes down to: If the concern is national security, we already have the tools. CFIUS oversight, Oracle's server control, and existing data privacy laws give us multiple layers of protection. What we don't have is any evidence that TikTok has actually shared U.S. user data with China, despite years of investigations.You want comprehensive reforms? Great. But banning TikTok while ignoring identical data collection practices by American companies isn't reform - it's selective enforcement that hurts American businesses while doing nothing to protect our data.These aren't talking points - these are verifiable facts supported by government reports, economic data, and legal documents. The question isn't whether we should protect American data - we absolutely should. The question is whether this ban actually accomplishes that goal, or if it's just security theater that causes more harm than good.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"Meanwhile forty years of deficit exploding tax cuts for trust fund babies and the corporations they inherit still hasn't created millions of great paying jobs.","title":"House Passes Bill To Ban Trans Athletes From Participating In Women's Sports With 206 Dems Opposing"},{"text":"Look.

The institution of marriage historically arose to moderate the responsibilities tied to childbearing, as sex and thus relationships can lead to the creation of dependent human lives. In order to protect children and ensure stable family structures, laws guide these relationships. Polygamy, most often involving one man with multiple wives, presents challenges similar to the ones found in single-parent households. It specifically mimics the structure of the single-mother household. A man in a polygamous structure  has to divide his material and emotional resources among many partners and children, which weakens the stability and psychological support that is absolutely critical for positive child outcomes. Vast amounts of data consistently show that children fare better in stable, two-parent households.

People tend to forget that when they use a non-noun form of the word \\"respect\\". For example, \\"Respect your elders,\\" means, \\"Ensure that your behavior toward your elders is what it would be if you had respect for them and if nothing else was influencing your behavior.\\" There's no meaningfully shorter way of expressing it that's reasonably complete. Also, respect is not, or not entirely, a matter of choice, so we should allow it to directly influence our behavior only when there truly isn't time to arrive at a conclusion instead.So, why is it worth mentioning that you respect everyone's religion and beliefs? What does that mean? You're fine with them killing homosexuals and marrying children as long as they do it only in certain countries? I'm not. I have the opposite of respect for that behavior. I have contempt for that behavior, regardless of where it happens. So, instead of simply allowing them to relocate and continue supporting evil behavior and sometimes engaging in it themselves, what should be done?","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"Good for hard-working women who want to compete.

As a people we were not given the choice to contribute to the war. They took taxes were forced to pay and gave them to other countries. Hell once the money/weapons are sent it cant be tracked after leaving the US.      No one Ive seen online or in life has acknowledged this at all. Not only that but US and UK (Borris Johnson) broke down peace talks and communication between two countries at war. Ukraine is not huge and the average age of soldiers kept increasing because the young keep dying in the field. We pay for their weapons, food programs, future infrastructure etc.      Switching lanes from Ukraine to Israel we have done the same thing if not more because Israel receives 70B from the US every year for 70 years now. We have sent trillions to Ukraine and Israel and before around end of 2023 beginning of 2024 Biden was making weapons deals with Ukraine every 13 hours for months. No one has questioned any of the things brought up.      We hate Trump! Trump sucks hes only for the rich etc etc. we focus on someone who hasnt even taken office yet when it comes to the dumb motherfvckers who have been in office for 4 years the majority doesnt question them or their actions. Trillions sent to Ukraine Israel and illegal immigrants, our taxes given to them without our consent yet no one hates Biden just Trump.      We have been screwed over for 4 years straight but the moment you say anything opposing Dems/supporting Trump its a problem. For fvck sakes the people who downvote me to oblivion and hate Trump thought that voting for an incompetent woman who didnt have a plan but stated ways shed be a good president despite having power and sway in the White House was a good idea.      If I fumble being the leader of a party and when its an election for a new leader I state ways Id be a a good leader despite being in power and showing otherwise then I dont deserve to be leader. Sorry for the rant but its irritating having your opinion downvoted and oppressed because people think having an opinion opposite to them means youre against them which isnt true.      These past 4 years have made me realize how truly ignorant people are on subjects such as war, politics, justice etc. Even with evidence I got/get called a lair or ignorant. People wont realize theyre wrong or admit it until theyre sinking in a boat with it on fire. By the time people admit to seeing things differently its usually too late. I accept I dont know everything and am always changing my thoughts and opinion the more information I obtain but things are so clear to me right now thats its scary and disheartening because the majority dont fact check or question the things they hear from mainstream news and even independent media they follow.       Just tell me how its cool that natural disaster victims in the US gets $700-$750 under certain circumstances meanwhile Ukraine Israel and illegals get trillions in money, food, weapons, medicine etc?

However I think the traditional answer to the incompatibility of omniscience and omnipotence regarding God knowing her future actions goes something like this: God is omniscient, meaning God knows all that there is to know.  God is free and omnipotent, meaning no one can know what it is that God will do next.  Therefore, there is no contradiction because what it is God will do next is not something to be counted among \\"all there is to know\\".  A somewhat similar argument goes that omnipotence gives God the power to do all that there is to be done; creating a rock which cannot be moved by God is not possible, because a rock is a finite thing and God can move anything finite.  Thus, there would be no contradiction because God's omnipotence only applies to doing things which are possible or sensible to do.  To create the stone would be a contradiction; it would be no more possible than, say, to sin in such a way that pleases God.  By definition, sin is that which does not please God, and to be a stone is to be that which God is able to move.Not sure these arguments would be enough to convince me or you of the existence of God, however.The philosopher Anselm had an argument, known as the \\"ontological argument\\" which was supposed to prove the existence of God logically and once and for all.  It goes something like this:1. God is the greatest being that can be conceived of.2. Since God can be conceived of, God exists in your mind.3. If God existed only in your mind, then something greater could be conceived of than whatever it is you conceived of.4. Therefore, God exists not only in your mind but in reality.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/dgnr1a23b5de1.jpeg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feb90655e693d0240e5b4b1a3bfc418a7e3ca02b","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Of course not.

No one knows how to think any more, only how to feel, and spin emotional narratives.Truth is, there are plenty of Muslims who DO desire Shariah law in Europe because their religious devotion is stronger than their national loyalty. Far, far stronger. Doing right by God is infinitely more important to them than pleasing a country that largely doesn't like them. There are also many more Muslims who privately want Shariah law but keep that to themselves. And there are Muslims - perhaps a majority, perhaps not - who are content to follow western native laws.

It also has to be paired with a positive message: do these things instead and you will be fully accepted.Thats where the Western societies have their own weaknesses of course, because many people use these arguments just as a way of disliking other races or religions.But this misuse is not a reason to throw out the whole idea.

Though they may purchase them as investment vehicles, they still serve as housing for other people most of the time.Secondly, what makes housing such a reliable investment vehicle for the rich? Why put their money in housing rather than stocks and bonds? It is precisely the radical supply deficit of housing that makes it such a reliable investment vehicle. Restricted supply *is* the reason that housing is such an attractive place for the affluent to put their money.In a properly functioning market, as the demand of a good increases, so does its price and profitability, which in turn incentivizes more production of said good to meet demand. In the reverse, as demand for a good decreases, so too does its price, profitability, and incentive for supply. These price signals are always pushing the market towards an *equilibrium* between production and consumption *when they're allowed to*In the housing market, however, in *many* (arguably most) jurisdictions, we have radically restricted expansions in the housing supply, even as demand for housing continues to escalate. This is actually similar to how many cartels have historically attempted to price-fix their goods, by forming agreements restricting *how much* of a good to sell or produce. Only, in this case, the enforcer of these restrictions is our own government, via a range of misguided policies that have created a ballooning deficit of housing relative to population.*Investors buying up lots of housing* is a convenient scapegoat for our housing woes, but it confuses a *symptom* of the problem for the problem itself. If you care about housing affordability and homelessness, the only sustainable solution is to build more housing, and lots of it. If you care about this issue, please support local and state candidates where you live who vow to reform the zoning, neighborhood approval processes, tax policies, and other highly restrictive ordinances that make the development of housing difficult, slow, and costly.","title":"CMV: We will look back in 50 years and think the CEO to pay ratio was really low in 2025, compared to 2075 in the US."},{"text":"Idea: Spotify/Youtube Music/whatever playlist that uses your current location to play music by local artists.

For instance, the Muslims are terrorists stereotype is wrong because Christians have committed equal, if not far worse, atrocities through war and colonisation. If we look at the orthodox religious groups, Christians also have evangelical groups and witnesses of Jehovah going around being nuts. These are all true.But at the same time it's also true that CURRENTLY, radical Christians are far less in number than radical Muslims. Even amongst those who only practice the religion in moderate amount (which is like most people), Christians would be far more likely to be more open with their religious laws.Most countries which seem to have Christianity as their state religion are amongst the most liberal countries in the world.

I mean, yeah.

That's assuming a metric fuckton of immigration, an insane continued growth of established very conservative muslims, and that none of the people who are currently being educated and growing up in liberal societies all decide that it's preferable to spend time hating everything around them.The change will take time and it won't just magically sweep everyone all at once. Some will never accept it. It's taken European countries time to accept people being gay, and we're not all the way there, either. Just look at Catholicism. They've continually had to soften their stance on gay people because otherwise they won't have and damn faithful left. Islam will have that same choice. Maybe the faith splinters a bit, to some more moderate interpretation, maybe it just loses a lot of people. Who knows?But eventually, the younger generations are going to be making friends who are gay and who they realize are actually nice people just like they are, and then their parents in turn will have to make the choice about if they want their children to come by for Sunday lunch, or if they wanna stew in their hate alone.","title":"CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home"},{"text":"[https://bsky.app/profile/leftliblucy.bsky.social/post/3lcppebmkhk2b](https://bsky.app/profile/leftliblucy.bsky.social/post/3lcppebmkhk2b)Xi Jinping Thought is such an emperor's new clothes moment; it makes no real theoretical contribution to communism\\"the party must lead\\" wow that's a new one\\"more natsec\\" what a shocker\\"reform more\\" no way broSurely party members just call this shit innovative because they don't want to diehttps://preview.redd.it/nrs6dvjr45de1.jpeg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781546a0467a90ae9a80adb4c3ceaa62f45df609","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The shit eating book is \\"this book is gay\\" which was banned by far more schools.
