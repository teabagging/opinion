You do understand that words have meaning right. And expressing an opinion that women are less capable then men fits the textbook definition of sexism right? He does want his daughters competing in the same sports with biological malesYou say that like I'm not aware of that fact. Indeed his desire for this and expression of that desire is what makes him a sexist. He is not breaking any new grounds here and your attempt at conflating this is not only disingenuous but lame.He doesn't have to break new ground to be a bigot. Why do you think that that's the case. Objecting to trans participating in womens sport does not invalidate my beliefs in trans rightsYes it does - your belief that prepubescent girls are less capable then prepubescent boys is sexism. And the fact you believe that means you do not support trans rights. So the transphobic label is misplaced in my humble opinion.Ah I see - so if holding a belief that trans people should not be allowed to participate in civic life and engage in society doesn't make you transphobic what does? Seems to me you just hate the word because it's a little to close to home Its similar to someone objecting to Netanyahu and his war policies and being labeled antisemiticNo it's not even close. Its an overkill and meant to shut down dissenting opinions.\\nIt's not - it's more about accurately describing your position. Btw your opinion that trans people shouldn't be allowed to participate in society should be shut down. Just like if you had expressed concern about your white children competing against black children.

I wish all women to stay safe though, because the whole manosphere thing, coming from a mostly established man, it's the kind of talk I remember gravitating towards when I was an insecure early 20's man who was in a dark place that I dug myself into.A lot of the manosphere stuff and talking points I've been seeing online is stuff that I was into in my early 20's until one of my good friends called me out for being a \\"punk ass bitch\\" and a \\"god damn fucking disgrace and waste of good oxygen\\". I know for sure that for him, it takes a lot to piss him off, and for me, I was able to do it by saying really stupid things along the lines of, \\"Women nowadays are not women, they only belong in the kitchen\\" or \\"Men are inherently superior to women, that's just biology\\". Again, this was in my early 20's, and I was in a dark place at the time. Ultimately, it all boiled down to me not being able to get laid and I was doing things and saying things that ensured that I wouldn't get laid. My good friend called me out on it and said that 100% of the things I was complaining about was because of me, and not every woman around me. He said that I need to get out of that headspace if I ever want to stay friends with him and if I ever want to get the slimmest chance of getting laid.Women won't really get to the headspace of the manosphere men, I can guarantee that. I was one of those men back in the early 2010's, and I can easily say that at the time, I viewed my opinion of women's thoughts to be lesser than mine, and that women were only meant to be beneath men both in status and in the bedroom. It took a couple of good friends to call me out on my toxic mindset, them threatening to cut all ties with me, and me learning from my mentors for a good number of years before I broke away from the manosphere mindset.Whatever the manosphere is saying now towards women isn't masculine at all. It's all similar stuff I was pulled into when I was younger and angry with myself. The manosphere is extremely emasculating and it teaches men to have an extremely ignorant mindset in the guise of empowering them. If a man wants to truly feel empowered, go out and volunteer in the community not for recognition or to find a woman to bang, but go out and volunteer to better your community. If a man wants to truly feel empowered, treat others around you the same way you would treat your parents or the person you most respect. If a man wants to truly feel empowered, walk away from the manosphere and focus on just being a good person.A person doing good in their community for the sake of doing good is looked on more favorably than someone who is there to drag others below them for the sake of feeling superior. That's one thing that my mentor said, and it's a lesson that I've followed to get to where I'm at today.Where I'm at today isn't me being Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk levels of wealthy, but I'm happy and content with my life, and I have a lot of friends who I regularly stay in contact with. All the stuff I have now is stuff I wish I had when I was younger, but I didn't want to work or be a good person for it. I expected people to just bend their knee to me at the time.  \\nEdit: I'm in my early 30's now. It took a good friend calling me out on my mentality, threatening to cut all ties with me, a couple of good mentors, and just putting what my mentors have said into practice. That's just what worked for me. It's not a catch-all method, but it's easily much better than stuff I've seen online involving redpill and Andrew Tate. I'm not going to be a wealthy man by any means (I'm not a millionaire, and I never want to be one), but I can easily say that I'm in a place where I'm stable, happy with the friends and connections I have, and I'm in a place where my stress is at a minimal level and my contentedness is high.","title":"Emboldened 'manosphere' accelerates threats and demeaning language toward women after US election"},{"text":"If they are a true friend all you can do is hope that they will heal from the TDS someday and be mature enough to come around and apologize.","title":"Help: Lost my friend of 20 years to liberalism"},{"text":"Suck that money cock!","title":"Khanna says Democrats will work with Musks DOGE on cutting defense budget"},{"text":"I have liberal friends who hate Trump, so we have an agreement that we just do not talk politics, ever.

The stakes were high because over 12,000,000 people were being genocided (Jews, Romani, political dissidents, LGBT, disabled, different ethnic groups, etc) and it could have been that the Axis took over the world.WWIII would be much more precise, subtle, and machines would be much more involved.

It was such a neutral and unbiased post with no political siding. I dont have a side I just observe and do my research. I dont subject myself to any programming, I dont have cable, I dont let people leak info into my head without doing my due diligence. I have books, I study papers, and I have full access to the every corner of the web. The ONLY reason youre saying Im liberal, cause if its against what you believe it has to be liberal, is because i gave Trump just a little bit of criticism and you didnt like me doing that. In fact you immediately saw a post about the first year of Covid and my opinion, which is based on way more facts than what your brain worms are feeding you, and you couldnt help yourself to flip it into democrats.

Also nice story you got there The classic case of I have a black friend so I cant be racist. shut your racist ass up, its clear ass day racism is a problem and youre belittling it.

Supporters of the monarchy were seated on the right side, and supporters of the revolution were seated on the left. Newspapers started using \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" to refer to these two groups, or more generally to describe progressive and conservative politics, and then French political parties started using the terms to describe themselves. By the late 1800s this terminology had spread to other parts of the world.We can draw a pretty clear scale here. On the right is hierarchy and inequality; toward the center you have some people with more wealth or status than others, and as you move right you get larger wealth divisions, class stratification, feudalism, and at the very far end is totalitarianism. On the left you get more equality: popular democracy, labor movements and unions, popular ownership of capital, that kind of thing. The far left end is anarchism, with no government or private property.Social equality fits on the right/left scale as well. Less equality goes rightward, so there's your women who can't own property, black drinking fountains, chattel slavery. More equality goes left, so you've got civil rights, feminism (the ideal, not the female-chauvinist reality), equity for handicapped people, etc.I call this the _political_ left and right.#BUT#There's a whole other _cultural_ aspect that doesn't have a lot to do with the political philosophy, and this is what gets almost all the attention.The cultural left thinks they're educated, enlightened, wise, perceptive, compassionate, cultured, classy, civilized, clean, beautiful, and noble. But they think the cultural right is stupid, ignorant, hidebound, anti-intellectual, superstitious, uncultured, backward, dirty, ugly, diseased, intolerant, violent, and dangerous.The cultural right thinks they're practical, hard-working, sensible, strong, community-minded, clever, and moral. They see the cultural left as shallow, hypocritical, smug, arrogant, elitist, pretentious, foolish, weak, effete, narrow-minded, disruptive, dishonest, corrupt, and morally bankrupt.In other words, the divide between the cultural left and the cultural right is very much like the cultural divide that has always existed between rich and poor.Of course, it's not as simple as rich vs. poor with a coat of political whitewash, because we're talking about two different cultures that have grown and evolved over the years until they're loaded down with enormous amounts of baggage.The funny thing about the cultural left is that it's not particularly politically left. Liberals will cry about civil rights, labor, poverty, the environment, etc. but their positions are usually so moderate that they're practically conservatives, they have a cult-like dedication to a corrupt center-right party, and they are not nearly as tolerant as they pretend to be.The actual political left in this country is socialists, communists, anarchists, and a variety of committed activists (labor, civil rights, etc) who work by grassroots organizing. This left is very small, mostly disorganized, kept away from getting any real power or mainstream recognition, and they tend to dislike liberals almost as much as the cultural right does, but for different reasons.","title":"What does the ACTUAL left represent for you?"},{"text":"But she checks the right boxes!","title":"It would be a 'disaster' for Democrats if AOC runs for president, pollster says | Fox News Video"},{"text":"No, what I am saying is there are already infinitely better things than eating human flesh I could do with minimal repercussions, and I am not doing them.

I dont think modern American national identity is racial, and the best versions of the *promise* of American identity were always a postracial ideal, dating all the way back the Washingtons letter to the Newport Congregation, the idealism of Roger Williams, nascent abolitionism, and hopes (quickly dashed) of peaceful assimilation of American Indians into the expanding republic. But in practice, white supremacy was a useful tool for getting disparate groups to feel like they all had common cause, and American politicians didnt shy from appealing to it.I mean, in what sense are Poles, Italians, Brits, Swedes, and Romanians any more or less real that whites. Why should we talk of Poles and not of Silesians and Galicians? Italians still divide themselves not just into north and south, but into Bolognese, Milanese, Florentine, Romans, Ligurians, and so on. And the Liguri divide themselves into Genovese and all the surrounding cities and towns! These are all imagined communities, in academic parlance, especially at the larger scale.

If we say what the Swiss had in 1874 was still \\"ethno nationalism\\" then the category is clearly broad enough to not be objectionable in some forms. If \\"white\\" is a category for the purpose of American enthnonationalism, which can encompass Poles, Italians, Brits, Irish, Swedes and Romanians, then should we view it as particularly exclusive on *ethnic* grounds?Keep in mind, the point isn't that there isn't exclusion taking place. Yes, Australia excluded Aboriginals but it had significant German, Dutch, Greek, Italian, Irish etc populations. So when we talk about needing to \\"develop through\\" some sort of \\"ethnonationalist\\" stage, what are we actually talking about? To me it makes just as much, if not more sense, to just talk about national identity formation. I don't think many people think of \\"Australian\\" as an ethnicity. Ethnicity in many of these cases isn't some sort of key thing. In which case, a nation state requiring the formation of national identity sounds fairly unobjectionable.Because if we are just making the rise of Swiss national consciousness as synonymous with the rise of a Swiss ethnic nationalism, then I think you're just defining ethnonationalism to cover every historic path and then concluding it is inevitable/necessary based on that broadness.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They dont learn from their mistakes.

Youre right that British identity includes both the Scots and English, but it also largely excluded the Irish, not to mention British colonial subjects. Australian ethnonationalism obviously excluded aboriginals, while the US created the category of white in its racial hierarchy.So in some sense I agree, there are different flavors of ethnonationalism, ranging from the least objectionable Swiss version (full civil rights for Jews in all Cantons in 1874, in some as early as 1841) to the obviously highly objectionable Nazi version, but Im not entirely convinced that the phenomenon of the creation or elevation of an ethnicity as a basis for nationalism can be easily avoided.Does this respond to your objection?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Where do you live where Iranian and Lebanese people are considered super white?

This would bring total installed capacity in the country to around 100 GW. However, BDEW warned that around half of the new capacity came in the form of small-scale systems under 100 kilowatt each, which under current rules feed into the grid whatever they produce, without the option to curtail production when this is necessary to ensure grid stability. The amount of electricity now threatens to exceed consumption next spring and summer on sunny Sundays with low electricity demand, even with perfect grid expansion, said BDEW head Kerstin Andreae. She called on parliament to decide a law reform that would curb feed-in of new installations at 50 percent for a transitional period, until it is possible that grid operators control the feed-in of smaller PV plants as well. Otherwise, Germany would run the risk that grid operators would have to temporarily disconnect entire grid sections in the event of an overload in order to stabilise the system. Solar PV expansion has picked up again in recent years, and Germany plans to make the technology one of its central energy sources as it aims to ramp up the share of renewable electricity to 80 percent of consumption by 2030.

I am also a victim of male hate in workplace. I come to the realization that there's no point fighting against it. We were just born in an abnormal world (from the bible's point of view).For example what exactly. Give me your most egregious issue that happens to you regularly because of feminism. If you can try to make a direct link, that is explain what's happening and explain how feminism is the root.We were just born in an abnormal world (from the bible's point of view). A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. 1 Timothy 2:11-14Do you think the Bible is an article we ought to put great focus on and if so why? Lots of books in lots of philosophies think lots of things are bad. That doesn't mean they are bad necessarily. You have to do more than cite the Bible, you have to make the argument why this is bad or make the argument that the Bible should be used as a guiding principle. Because not everyone agrees with you there, hell some Christians don't even take everything Paul wrote as factual either so you have your work cut out for you here.  But the bible, buddihism, taosim, star wars, dune, etc., all have one thing in common. Don't fight against the flow.Putting religion and philosophies when talking about this doesn't make sense to me. Worse when you say etc the amount of space you're leaving to fill is a bit vast.But also no. These philosophies are not so quiet actually. All of them actively claim to have the one true way to live. A buddihst who goes with the flow will never see nirvana, a christian who goes with the worldly flow will never see heaven. While these philosophies have some space, they are actually really rigid and don't advocate for this sort of don't fight mentality. Non-violence possibly but not non-resistant. That is untrue.Star Wars is all about a rebellion fighting a much lager Empire. That's active resistance against the flow. As men, why dispute with women. Why not be wrongly accused by them? Why not be cheated by them? Why not be taken advantage of by them? Why not be backstabbed by them?The best course for men is to yield to feminism. Let the women gain as much power as they desire, take as many jobs as they want. After unemployment, men will take the leftover jobs like janitors and soldiers, and assist ladies achieve their lifegoals.I don't want to be cheated and where I can avoid it I will. That could be women, my boss, my government, where I can resist I shall. Fight against feminism. Consequence is women will fight back. Chances are the battle will be very long. Everybody lose. Why the battle will be long? It is because the feminism is too strong.That's a bad logic. Giving up because it's hard means you trade the struggle for the bad. All fights are hard. If the civil rights movement or the Allies had taken this stance the worldwould be a worse place overall.Take me as an example. As a man, I chose option A before because I wanted to be happy. I was labeled as angry men. Why do I want to be happy? I blame the selfish gene inside me. But as I was fighting I actually felt unhappy and angry, because the battle is so long. If I yield to feminism now, I will still be unhappy (for a brief period of time only). However, after the full acceptance of it, I will feel content. The fact is, I have recently yielded to feminism and that only took me a few days to go from angry to happy.Walk me through exactly what you accepted and how.","title":"CMV: The best course for all men is to yield to feminism and let it blossom."},{"text":"okay reddit what are you going to do about it?","title":"Citizens United has turned our democracy into an oligarchy!

I do know that Trump is exaggerating when he makes a lot of these statements. It's his manner of speaking and he's always been like this, even back on the apprentice. But it takes a fair deal of intelligence to actually pick up on that, in the same way it takes intelligence to pick up on sarcasm.I don't think it's quite accurate to say 50% of Americans actually believe them to be true - but I think it's more accurate to say that 50% of Americans believe he is not exaggerating.It's reasonably plausible to me that half of Trump voters will fully believe his statements and not pick up on the exaggeration, maybe a little more than half. And it's equally plausible that half of Democrats don't pick up on it either and think he's intentionally lying.His communication and body language is definitely learned. I imagine the reason for talking in this way is it makes him more engaging, and makes the people he's selling to be more excited, when he would exaggerate the potential success of future business.Whether it's appropriate in politics though, considering half of people from both sides won't be picking up on it and will be confused? That's probably a better debate to have.

Sigh. \\nInfluenza and Coronavirus are two completely different types of viruses which don't behave the same. Influenza is excellent at quick mutations (hence the yearly flu shot) Coronavirus isn't (granted when billions of people are infected it may *appear* to mutate quickly. You seem to be egregiously underestimating just how hard world-wide mass covid vaccination combined with its slow and relative minor rate of mutation saved our collective asses. Before a virus becomes endemic by definition it first has to become pandemic. Endemic means a virus persists at a predictable and relatively stable rate in a population. The virus has to spread to and become normative in a given population before that can happen. And be aware that in no way implies the population \\"goes back to normal\\". Only that the virus persists at predictable - *predictable* not ignorable - levels. H5N1 has already jumped to mammals and is currently spreading through the county's meat and dairy cattle. Not only is it extremely alarming how quickly it mutated to infect mammals instead of avians (different Kingdoms ffs!) but now it's appearently getting a minor but solid toehold in infecting humans. And humans who work with cattle are some of the toughest, most physically fit people in the country (granted ime there's a high rate of drug use). The cattle industry is by a wide margin the most lucrative Agricultural sector in the nation and how its infrastructure has been created means there's no way to sustain the cattle industry in any way but the current model. To be completely honest I have zero question that - especially under a Trump administration - staggering American mortality rates would be tolerated and false statistics released before it'd ever cross the mind of the Billionaires or Trump administration to cripple the cattle industry. Beef and dairy prices will nonetheless skyrocket to unfathomable heights. \\nA 30% mortality rate is insanely terrifying. Poo-pooing is insulting - one out of ever TWO people you know will die (unless you're the one that dies). That's Black Plague level mortality (and btw we're *still* very much not at all immune to The Plague after centuries and despite everyone with European heritage being the descendant of Plaque Survivors.\\nInfluenzavirus isn't a poxivirus like smallpox but nonetheless ask the millions of thriving indigenous Americans how deadly virus are no big because they just become endemi, minor inconveniences. By the time Europeans started regularly visiting North America the indigenous people were already living in their post-apocalypse. But in the past 150 years the majority of the new, deadly, pandemic viruses have been influenza virus. Shit, we can't even outsmart the \\"normal\\" yearly flu. I'm not saying it'll be a second Bubonic Plague or smallpox but I AM saying your assessment is largely fakakta and if H5N1 decides it's gonna fuck shit up then Americans are utterly fucked for so so many reasons.","title":"A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History"},{"text":"Your not wrong.

I work with plenty of feminist women who are fantastic colleagues and actively speak up against discrimination of any kind.By promoting this view of \\"yielding\\" to mistreatment, you're actually enabling toxic behavior that most feminists oppose.

I think you mean something more specific than feminism in general, so I'll call it oppressing men/restricting masculinity. You'll get a lot of flak for your choice of the word feminism, though.\\n2. Oppressing women didn't make men happy. Oppressing men doesn't make women happy. Most women don't want weak men. Whether it's as a friend, a sexual or romantic partner, a father, a brother- most women prefer the men they rely on to be strong.\\n3. Women aren't the enemy of men anymore than men are the enemy of women. Individuals sometimes choose to make life worse on purpose. It feels good to have power over people, so it feels good to take things away from people. It can also be a source of comfort if you're insecure, afraid, or in pain. Ideology/culture can provide excuses. That's all.\\n4. Focus on the people you're close to and the problems you can actually confront and solve. Do good and be respectful. Consistently improve and look for people who reward you for it. Someone paying genuine attention to you is the best reward- everything you need can reliably start from that. Be honest but also know when to listen instead of talk. Distance yourself from people who want you to do badly, and distance yourself from people who want themselves to do badly. Give it a few years and be ready to make a lot of mistakes. Then, you'll find yourself surrounded by good men and women, and will have a good reputation.

People want to point out that social media and Fox News has destroyed the abilities of the working class but that's only what they latched onto, not what caused them need to latch.I went to school in a pretty well-off part of town in the 90s; teachers had time to devote extra time to struggling students, and what we were learning was well-rounded. Then I started to talk to people that grew up in other parts of town, in other decades, and other states and their education was drastically different. Not to knock religious schools but one of my exs went to a Christian school and while she knew the scriptures, she had no idea about the ice age; we literally had a fight because she said \\"The ice age was fake. How could the whole world freeze into a giant ice cube without everything dying?\\".  I don't know if it's American's need to always be superior that makes it impossible to admit there's a problem or that they were wrong but it feels like people are constantly digging in their heels so when people like Trump, Fox News, or whoever says \\"You're not wrong, it's...the trans people\\", rather than question how that connects, they latch on the lie. Maybe it's because they honestly don't have the ability to reflect or research but it's definitely getting worse, not just through generations but through time. A decade ago, I used to volunteer at my local library to help people learn their electronics; it was primarily elderly people wanting to learn how to text their grandkids but it was also 30-40 year olds who never learned how to use a computer but they need to submit job applications online now instead of by paper. I'd try and talk to them as simplistically as possible without talking down to them and they'd get frustrated because what you and I think is second nature (what a save icon looks like), they have no idea and that frustration would occasionally have them big up and blame society for leaving them behind because it's easier than having to learn for something so trivial like a job at Walmart. That's what I think is partially happening. people who didn't learn about critical thinking or creative writer due to poor education funding is now being faced with a society where they don't know how to process the obvious lies by simply asking \\"but what?\\" which results in going to basic \\"it's not my fault\\" and \\"how does this impact me?\\".Basically, we're fucked because people were left behind and it's too much work to catch up.","title":"Is Bernie Sanders Launching a Third Party?

It reminds me of old history books:His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei?em und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.[-Tom Philips' Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans:_A_Brief_History_of_How_We_F*cked_It_All_Up)","title":"Joe Biden Warns Trump Not To 'Screw Up' Relationships With Allies Over Tariff Threats"},{"text":"California really needs to ditch being fair and go back to it.

I feel once you start seeing humans as figures and tools, then the clock has started on the corruption.  The more you disassociate humans, the further you fall into this corruption, and overtime you become comfortable doing great harm in the name of the greater good, and rationalize it as you know best. Plus they have the power to actually do great harm, like shutting down factories in a district to get revenge on a politician. There may be people who can fight this corruption, but I dont think many, so overall best to avoid it.I think our forefathers realized this to a degree and why they limited the term of the president, as you have to disassociate from people at some level as there will be many choices that will harm some people to help others. Such as sending troops to deal with a national threat, is that threat worth the potential loss of soldiers? The President has to make that call.I think that is a key problem with the elite, is many have power on the scale of the president, not close to being equal but in the ball park, yet they can retain this power for life. I think this is why you see so many billionaires ending up doing bad things, and dynasties devolve overtime as each generation is more and more corrupt as they are raised from birth with this power also receiving the previous generations teachings.I think that is why to have a fair society, these elites should not exist, at least not for long. The only way to keep power from corrupting is to limit the individual power one person can obtain, and(or) limit the time exposure to prevent the mindset taking a complete hold.And to all the Christians who disagree, I just urge you to read what Jesus said about the rich:For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.","title":"Liberal winners vs. Conservative winners"},{"text":"Someone needs to check on De Niro!","title":"Their Liberal Tears  Are  soo Yummy"},{"text":"Also worth noting that this year the house of Representatives no longer has an overall Republican bias vs popular vote due to more Democratic states gerrymandering.","title":"Defeated Ohio Dem Senator Claims GOP Rigged The System To Win Election"},{"text":"Exactly!

Advanced forms of thought are probably what gave humans the bump to be humans as opposed to just another primate. Critical thinking is in every person's skill set so long as they are capable of thought, no need to teach. Life experience is helpful, logic classes are helpful, reading is helpful, being challenged with complicated dilemmas is helpful. *But none of those things will help if the person in question does not choose to engage in critical thought or reflection.* Some people cannot stomach doing so. They cannot handle thoughts that make them have to question their ethos or their ego. This problem lies deep, *deep* in our method of existing as humans in America. Shit here is so easy to come by, patriarchy ensured some measurable outcome for most white men (until they ruined a lot of that for themselves and then blamed everyone else) and a semi-predictable one for all other men, women were given the role of home- and baby-maker so their path was set. The old concept of being overworked (in factories, every day of the week, 12+ hours a day) is a nightmare scenario compared to the modern idea of being overworked. People didn't want to think about that so they let workers rights slip. Food-born illnesses and diseases we can now treat and prevent entirely used to kill nearly all of someone's siblings. People didn't think about that, even though they learned about it, so now we're going back to measles outbreaks and raw milk and probably a lot worse. Women didn't meet their aggressively abused great grandma or their suffragette great aunt, or hear the stories of people in their direct and known circle dying from back-alley abortion issues, so they're willing to hand up their power to a guy who promises to make enough money that they don't have to worry over anything beyond domesticity again.America's stupid ass culture hid the hard realities of past humans down to even their own fucking ancestors. The stupid ass culture lulled everyone into a daydream that life is full of everything they want, they just gotta go and get it, so when any struggle occurred near them they could not even comprehend it. Nor could they even comprehend that modern-day parts of the world have forced-labor factory towns even *now.*Even though we have strayed from that *very* recently, that does not make the people who got used to, and were happy with, the ol' predictable suddenly willing to ask themselves hard questions and work out good answers.American fucking culture is THE direct culture that you get from giving highschool students a *small* part of the horrors of Nazi Germany, and then letting them go \\"Well that was bad but I don't know, the Nazis were right about some things.\\" It is the culture you get from letting kids 8 and older have a nice bedroom and things to fill it with, and a wardrobe of clothes, without telling them *very* seriously that just over a century ago (now), kids just like them usually had one outfit and no room of their own and went to work every fucking day crawling into machines that dripped diesel and oil from starved, rusted metal maws that would often crush them to bits.

Insurmountable amounts.It is not surprising that these people are happy with spreading suffering, they live in their own hellish experience of being forever paycheck slaves and not being able to advance meaningfully in life, and they want to share the warmth with everyone they can.\\nIn Denmark we are studying which kinds of structures in Americas society allow someone like Trump to come to power, compared to someone like Kamala, a much more progressive and modern icon for the American people.Personally I've written my thoughts, I think it is because of the merciless ultra capitalistic society America operates under, that this can happen.People are squeezed to the brink of poverty for just existing. It's disgusting.Compared to the US, here are some things we have in Denmark to ensure everyone gets a fair shot at life- Free healthcare, regardless of complications (But for things like Diabetes, often you will have a large amount of your medicine state paid, but not entirely)- Everyone has *a right* to free education. This one is important for ensuring everyone can become developed, objective and responsible adults. This one is *really* important. More imporant than Health Care. (imo)- Education is *paid* actually. We make a very low wage being students, basically what is a bit less than the minimum wage in the US, but it makes it so we can kind of survive off of it alone, because the cost of living in Denmark is a bit lower than the US, and we have more free stuff in our society. This one is very important too, especially for people who might be unable to work, and have disabilities.- We have a bonus for people with disabilities. So people who are getting educated at a level similar to University, will get a bonus in their educational wage if they are disabled and cannot work- We have a very high tax rate, yes, but... **We have a \\"minimum\\" tax, which makes it so if you make less than 7000 dollars per year, you almost pay nothing in taxes, despite receiving all the benefits of free healthcare, free educatoin, etc.**\\nThese are not communist structures in a society, these are sociological structures in a society which level the playing field substantially between individuals of all race, gender, and so on so forth. It doesn't level it entirely, as we do have a large amount of Social Heritage still, but it makes it far easier to climb in our society than in yours.When I was a kid I wanted to go to America so badly.

However, they could get around this potential balance issue by either just handwaving the whole thing and letting Hondurans use Stuarts anyway, (the more likely path for DICE to take given how often they make equipment available to both factions, though they notably didn't do with some of the vehicles in BF2042) or take a more interesting and authentic route by limiting Salvadorian tank access to certain \\"conquest assault\\" maps designed to balance the Salvadorian's greater offensive power with the Honduran's early advantage due to controlling the entire map, as opposed to normal conquest where both sides start out on relatively equal footing.!Ping GAMING","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"What did Canada do?The US sent $175 billion in aid.

You might be doing the thing where because we know how it worked out (Trump was a viable candidate) that you're using present known information as justification for past circumstances.Anyways,  when DeSantis was revving up his run,  one thing that *was not clear* was that Trump's considerable downside risk from post J6 and post presidency made Trump a political risk. The NY case was the smallest and the most inconsequential.   In this Trumpian world, campaign fraud and porn stars is inconsequential.  *Sigh*.  The GA case, the DC case, the FL case (classified docs), if not supremely well handled, would have likely shaved off enough voters to make him viable.  He definitely got lucky with the FL judge.Anyways,  what I'm saying is,  if any of the 3 big cases landed hard, even if he was tied up in the courts with a lot of public discovery and discourse, Trump might have been non viable. Enter DeSantis!  He's pretty Trumpy in a lot of ways.   But he's not Trump.   His likely intended trick was to be Trumpy enough to keep the MAGA hardcore in the reservation while also appealing to the Trump reluctant voters.  Should Trump have gone down in a legal or political trashfire, a real risk, DeSantis could have credibly positioned himself as mostly more of the same but less grab em by the baggage. One problem though with DeSantis is he isn't as charismatic.   He's smarter, better at policy, more disciplined, capable,  but he can't work a crowd.  He wasn't able to pull off being Trump because he's too much of a nerd. DeSantis' campaign was pretty iffy too.  Some questionable moves, and generally unable to gain traction.   It might have been interesting if he actually went after Trump, he might have gotten more respect, but he dithered,  he ducked, which comes off weak.(Consider Christie.  Not remotely viable.  But at least he made a mark. )Anyways,  as it turned out, DeSantis' campaign sputtered, Trump finangled very very low damage from his adventures, the Rs coagulated behind Trump.  Haley got a little,  too little too late.   And here we are. ...As for this CMV, I whole heartedly agree that Trump is a mix of hyperbole and true messaging.

Isnt that painfully unfair to the (very large) category of legal immigrants and their next gen families?

President Bidens belated decision to allow Ukrainian armed forces to deploy a key US-supplied missile system deeper into Russian territory will be a welcome boost to morale in Kyiv, as well as being of some material help. It should also prompt the British and French to follow suit and to generally encourage other allies to boost their support for Ukraine.However, it is painful to reflect on how much more effective this change in tactics would have been had the move been made, say, a year or two ago. In hindsight, President Vladimir Putins veiled threats about escalation proved to be empty C and now no one thinks hes about to bomb New York, Paris or London in revenge for the West giving the Ukrainians more firepower. As it is, in the dying days of the Biden administration, it seems unlikely to be the kind of game changer that President Zelensky and his long-suffering people have been virtually begging from the West since the earliest days of this conflict.It may be recalled that, when the news broke about President Putins special military operation in February 2022, the reaction in many Western capitals was to assume that nothing much could be done to save Ukraine, and even if it could, it would be unwise. The most notorious response was Germanys initial decision to send anything more lethal than some new helmets to the Ukrainian troops. The British were honourable exceptions to the general mood of complacency (and sending military hardware was one of the few tangibly useful things Boris Johnson achieved in his entire political career).Since then, the pattern has been depressingly similar. On the supply of defensive missile shields, artillery and munitions, then of tanks, then of advanced fighter jets, and now of the ATACMS and Storm Shadow missile systems C it has always been a case of too little, too late.After the first, spectacularly incompetent Russian offensives failed in the face of brave Ukrainian resistance, the West seemed ever-reluctant to press the advantage and help them to take the fight to the enemy, and drive the invaders out. Consciously or otherwise, the West, led by America, seemed always determined to give Ukraine just enough to defend itself and not be overrun, yet too little to entirely claw back what had been lost in 2022 C let alone recover the sovereign territories across Crimea and the eastern provinces occupied in 2014, or inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. Much the same might be said of the mix of sanctions and other measures pursued in recent years C only very recently have some frozen Russian assets been used to fund the defence of Ukraine.President Bidens move wont get Crimea back, then, but it may well blunt Russias attempts to wreck the supply of energy and water to Ukraines towns and cities, slow the grinding Russian advances in eastern villages, and counter the 50,000 to 100,000 Russian and North Korean soldiers in the Kursk battlefields. That will help President Zelensky hang on to as much land as possible before any armistice to freeze the facts on the ground.Such a moment will come after Donald Trump starts to make his own decisions C and there are some hints that he may not be as easy a pushover for Mr Putin as he has proved in the past. Mr Trump never disguised his distaste for Americas involvement in the Ukraine war, but that does not mean he wants his first foreign policy move to be seen as an abject surrender to Russia.Despite some childishly cruel social media posts about Ukraines tragedy by Elon Musk and Donald Trump Junior, the next president himself hasnt commented, adding to the suspicion that he at least knew about President Bidens plans, and the pair may even have discussed such options at their two-hour transitional meeting.With many of the principal players at the G20 summit, what is plain to see is that the USs strategy of uncertain, limited military support could never prevail against the tacit military, financial and diplomatic support for Russia being offered by some leading G20 powers C China in particular, but also, albeit to a more limited degree, by the likes of India and South Africa.Russia could also call upon the malign talents of the hard men of Tehran and Pyongyang to break sanctions and send arms, and soldiers in the case of North Korea. Only a total commitment of American military force could have had any hope of putting President Putin in his place. Soon, President Trump will have to demonstrate that he, the self-styled master of the art of the deal, can do any better.","title":"At last Biden is taking real steps to help Ukraine C but is it too little too late?"},{"text":"there's an idiot I work with. he always talks about how he's a good christian. he talks about how people need to work together instead of being divided. he also talks about how we should round up all the immigrants, send them to california, then bomb the entire state.","title":"Liberal winners vs. Conservative winners"},{"text":"This is an insightful article, written by a subject-matter expert with years of experience working with Biden.I think his suggestions meet the promise of the title, but they would be such an about-face compared with what we have seen from the Biden administration in the past year that I really doubt it can happen","title":"How Biden Can Salvage Middle East Peaceand His Legacy"},{"text":"Upstate New York is mostly red.

It is proven to exist and every credible health org states that it was in fact real, I even tried to a quick search to see what you are talking about and i honestly couldnt find anything, Im open to reading that if you send me a link. It is covid-19. Originally called N-cov or Novel Coronavirus, which basically just means a new coronavirus, which coronavirus is just another name for a common illness or cold. It then became known as a more genetic descriptor SARS-Cov-2, which SARS is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Obviously the CoV-2 just means coronavirus 2 which is its mutation. Its all names for the same thing. They learned that it was never seen in humans, therefore they mostly believe it was spread between animal and human, they also discovered how it spreads and that we havent developed an immunity to it. So YES it is researched and documented as being a thing that actually exists.Viruses mutate and have variants, they mutate more when its breeding in a host with no natural immunity to it. Thats what vaccines are for too, but then when people dont get those its harder to control and leads to more variants, your body gets introduced to just enough of the virus to help your immune system build immunity. This is all common sense though and has been proven to work and humans have actually been able to eradicate diseases with these. With the testing YES they are pretty accurate. When the tests came out they knew what it was, thanks to science and research and I really hope you believe in science, they knew the genetics of the virus and could test certain markers to see if you had it.My family members died FROM COVID-19. An aggressive virus, that our bodies never seen before, that would attack weak points in your immunity system. They were a few among millions who died from something that is definitely stronger than the flu, which our bodies have developed a natural immunity to. Did you know the first influenza case could be traced back to 412 BC, Hippocrates actually describes a contagious disease with flu like symptoms in one of his books. In 1918 a thing called the spanish flu existed, a virus that killed 50 million people because their bodies had never been exposed to something like that. It sounds a little familiar right? In 1957 H2N2 or Asian influenza developed, the first pandemic in the era of modern medicine, killing upwards of 4 million people. In 1968 The Hong Kong flu, same thing 4 million casualties. You can even add HIV, that ones probably a bad add due to the conspiracies behind that. Swine flu, Ebola, Let alone all the plagues in history. Do you not believe in any virus? Like none of this happened and those mortality numbers are greatly exaggerated? Covid reports 4 million casualties, if you adjust for population growth since 1968, not a bad as the Hong Kong flu but still pretty high. Why is this one so hard to believe?

If he loses an election, it must be fraud, because there's no way a winner like him could lose an election fair and square. Any evidence to the contrary is fake news. For Trump, there is nothing beyond his self-image - the only durable concept in his mind - and whatever impulse is striking him at the moment. It's an extreme form of solipsism, the kind that can exist only in a man who has valued his ego above all else since he was a child and reaped endless rewards for it.Trump's movement endures because this is irresistible to many people. Don't think anything through, just speak from your gut. Don't try to explain how exactly the 2020 election was stolen, just mumble something about insecure drop boxes and absentee ballots and hint at a vast conspiracy.

You don't have to go to the trouble of developing a belief system; just match your instincts to the right Trumpian slogans and you're good to go. You don't even have to agree with any of Trump's policies; a desire to own the libs and MAGA is all that's needed. It's an attitude, not an ideology.

So if, the ultimate goal is to stop the war peacefully and as soon as possible, why wouldn't folks vote for the realistic canidate who was at least talking about a peaceful solution, and could have been pushed when in office towards peace? Because now there's a situation that's about to drastically worse. Trump has litterally shown zero inclination towards peaceful negotions. The Golan Heights were already recognized as part of Isreal under Trump after being in anxed forever but never formally recognized.  This was a huge move on its own. But also dont forget the Trump recognized Juerusilim as Israeli capital, not Tel Aviv. This, further isolated the Palastinians and enflamed tensions. The west bank should be considered gone, and I would be surprised if my the end of 4 entirety of Gaza is also annexed.  Like I know that some folks don't view Trump and Biden (and Harris for that matter) as having different  views. I can tell you unequivably  as someone who served in the military under Obama, Trump, and Biden. That Trump was by far the most violent and prone to ignoring the rules of war. I can provide hard data if you would like. I dunno I guess I just dont understand the thought process of a single issue votee voting third party for this particular issue because it both ignores what's realistically on the ground, conflates two regimes (Trump and Biden) as equivical when they are 1000% not, and actively undermines the only realistic peace process currently taking place in the conflict.","title":"Is Bernie Sanders Launching a Third Party?

I think it is best to think of pandemics less like we're unlucky to have one, but rather we are lucky to not have more. Because we seem to be actively starting them. Loose regulation and lack of environmental control has exploded the factors in causing a pandemic, on top of the pre-existing global supply chains and networks. 1. Mass Deforestation has effectively erased the boundary between wild animals, and upset the ecosystem where certain animals containing certain diseases are allowed to roam rampant2. Loose regulations around farmer's market. COVID might have started from a wet food market in China, but we got lots of outbreaks here in the US with faires and festivals 3. Massive factory farms put thousands of animals in close proximity to each other, stressing them out, weakening their immune system, and letting them spread and mutate one another.  Heavy antibiotic use in animals mitigates some of this (while causing other consequences), but it is only a matter of time before we get something resistant to antibiotics and lucky enough 4. In addition to loose to extremely weak protections for labor working on said farms, with said animals and in distribution. Worker protections, and hence actual protection from animal diseases, are very limited. During COVID a large outbreak vector were meat packing plants where you have workers sit right next to each other in close proximity, with dangerous conditions, and next to animal meat. Curbing pandemics is similar to Climate Change - it would need a large pivot from multiple large stakeholders and even with favorable administrations I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.","title":"A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History"},{"text":"It is but a labyrinth, with a red thread.

And you can see the entire [judicial history](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/texas-v-pennsylvania/) of the case here. Texas V Penn isn't even about election fraud. The claim in that case is that Texas was trying to argue that other states modified their election through non-legislative action. Basically \\"Pennsylvania is trying to accommodate voters during the pandemic by allowing mail in voting, they didn't change their laws to deal with this and as such we think that the supreme court should **invalidate the entire vote for these states**.You understand that is clown shit, right? That the State of Texas should be able to go to the supreme court and say \\"Those four states didn't vote how we wanted, and it prevents us from getting the president we wanted, so we win\\"This is **why we have rules about standing.**Anyways, this is turning into an argument which I really dont want to have. You hate Trump. Thats okay. I get it. And I can see youre getting stressed not being able to convince me to hate him too. I only like having conversations on here on good faith only while I can tell you have an agenda and youre getting too emotionally invested.Ignoring that you're violating sub rules by accusing me of being bad faith, I'll confess. I do not like people who try to overthrow the democratic process and I do not have a lot of respect for people who continue to peddle debunked conspiracies half a decade later.Conservatives have this thing where they act as if they say the worst shit imaginable in a nice enough tone, that this is somehow better than passionately defending what is right. I reject that.Your claims are false. You are wrong. I will call out out on being wrong, because even if I can't move you, I can at least hopefully prevent some bystander from reading your false statements and thinking they have even a modicum of merit. I really dont care that much to be honest and I dont really want to be defending him on the 2020 nonsense. It seems redundant at this point and a waste of time. Bottom line is, I believed he would have lost even if all 4 of his cases were examined. I hope thats satisfies you and your hatred of him.If I can offer you one bit of advice, it is don't talk about thinks you're unfamiliar with. As you may have guessed, I actually care about these issues. I know the facts about these issues. Having you repeat blatantly false information because you don't know any better is only marginally better than having you do it on purpose.Have a great one.","title":"CMV: 90% of Donald Trumps public statements are hyperbolic. 50% of Americans Accept These Statements As True."},{"text":"Fuck the constitution.

If the government has to step in for equal protection, fine, but it should be possible for a light touch here. As far as trans prisoners getting gender affirming care, Ill leave that one up to more experienced political media experts. They didnt run a counter ad, apparently, because the ones they tested didnt score as well as Harris introducing herself to voters. Political malpractice. If the ads you cut didnt score well, fucking find ones that do. Ignoring attacks is never an option. I would expect David Plouffe of all people to understand this. It would have been simple for Harris to parry these attacks and counterattack that they were a distraction from kitchen table issues because Trump doesnt want to talk about his disastrous economic plans and how hes in bed with dictators and billionaire plutocrats. Then reiterate your plan for working people and the middle class.But as usual we ignored the issue under the fatuous notion that if we stick our head in the sand were not dignifying their attacks and worse, that the electorate will somehow come to the conclusion that its the Republicans running on this issue, not us.

Counting votes in an Irish election is often a lengthy process, but Ireland's STV system means votes aren't wasted and, its supporters say, delivers a parliament that properly reflects voters' choices. At its heart is a method of preferential voting, where electors rank candidates in order, 1, 2, 3, and so on, rather than a simple 'X'. Voters are free to vote only for a single candidate for their choice to count towards the result. Ireland uses constituencies that select between three and five members to ensure the outcome is broadly proportional. Basically, it's a form of ranked choice voting where multiple candidates are elected per district to ensure that the elected legislature reflects the overall distribution of support. I'm a fan of the system (and I think *any* proportional representation system is better than the first-past-the-post we have), but my overall preference is mixed-member proportional representation (MMPR), like the system used in Germany or New Zealand.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 29, 2024"},{"text":"A Large proportion of NYS residents voted for trump so her dumbass comments are not representative of the voters wishes.

And he was one of the guys that pushed for his impeachment. He knew Trump was going to win and trying to get on his good side. They all knew she was going to lose. Obama benched her at one point and took over her campaign. And I thought, maybe Obama could rescue her. I thought with Obama taking the pressure off of her Maybe shell get 270 if the blue wall holds, just enough to defeat Trump. And with the last minute attacks on Trump, he doesnt do well on defence. He loses his footing when hes on defence mode. Hes much better on offence. My final prediction was 270-269 to Harris. But nope. It wasnt to be. The results couldnt be contested even if she wanted to.","title":"CMV: 90% of Donald Trumps public statements are hyperbolic. 50% of Americans Accept These Statements As True."},{"text":"It taught me that people only have the capacity to care about a pandemic for a limited period of time","title":"A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History"},{"text":"Fucking thank you.","title":"The message to Democrats is clear: you must dump neoliberal economics | Joseph Stiglitz"},{"text":"It's real simple.

I would argue to Moulton that Lovett is not policing his language here so much as reflecting leftist orthodoxy about gender identity, which I characterized in a comment upthread and which Im not going to retype. It is an orthodoxy which is far away from where a majority of the American electorate is on this issue and therefore we have two choices, IMO: stand on ideological and lexical purity and continue to get the shit kicked out of us by Republicans because a very large percentage of voters will probably never agree with the orthodox ideology, or meet the electorate where they are, listen to them, argue for our POV, and defend whats essential.

I would argue that there are many other teachers better than him, but there is one who stands head and shoulders above all.Ms. Frizzle is hands-down the best teacher ever. Let me break it down:1. **Learning by doing**: She doesnt just lecture; she takes her students *into* the lessonliterally. Whether its traveling through space or diving into the human body, her lessons are unforgettable because theyre interactive and immersive.\\n2. **Curiosity  Perfection**: Her motto, Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy, is iconic. It teaches kids (and honestly, adults too) that learning isnt about getting everything rightit's about trying, exploring, and learning from failures.\\n3. **Everyone belongs**: Ms. Frizzle makes sure all her students feel included and valued. Every kid in her class gets a moment to shine, no matter their personality or skills.\\n4. **Creativity for days**: A flying, shape-shifting school bus that turns into a spaceship? Submarine? Time machine? She makes science fun, exciting, and full of wonder.\\n5. **Role model vibes**: Shes quirky, confident, and unapologetically herself. She shows kids that being different is awesome and that curiosity is cool.\\n6. **Science made simple**: She breaks down complicated concepts in ways kids actually understand, sparking a love for learning (especially STEM) in a way most teachers can only dream of.\\n7. **Global icon**: Ms. Frizzle didnt just teach her fictional studentsshes inspired *millions* of real kids through books and TV.

The Biden-Harris administration, to its credit, did not join in on the attacks on advanced math classes or exam schools. At the same time, they did not lend their bully pulpit to the defense of any of these things. And thats not due to a principled aversion to getting involved in local education controversies. The Biden Administration was happy to talk about its opposition to book ban initiatives in public school systems in other parts of the country. So they constructed a dialogue where restricting access to books with LGBT themes was deemed categorically unreasonable and beyond the pale, in a way denying the most advanced kids appropriate coursework was not. To me, thats bad judgment. The algebra issue is substantively quite important.

Now, in fairness, although the part youre referring to him basically saying trans girls are nothing more than boys in drag, while a mistreatment on your part, it is complex. What he said verbatim was formerly male and to understand why that set off a firestorm youd have to understand the minutiae of leftist orthodoxy on gender identity: that people who experience gender dysphoria are more or less born in the wrong body and mistakenly assigned the wrong gender at birth based on their apparent sex. Therefore to refer to a trans girl as formerly male is to kinda sorta misgender her. Which is why the PSA host who interviewed him today said he was, you know, being a bit of an asshole in the way he talked about it  which TBH was my reaction at the time even though Im very sympathetic to Moultons larger point. His larger point is that the way the identity left talks about this stuff, basically like it escaped from the lab of a Gender Studies graduate school department, is miles away from how a majority of American voters think about this stuff, and we can continue to enforce a lexical purity for the next decade or so until the electorate catches up with us while we lose election after election after election, or we can meet voters where they are, listen to them, talk about whats important to us, and defend what needs to be defended in the meantime.","title":"Im done with Democratic purity tests"},{"text":"Seth Moulton is exactly why we need more diversity trainings in education and the workplace.

Trump and his team only brought 4 cases not 10 or 50, just 4 were brought forward by his team including the Texas case. The others were brought forward by other people. So you got that wrong even with your quick google searches. All 4 of them were dismissed on the grounds of legal standing. And again, they tabulated all the contested votes especially in the Texas case against Pennsylvania. I actually looked at the document online back in 2020 when all of this craziness were going on. There was like 60 pages of every single ballot they were contesting. But it didnt get to the point where the evidence they presented were examined. The State of Texass motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.

California and Illinois are close to the top. They should be able to boast that these levies are a good deal  the price citizens pay for excellent public services: the smoothest roads, the cleanest streets, the nicest public transit, the safest neighborhoods, the loveliest parks and the best schools. Their economies should be paragons of dynamism and growth.Ten years ago, we might have argued that our bluest metro areas and states were mostly fulfilling this mission. Today, the troubles are all too evident. Even as the pandemic-era crime wave has receded, public disorder mars too many blue bastions like San Francisco and Chicago. Retail stores have locked their wares behind glass and instituted onerous security measures to combat shoplifting. Too many people are living on the streets who ought to be appropriately housed.But the worst problem many of these areas have is their seeming inability to build anything at a reasonable cost, especially affordable housing. One reason so many people are fleeing blue states such as New York and California is that their major metropolitan areas are consistently the highest-cost places to live.Though highly paid professionals can cope, ordinary workers find they have to move to make ends meet. Especially since blue states arent particularly good at creating jobs for those workers: The latest data show that New York ranks 28th in annual job growth, California 30th, Illinois 44th. This is unsurprising, given that in a recent CNBC ranking of the affordability of doing business, Illinois came in 32nd, New York 41st and California 45th. Taxes, of course, add to that burden, and seem bound to rise because of Blue Americas dodgy public finances: U.S. News and World Report ranks New York only middling for fiscal stability, while California is near the bottom and Illinois dead last.The higher cost of building is often defended as the price of important regulatory priorities, particularly environmental protection, yet the lack of new infrastructure often puts green priorities at risk. Californias high-speed rail project, a carbon-reducing transportation program approved by voters in 2008, is more than a decade behind its original schedule and its cost estimates are now almost $100 billion over its initial budget. Meanwhile, a public-private partnership in Florida proposed, constructed and began carrying passengers on a new service between Miami and Orlando that has a top speed of 125 mph. According to the American Clean Power Association, Texas has now surpassed California in utility-scale solar capacity.With the best of intentions, Democratic-run state governments have allowed burdensome regulations and bureaucratic inertia to stifle growth and allowed special interests to stymie construction of housing, infrastructure and other necessary projects. Public projects now sometimes work better as a jobs program for various consultants, nonprofits and politically influential unions as a way to meet the needs of the broader public.There are some signs reform is beginning to happen. A YIMBY  yes in my backyard  movement is scoring victories in places such as Arlington, Virginia, where leaders are pushing to cut zoning rules that bar building townhouses, garden apartments and other affordable housing options.More and more drastic reform is needed, not just for the sake of the Democratic Party but for the sake of the cities and states where it dominates local politics. The residents of these places deserve cost-effective government. If they dont get it, theyll continue voting with their feet.","title":"Opinion | The first step for Democrats: Fix blue states"},{"text":"You gotta love it when rightoids pretend theyre leftists, but are too incompetent to mask their own ignorant tells lol","title":"Democrats on November 6th, 2024"},{"text":"And all of those cases had the same thing in common: Obama based his statements on misinformation, then never acknowledged his mistakes.","title":"Your thoughts on Obama's role in dividing the country"},{"text":"Yea, 3 hours sounds MUCH better than one hour.

(Disclaimer: I'm not aware of Harris making any false claims, and am not saying she did, I'm simply saying that people evaluating her statements may have been no less likely to do so superficially than those who supported other candidates.)This is what is meant by the \\"seriously not literally\\" trope, and why counter arguments highlighting Trump's lack of truthfulness don't tend to be effective.

Anomie is the word, I believe. Here is a survey that notes, people who have at least a BA are more likely to have friends than those with a high school degree or less: https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-college-connection-the-education-divide-in-american-social-and-community-life/#:\\\\~:text=But%20the%20deficit%20of%20close,while%20in%20the%20past%20month.Here is a snippet from the article:But the deficit of close friends among those without a college degree is only part of the picture. The social disparity is even worse if we look at the entire network of social ties that Americans have. A 2020 survey found that 17 percent of Americans reported having no close social connectionsdefined as someone you talked to about an important personal matter within the past six months.[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-college-connection-the-education-divide-in-american-social-and-community-life/#_edn5)?Americans without a college degree were nearly three times more likely to have no close social ties than those with a college degree were. Nearly one in four (24 percent) Americans with no college education reported having no immediate social connections, compared to 9 percent of college graduates.# The Loneliness GapNot only do Americans without college degrees report having smaller social networks and fewer close friends, but feelings of loneliness are more common among those without a college education. Close to half (45 percent) of Americans without a college education report they have felt isolated from others at least sometimes in the past four weeks. College-educated Americans report experiencing these feelings less often; 36 percent say they have felt this way at least once in a while in the past month.========So I think a lot of working class people are lonely, alienated - especially the men! - and feel distrustful of institutions, including political institutions. They want to burn it all down, or they dont bother to vote at all.

Here's the thing.*The tent is to broad and its fucking collapsing.*The Democrats are attempting to be everything at once. The ones who fight the rich, the ones who give tax breaks, the ones who want a ceasefire, the one's who'll back Israel, the free traders, the fair traders, and so on. Harris' main issue was honestly not the positions she took-it was that she went back on all the old left-wing policies she advocated, which, as I said when she began doing it, the GOP would just bring up anyway and which would alienate the left. That's the party's issue encapsulated. It sucks, but outside genuinely brilliant campaigning, messages, and/or circumstances, you can't expect to hold a coalition of a majority of suburbanites and urban workers, pro-Palestinians and pro-Israeli's, right wingers and moderates at the same time and expect it to work long term-eventually, they begin fighting each other, and attempting to appease both just pisses them all of. The Dems need to pick a coherent unifying ideal or ideology and stick to it. It's not a question of whether becoming progressive, neoliberal, centrist, libertarian, or conservative is the best-they need to pick one and commit to it or else they'll, again, piss everyone of and just look non-genuine. Of course, I prefer they pick a route that at least doesn't have them punting my friends beneath the bus like Moulton is slyly suggesting.","title":"Im done with Democratic purity tests"},{"text":"No, I'm just being realistic.People like you grade Trump on this absurd fucking curve and would never, ever give that level of benefit of the doubt to anyone else. Trump spent months in advance of 2020 saying \\"If I lose, it is stolen\\". Just like he said in 2024, like he said in 2016 hell, like he said in the 2015 primaries. And what did he do immediately after losing in 2020? He declared victory and starting setting up plans for how to stop the victory from being given to Biden.So one of two things must be true here:1. Trump is so delusional that he literally does not believe he can lose an election without fraud.2. Trump is intentionally spreading misinformation about fraud in order to set the stage for his own attempts at fraud.Malice or stupidity. I'm willing to at least *consider* stupidity given how much of a narcissist the man it, but if I'm being honest, Malice seems more likely.We can look at this election and how Trump behaved for evidence. On election night Trump tweeted [this.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d463/live/aeac7cd0-9bcf-11ef-9260-19e6a950e830.jpg.webp) What do you think that was based on? What massive CHEATING have you heard about in Philadelphia? Has Trump ever put forward any evidence of this? Has he talked about it since?The stupidity explanation there is \\"Trump heard a random vague story on twitter\\". I find this unconvincing because no one knew what the fuck he was talking about.The malice explanation is \\"Trump is a lying sack of shit who was trying to prepare another set of excuses\\", ones that he dropped entirely as soon as it became clear that he won and he didn't need it.With regards 2020, the cases his team brought were never looked at properly by the courts due to lack of legal standing. Not because they were debunked or lack of evidence so he still believes he won. The best way it could have been put to rest is actually look at them closely. And if the courts decided, he still would have lost anyway, ( which I believe) then that would definitively proved him wrong and he would have stopped believing he won.This is false.[Here](https://electioncases.osu.edu/case-tracker/?sortby=filing_date_desc&amp;keywords=&amp;status=all&amp;state=all&amp;topic=25) is a tracker of all major cases involving the 2020 election. [Here](https://campaignlegal.org/results-lawsuits-regarding-2020-elections) is a list of ten that were decided on the merits, which acocunts for roughly 1/6th of the total number of cases filed.If you look at the latter, you'll find that basically all of these cases were absolute garbage. Arizona Republican Party v Fontes, for example, resulted in the party being forced to pay legal fees for bringing a \\"Groundless\\" bad faith lawsuit. They found that the plantiff didn't bring evidence that showed the validity of their claims.Or how about Bower v Ducey? They found that even though they could dismiss on standing that the plantiff's complaint was meritless. They found that it was based on \\"anonymous witnesses, hearsay and irrelevant analysis of unrelated elections\\". They pointed out that declarations from poll watchers provided as proof of fraud did not even allege fraud.That 50ish of the cases were dismissed on standing or laches grounds does not mean that those cases were legitimate. For example, Trump v Kemp was officially decided on standing, but also includes language that states plainly that the \\"Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success of any claim\\"If you actually read through these cases, they're all garbage. Gohmert V Pence? That is a congressman saying \\"Hey, I'm being denied my right as a congressman to pick trump as the winner since Pence isn't willing to violate the ECA\\".Wisconsin Voters Alliance V Pence is \\"Hey the ECA is illegal, and pence shouldn't be allowed to count them unless the state legislatures affirm their presidential elector\\"Still Vs Raffensperger was put in on Dec 17th demanding that the entire Georgia certification process be decertified (after safe harbor deadlines!!!) based on three voter affidavits saying they weren't allowed to vote (with no supporting evidence) and a couple of excel spreadsheets of what they think are voter irregularities. It was voluntarily withdrawn.I'm sorry if this is a little long in the tooth but this is just such a bad argument that it annoys me.  These cases weren't sent back becasue of the deep-state judges, or whatever. They were thrown out because they could not meet even the most basic requirements of our legal system, such as making sure the plantiff had standing to sue.

Seth has three Harvard degrees and laments how they cost him street cred when he was in the military. He suggested we need to meet Republicans in the middle on some of their issues, be less preachy, less hifalutin, and be willing to be crass in how we discuss marginalized groups or sensitive issues - Democrats need to be less offended by rhetoric, basically.The problem with this is that some rhetoric is offensive, words have power, and to deny or ignore that would be to capitulate to Conservative dogma that wants to normalize out-group hatred. Seth cried about identity politics like every other Republican, and it's honestly so funny to talk about how identity politics doesn't matter while Republican voters tell you TO YOUR FACE that they don't think a woman should be president, that they would prefer if the president were white.My opinion is that without splitting hairs, Republicans are more willing to lie to advance their agenda then Democrats. At the same time, Democrats are more beholden to rules and norms that they believe protect their political agenda, but is actually a relic of an earlier time. Our social contract has failed, you can just do what you want now, and what people want are political actors that they perceive are acting on their behalf - literally in action to advance their interests. Republicans are always perceived as fighters, as in motion, because they are constantly on the lookout for the weakest political actors and then spending all their political capital attacking them. Trans people were the number one target of the Republican party this election cycle, arguably one of the most disenfranchised politically active cohorts in the country. You always appear to be strong, to be winning, when you are  swinging down on the weakest possible target.

The more we do car centric SFH sprawl, the more and more areas that get developed on. We need to densify, that's how we minimize harm. The best environmental rule we could ever do is to tell zoning to fuck off.Because after all, having some environmental rules is actually really important, there's so many species that just don't exist anymore thanks to development and a lot that are critically endangered. The Piedmont wetlands for example have been developed on so much, and it's especially tragic given how biodiverse that area is. Things like the bog turtles and eastern coral snake and white irisette. We've likely lost a whole lot of things that we don't even know about because they got paved over before any biologist got a look at the area.And some of this stuff just doesn't exist anywhere else. The Venus Fly Trap exists pretty much entirely within a small radius around Wilmington NC. Luckily that plant isn't endangered (but it is listed as vulnerable) but there's some really rare stuff that has been snuffed out forever because it just didn't exist anywhere else.The issue is that they're fucked up in implementation, especially thanks to all the other bullshit planning and zoning rules. What's the point of any sort of environmental review when you force everyone to have huge parking lots and massive SFH sprawl? Again the single best thing we can do for the environment is to stop encroaching on it as much and densify.And worse environmental rules often just get used as a weapon to delay and attack *green* construction. There's no reason for a long drawn out process to replace a parking lot with an apartment complex. And the ridiculously long delays of Sunzia is unforgivable.NIMBY \\"environmentalism\\" is both counterproductive to any stated goals *and* harms discussion about the actual things we do need to be protecting. They care more about lawns full of Kentucky bluegrass or Zoysia, shit that's not even native here instead of the diverse prairies now cut in half by roads and left nearly extinct.","title":"Opinion | The first step for Democrats: Fix blue states"},{"text":"Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Dogmatik_ ([1?](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Dogmatik_)).^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: 90% of Donald Trumps public statements are hyperbolic. 50% of Americans Accept These Statements As True."},{"text":"Dems havent put up a decent candidate in 3 elections.

Both cases seems to be very similar.\\nClaim that Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler (which obviously can't be objectively justified) among Democratic voters seems to be believed as true just as strong as Republicans supportets seems to believe in Trump's statements.Similarly the process of adjusting Trumps words to personal beliefs by Republicans that you mentioned seems to have analogy on Democrats side we also can easily see that each group of Democrats supporters has done personalization of base claim and adopted it to Thier own specific situation.\\n- Transgender minorities added claims of inevitable extermination of transgender people, \\n- Homosexual communities often repeated about the delegalization of gays \\n- Women, despite Republican officials denied that several times, claimed that Trump would lead to the deaths of thousands of women by completely delegalizing abortion. This is a truly fascinating phenomenon because both sides, as if by the same mechanism, blindly believed in their version of the truth and at the same time firmly recognized the version of the opposing side as a lie. Just like if, on some level, humans could only accept as truth what they previously agreed with/identified with in some way, or something that, despite its absurdity, seemed to confirm their previous beliefs.\\nAlsow the case of a women I've mentioned shows something extream, however not sure how to interpret it. Despite official declaration about Reps abortion policy they didn't change thier mind and stick to original claim which presented an extremely unfavorable and certainly undesirable situation. This is so counterintuitive because, it seemed to me that (with taking into account distrust in opposite side words) it would be easier for a person to accept a much more favorable statement than keep the one that is much worst.","title":"CMV: 90% of Donald Trumps public statements are hyperbolic. 50% of Americans Accept These Statements As True."},{"text":"In 2016 I was a teen and In college.

But the fight for equality is far from over, as the\\nLGBTQI+ community continues to face attacks and bigotry in states across the country.\\nDemocrats are committed to defending LGBTQI+ rights.\\nPresident Biden is committed to leading the most pro-equality Administration in history.\\nDemocrats passed and President Biden signed the historic Respect for Marriage Act,\\nenshrining marriage equality in federal law. He reversed Trumps un-American ban on\\ntransgender servicemembers and ended the disgraceful and discriminatory ban on blood\\ndonation by gay and bisexual men. On Day One of his presidency, he signed a historic\\nexecutive order extending federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQI+ people, and he\\nsigned executive orders strengthening civil rights protections in housing, employment,\\nhealth care, education, and the justice system. He pardoned service members who had been\\ndischarged for being themselves.\\nAs president, Trump rolled back the LGBTQI+ communitys hard-fought progress. Trump\\ngutted ObamaCBiden anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and banned\\ntransgender service members from serving, overruling the recommendations of military\\nleaders and public health professionals. And, he appointed judges who oppose same-sex\\nmarriage, have sided with businesses to reject LGBTQI+ customers, and helped implement\\nthe militarys transgender ban.\\nWhen a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay\\nin the afternoon, something is still wrong. Thats why Democrats will pass the Equality Act to\\ncodify protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and their families. We will prohibit employment\\ndiscrimination in the federal government, including contractors, and make federally-funded\\nseniors programs LGBTQI+ inclusive. And we have and will continue to make great strides in\\nprotecting LGBTQI+ children and prospective parents in the adoption and foster care\\nsystems.\\nPresident Biden has delivered on his promise to ban discrimination in health care on the\\nbasis of gender identity and sexual orientation. He has protected transgender Americans\\naccess to health care and coverage, including medically necessary gender-affirming care;\\nand implemented a national strategy to end the HIV epidemic in this country. Democrats willbuild on this progress to expand mental health and suicide prevention services for LGBTQI+\\npeople.\\nTrump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which will increase costs and rip away\\nprotections for LGBTQI+ Americans. That landmark law ensures LGBTQI+ people nationwide\\ncan access health care free from discrimination; helped reduce the uninsured rate among\\nLGBTQI+ Americans and their family members; and banned insurance companies from\\ndenying care or charging more for people with pre-existing conditions. Trumps MAGA\\nRepublican allies are also looking to target surrogacy for LGBTQI+ Americans next.\\nAs President Biden has said, LGBTQI+ youth are some of the bravest people he knows, and\\nhe has made it a priority to fight for them. The Administration is combating the dangerous\\nand cruel practice of so-called conversion therapy. Democrats have invested in supporting\\nLGBTQI+ youth mental health, including through the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities\\nAct. President Biden has also taken action to support LGBTQI+ youth in foster care; and is\\nfighting book bans that censor LGBTQI+ content. He signed an executive order\\nrecommitting the federal government to guarantee educational environments free from sex\\ndiscrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. He signed a\\nhistoric executive order to address discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQI+\\nchildren and families, directing key agencies to protect families and children; safeguard\\nhealth care and programs designed to prevent youth suicide; and support LGBTQI+ children\\nand families by launching a new initiative to protect foster youth, prevent homelessness, and\\nimprove access to federal programs. And, he established the White House Task Force to\\nAddress Online Harassment and Abuse to help fight online hate that disproportionately\\ntargets LGBTQI+ people, including youth.\\nTrump is running on an extreme plan to punish doctors who treat transgender youth and to\\nban gender-affirming care, and his MAGA Republican allies have pushed a tidal wave of\\nextreme anti-LGBTQI+ bills in statehouses across the country. Democrats will vigorously\\noppose state and federal bans on gender-affirming health care and respect the role of\\nparents, families, and doctors C not politicians C in making health care decisions.\\nDemocrats will continue to fight for LGBTQI+ youth by building on President Bidens historic\\nactions to ban so-called conversion therapy; protecting LGBTQI+ children from bullying\\nand discrimination; guaranteeing that transgender students are treated fairly and with\\nrespect at school; and ending the homeless crisis among LGBTQI+ youth.\\nLGBTQI+ Americans have long faced threats to their safety just for being who they are.\\nPresident Biden launched the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership to provide\\ncommunity safety trainings, support health care providers who serve the LGBTQI+\\ncommunity, and support LGBTQI+ communities to report hate crimes, and build\\ncross-community partnerships to address hate-fueled violence.

Which means we are just passing the problem forward into the future. A whole mass of people who are under educated and taught that what they see on the news is real. People can complain about boomers and gen this and gen that until theyre blue in the face, but a surprisingly large percentage of voters (at least the numbers Ive seen since the election) were younger voters that dont care about red or blue just whats been spoon fed to them by the boxes in their pockets.
