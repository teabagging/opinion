Have you honestly never been told examples of misandry in the Democratic party, and how sure are you you aren't doing the same behavior?Let's cover just three examples.1. There is no section to appeal to men on the Democratic website for a campaign level.2. The Democratic party has opposed shared custody bills on a state level numerous times3. The Violence Against Women Act for a federal level. (Both in name and structure. While the act was later amended to allow funding to male shelters, shelters which had already begun to be funded were grandfathered in, and the money was already allocated).These are, by far, not the only examples.

The Stormy Daniels checks from Trump to Michael Cohen were written in 2017 and were reported on in January 2018, but the indictment was not brought until March 2023, five years later, with the trial starting in April 2024, right at the beginning of campaign season.With the election interference prosecution, the events took place on January 6, 2021, but the indictment wasn't returned until August of 2023, two and a half years later.Regarding the classified documents, Trump's term ended January 2021, the raid took place August 8, 2022, and the indictment was returned June 2023, with the trial initially set to take place May 2024.Lastly, the Georgia election interference indictment was returned in August 2023, almost three years after the 2020 election.

Go ahead.Make them do more than repeat a Democrat taking point like a mindless NPC. Put them on the defensive.None of the shitlibs will be able to convey a single, coherent explanation of anything. They dont know what he was charged with, the elements, the procedural issues, or the judges or prosecution.Read up on the disposition of the classified documents case (Florida), the sassy prosecutor Fanny Willis and her boyfriend case (Georgia), and the one where they said he overvalued his property in Florida (New York case), and the accounting issue with stormy Daniels (New York).

I don't necessarily think we should believe what voters say in focus groups and the like (in fact I think you should almost never take them at face value), but this would be a pretty shocking disconnect, and a disconnect that virtually no one explicitly verbalized.Even subconsciously it doesn't quite make sense--if the idea is the economy is great so we want to keep letting it ride, double down on the good times, why would the instinct be to vote for the guy who promises to blow it all up? the same guy who did blow it up last time? Why are people more risk averse when times are tough, instead of wanting to blow-it-all-up-try-anything-it's-gotta-be-better-than-this? Again, especially when this is opposite to everything the campaigns and voters explicitly say?I think you could maybe make a stronger case that it's not higher risk tolerance but risk underestimation--after a period of semi-competent governance people forget that things can go wrong, and so they feel free to ignore the stupidity of the GOP and hyperfocus on the petty things they hate about Dems.

Well before todays long line of right-wing populiststhe likes of Bolsonaro, Orbn, and Modiand outright fascists such as Hitler and Mussolini, it was Marxs true insight that democratic procedure alone brings no guarantee of progress. In France in early 1848 the bourgeois revolutionaries had introduced a species of universal suffrage (though it was limited only to men); on December 2, the gains of the previous year were, in Marxs words, conjured away by a card-sharpers trick. It was not the monarchy that was overthrown; instead, the French state was robbed of the liberal concessions that were wrung from it by century-long struggles. In this assessment the term liberal stands out in bold relief. Today, that word too often appears in derisive polemics that are eager to dismiss all that liberalism has stood for throughout its long and varied career. That it has served as a cover for policies of racism and empire should strike any social critic as obvious; but the further argument that liberalism serves only as an ideological groundwork for neoliberalism has become such a commonplace that few critics ever pause to consider why Marx would have mourned the loss of the liberal concessions that had been won, slowly and fitfully, often by popular struggle, during the era of the bourgeois revolutions. The anger that courses through The Eighteenth Brumaire is intelligible only if we reckon with his dialectical belief that liberalism is not a mere tissue of falsehoods but an archive of principles that can be transformed and expanded until it bursts free of the system from which it was born. A society in which liberal values have lost all credibility or have never gained sufficient traction in the first place will be inclined toward atavism rather than progress, and it will deploy democracy against itself. This is the poisonous atmosphere in which authoritarianism gains an upper hand. Populism supplants liberalism, and the true face of economic suffering turns into a grimace of nativism and racial hatred.","title":"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Donald J.

However, transgender individuals are not attempting to alter these immutable traits. Instead, their experiences are rooted in neurological processes that influence their sense of self. Questioning their legitimacy by citing high rates of suicidal ideation and detransition overlooks a crucial point: prejudice, stigma, and lack of supportnot inherent \\"delusion\\"drive these outcomes. Studies consistently show that affirmation, inclusion, and access to transition-related care yield the best psychological and social outcomes.Even if gender-affirming surgeries provided only temporary relief, what harm does it cause to let individuals make these decisions for themselves? Medical gatekeeping standards already exist for minors, with parental consent required for many procedures. For instance, boys with gynecomastia can undergo breast reduction surgery at 16 with parental approval. Why should trans boys face different standards when seeking top surgery? A 2019 study showed that 97% of breast reduction surgeries in minors were performed on cisgender males, yet there is no comparable backlash.The regret rate for knee replacements ranges from 6% to 30%, far exceeding the less-than-1% regret rate for top surgery in transgender men. Why, then, do critics not lobby to ban minors from undergoing procedures with significantly higher regret rates? Denying transgender individuals the care they need is inconsistent and reveals a bias against their existence, rather than concern for medical ethics.Ultimately, the rejection of overwhelming neurophysiological and psychological evidence in favor of outdated, simplistic models of sex and gender resembles dogmatic belief systems far more than scientific inquiry. If the goal is to reduce suffering, affirming the identities of transgender individuals and supporting their access to care is the most evidence-based approach. Blaming their struggles on \\"delusion\\" or \\"social contagion\\" while ignoring the harm caused by stigma and exclusion is both unscientific and inhumane. Until science advances to address these complexities more fully, compassion and understanding remain our best tools for supporting marginalized communities.","title":"\\"We are going to stop the transgender lunacy and I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation and we will keep men out of women's sports.\\" What are your thoughts about this latest Trump speech? "},{"text":"In neuroscience, studies of transgender individuals have revealed a distinction between biological sexdefined by phenotypic genitalia and chromosomesand gender, which is also rooted in biology. Gender refers to the sense of alignment a person feels with a particular sex. While macro-level MRI scans show no structural difference between \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" brains, at the cellular and molecular levels, distinct patterns of neuronal activity, neurotransmitter distributions, and electrical propagation occur that correspond to gender identity. Research demonstrates that transgender individuals often exhibit neurophysiological traits more closely aligned with their gender identity than their biological sex.This is not a delusion but a manifestation of measurable, causal interactions within the brain, much like traits observed in neurodivergence or homosexuality. Before addressing common strawman arguments, it is essential to clarify: age, height, or one's status as an \\"Apache helicopter\\" are objective traits that can be directly measured or falsified. Identifying as such would indeed be delusional. However, gender cannot be dissected from a brain biopsy or directly inferred from one's external anatomy. Men and women can have atypical chromosomal configurations (e.g., XXY or XO) or lose reproductive organs to disease or injury. These complexities underscore the error in conflating sex and gender as binary categories.Biologically, there are two primary sexes when not accounting for intersex conditions. However, gender does not claim to be binary in the same sense. Gender reflects a spectrum of traits shaped by neurophysiological processes, much like the color spectrum divides red and green into near-infinite shades. Similarly, the \\"gender spectrum\\" provides nuanced and more accurate descriptors for brain-based identities. Science evolves with evidencejust as Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet, the conceptual distinction between sex and gender has also shifted to reflect modern understandings.At its core, you are the experience of consciousness that arises from physical processes within your brain, not your body. While your body sustains these processes, hypothetically, a brain transplant would preserve your identity, whereas separating you from your brain would end it. Consequently, it is the brain's biophysical processesinteracting with the body but distinct from itthat govern gender. This does not imply that the body is irrelevant but highlights its limitations in determining ones identity. Even many theistic frameworks posit that the self is not identical to the body, raising the question: why should a fallible body not also err in expressing one's gender?Consider the implications of a hypothetical brain transplant into a body of a different sex. Some individuals might adapt over time, while others would not experience alignment with the new body's sex regardless of hormonal changes. This aligns with the way we understand other neurobiological phenomena, such as phantom limb syndrome or intersex variations. Interestingly, transgender individuals have a 0% incidence of phantom limb syndrome compared to cisgender individuals, as their brains do not recognize the incongruent body parts as \\"theirs.\\"The rarity of a phenomenon does not diminish its legitimacy. Apologists often argue that intersex conditions are statistical outliers and thus irrelevant to the discussion of binary sex. However, rarity is a poor argument against complexity. For instance, while hydrogen and helium make up over 99% of the universe's atoms, the existence of other elements is neither negligible nor unimportant. Intersex individuals represent over 1% of the populationstatistically significant enough to challenge rigid binary categorizations. Furthermore, even if 100% of people fit neatly into binary biological categories, this would not negate the reality that \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\" pertain to neurophysiological, psychological, and social constructs, not solely reproductive roles.","title":"\\"We are going to stop the transgender lunacy and I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation and we will keep men out of women's sports.\\" What are your thoughts about this latest Trump speech?

Nope. If the election didn't make this clear to you, most Americans aren't as absolutely obsessed with abortion as you.17% of people thought that Joe Biden overturned Roe, according to an NY Times poll. Trump also lied repeatedly about being opposed to nationwide abortion bans while surrounding himself with freaks like JD Vance who openly supported one. Most people have zero clue what the hell they just voted for.But yes, I am obsessed with basic human rights. I also stand against things like mass surveillance, the draft, and draconian drug laws. People who don't care about human rights are the problem, not the ones who do care. But that's because I'm an actual American. I don't give a single fuck if I'm literally the only person on Earth who cares about human rights; I'll continue to prioritize them. If the election didn't make this clear to you, most Americans aren't as absolutely obsessed with abortion as you. There are other gendered issues in this country try than that. Many of them kill far more people than lack or abortion.Texas's maternal mortality rate has jumped 50% in the last few years. Many women are also being maimed/losing their uteruses because of these abortion bans. People think it won't affect them until it does. I also think it's bad when little girls, [like this one in Mississippi](https://time.com/6303701/a-rape-in-mississippi/), are forced to give birth to rape babies.

The real question being addressed is: \\"in principle, should trans women (men) be allowed to compete in women's sports?\\" Whether it happens often, sometimes, rarely, or never, it doesn't make a difference to the question. The question is about whether it would be ok if it did happen, not whether is does or does not.Anyway, the more important point is my first one. For a group that is so sure it never happens, they are VERY enthusiastic about making sure there are no laws to prevent it.","title":"\\"We are going to stop the transgender lunacy and I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation and we will keep men out of women's sports.\\" What are your thoughts about this latest Trump speech?

They'll promise that they will fix all our problems just like *that*, and if you just put whichever bad guy (immigrants, LGBT people, billionaires to use an example on our side) in their place, everything will be perfect. (And I'll clarify that I'm eager to tax billionaires and regulate their companies so we have money to help people, but let's not pretend that's going to be a quick and easy process).But nothing works like that.  The system is slow as fuck.  I wish it was faster quite often, but that's not going to change anytime soon. And nobody can ride in and fix everything right away.So people abandon Joe Biden-style politicians who work within the system, take their time, and get big-time results (most notably, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act).  They go for the guy promising to snap his fingers and make everything perfect right away.  And then they decide that politics is useless and default to complaining on the Internet (which I'm fine with the Trumpers doing, but we need every good person out there and voting to get the kind of majorities where you can do big-time change).Use populism wisely.  It gives a good vision to work towards, and it gives a nice jolt to the base.  But if it's all you do, you end up demoralizing people in the long term, and hurting the political system.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 22, 2024"},{"text":"Lying Republican liars.","title":"Unhinged GOP candidate says LGBTQ+ people are a terrorist organization who kill Christian kids.

So now that we know that they get their money from Big corporations and billionaires, we don't have to donate a thing to The Democratic party. Democratic elders sneered at us and told us that we're too woke, we're too Progressive, we need to stop defending our gay and trans friends, we need to stop caring about Black lives, When our kids get shot at schools we need to keep our mouths shut because that's just the cost of doing business.

Despite this second reality, I still would've voted for a more liberal candidate if it were Bernie in 2016 or literally anyone else than Harris in 2024. I've voted for Trump three times because the alternative party has failed three times to field any remarkable candidates on par with a Sanders or Obama. I know that there was a case to be made for Biden because the POTUS can only do so much and appointments are just as critical as the person making executive decisions, but that argument also can work in favor of Trump, so the whole thing is gray morally in my opinion. We can talk about all the deranged ways people support Trump, but part of the equation is to ask the question: Who else is there to represent your interests if you are fiscally conservative? You're really damned if you do and damned if you don't when it comes to who you vote for.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Sure as shit wasn't his \\"policies\\".?","title":"Trump Says Talking About Hannibal Lecter Won Him the Election"},{"text":"Keep telling yourself that First LadyTrump!","title":"Trump addresses Elon Musk's growing political influence: 'He's not going to be president'"},{"text":"Yeah Musk needs to get his VP under control!","title":"Trump addresses Elon Musk's growing political influence: 'He's not going to be president'"},{"text":"How is this true?

And even before Trump said he would lower grocery cost, many just automatically assumed bringing Trump back in would, I guess, bring back the 2016-2020 economy somehow (the one he inherited from Obama, BTW). Then there are the people who just don't think a female POTUS could stare down gruff, male world leaders like Xi Jinping and Putin. Again, if these people watch the news, they'd have known over the years of at least one or two of the many female leaders around the world past and present.  Plus a lot of people didn't even know Joe Biden dropped out months ago. That'd be IMPOSSIBLE to miss if you actually watched the news since it was only about Kamala and Trump for three solid months.  If they watched the mainstream media, they could also see for themselves that Kamala Harris was a very normal, articulate woman via clips of her speeches and interviews played on the news unlike the mentally disabled person Trump kept painting her as.

This isn't to say that religion should be politicized, but to say that we find ourselves on a slippery slope when we view traditional western values as a form of ignorance or extremism.To be fair though, it doesn't help when you are trying to have a civil discussion on political matters and people cite scripture or use biblical arguments over reason to support their arguments. I ideally would like to view Christianity as a force for good. It's important to consider that Christianity and most history is often overlooked and degraded for its faults rather than in its achievements. This could be done similarly in the reverse. Moderation with religion and politics is the answer.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Like most of the world, this sub has an aging population, meaning that medical research targeting the biology of aging must be funded aggressively now so that medical therapies will be ready by the time we would otherwise be old.","title":"November r/Neoliberal 2024 Demographics Survey Results (Part One)"},{"text":"Try r/Warts","title":"Donald Trump says Vladimir Putin wants a meeting as soon as possible about the war with Ukraine"},{"text":"I feel like there's a non-zero chance that Hakeem himself gets elected Speaker this time around.","title":"Jeffries: There will be 'no Democrats available' to save Mike Johnson's speakership"},{"text":"Thats true, but lets also factor in how much work Trump actually put into presidency.

He thinks he's John Galt and that in a libertarian meritocracy, he'd be king. He's an objectivist, and he's committed to the idea that anyone who challenges his ego is actually just someone who can't understand his genius.In the book Atlas Shrugged, Dagny even kind of has to learn NOT to be charitable because it actually just makes things worse because charity is framed as giving to people who just take and take and give nothing to society in return. The antagonists Rand writes are based on her bad experiences under Soviet Union corruption, so her philosophy basically concludes that anyone who supports any kind of charity is either a looter who is using kindness as a front to steal for themselves or is something someone is doing because they are being naive and taken advantage of themselves.He's too privileged to understand how simplistic and wrong objectivism is, so because he's a nerd with self-esteem issues, he responds to all the criticism by pivoting into narcissism to prop up his ego instead of questioning if he's maybe wrong after all. The more other humans are \\"other\\" to him because he's a special and they're his antagonists, the less he feels like he needs to hold back. I bet he thinks history will remark on how, even if he did some unpopular stuff, the good he did was totally smart and worth it. So, it's like he's \\"above it all\\" because of his ego, but he's also very reactive because that ego is held up defensively to feel better about himself.","title":"Mike Johnson asked Elon Musk if he wants to be Speaker of the House"},{"text":"And yet, Donny still cant tell Elon no","title":"Trump Pushes Back on President Musk Claims"},{"text":"I mean, in this one limited case, Leon isn't wrong.

That is not up for debate.  I mean, sure, but it's kinda missing the point. Obviously Trump's remain in Mexico policy meant there would be less people crossing the border. But that just means that the place immigrants were waiting changed. Without that policy they could cross and wait in the U.S. With the policy, even if they crossed they would be sent back to Mexico. So the numbers of people crossing would obviously drop. But that doesn't necessarily mean there are less illegal immigrants, or that the legal immigration policies are better.To be clear I'm not saying either side was better, but the way you're saying makes it sound like it was a change in terms of things care about, instead of just a policy change that by itself isn't what most people care about.
