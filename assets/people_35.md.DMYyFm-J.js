Sanctions following the Crimea annexation in 2014 led to economic stagnation, weakening Russia's ability to project power.

Trump keeps saying he wants \\"deals\\" and what's wrong with that?  \\nThere are two problems. One is the precedent which always hangs over at least British discussion of war (and not just British I'm sure) - Chamberlain struck a peace deal with Hitler over Czechoslovakia in 1938 and look where that got the world. The fear of appeasement hangs heavy in the debate over what to do about Russia - attempts to meet Putin halfway in the past don't seem to quench his thirst for rebuilding the Russian Empire.  \\nThe second problem is because Trump comes over as erratic it raises the possibility of miscalculation. If his interlocutors think he is going to give them a big concession in return for a deal, they can then become more, not less, assertive in pursuing their goals. That is, arguably, what happened in Afghanistan, where Trump's \\"peace deal\\" with the Taliban left them far more sure than before that they could just take the whole country by force, which they did once Trump was out of office. America was then forced to escalate, and then decided to pull out. It was all a bit of a mess.  \\nOf course, it's possible that he really might strike a decent deal. But again, would he be looking at the small print? That's where the devil often is, and is he a small print person?  \\nRichard Spencer","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

Yeah it severely sucks we can't agree on social issues, as a trans woman I wish it were that simple but it isn't. We need to build bridges and win people over on what directly affects all of us rather than letting the bullshit culture war stuff *both* parties push to control a narrative that keeps us fighting each other. We honestly need to just to shift focus entirely to how unify with each other over our shared needs. 90% of people just want to be able to afford rent or to buy a home, to feed their families and pets, have access to decent healthcare that won't bankrupt them, and be able to have some recreational time and spare funds to spend on it. We all need and want those things more than we care about ideological differences and if we could get on the same page under a party driven to fulfill the needs of the people the progressive social ideas can be won over from that. People are more likely to listen and consider things when not being constantly kept stressed by not having enough money, fear of losing their homes, dying because they can't afford medicine, medicine, and so on. That push to the edge makes them latch on to whatever person says they'll make it better and whatever rhetoric they use to shift the blame from the wealthy who are our true shared enemy. Again, most don't even give a shit about the rhetoric, sure some deeply do and that's an issue, but like we've been discussing most people voted for Trump because of the economy and promises to working class people. We have to shift away from running on social issues and focus on addressing our shared, basic needs. Social change can and will only come after people don't feel desperately backed into a corner. We need a labor forward party that puts the people as people first Knowing that every other good thing we want can come out of that once we all unify over getting what we all need to live safely and securely. I honestly think the only sane thing we can do over the next 4 years is figure out how to make that happen. We need to start building a new party together.

I'd love to know what they think.  \\nt's a difficult one - it could be the defining issue of the next few years if people on all sides get their calculations wrong.  \\nTaiwan is clearly nervous that Trump might either pull back from support for Taiwan (in keeping with \\"America First\\" and its dislike of \\"foreign wars\\"); or that he might strike some sort of deal with President Xi which leaves the island exposed. There's also the possibility that he might turn against Taiwan's semiconductor industry, which is so vital both economically but also as  \\"roadblock\\" to conflict given how important it is to China too. It's just the sort of industry Trump and Vance would want to \\"reshore\\" to America. That would leave Taiwan very vulnerable.  \\nMy feeling though is that at the end of the day Trump knows that the build up of forces on either side in the Pacific is dangerous and has to be managed carefully, and he will realise it would take too much of his attention, on a topic that isn't his first concern, if he decided to do anything to really stir things up. If I were in his shoes, I'd say I had a lot to be getting on with making America great again, and the conventional deterrence policy in the Pacific has worked so far, and leave it at that. One of the \\"MAGA-friendly\\" policy wonks in Trump's orbit - Eldridge Colby, and there's rumours he might get a job in the administration though I've no idea whether they are true or not - has said some very hardline things about China.

Trump is likely to be more hawkish on Iran than Biden and potentially back Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear sites. If he gives the Israelis the weapons to do that (bunker busters that can penetrate extremely deep into the earth) then Iran may be pushed into a corner and feel it has no option but to ramp up its nuclear capabilities with a view to using them - a pretty terrifying prospect.

Marx never used the term and Engels only used it once. Later thinkers would develop the concept into an explanation for why workers appear to form ideological commitments that go against their class interest. Unfortunately this idea is completely wrong. In the German ideology Marx and Engels make clear that ideological developments only arise in correspondence with material developments. To put it differently, every ideology has a material basis. Marx and Engels discuss in their private letters that it is possible and natural for workers to become bourgeois-ified. By being included in the benefits of the surplus labor extraction process, workers are turned into both the victim and perpetrator. You are wrong, workers are not the majority in America. The majority of people who claim this status are actually bourgeois-ified in the way that Marx and Engels described. Therefore, they have a bourgeois material interest and vote accordingly. This not only explains why this election went the way that it did, but also why your idea of uniting \\"all workers\\" is historically impossible.Edit: aside from the ignorance of the other user, the reason that they call you a liberal is because the theory of false consciousness is today championed by the Democratic party. That might seem ridiculous but consider that they are operating on the same principles that you are. The proof is all these think pieces and news articles by liberals who speculate on the internal workings of the minds of Latinos and other people that didn't vote for them.","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

The interesting wrinkle is the whole elevated vice president with less than two years remaining in the term. Theoretically, they could wait until Jan 2027 and then 25th Amendment Trump. Vance could then potentially be president for 9 years and 364 days if elected twice. The tradeoff tho is that right now they have Congress. So letting Trump serve the first two years risks them not being able to get Vance into the Oval with a kept Congress. So to me the question boils down to whether they are looking for more short term or long term returns. Apologies if any of this comes off as fearmongery. That is not my intent.

Estimates from a study released in December by Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors show that by mid-2019, increased input costs due to the steel and aluminum tariffs are associated with 0.6 percent fewer jobs in the manufacturing sector than would have been the case without the tariffs.

You may have been thinking something different, but I can only respond to what you say, I'm not a mind reader. I take what people say to be what they mean. you seem to be interested in my own psychology so whatever Ill play.Not your personal psychology, but the reasoning behind why 73 million American voters do not find attempting to subvert an election automatically disqualifying for the presidency. If it seems bizarre it may be because I genuinely want to understand the reasoning rather than use it as a cudgel to demonize people I disagree with. What you provided is that it didn't work. This is hindsight bias. You assume that because it didn't work the first time, it can't work in the future. It would be hindsight bias for me to say it's guaranteed that he will try a second time. That's one reason I'm not out here screaming \\"America is over!\\" like I see some people doing. But he tried, and therefore he can never be trusted with the reins of power again. You also cited the constitutional term limit. The problem is, if Trump seeks to stay in office past his term, he has already shown that he is willing to disregard the law, so this would be no guarantee. This shows the corrosive effect his previous attempt to stay in office illegally has had; it has undermined faith in the rule of law. You cited other issues that you find more important, but to me, it's inescapable that these are secondary when you believe the President-elect is disqualified from holding the office in the first place. It's akin to saying \\"Mussolini made the trains run on time.\\" So if you don't understand why this was a talking point, I don't know how to explain it to you. It's a showstopper, it's a slam dunk. But, the results of the election show beyond a doubt that more people agree with you than with me.

His exit from office after term 1 was not legacy material.  This one will be.  Here's why.When Trump made the July 4th celebration happen at Mt. Rushmore, I watched his speech and I watched his body language during other speeches.  He kept looking up at those heads.  In my opinion, taking mental measurements of what his will look like up there.  But, to get there, you have to not be a good POTUS, or not even a great POTUS, you gotta be epic.Why did Trump decide to put himself out there for office?  Ego?  Sure, can't get a bigger one anywhere else, can ya? Yet, the egotist would NEVER succumb to the character assassinations and drain on personal wealth and family relationships like that guy.  The egomaniac would have completed term 1 and gone on about his rich life.I think that Trump, if anything, is consistent.  He's had thoughts on politics since the 1980's.  Go back and watch both of his Oprah interviews.  Check out several of his magazine interviews.  He is also loyal.  JFK Jr. got himself into a plane crash.  They were very, very good friends.  And JFK was making some noticeable waves in George magazine very shortly before he forgot how to fly when flying.  I don't think Trump ever forgot that.  But, since the last initial in the name is a \\"K\\", ya think the true story of a crash is readily available?  You're gonna need some top-top clearance to get to see THOSE case notes.  This situation was a marker, in my opinion.Fast forward to a guy in the mid teens of this century, being courted by rap stars for video cameo, and everyone admiring the dude, watching some \\"The Apprentice\\" and whatnot, and I think he saw his opportunity to actually make a difference.  I'm sure he had a LOT of thought about the advantages and disadvantages.  Very few stupid people are billionaires.Making a difference would back up all of the rhetoric he'd thrown around about politics since the '80's, and he saw his window of opportunity opening.  And, since he's a go big or go home type of personality, he packed a bunch of bags of ideas to take through the window sill.Go back to his gilded escalator speech to when he was coming down to the basement to meet the press.  There's a store at the top of the escalator in Trump Tower.  What is that store?  What does the sign say?So, the rich guy with ideas and ideals is gonna drain the swamp.  Ha!  Boy did HE learn!  After losing, on his \\"thank you\\" tour, I think in Arizona, he said something to the effect of \\"you sent me to Washington to drain the swamp, but I had no idea how deep it was or how many monsters were in it.\\"  Now, he does.He's learning that money matters, but, power is worth more than wealth in people.  It can be fixed though.  Limit the power, and limit the money and you might get representative governance.Trump packed a straw the last time he went to DC.  I didn't think to pick one up myself.  If I would have, there would have been two people sucking up muck and spitting it out to dry in the heat of daylight against the dark dredges.  Want to make a difference?  Get a straw and help the dude help us.  Demand prudent changes to voting regulations to eliminate the argument of elections are (s)elections and your vote doesn't matter.  Demand responsibility with our tax dollars, and accountability for the power we award our overlords.  Where's term limits legislation?  Hell, I could go on all day! Of the people, by the people, for the people is you and me.  Not them.  It's time to remind them all of it, regardless of the D or R or I next to their name.  And, if Trump can get it done, and we do our part with our own straws, he will get an admirable legacy.And, if Trump tries any less than good for the people, he ain't exempt from getting sucked up in someone's straw and spit out on the banks as well.  But, I have a feeling I might have to buy a rock chisel, some climbing rope and take some basic sculpting YT videos with me on an unplanned trip to South Dakota in a few years, instead.  Making America Great Again benefits all of us.","title":"Theory: Trump rigged the 2024 election with help from Jill Biden.

He played the game well enough to survive in the cesspool.  In that career, it was not monumental.  Party line votes, limited sponsoring of legislation, basically, getting his own wealth to grow pig style rather than hog style.  You know, the old \\"Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered\\" thingy.But, he did have personal aspirations.  And hooking up with Obama got him the opportunity to flirt with hogging.  However, you ain't gonna go full hog if you ain't got the biggest chair.Biden had his machine in place.  A close knit team of family members with little outsider assistance in the inner circle.  If one of the cogs (Hunter) wouldn't have been so dysfunctional, the sky would have truly been the limit every time he hung his \\"Garage Sale\\" sign.He'd have been a one-term POTUS, for sure, but, maybe a two-termer if it wasn't for Hunter's spotlight shining down.HOWEVER, he wants his legacy.  He doesn't want to leave disgraced.  Jimmy Carter fucked up everything royally in his 4 years, yes, Reagan beat him, but, just about anybody could have.  And Ole Peanut Farmer is beloved, even until this day.  Jimmy's bad moves are long forgiven, they didn't self-enrich.And Biden, without Hunter, might have gotten that.  Now, Biden's in a quandary.  His kid ain't cracked up for incarceration, but, he's pledged and promised not to pardon.  Biden also never said he wouldn't pardon Trump, though.To protect his legacy, I foresee a backroom deal where Biden pardons Trump, and then Trump pardons Hunter.It's a win for Biden to protect legacy.  Sure, he's not going to go out and start building houses for Habitat for Humanity and whatnot, but, what he is going to do is take HIS 1B campaign chest that he turned over to Harris, take his 10 percent for the Big Guy and slink off to live happily ever after, family-wide.  The big short.  And, while everyone is scratching their heads over the Trump pardon, he'll be stashing his scratch with a smile.  He's old, he's fading, but, he's as conniving for self preservation as he ever was.","title":"Theory: Trump rigged the 2024 election with help from Jill Biden.

Gabriel here at the Sunday Times. I sense you may have a particular view on this theme. Let me try answer in a way which doesn't just amount to a defensive riposte to your comment about \\"lies\\". The answer is, erm, yes. I am worried about the obsolescence of what you describe as legacy media. Nobody could possibly have watched newspapers haemorrhage circulation and withdraw from communities over the last two decades and conclude anything other than the fact we face an existential challenge, and have in the case of many titles already lost it - i.e. look at the number of local and regional tiles on both sides of the pond which no longer exist.  I am an official Millennial - I hate that term - and can inform you I don't know a single member of my age group who buys a print paper, which is possibly fine and no longer surprising. Just as stark however is how few people consume any traditional media full-stop.  Thankfully for you, and for democracy, the only way we can restore our role, and both retain and win back readers, is by earning their trust and reporting in an accurate, fair and compelling way. I promise we try harder at those things than you probably think, but don't take my word for it.

From where I look,  social media is certainly taking over a lot of the discourse - whether Instagram pix or serious debate on Twitter or forums like Reddit - but most people are aware that these are places for discussion, however wild, banter and stirring things up, not for calm consieration of facts. Legacy media have come back into the game for those prepared to pay for what used to be called derisively \\"gatekeeping\\". On your side of the Atlantic (assuming you're American) for all its critics the New York Times has ten million paying subscribers. That's ten times the number it had when it was just a print product. Fox news remains a big influence on voters, clearly.  \\nWhat I do see as  happening from my side of the Atlantic is that audiences are becoming more polarised in America as they already were in Britain. Papers in the US used to be city-wide - New York Times, Baltimore Sun or whatever. That model's not sustainable in an internet world. Now the papers are trying to define themselves for bigger markets - but are being attacked by the left for not being left enough and the right for not being right enough, but everyone agrees they are biased (but for opposite reasons). It's a tough situation.  \\nIn Britain, papers have always been politically aligned so it's easier for us. The BBC, though, is in exactly the same position as the NYT - assailed from both sides.Richard Spencer","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

Turnout was very slightly depressed vs. the last election, likely by about 500K people. But that was the highest turnout election in recent memory, by a very large margin. Seems like if its not one hoax, people are eager to spread another.","title":"The right-wing claims about voter fraud have suddenly vanished"},{"text":"People are morons, many overworked, and all of us are pretty fuckin  angry.

The deportations and tariffs achieve a number of things:1. Global inflation. This is the big one. High inflation leads to discontent. Discontent leads to people turning to the far-Right who are in the rise in almost every country in Europe. Who just so happen to be friendly with Russia. 2. Meagre GDP growth. Again, this is global. Wages thus have a harder time catching up with inflation. Exporters are hurt, especially smaller ones that are more susceptible to tariffs. Entrepreneurship and innovation collapses due to a lack of feasibility. Productivity remains stagnant. This all further fuels the political changes as in (1).3. A collapse in asset prices, due to the above. This is the reason why the global ultra-wealthy are so attached to far-Right parties. Because they want to buy up assets on the cheap. You can get away with all of this by ensuring two things. A. Removing democratic structures, and therefore accountability; and B. Installing *awful human beings* as leaders, the type of people that dont care about the welfare of the ordinary citizen or the prosperity of the country as a whole. They only care about power and their personal wealth.I have had difficulty trying to get this across to many people, as it runs counter to basic economic wisdom. Why would any leader wish to *destroy* their country? But were dealing with a very different type of leader. Ones that are connected to a certain class of people that are *extraordinarily wealthy*. These arent just your usual rich people. Not millions. *Hundreds of millions to the tens of billions* range. They do not see the world the same way we do. They see it as essentially a game of competing dynasties. They also know that while there is of course money to be made from *creating* value, theres also money to be made from *destroying* value. The latter option is much easier if you have the political capital.","title":"Trump promises to implement the largest mass deportation plan in U.S. history"},{"text":"You mean they're totally full of shit?

Democrats lost margins in every demographic, every racial base, 99% of blue and red counties, and every cross-tab except college educated women (barely). We need to start fixing this now. A lot of these \\"you'll get what you deserve\\" and \\"America revealed it's horrible\\" messages do nothing but deepen the Democratic circlejerk and further alienate most voters. Dems don't need that, they need to win. If Democrats are in power, better social justice will follow. But they need to get in power first.Existing Democratic policies are very popular. More than enough to win elections, as down ballot propositions showed. But the messaging recently has been too entirely focused on the social issues and evils of Trump as a person. This isn't working. The only demographics Dems improved on in the election are college educated women and people making over 100k. The post-covid recovery has been very uneven, and the gap between those doing well and not have widened. Only those privileged enough have the capacity to vote on others' social issues. The bulk of voters vote on their own priorities. We need to speak to their priorities better instead of just lecturing them.I've been doing some exit-poll research. Very few new Trump voters did it to support him. Nobody did it because they want fascism, or want to harm women or migrants or Ukraine.Overwhelmingly, they voted Republican for themselves. We shouldn't be asking \\"how could you support XYZ horrible thing\\" and we should be asking \\"what are your needs\\". We shouldn't be telling them about Trump's latest disgusting behavior but telling them how Dem policies will make their lives better. Interestingly, Trump's turnout and votes from his base dropped a lot since 2020. He more than made up for it with new voters and flipped independents. Those paying attention on both sides are rejecting (or tired of) his hatred and messaging, yet there are a LOT more voters who are simply less engaged who overwhelmingly voted for him. Not because they wanted a fascist, but because they want lower taxes, lower prices, a better economy, and safe borders (related to economy). The Dem response needs to address these issues, instead of focusing on Trump/GOP's negatives (voters are exhausted/disbelieving and won't engage) or protecting marginalized groups (LGBTQ, Trans, Migrants, other countries, Geopolitics, etc).

Covid gaffes, relationship/affair scandals. But really, who cares about literally any personal baggage in modern politics? Trump proved it doesn't matter nearly as much as people thought. So what if the guy had a fundraiser during covid or had an affair. The lid's already been ripped off that box, which means it won't matter for Newsom. You nailed it, it really does just boil down to charisma and looks, and the ability to project as an alpha. Wonky policy geek stuff can be dealt with later, the front office of the campaign doesn't need to worry about it.

And dont forget he was almost killed 4 months ago and he still kept on fighting. Kept on campaigning. Didnt cancel his appearance in the RNC in Wisconsin 2 days after J13. Returned to Butler, Pennsylvania where was nearly killed. Then did endearing things like staging to work at McDonalds or be inside a garbage truck.Another thing most people might overlook is Trump in 2024 might be a different person and changed man than Trump in 2016. Hes approaching his 80s in less than 2 years. Being nearly killed might have humbled him quite a bit. Theres still that blunt truths that still come out from him which makes him who he is. Yes, he can sound like Biff Tannen and sound like a bully. But similar to Howard Stern, he might have soften his tone these last 4 months. Its only the Left that havent soften their tone on Trump and think the Orange Guy is Hitler.Ive been ecstatic all week. Its been 2 days later, and Im feeling great every morning. Im personally having an excellent year in 2024. Got a car in late Dec 2023 that I love. Made some good money. My brother finally got married to this woman who looks like Emily Blunt. Finally bought a Steam Deck. Got every hat I wanted. Remodeling the house. My mom is cancer-free. Im cancer-free. My Clippers finally in their new home. But Trump winning put me over the moon and I havent come down since.I just remember that my life was much better when Trump was President. MCU was still in Phase 3 (2016-2019), their best phase ever. The year of 2019 was one of the deepest years in movies although Game of Thrones final season did suck. Finances and entertainment were better 5 years ago. Here we go again. Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars will be released while Trump is President. I think 2024 is my best year ever since 2017-2019. And I think 2025 and beyond can match those years or surpass them.2024 Election = best election results ever!!!I love the 2016 election too but even Trump supporters didnt expect Trump to win. That was quite a shock for everyone on both sides. But in 2024, we had expectations he could win and he did. It feels like my Clippers finally winning a championship. Thats how I feel with Trump being re-elected. Great year for me! Trump winning was the icing on the cake.I dont care if my Thanksgiving and Christmas this year ends up being boring which is usually the case since 2009. Trump won and thats all I care about! Bring on 4 more great years after this one.

American citizens and non-citizens need to be provided these IDs \\\\~FOR FREE\\\\~. (Only citizens can use them to vote, voting eligible ones can have a special mark or something.)The cost of a driver's license is $10-$89 depending on the state you live in. It can then cost $50 to renew that license, and must be renewed every five years.If you make these IDs the backbone of our voting system, congratulations -- you have implemented a poll tax. The only way to ensure fair and equal access under an ID system is to make the ID free, and...\\\\#2. It is the onus of the government to provide their constituents with these IDs.This is basically the main reason I don't generally support voter ID laws.

If we are to add another hurdle to voting, the burden should be on the government to lessen that load.But I do not trust the US Government to take the steps necessary to make these ID laws not a burden.Let's say you have to go to a DMV to get these licenses.

Gabriel here at the Sunday Times.Am I allowed to be solipsistic and start with Britain?

It was a remark which spoke to the mismatch between a) Blair's profoundly felt Catholicism on one hand and b) his aversion to discussing religion on the other. This which was itself a result of Britain's growing secularisation - a trend with has only accelerated since.Trump's situation in some ways resembles the opposite of  the above. He is not a conventional Christian or conservative - nobody would accuse him of that -  but he has consciously and effectively used God, prior to and during this campaign. Meanwhile fewer Americans believe in God than they once did but faith continues to feature front and centre of your great republic's national life.The big recent development seems to be the sheer explicitness with which Trump has cloaked his survival of an assassination attempt in religious language - which, by the way, I am not for a moment saying is not sincere.In 2016, Trump's alliance with the conservative / religious right was one of the big stories - I hope you hold me to account on this, as we are only a couple days after the contest, but my sense is this contest won't be defined by that, but rather the way Trump has deepened and broadened his coalition beyond its 2016 complexion.","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

That automatically disqualified half the country for no reason. Just pick Harris, don't telegraph that divisive shit!Biden said he was going to pick a black female SCOTUS justice.

Just pick Brown, don't telegraph that divisive shit!Then he did other poor optic shit like immediately negotiating to get Britney Griner out of Russia, which immediately confirms people's suspicions that this dude is favoring certain groups.

Democrats lost margins in every demographic, every racial base, 99% of blue and red counties, and every cross-tab except college educated women (barely). We need to start fixing this now. A lot of these \\"you'll get what you deserve\\" and \\"America revealed it's horrible\\" messages do nothing but deepen the Democratic circlejerk and further alienate most voters. Dems don't need that, they need to win. If Democrats are in power, better social justice will follow. But they need to get in power first.Existing Democratic policies are very popular. More than enough to win elections, as down ballot propositions showed. But the messaging recently has been too entirely focused on the social issues and evils of Trump as a person. This isn't working. The only demographics Dems improved on in the election are college educated women and people making over 100k. The post-covid recovery has been very uneven, and the gap between those doing well and not have widened. Only those privileged enough have the capacity to vote on others' social issues. The bulk of voters vote on their own priorities. We need to speak to their priorities better instead of just lecturing them.I've been doing some exit-poll research. Very few new Trump voters did it to support him. Nobody did it because they want fascism, or want to harm women or migrants or Ukraine.Overwhelmingly, they voted Republican for themselves. We shouldn't be asking \\"how could you support XYZ horrible thing\\" and we should be asking \\"what are your needs\\". We shouldn't be telling them about Trump's latest disgusting behavior but telling them how Dem policies will make their lives better. Interestingly, Trump's turnout and votes from his base dropped a lot since 2020. He more than made up for it with new voters and flipped independents. Those paying attention on both sides are rejecting (or tired of) his hatred and messaging, yet there are a LOT more voters who are simply less engaged who overwhelmingly voted for him. Not because they wanted a fascist, but because they want lower taxes, lower prices, a better economy, and safe borders (related to economy). The Dem response needs to address these issues, instead of focusing on Trump/GOP's negatives (voters are exhausted/disbelieving and won't engage) or protecting marginalized groups (LGBTQ, Trans, Migrants, other countries, Geopolitics, etc). Abortion as an issue works for women voters but that's about it.","title":"Harris campaign and allies spent more than $1.4B on political ads in losing race against Trump"},{"text":"This might be this best explanation Ive ever read.

A good example - though very technical - is when he tried to do a deal with President Erdogan of Turkey during his last presidency about America's support for the Kurds in north-east Syria. Suddenly a complex situation which had a simple purpose - building an alliance of forces against Islamic State - suddenly got a whole lot worse. There was a brief war inside Syria between Turkey and the Kurds, US troops were stuck in the middle, Russia came in as a mediator and suddenly you had Russian and American troops squaring up in a remote part of the Syrian desert. It sounds like something you wouldn't make up in the craziest war movie, but it happened.   \\nEventually things calmed down, but imagine something similar happening on one of the current conflict lines in the Middle East, or in the Far East...  \\nAs for Israel - this is a really big question. What is Trump's bottom line for US support for Israel? Will he support an expansion of the war to Iran? Again, my feeling is that there is a bottom line, but the idea that there isn't could make the war worse. Of course, as some have suggested, if he really did tell Netanyahu to stop the war Netanyahu would listen to him more than he does to Biden - but whether there would be any incentive to find a longer term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another matter.  \\nRichard Spencer","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

The entire industrialized west is going through a right wing surge, driven by anger over decades of neoliberal economics which have routed the working classes.  But instead of being angry over lost wages, voters have easily been swayed by racist and religious rhetoric, blaming immigrants and gay people for people's woes. The German people were quite easily convinced to blame Jews for the pain the Great Depression and the Treaty of Versailles caused. Had the parties of working classes (Democrats, Labour, etc.) actually looked after their constituents instead of capitulating to the rich 40 years ago, the rage which racists and Christians so effectively exploited would have been muted.Canada is only a couple of years behind the US.  Multiple European countries are seeing the growth of hard right parties, driven by rhetoric about minorities and immigrants.Any society based in capitalism will eventually fail like this.  Capitalism - late stage capitalism - fascism.  Once capitalism has taken everything from everyone, they get mad and they start to vote for things like unions.  Billionaires don't want that, so they have to get people to vote against their economic interests.  But how?Religion and racism.  And those things are in such plentiful supply globally that fascism will always win.  Every time the working class tries to improve it's situation, we'll be met with this.Look at the Great Depression and WWII.  It only took capital 30 years to undo the New Deal.  Let's say there's 50 years of violence in front of us.  And after 40 million people die, there's another post WWII period of relative peace and prosperity.  In 20-30 years, capitalism will destroy it and return to the robber baron era again and we'll go through this again.  It's unstoppable.As long as we live under an economic system like this, we will know no peace.As long as we allow adults to believe in magic sky daddy, capitalists will have an army ready to murder on their behalf.  Obviously, those last two points are never going to change.  I don't have kids, so when I'm dead, my suffering ends.

Dems don't need that, they need to win. If Democrats are in power, better social justice will follow. But they need to get in power first.Existing Democratic policies are very popular. More than enough to win elections, as this article shows. But the messaging recently has been too entirely focused on the social issues and evils of Trump as a person. This isn't working. The only demographics Dems improved on in the election are college educated women and people making over 100k. The post-covid recovery has been very uneven, and the gap between those doing well and not have widened. Only those privileged enough have the capacity to vote on others' social issues. The bulk of voters vote on their own priorities. We need to speak to their priorities better instead of just lecturing them.I've been doing some exit-poll research. Very few new Trump voters did it to support him. Nobody did it because they want fascism, or want to harm women or migrants or Ukraine.Overwhelmingly, they voted Republican for themselves.

During his last presidency, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels imported from China - it didn't do anything to stop Chinese domination of the solar panels industry, where it now has 80 per cent of global manufacturing, but it did cause big lay offs in the US solar panel installation industry for a while as prices went up and sales down.  \\nChina isn't shrugging its shoulders about this threat. Trump's said he would impose 60 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from China, and that would be a big blow. China's economy is struggling a bit at the moment (though its 4-5 per cent growth this year is only bad compared to previous years). However,  China has seen it coming - Biden also raised tariffs, and the threat from Trump was always clear. So it's acted to seek out new markets for its products particularly in South East Asia and Africa. You can see that if you go anywhere outside Europe and America - suddenly you see all these car models you don't know on the roads. Look closely and they are Chinese.  \\nWhether Trump actually goes ahead I don't really know. It's quite interesting looking at how close Elon Musk has become to Trump. We tend to look at this just through the prism of Twitter/X and the two men's shared love of the limelight - birds of a feather, if you like. But Musk has clear commercial interests here. Tesla has a massive factory in China, and sold $22 billion of cars in China last year. That's big.

Weve known for decades that when progressive policy is presented without ideological baggage, its overwhelmingly popular. And we see that in these ideologically inconsistent voting patterns.  But it is the allegiance to the in-group identity - and that means voting for Trump and his chosen bag of idiots - that gives the individual identity its validation.  We just had a Hot Labor Summer, with more administration support than any in my lifetime, resulting in rising wages for entire industries, and important conversations about AI and automation, and these issues should have been hammered home to every voter in every speech or appearance.  I agree that watching the Dems once again fall into the trap of talking about Trump at all, and courting the center Right is frustrating, as it doesnt work. Be honest and sell your victories. Be fearless in moral issues, and drag the voters there with you. Absolutely, this cowardice sucks.  But its not why they lost.   They lost because a coalition of the worst fucking people in the world wrapped their whole identities around a malignant narcissist, and fostered an addiction to pwning the libs in this aggrievement/persecution fantasy and fed it relentlessly to anyone they could find through as many seemingly unrelated outlets as possible.  How the least talented member of NewsRadio and a Ron Paul devotee who used to be a third rate Art Bell clone ended up blackpilling a generation of GamerGaters into voting for a theocratic regime that wants to take away their tentacle porn makes no fucking sense.  But here we are. Because its literally a narcissistic identity cult, built out of many smaller narcissistic identity cults that metastasized into a national if not global cancer.  And the institutions charged with preventing this sort of thing did fuck all about it - Trump should have been yeeted from office in the first impeachment but we have bad faith actors who supported the cult over the country. Or the second time. Or from any of his indictments. Or if he had been sentenced to jail for his felony convictions. Or had been forced to give up his actual judgements in his rape case.

The people who looked past the homophobia, the hate, the misogyny, people who don't care that he is a rapist.Those people, in my book, are selfish. They do not care about their community nor do they care about their country. They only care about themselves. So why should I give a fuck about them and any suffering they endure?

Gabriel here at the Sunday Times. Let me begin by saying something journalists probably ought to say more regularly. I don't know. However, my instincts are as follows. \\\\- Trump is self-evidently pro-Israel. You will recall he was the president who caved to longstanding campaign to move the US embassy to Jersualem. And he was an architect of the Abraham Accords which sought to marginalise the Palestinian question in favour of a wider geostrategic realignment against Iran and which was supposed to be Bibi Netanyahu's signature foreign policy achievement when it was unveiled in the Rose Garden.   \\nHOWEVER, Trump is guided by nothing if not self-interest and has no deeper or more abiding instinct than his opposition to costly foreign entanglements. He may be more anti-that than he is pro-Israel in relation to the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. He also has a complex relationship with Netanyahu who was one of the early world leaders to welcome Biden's victory back in 2020. There is a third, newer dimension to the question too, which is that Trump won, and, in his victory speech, celebrated winning, a lot of Arab and Muslim votes this week.For that reason I can envisage a situation where he tells Netanyahu it's time to wrap up the conflict - he won't quibble with the underlying goals or the notion of Israel's right to self defence but may well tell him to hasten its resolution. I'll leave the other bits to my esteemed colleagues.","title":"What will the new Trump presidency mean for the rest of the world?

It is pretty amazing for someone to be complaining how money and corporate interests are too strong in the Democratic party, abandoning working class people. If you think the Democratic party is too corporate and anti-worker, then I'm not sure what someone would make of the Republican party. President-Elect Trump is famously anti-union anti-worker anti-minority and anti-women.He ran a campaign that was overwhelmingly concentrated on racist, sexist anti-immigrant propaganda and whose biggest supporter is famously a right-wing billionaire and whose VP believes that child-less people should have fewer voting rights. Yet he convinced an historic number of minorities to vote for him.So obviously the issue is that the Democratic National Committee is too corporate and focused on wealthy people rather than the working class. You can go ask almost any Cuban American and they will tell you that people like Bernie Sanders are exactly the reason why they don't vote for the Democrats. I completely agree that the Democratic party has long done a terrible job at outreach to the various minorities instead spending too much time doing performative identity politics rather than trying to actually solve the issues of its constituents. But people voted for Trump because they falsely believed that he was going to be better for the economy, despite almost every CEO and competent financial institution being very clear that his financial and immigration proposals were a recipe for disaster, not to mention his proposals for running the healthcare and missile defense systems.And, again, I am not anti-Bernie but sometimes he really is less than useful.","title":"Bernie Sanders excoriates Democratic Party, calls campaign 'disastrous' after Trump victory"},{"text":"Personally it still feels like yesterday sitting in my bed with a laptop watching the leads in the rustbelt slowly disappear at 3 in the morning in the 2020 election.

The latter seem to have won out with Ukraine, if he really does do the deal he has promised with Putin.

Giving up on our trans community members' civil rights and dignity because their rights are not popular is not the answer.The most effective line I've found for defending trans rights is about tying this to individual freedom -- doctors and patients should dictate medical care, not the government. For people concerned about trans youth, we can bring up the importance of parents' rights.There is a lot of misinformation and fear mongering about trans people and especially youth. Some of it is despicable lies, such as the assertion that schools (which can barely afford copier paper for teachers) are somehow performing surgeries on children without their parents' knowledge. We need to call out this ridiculousness whenever it happens and set the record straight.There are also a lot of good people who are skeptical of trans rights but not openly hateful. It's important to treat such people with respect and have dialogue with them. We should not have purity tests where we speak ill of anyone who's not 100% on board.Trans people being more visibile in our society will help, too. When people know someone who is trans, they are more likely to support trans rights. Of course, it is not trans people's responsibility to be visible to others, and I recognize the risks that doing so can entail. But it will have a big impact. Because there's so much fear mongering, getting to know a trans person who is just an average person trying to get through life will go a long ways in helping people to reevaluate their attitudes.There are a lot of parallels to trans rights today and lesbian and gay rights 20 years ago: major backlash in the face of increasing visibility and acceptance. We can work towards a society more inclusive of our trans siblings and we can do it in a way that does not alienate people. But we must not give up on trans people and their rights.","title":"From the economy to transgender athletes: Alabama voters on why they voted for Trump, Harris or RFK"},{"text":"I love this.

They had a terrible strategy and dropped the ball so hard on so many occasions.* Biden dropped out at the last possible second, causing Democrats to skip having a primary, nominating someone that the people had zero say in, and who also did terribly in the 2020 primary\\n* Democrats completely ignored the white and middle-class demographics, and especially men (as is evident by the post-election statistics)\\n* Democrats delayed the prosecution of Donald Trump by 2-3 years, to try to force it during election season, thinking it would be an advantage. But it backfired spectacularly with Trump's delay tactics, combined with his cult of personality, plus the fact that he'd already stacked the courts with Republican judges.\\n* I'm going to be perfectly bluntly honest here... but Democrats underestimated racism and sexism. I'm not saying this had a major impact, but it mathematically must have had SOME impact, where some people would not want to vote for a) a woman, b) a black person, and c) an indian person. Not voting for someone because of any one of these three reasons is obviously wrong, but I would be shocked if it wasn't a major factor for a significant number of voters.I'd like to point out btw, especially for that last bullet point, that these are not my personal feelings or beliefs.

This year, the strategy plainly failed, according to exit polls from Edison Research.Harris only received 5 percent of Republican votes  less than the 6 percent Joe Biden won in 2020 when he beat Trump, as well as the 7 percent won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 when she lost to him. While Harris won independents and moderates, she did so by smaller margins than Biden did in 2020.Meanwhile, Harris lost households earning under $100,000, while Democratic turnout collapsed. Votes are still being counted, but Harris is on pace to underperform Bidens 2020 totals by millions of votes.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/harris-republican-appeal-democratic-support-collapse-1235156634/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/harris-republican-appeal-democratic-support-collapse-1235156634/)","title":"Harris Tried to Win Over Republicans.

The issue here is that the inequality of economic gains also prices a ton of people out, leaving only corporations or those rich enough to buy investment houses. But if the cause of the depression is tariffs and that increases construction costs, that will just halt future development and inventory will sit. Most Americans currently can't afford the median house prices and a depression makes this worse. The only way housing prices stop rising is if there's a breakthrough in inventory at levels Americans can afford. Namely, multi generational housing and/or town homes and/or apartments.

If Biden had decided to not step down, which seemed like the most likely scenario, it was going to be a cluster fuck.  That was going to happen as soon as a few elected officials came out stating that he should.  And the voters he was most likely to lose were young, progressive voters.  Bernie and AOC could potentially help blunt that.  Beating Trump was far more important than who the candidate was.They made the right choice for a number of reasons, these being the primary ones.  Had Biden not stepped down, he was going to need all hands on deck to try to get through the election.  And if they had been against him, any loss would have been pinned on them, regardless of whether he stepped down or not.  The Democratic party loves to try to blame the progressive wing for all of their problems, even though the progressive economic policies have incredibly high support among voters and yet have never been adopted by the top of the ticket.  Biden did adopt some of them, and Harris was even more so, but it was only in small amounts rather than the full embrace that would be necessary to convince people that they were going to fight for them.","title":"Democrats blame Joe Biden for Harris' loss to Trump'if he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place'"},{"text":"Biden should resign.

Especially with the cognitive decline and worry about his age, not to mention the fact we knew 100% Trump would be the nominee on the right and that they'd need a strong candidate to beat him. You can't tell me they didn't already know in 2022 he wasn't suited for it, they knew he was showing dementia symptoms too. Still they refused to primary him. Here's the sad truth: nazism beats 1% loss of control to populism. Given that choice, the establishment will always pick capital. So, rather than allow a small chance for a progressive like Bernie to win the primary and be the nominee, they purposefully waited til the very last min, shit down their leg, and selected Kamala for their ticket-head in a \\"panic\\" without asking the voters once. Why? Cause progressives have gotten closer and closer to getting the reigns of power in years past and they can't risk that. If they actually cared about democracy, or winning elections, or even opposing the right, they'd champion progressive and grassroot causes, not pick the person who came in dead last behind Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Biden, AND Elizabeth Warren. Even now-Republican Tulsi Gabbard got a pledged delegate from the Dem primary in 2020! And you know who didn't get a single one? Kamala.I remember telling my wife she'd be Hillary 2.0 (the establishment darling) in 2020, was obvious that big money interests and party leaders loved her. Yet again they got their way, and yet again they were wrong. I honestly thot Biden would step aside after being elected and she'd be our first appointed president. Came damn-close to that 4 years later as she was being shoved down our throats. I'm all for women and ppl of color in positions of power, and yes America is plenty bigoted, but skin color and gender are not a qualification, to believe so is racist. Do you take corporate money or do you raise clean campaign money, do you support climate action, Gaza action, prison reform, wall st reform, lgbq rights, education reform, healthcare reform... those are qualifications. So sick and tired of identity politics and the establishment shoving their picks down our throats. That AIN'T democracy so idk what ppl thought they were \\"saving\\".Obviously there's plenty of blame to go around, but the party telling you to preserve democracy by voting for who they selected for you couldn't even beat a fascist felon. They're feckless failures and they'll learn the wrong lessons yet again, get more corrupt, and blame the progressive wing of the party.  Wouldn't be surprised to see them blame the voters too, and Gaza and everything mentioned above, pretty much anyone but themselves. Just the way it goes when you're the Washinton Generals and you're only real job is to make the Harlem Globetrotters look good, get dunked on, dribbled around, and somehow make it all seem like it's a legit competition.

So, their goal is not profit, it's winning. They do anything that is required from an information perspective, to more closer towards their goal. Whatever is needed to accomplish that is done. Nothing else is considered. If people's brains are getting fried from the misinformation, their care level = zero. If people are falling for it and their strategy is effective at moving them towards their goal, then their care level = 100%.The only way to fight a group engaging misinformation warfare is to engage in information warfare. You can't be nice and make everybody happy. The more pissed off conservatives are, the better. Not the other way around. The DNC is getting this all backwards.

California super wealthy enclaves, but also middle class cities, and a major issue is that those wealthy enclaves are now investment zones for global wealth and the middle class places are now super expensive.  I am from a city called Riverside.  Its a middle class city with a median household income of $80,000-$85,000 per year.   Up until the early 2000s, homes were largely priced at a point where the local jobs could afford them.   Now this is no longer the case.  Entry level homes are $550,000, homes that when I was a kid were less than $100,000.   1 bedroom apartments are $1800-$2100 per month,  when I turned 18 (2002) I knew people who had them and were paying $400-$600 per month.  Our median household income to median home value is like 1:7.  Either home values need to come down or the median household income, and thus pay for middle class regular jobs, needs to skyrocket.  Median household income needs to be more around $150,000.    \\n  \\nThis is all fairly recent.

Those are two different things. I know the perception is that all home owners are making six figures or whatever, but that's not the case. I own a home. I make slightly above what experts consider a livable wage in my state. The way I was able to buy my house can be summarized as it being a tiny house with some repair needs in a town recently named the most unlivable small city in my state and me lucking into a small settlement payment from a crooked landlord. Most people would not aspire to buy the home I live in or move to the town I moved to. I love it though, and I've taken on some debt since moving in related to home repair, but I'm making things work. Finally able to save a bit for retirement. I feel pretty lucky all around. Point is, if the economy goes south or if they enact the Medicaid caps in Project 2025 (my career is in services largely funded by Medicaid), I may no longer be able to make things work. There are not many opportunities to change careers around here in a worst case scenario and I doubt that will change. My home is my only asset, in order to pay off the debt from repairing it, it is possible I may end up having to sell it and try to make a new start somewhere with a better job market. Home prices dropping precipitously could be a disaster for me in that situation.That's my specific situation, but I'm sure a lot of first time home owners would have similar concerns.That's actually why I thought Kamala Harris' proposals for tax credits for new home buyers made a lot of sense even though it wouldn't have benefited me. I'm all for helping more people be able to afford to become homeowners by making them able to afford homes, not by lowering the value of the houses themselves.

My partner passed them out. We tried. I got my historically apolitical father to vote. My mother, who received miscarriage care, elective abortions and still almost died in child birth in the 90s voted for trump. Shes hand waved the deaths due to lack of abortion care as no system is perfect. She claims that they fall on the heads of malpractice. Despite the hospitals explicitly siting the law. She refuses to believe a d and c is considered an abortion. She tells me Im crazy. That it will be better for me under trump. With worms in his brain RFK at the head of the department of health.
