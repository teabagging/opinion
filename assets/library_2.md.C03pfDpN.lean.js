(Disclaimer: I'm not aware of Harris making any false claims, and am not saying she did, I'm simply saying that people evaluating her statements may have been no less likely to do so superficially than those who supported other candidates.)This is what is meant by the \\"seriously not literally\\" trope, and why counter arguments highlighting Trump's lack of truthfulness don't tend to be effective.

Yes, of course they are frustrated with inequality; I am frustrated with inequality and corporate power! Very frustrated!And yet, you know who has been the best on that in my lifetime? Someone whose name rhymes with Schmoe Schmiden. But hes old.Though I think Milbank has his finger on the pulse of something and that is feeling alienated and disconnected from society in general. Anomie is the word, I believe. Here is a survey that notes, people who have at least a BA are more likely to have friends than those with a high school degree or less: https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-college-connection-the-education-divide-in-american-social-and-community-life/#:\\\\~:text=But%20the%20deficit%20of%20close,while%20in%20the%20past%20month.Here is a snippet from the article:But the deficit of close friends among those without a college degree is only part of the picture. The social disparity is even worse if we look at the entire network of social ties that Americans have. A 2020 survey found that 17 percent of Americans reported having no close social connectionsdefined as someone you talked to about an important personal matter within the past six months.[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-college-connection-the-education-divide-in-american-social-and-community-life/#_edn5)?Americans without a college degree were nearly three times more likely to have no close social ties than those with a college degree were. Nearly one in four (24 percent) Americans with no college education reported having no immediate social connections, compared to 9 percent of college graduates.# The Loneliness GapNot only do Americans without college degrees report having smaller social networks and fewer close friends, but feelings of loneliness are more common among those without a college education. Close to half (45 percent) of Americans without a college education report they have felt isolated from others at least sometimes in the past four weeks. College-educated Americans report experiencing these feelings less often; 36 percent say they have felt this way at least once in a while in the past month.========So I think a lot of working class people are lonely, alienated - especially the men! - and feel distrustful of institutions, including political institutions. They want to burn it all down, or they dont bother to vote at all. I think that just as we need a better economic deal, we need some kind of way to get people back together socially again.(Sorry about the terrible formatting.

Trump spent months in advance of 2020 saying \\"If I lose, it is stolen\\". Just like he said in 2024, like he said in 2016 hell, like he said in the 2015 primaries. And what did he do immediately after losing in 2020? He declared victory and starting setting up plans for how to stop the victory from being given to Biden.So one of two things must be true here:1. Trump is so delusional that he literally does not believe he can lose an election without fraud.2. Trump is intentionally spreading misinformation about fraud in order to set the stage for his own attempts at fraud.Malice or stupidity. I'm willing to at least *consider* stupidity given how much of a narcissist the man it, but if I'm being honest, Malice seems more likely.We can look at this election and how Trump behaved for evidence. On election night Trump tweeted [this.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d463/live/aeac7cd0-9bcf-11ef-9260-19e6a950e830.jpg.webp) What do you think that was based on? What massive CHEATING have you heard about in Philadelphia? Has Trump ever put forward any evidence of this? Has he talked about it since?The stupidity explanation there is \\"Trump heard a random vague story on twitter\\". I find this unconvincing because no one knew what the fuck he was talking about.The malice explanation is \\"Trump is a lying sack of shit who was trying to prepare another set of excuses\\", ones that he dropped entirely as soon as it became clear that he won and he didn't need it.With regards 2020, the cases his team brought were never looked at properly by the courts due to lack of legal standing. Not because they were debunked or lack of evidence so he still believes he won. The best way it could have been put to rest is actually look at them closely. And if the courts decided, he still would have lost anyway, ( which I believe) then that would definitively proved him wrong and he would have stopped believing he won.This is false.[Here](https://electioncases.osu.edu/case-tracker/?sortby=filing_date_desc&amp;keywords=&amp;status=all&amp;state=all&amp;topic=25) is a tracker of all major cases involving the 2020 election. [Here](https://campaignlegal.org/results-lawsuits-regarding-2020-elections) is a list of ten that were decided on the merits, which acocunts for roughly 1/6th of the total number of cases filed.If you look at the latter, you'll find that basically all of these cases were absolute garbage. Arizona Republican Party v Fontes, for example, resulted in the party being forced to pay legal fees for bringing a \\"Groundless\\" bad faith lawsuit. They found that the plantiff didn't bring evidence that showed the validity of their claims.Or how about Bower v Ducey? They found that even though they could dismiss on standing that the plantiff's complaint was meritless. They found that it was based on \\"anonymous witnesses, hearsay and irrelevant analysis of unrelated elections\\". They pointed out that declarations from poll watchers provided as proof of fraud did not even allege fraud.That 50ish of the cases were dismissed on standing or laches grounds does not mean that those cases were legitimate. For example, Trump v Kemp was officially decided on standing, but also includes language that states plainly that the \\"Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success of any claim\\"If you actually read through these cases, they're all garbage. Gohmert V Pence? That is a congressman saying \\"Hey, I'm being denied my right as a congressman to pick trump as the winner since Pence isn't willing to violate the ECA\\".Wisconsin Voters Alliance V Pence is \\"Hey the ECA is illegal, and pence shouldn't be allowed to count them unless the state legislatures affirm their presidential elector\\"Still Vs Raffensperger was put in on Dec 17th demanding that the entire Georgia certification process be decertified (after safe harbor deadlines!!!) based on three voter affidavits saying they weren't allowed to vote (with no supporting evidence) and a couple of excel spreadsheets of what they think are voter irregularities. It was voluntarily withdrawn.I'm sorry if this is a little long in the tooth but this is just such a bad argument that it annoys me.  These cases weren't sent back becasue of the deep-state judges, or whatever. They were thrown out because they could not meet even the most basic requirements of our legal system, such as making sure the plantiff had standing to sue. The ten that did were **embarrassingly** bad.The simple reality is that time is linear and we currently exist in ttyol 2024. If **any of these cases had merit we would know by now**. But we don't, because they didn't. They were all just bad faith garbage thrown at the wall trying to keep Trump from losing an election that he'd lost.","title":"CMV: 90% of Donald Trumps public statements are hyperbolic. 50% of Americans Accept These Statements As True."},{"text":"It's enough to pretty much resolve homelessness if it was spend domestically.","title":"Trumps Ukraine envoy pick proposed forcing peace talks by withdrawing US weapons"},{"text":"Weird.

Retaliatory tariffs will only escalate things and could lead to even steeper tariffs.

According to the authors, this ideal bears little resemblance to how democracy actually works. In fact, the omnicompetent, sovereign citizen found in the influential writings of Robert Dahl and Walt Whitman is an unattainable myth: voters are incapable and uninterested in fulfilling the role required of them by democracy. Most people are too busy with jobs and families to give politics sufficient attention: rather than spending their leisure time studying the minutiae of trade deals or infrastructure planning, they, quite understandably, pursue more enjoyable pastimes. Even the minority of voters that have the time and inclination to inform themselves about politics do not behave as folk theory contends. When faced with choice in a democracy, human judgement is overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and bent by self-interest. Voters use information not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them, which the authors describe as enhanced bias. To minimise cognitive dissonance C when an individual holds inconsistent opinions or beliefs C voters adjust their views to those of their favoured party, or simply avoid finding out what a partys position is altogether if it conflicts with their own.

Thats nice, but much of the job of raising kids falls upon the parents. And weve grown to expect intensive parenting as the norm, not the exception. It really does take a lot more time to raise a child now than it did a generation or so ago. The village had its downside as well as upside; people moved to detached houses in the suburbs because they could. Many people dont come from trustworthy families, or they are fleeing racism or sexism or other forms of bigotry. However, raising kids is really hard, and if you and the other parent have to go it alone, with occasional babysitting and then just hope that you can white-knuckle the slog until kindergarten, and what is expected is that the child becomes the very center of your world, its tough. Even if your kid is planned, wanted, and loved, its tough.I know there are countries that are better about providing low-cost child care.

This is a truly fascinating phenomenon because both sides, as if by the same mechanism, blindly believed in their version of the truth and at the same time firmly recognized the version of the opposing side as a lie.

Trump at Mar-a-Lago, two officials with direct knowledge of the visit said, after a threat by Mr. Trump to impose the across-the-board tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico on Day 1. One official said that Mr. Trudeau was expected to stay in the area overnight Friday, but not at Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Trudeau has been scrambling to formulate a plan to respond to the threat made earlier this week by Mr. Trump for a 25 percent tariff unless the two countries take action to curb the arrival of undocumented migrants and drugs from their borders to the United States. Mr. Trump said he would sign such a policy on his first day in office, a move that could potentially cripple trade across the continent. The threat was also seen as an opening salvo in what would most likely be a long renegotiation of the trade agreement among the three North American nations, known as the USMCA United States, Mexico, Canada trade agreement, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trudeau has tried to project calm and confidence, saying that he believed that Mr. Trump would see that tariffs would harm both countries, which are each others biggest trading partners. About 80 percent of Canadas oil and 40 percent of its gas are exported to the United States, and the two countries are deeply intertwined through the joint manufacturing of cars, as well as in multiple other industries. The Mar-a-Lago visit on Friday, which was initially reported by the Globe and Mail news paper on the basis of tracking Mr. Trudeaus plane, is intended as a direct effort by Mr. Trudeau to show that he has a plan to address Mr. Trumps border concerns, and that tariffs should be avoided for the sake of both nations economies. Mr. Trudeau and Mexicos president, Claudia Sheinbaum, have taken very different approaches to Mr. Trumps tariff threats. Mr. Trudeau and other senior Canadian officials have sought to distinguish Canadas position from Mexicos, highlighting that Canada is better aligned with the United States and Mr. Trumps agenda on three key issues: the borders, restrictions on China and bringing well-paying jobs back home. Ms. Sheinbaum has been firmer, threatening retaliatory tariffs if Mr. Trump made good on his threat.\\n \\n The split has driven a wedge between two allies, Canada and Mexico, who were able to leverage their relationship to negotiate a favorable agreement during Mr. Trumps first presidency. The trade pact is officially up for renegotiation in 2026, but analysts say they believe that Mr. Trumps decision to put tariffs against the two U.S. neighbors on the table even before he takes office, indicates that a renegotiation of that agreement could come sooner than planned.","title":"Trudeau Flies to Mar-a-Lago to See Trump Amid Tariff Concerns"},{"text":"Damn!

Carr supports changes to Section 230 and opposes net neutrality protections.Carr publicly accused social media platforms of being biased against the Trump reelection campaign and censoring conservative voices.In 2021, Carr criticized the Biden administration's proposal for $100 billion in new broadband deployment.He's an avid supporter of Elon Musk.When Elon Musk was criticized for denying Ukraine extended Starlink satellite coverage because he believed that Russia would launch an attack against the U.S. in response, Carr came to Musk's defense, claiming that there was an \\"effort to weaponize the government against Musk,\\" and that it was \\"part of a clear and repeating pattern of regulatory harassment that accelerated the moment Elon Musk stood up for free speech.\\"**Tom Homan**Homan is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, and has been named to lead Trump's mass deportation plan.Homan is listed as a contributor who helped write the 922-page Manifesto. He is also a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center.When asked about what his mass deportation plan will look like, he responded, \\"shock and awe\\" with a smile on his face.Homan has promised to execute \\"the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen.\\"He's expressed the need for \\"detention assets\\" from Congress. \\"Congress is going to have to give a massive amount of detention beds,\\" he said.\\"We're going to be out there looking for them [and] when we find them, remove them.\\"Homan has been making a case for himself over the last two years. During public appearances, he often uses aggressive and malicious rhetoric while warning Americans about all the violent criminals, terrorists, drug smugglers, murderers, etc, crossing our borders.Homan called Joe Biden \\"treasonous\\" and warned that \\"something is coming.\\"Homan has also said that child separation \\"needs to be considered.\\"Additionally, Homan has remarked that \\"nearly nine out of ten\\" asylum seekers are \\"committing fraud.\\"Homan has also expressed that he wants to end birthright citizenship and \\"chain migration.\\" Donald Trump's current wife and her family benefited from\\nchain migration.Homan supports \\"worksite operations\\" that prevent undocumented migrants from getting jobs.**John Ratcliffe**Trump is nominating John Ratcliffe for CIA director. Ratcliffe is listed as another contributor to Project 2025.Ratcliffe served as director of National intelligence in the final months of Trump's last administration. Ratcliffe has promoted 2020 election fraud theories.He also faced criticism for declassifying Russian intelligence about Democrats in 2016, even while acknowledging it was unverified.Radcliffe fervently defended Trump during his first impeachment hearings.Trump was impeached for withholding aid to Ukraine In return for political dirt on Joe Biden. That aid included javelin anti-tank missiles that were a front line defense for Ukraine against Russian proxies.\\"This is the thinnest, fastest and weakest impeachment our country has ever seen, Ratcliffe said after the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump.Ratcliffe aggressively condemned Robert Mueller and his report on Russian election interference.Ratcliffe originally withdrew from consideration for the position of DNI in 2019 because there were growing criticisms about his lack of qualifications.He's a rabid \\"China hawk\\" and supports Trump's tariff policies that previously instigated a trade war with China.**Pete Hoekstra**Hoekstra is Trump's choice for ambassador to Canada and is among the list of contributors who helped put together Project 2025.He has been named a visiting distinguished fellow at the The Heritage Foundation, concentrating on education reform.When he was first elected, Hoekstra initially pledged to serve no more than six terms in the House. However, in 2004, he announced he would break that pledge and seek a seventh term.During his tenure, he opposed abortion rights, opposed expanding health care benefits for children, opposed gay adoption rights and gay marriage, and voted against paid parental leave for federal employeesHoekstra has earned an A rating from the NRA politically victory fund.Hoekstra was a proponent of the claim that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, and held onto this belief even after no WMDs were found in the wake of the Iraq invasion.Hoekstra was a founding member of the tea party caucus. He has also been notorious for his anti-Muslim comments.**Russ Vought**Vought is major Project 2025 figure who is being considered for director of the Office of Management and Budget.He also spent time working for the lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation.He has spent years organizing a plan to restructure the government in a way that grants Trump unitary executive powers. Mr. Voughts role in Project 2025 was to oversee executive orders and other unilateral actions that Mr. Trump could take during his first six months in office, with the goal of tearing down and rebuilding executive branch institutions in a way that would enhance presidential power.In an interview, Vought laid out his plan for eliminating the independence of several government agencies in order to give the White House direct control over them. What were trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them,\\" he said.Vought said that Trump has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle the power of federal agencies and civil servants.\\"We have to solve the woke and the weaponized bureaucracy and have the president take control of the executive branch.Vought also helped publish a legal framework for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops on domestic soil in order to quell protests.*There are reports that Trump intends to consider several other nominees with ties to Project 2025*Steven Miller is set to play a major role in Trump's new admin, and he was previously listed as a member of the Project 2025 advisory board. I could write an entire separate post about Miller.Gene Hamilton and Reed Rubinstein, two Project 2025 contributors, are also reportedly being considered for top roles in Trump's adminLastly, over 100 former Trump staff have all contributed to the Project 2025 manifesto.What's more, two out of the three top executives on the Project 2025 board formerly worked directly for Trump. It wasn't too long ago that Trump said, I know nothing about Project 2025.

Japan is probably the best example of this. Trump *knows* this. A large part of his wealth has come from his real estate increasing in value, which *only* happens because of inflation... However, I'd venture to say most people don't know this. In a way, he is speaking in a way that resonates with people *because* they understand what he's saying. The game is politics.

He just cant help himself at all.  Whether he is factually accurate himself is a different question. He doesnt seem to do any kind of deep research. Hes not an intellectual, ideological or philosophical kind of guy. He likes to do things by trial and error.  And when he is trying to lie, it is so obvious. He is so undisciplined with lying, his elbows and shoulders jerk up, he twitches and he cant keep eye contact. Its actually hilarious.Saying that, yes he is hyperbolic most of the times. And there is a method to his madness. Nobody wants to hear statistics, assessments, numbers, graphs, reports, whatever. Theyre boring and most people wont remember these details as soon as you finish the conversation.

In addition, the GOP is about to temporarily lose 3 Representatives (until a special election to fill their seats) to Trump's administration. With such a slim majority, it's pretty likely that Trump won't be able to accomplish any of his more controversial legislative priorities through Congress in his second term. So much for his \\"mandate.\\"In fact, this means that if it wasn't for the 3 seats that North Carolina Republicans gerrymandered into safe GOP districts after the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats would have flipped the House of Representatives by the narrowest 218-217 margin.

Biblical womanhood in your opinion being, giving birth because its what God intended, experiencing monthly menses and not speaking against a mans wishes? I am curious and dont wish to offend.And yes. Churches wouldnt exist without money. Christ didnt set up or approve of any churches in his lifetime. And even thirty years after his death, there were only twelve and they were all extremist to the point of terrorism. Alexandria was burned to the ground by mobs of Christians and when Romans acknowledged them with the Catholic Churches, they dominated the world. One of their last known crusades was the persecution of witches/pagans in the British colonies of the US before they became the US. But that isnt anything to do with surviving and practicing Christians now. Christian churches now are mostly about learning about the Bible and getting to know your neighbors. But almost every religion has a dark history behind it. And establishments are usually established for a reason. Try not to read too much into it and if youre being told to think, say or do something that you feel is wrong, thats the only real warning sign that your establishment exists for the wrong reasons.

And let's say we're talking about LGBT rights and whatnot, I'd totally be able to empathize with people who are doing it for an easy out and whatnot, but in the case of Italy and Poland, they're not gonna find communities that accept them as much as let's say the Netherlands or Sweden, but of course, if they can live there legally too, why not.But still, you gave a worthy argument and helped me see my deeper thoughts behind it, so a delta is much deserved.

People use it in terms of old people or young people, as they make the biggest headlines, but in every working relationship youll typically have drugs or alcohol in the beginning. From one party or both. Most working relationships have a type A and type B personality. Type A isnt bad or dangerous, 90% of the time, but there are controlling types of personalities out there. Coercive control types. Type A stupidly falls into that category now and can be a woman just as easily as a man. But is usually assumed upon first read to be a man. During the first few years of a relationship, youll have a dominant personality and a submissive. Or theyll split. People who spend a lot of time together, synch their brainwaves, even family or friends, and eventually mimic their partners thoughts and feelings. Type As who are unhealthy in their ideology of opposite sex encourage their partners to do more drugs or drink more alcohol to keep them submissive and under control. Type Bs who are unhealthy in their ideology will do the same to feel safe around their significant other because they grew up with coercive control conditions and unnaturally fear Type A.The rising increase in mental disorders might actually be due to the rising increase of drugs that the FDA has been approving. You see those drug advertisements in America that say they can cause depression? Concentration issues and thoughts of suicide? How many of those drugs that the FDA approved for, say food conservation, do you suppose induce those feelings as well? Then youll go to a mental health professional who will treat you with depression with good old fashioned psychopharmacology. Thats basically legal drug pushing. Because all therapists and psychiatrists are basically instructed to give you drugs first, and the most common drug at that. Which ironically can cause all the issues theyre trying to cure and there is no cure. Depression is a natural state of being that you can learn to live with eventually or you get over, like it was a phase of your life. Unless, that is, youre constantly being attacked psychologically or youre experiencing endless amounts of suffering, like starvation or physical/sexual abuse. Women, especially, are being targeted with psychopharmacological experimentation. Because women are more likely to seek professional services. Men too.There are people who have experienced severe trauma who fall into deep and dark depressions as well. I wish there was a cure. There are medicines out there that do work for groups of individuals. I would encourage people seeking treatment to get a blood test to target the types of medications that are more likely to work for them. I wouldnt encourage people to not seek treatment. Im just saying that its doing more harm than good in a system that only cares about money and brushes aside their own failures as statistics. For anyone seeking treatment for trauma related issues, physical/sexual/psychological abuse falling into that category, I would also suggest EMDR.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"Wait, he LIED?!?","title":"Trump Disavowed Project 2025 During the Campaign.

One of my conservative family members argued super hard that the supreme court case with the praying football coach was correct, wouldn't listen to reason or logic or anything. But when when I said \\"you wouldn't think it was constitutional if it was a muslim coach,\\" he just responded that \\"he doesn't care, because it's a christian country.\\" Like to waste so much time arguing about the constitution, only to finally admit that they don't give a fuck about the constitution and that's all just a pretense.See the essay above. You think in terms of *equality* and *consistency*. Conservatives think in terms of *Good* and *Bad*.Conservatives see no contradiction in platforming *Good* religion, and deplatforming *Bad* religion.

So what we have is US global dominance (hegemony) that has allowed the US economy to thrive which in turn has led to the best military in the world.  The US is a security exporter and by doing so we can always ensure actions in the world are done in a way that both benefits the American people and keeps them safe.You may wonder how this is, the answer is that the US ensures global trade to continue, this stabilizes the world by disincentivize conflict and prevents massive wars (most of the time), there is a reason why we had major world wars before the US came to dominate (even when there was a competitor in the USSR).  If you are somewhat reliant on global trade, which the US oversees/controls, then by going to war your economy suffers as the US will ensure it is painful.Now, how does this benefit the American people?  The US military can project military force anywhere in the world (as mentioned before as an security exporter) and with our spending we have the best technology and the largest (the largest Air Forces in order are the world are the US Air Force, US Navy, then Russia, and finally the US Marine Corp).  This creates a force over-match that wins wars by preventing anyone being able to meet us in battle.  If you face us, not only will you lose, but you will lose badly.  This is why the US is switching to improving a military that was geared to insurgency and fighting the global war on terror and transitioning to a near-peer battle (China and Russia).The next question might be, but what if we keep our military at home or reduce military spending?  As we have a huge national debt (which most countries have as well, despite us needing to get rid of ours) we can't afford to be everywhere like a failing empire, right?Not exactly, stepping back from global dominance creates a power vacuum, and the easiest form of government to fill that void is an authoritarian autocracy.  Do you see how China rules its people or Russia?  If the US steps back (or is forced back) they will be the ones that ensure their way of governance is center place and will use violence to ensure no one can challenge it - while it ensures all trade benefits them.This is how get World Wars or a potential invasion of the US mainland (through decades of encirclement).  This will cost the US financially and lives far more than it costs for the US to stay at the top.  Lastly, despite not all actions being benign, the US has largely been a stabilizing and peaceful force in the world that has lead to the most technologically advanced, progressive, safe, and free world humanity has ever seen.  It doesn't mean it can't be better, but it is far better than any alternative.The logic behind spending is prevention is always cheaper than an emergency.  You might think, well we haven't had a forest fire in a while so we can cut back funding.  Then still, no MAJOR forest fires just little ones, let's cut back more.  Suddenly millions of acres of land are engulfed by massive fires destroying homes, polluting the air, killing people, and more.It is always tempting to feel that the costs of prevention are unnecessary while you benefit from the safety those costs provide.What Trump has done threatening to leave NATO is recognize that the US is a security exporter, but we had nations leeching off the US through unbalanced trade deals and affording domestic policies that creates more wealth at the cost of American wealth.  The US said \\"we shouldn't pay to defend your country outright, either we get something out of it, or we might walk\\".  He wasn't serious about it even Trump has said it was meant as a wake up call that Europe has gone soft and needs to take ownership for their security in part.Now we don't want Europe to raise massive armies and create an arms race, but we don't want to subsidize their defense entirely so the US can continue to afford military actions elsewhere should something happen in Europe (basically Europe needs to be able to stand toe-toe with Russia and with the backing of the US overmatch Russia).Anyways, imagine where Europe would be had Trump threatened to leave NATO to increase their defense spending, it would be years before Russia could be stopped even with NATO - especially if China invades Taiwan.  Improving your defense industry takes a decade or more, right now everyone is having trouble scaling ammunition production in the quantities that Ukraine needs, let alone what a global war could require.Now I could type out more about Russia and its need to continue the war (it can't have peace), but I will save that for another time.","title":"Trumps Ukraine envoy pick proposed forcing peace talks by withdrawing US weapons"},{"text":"I dont understand how anyone think this is remotely a thing that could happen.

Speech isnt just oral and written communication, it refers to any action which expresses an idea or view. If I have a platform that I have created, my curation and moderation of that platform is *my* speech.I would say that allowing a person to exercise their free speech through a platform they created and control is more important than a person using someone else's platform to express themselves. That's not censorship, because that second person has no right to infringe on the first person's platform to begin with. They still retain all rights and privileges to create their own platform and express themselves freely there.This is why the distinction between government and private action is important. The government doesn't get to have protected speech. They don't get to use their platforms to strike down others. The government's freedom of speech is specifically subordinated to the individual's as a safeguard.Now, we could argue that large corporations and social media platforms have a comparable impact on public discourse when they exercise free speech. However, addressing this issue requires examining the rulings that established corporate personhood, as it introduces complexities that extend far beyond the scope of free speech alone.","title":"CMV: Reddit has a moderator problem"},{"text":"Stop blaming biden for shit trump was gonna do anyway.

Well, he *didn't* step down and there was an angry mob that showed up at the capital that, if provoked, could have probably even manhandled the Secret Service. My friends in law enforcement texted me the day of January 6th and literally said \\"Huh. You were right\\". I'm not patting myself on the back about being right, I don't want to be right, but the writing is consistently on the wall and we should heed the warning. And that was just a taste of things to come. Trump Supporters feel more emboldened now and when Trump pardons them after he takes office, even more so. Its what gets them openly saying shit like \\"Your body, my choice\\" and whatever else psycho shit they can think of.We can talk about precedent all day, but 1/3rd of the country is backing Donald Trump and literally whatever he says as the rule of law.

If the war ends, their economy will collapse in its current state. They need the war production to maintain things otherwise you send tens of thousands of men home, unemployed, and trained in war. Wages will collapse as industry no longer has to compete for labour with the military. Russia's contracts for the Ukraine war are the primary driver of labour costs currently. Then you also have all the workers in the factories that will presumably be out of work as well. All at a time when Putin's approval rating is the lowest it has been in a long time. That is a recipe for a revolution.The relief Russia gets is an end to sanctions, the article says all western sanctions, but that seems to be speaking on behalf of other western nations, they might not all get lifted. It also says the Russia would need to pay to rebuild Ukraine with a levy on energy exports, if Europe would even want Russian gas and oil.Then there is the issue of how the peace would actually be achieved. How do you maintain the demilitarized zone? Who is going to station troops there and pick up that cost? The article also says that Ukraine's entry into NATO would be put on hold. Will Ukraine accept security gaurentee's without NATO membership?IDK, I think overall, getting Russia to a place to accept is going to be the more difficult task. I think Ukraine has signalled they might be ready to tap out. Sentiment in Ukraine over having to give up territory is up. The amount of territory taken doesn't really achieve Russian goals though. They likely want all of Ukraine as that gets them a border with Moldova and Hungary for their next expansion westward. It also gives them a massive buffer against the west.Tough to say, but I think this peace deal is going to blow up in Trump's face. Hopefully the response to that is to double down on the war in Ukraine instead of folding.","title":"Trumps Ukraine envoy has a plan to end the war that Putin may revel in"},{"text":"This is so goddamn stupid.

But their conspiracy about the UN and the communist scare, ongoing to this day, is going to force countries to stand with or against them. But the CIA infiltrates countries that are neutral, fails 80% of the time and inadvertently creates a new communist regime.On a side note, President Trump has been courting southern Wisconsin a lot. And Kamala Harris. Pretty sure Biden was up in that JBS base of operations too, but people made a smaller issue about his travel plans. JBS also infiltrates police, PTA, government jobs and civil servant jobs. And my local coordinator looks like shes straight out of Russia.Communists are people too. I think its wrong to persecute entire countries because you dont like their leader or their policies. But they are actively attacking us. As you and the main poster said, through psy-ops, the racial divide as actually the largest problem because that will actually lead to another civil war. But how much of it is going to be real and how much will be hyped and done on purpose, like pushing drugs into minority communities and forcing minorities to push those drugs? Its happening in every major city and surrounding cities. Twin cities on the borders of states especially. Easier to move people back and forth to avoid police. Use the police to transfer them too as narc operatives. Truly evil material. FBI or CIA agenda too? Manson was an egotistical freak but if even he could see the agenda and try to throw an accelerant on it, a nobody from nowhere, why is it still happening?Money. Dark web and human trafficking mostly. How? Infiltration. Even JBS started copying what they thought communists from Russia were doing. Racist people had a really good Thanksgiving, Ill bet, and theyll have a really good Christmas too. No family divide there. You need to be a leftist or extreme right, middle class or poor and apparently Caucasian. Even the people they use become racist. Hate them blue eyed devils. Become a tool. Youll get paid really well until they dont need you anymore or they need a patsy.Anyone reading this can feel free to repost with actual information evidence they can find online. Everyone should be warned to avoid doing favors for strangers. I was, myself, targeted for a similar conspiracy. Im not racist by a long shot, maybe a victim of white guilt? Someone asked me for a ride and told me they didnt feel safe at any place he wanted me to drop him off at and constantly asked if I could do him a favor but didnt allude to what that would be. Shows up at my address a week later with a cousin and the favor was holding something for him. Obviously I asked him to leave and warned him that my wife would call the police on him and me. Also, I have two girls and a boy so Id like to avoid jail time and gang wars. Since then, my wife and children, and childrens friends have been followed by strangers and attacked through social media. Mostly targeting females. Constant intimidation tactics. All meant to inspire racial divide. All one can do after a year of constant reminders is think about the one time someone of the same skin color tried to either press one into service or set oneself up for a sting operation. He apparently had/has many friends. And Im a recluse. I have nothing to do with anyone. My kids and my wife are pretty much the same. When you dont put yourself out there, youre left with people who want to approach you or befriend you. Thus, its obvious, although purely circumstantial evidence. And these programs have no oversight. Its a sanctioned criminal enterprise.Again, feel free to repost or rewrite, because Id love to see this kind of information ANYwhere. All the conspiracies I see lately are about Trump, Elon or UFOs. Some about Israel. No one is looking at their own communities or talking about human traffickers. Its scary to see. Because half of it or more is probably misinformation to make people avoid thinking about whats happening to their own family/friends.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"The media balance is already shifting from Trump to Musk.","title":"Musk joins Trump and family for Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"I am putting faith in ~~the other branches of government~~ RepublicansI hear what you're saying but I think you're setting yourself up for disappointment.","title":"Trump Disavowed Project 2025 During the Campaign.

They often bring on their shows the most fringe people on the left (usually found on Twitter) and portray them as the norm.

They were even able to blow off Project 2025 despite the plan resembling Trump's Agenda 47.I see what you mean about Thatcher. But I think America's puritan ways will make a woman president unlikely for a long time.Also, based on being a conservative for twenty years, I can't imagine the GOP will ever elect a woman for president. With McCain, they wanted to seem mainstream and even inclusive, so they picked Palin. Many right wing comment sections would say how they agreed with her policies, but McCain was old and they weren't comfortable having her a heartbeat away from the presidency. Unlike on the left, where people criticized her intelligence and experience, the reasoning on the right just came down to her being a woman. A lot of \\"nothing personal, women are great at certain things, but running the military isn't one of them.\\"Now that was back during a time when the GOP felt lost. Bush was popular within his party but his presidency was considered a failure in many ways. The GOP weren't sure which direction to go, so they moderated their message.With Trump, they've learned how they absolutely do not need to moderate anything. I don't see why they'd pick a woman when there are plenty of suitable men for the job. Most conservative women don't even want to vote for a woman. There's no upside to choosing a woman. Maybe in a generation or two, that'll change and they'll find their Thatcher.Thanks for sharing your perspective.","title":"Donald Trump's Favorability Surges by Nearly 20 Points With Young Americans"},{"text":"Deporting people here illegally is not fascist","title":"The Local Sheriffs Gearing Up to Help Trump Carry Out Mass Deportations"},{"text":"But he was proven guilty.

Why does it feel like no one else is asking that?I highly recommend the 1952 San Francisco Film Noir *The Sniper*, about a disturbed young man who is shooting cute brunettes like the lovely Marie Windsor (*yowza!*)  There's a great meeting scene in City Hall about half way through.  City and state leaders are wondering what to do about situations like this.  A mental health expert says that it's possible to treat loons like the sniper to prevent them from killing, but it will take a lot more resources than the mental health system is getting from the state.  A conservative tightwad says there's no way the state is going to provide resources to treat \\"those monsters\\" and it's cheaper to let them go ahead and start shooting, and then have the police hunt them down \\"like the animals they are\\".It's pretty amazing that a scene like that made it to the screen.  It's a lot easier to call mass murderers \\"monsters\\" and \\"animals\\" rather than try to understand why they do it and try to prevent others from following suit.I'm a computer engineer and was (mildly) bullied by numbskulls in school as a child.  The message that schools sent is that the most important thing is competitive sports, and being a football star is far more important than math, science, and foreign language.  If football players and other athletes bully \\"weaklings\\", then that's fine.  It'll \\"toughen them up\\".Now, if you have brains you have an advantage since you can lose yourself in Jules Verne novels, electronics, and computer science.  Some become chess players.  But if you're simply a misfit you'll be treated abominably and the sports-oriented school admins really don't give a rat's ass.So some of the misfits finally decide that they've had enough and lash out.  I'm surprised it doesn't happen all the time.  Maybe they're getting enough social contact via the Internet to help them through their middle- and high-school years.Many decades ago I read a very interesting article in the newspaper about correlation between criminal behavior and brain damage.  Some scientists were studying correlation between violent criminals and brain damage by giving standard brain damage tests to violent criminals at a state prison.  As a control, they also gave the same tests to non-violent criminals.  They discovered to their surprise that *almost all of the criminals* had brain damage, both the violent and non-violent.  Furthermore, the incidence of left-brain and right-brain damage correlated with left- and right-handedness in the general population.  They suspected that left-brain damage was caused by children being \\"smacked upside the head\\" by right-handed parents, and vice-versa.I haven't been able to find anything about this on the 'tubes.  Nobody wants to discover that criminal behavior is a symptom of child abuse, because then it becomes a mental health issue instead of Crime and Punishment.  Suddenly we're back to that meeting in *The Sniper*.  Better to treat school shooters as \\"monsters\\" and \\"animals\\" instead of preventing killings from happening by stopping child abuse.","title":"What does the ACTUAL left represent for you?"},{"text":"Uh, well, how do I say this.First, this time next year we will very likely have our own mini right wing in charge.

It is fine not wanting to spend US tax dollars for Ukraine, but sending weapons there that is surplus and more expensive to dispose of than to give or giving tax payers to the defense contractors for weapon replacement AND increasing manufacturing capacity of these weapons/ammunition to prepare for war with China, is different.Also if the US does nothing with Russia's aggression it gives a clear game plan for invading Taiwan.  It also increases the chance of WW3 because of two reasons, one Ukraine will become more desperate in which they will strike more sensitive Russian targets with their own weapons.  Imagine what will happen if the Kremlin is struck.The second if you talk with Poland and the Baltic States, they 100% believe they are next and will put troops into Ukraine to fight Russians.  France is also interested in this same position.

When they do think, it's to rationalize the way they feel.They feel strongly and presume that means they're just correct.  They don't have to accept new information, understand other perspectives, learn, grow, etc.The whole \\"progressive\\" ideology is about positive affirmation.\\"You are, and I am, great the way that we are.  You/I should not have to improve.\\"This shunts any possible motivation to learn and grow.This ideological coddling is what I call 'matronizing'.  It's condescending like patronization, but it's got that feminine care-taker bent to it, to take everyone under their wing, so, \\"matronizing\\".It is the first step in nurturing, but unlike in nurturing, there is no growth  encouraged.  It's like mothers who want to keep their children weak and stupid so that they always get ran to for cuddling, because that's what the dysfunctional mother likes the most.They're kept under the wing, not for the empowerment or betterment of the \\"child\\", but as a crutch for the mother.This is attractive to some people, they want to be mothered, to be nannied.  They want to permanently be dependents, because that's less work.This is where the ideology always leans into creating the \\"nanny state\\".It's a whole symbiosis.  This can be seen in various cults, like the [Oneida cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community).  They practiced \\"sex positivity\\"(everyone sleeps around, no exclusisvity) and shrugging off subsequent children to the queen matrons(those with an intense need to influence and be loved by children) to raise.  This is why so many leftists are drawn towards being teachers.Once children were weaned (usually at around the age of one), they were raised communally in the Children's Wing, or South Wing.[33] Their parents were allowed to visit, but the children's department held jurisdiction over raising the offspring. If the department suspected a parent and child were bonding too closely, the community would enforce a period of separation because the group wanted to stop the affection between parents and children....Women over 40 were to act as sexual \\"mentors\\" to adolescent boys because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. ... In the decline phase:Within the commune, there was a debate about when children should be initiated into sex and by whom. There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.Can't have that.The authoritative nanny state:Even though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.Just about everyone of age was granted some form of control or title, got to pretend to be aristocrats like I mentioned at the top.Sounds a lot like Benito Mussolini:All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.Leftist centralization.Social regulation:Every member of the community was subject to criticism by a committee or the community as a whole during a general meeting.[16] The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits.That sounds familiar.  Cancel culture, social credit, struggle sessions, etc etc.  A common feature in leftism.Any form of collectivist ideology winds up in similar forms.  That's the only way to build a \\"functional\\" society for people rebelling against western individualism philosophy.  Whatever you want to call them, progressives, postmodernists, leftists, socialists, communists, etc.Despite their often strong in-fighting, they're all quite similar in their ideation, as opposed to western enlightenment which gave us the concepts of civil rights, individual accountability, agency + responsibility, etc.The only big difference:All community members were expected to work, each according to their abilities. Our cultish left is so big they often just externalize that expectation, they can just take what they want, everyone *else* needs to work.  This completes the Aristocrat model.","title":"Why do a lot on the left act as if they're complaining when talking politics?"},{"text":"Literally, what we send Ukraine is a fraction of our yearly military budget.

I am, but I'm saying more than that. I can break them into two things I think First. It's like if I said to you, most people who work do so because of a paycheck and not necessarily for passion. That's a completely factual statement, and an utterly mundane one. People work to get paid is a statement that needs no defending. Similarly you're saying A) people immigrate for the hope of a better life and B) do so using the easiest methods. That's a frankly mundane idea and I don't even think most people are being dishonest about that. Granted I live in Southern Africa so I can't say with certainty but I wager if I asked 1 000 of them are you moving primarily for A) a better life or B) to return to your homeland/culture the vast majority is A. That's not surprising to me and I don't see why it seems like something that is more surprising than the fact people work for paychecks primarilySecond. It's not a requirement. The EU nations that offer this scheme or the people taking it care about heritage beyond blood and the people going seem to be moving for a chance at a better life. I don't see why there's a focus on heritage at all. If Italy cared about heritage it would have included some sort of test for that exact thing. They don't (as far as I can see if I'm wrong correct me).I suppose it's the part of you CMV that said 'aren't actually' which implies that the reason people are giving for moving is heritage when I don't really see that to be the case for the majority. Are people really pretending to care that much and do you have like something I can look at to get the idea of person we're critiquing here.","title":"CMV: Most Young People (Younger Millenials and Gen Z) Pursuing EU Citizenship By Descent Aren't Actually Doing It Out Of Appreciation For Their Culture, But For Convenience or Escape"},{"text":"Ok, this is actually a well thought out point.

Polls will close in about 3 hours (10 pm GMT) and exit polls will be out soon after. Ireland uses a form of proportional representation called [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), which is basically a form of ranked choice voting that provides approximately proportional representation overall. This means that no single party is likely to win a majority of seats and there will most likely be some sort of coalition government/confidence and supply agreement formed after the election. Historically, the two dominant parties in Ireland are Fianna Fil and Fine Gael, and both are center to center-right parties. Since the foundation of Fianna Fil in 1926, either Fianna Fil or Fine Gael has led every Irish government. However, in 2020, there was a bit of a surprise as the left-wing Irish republican party Sinn Fin received the most first-preference votes and obtained the party's best result since 1923. In the end, Fianna Fil and Fine Gael reached a coalition agreement that relied on the support of the Green Party. I'm really curious to see how Sinn Fin will do this time. They've [led in polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2024_Irish_general_election) through almost all of 2021, 2022, and 2023, but dropped suddenly in support around the beginning of 2024.

Your point about how young men care more about the left being PC than the right is spot on. Thats because Democrats have leaned into wokeness for years, and its influenced culture in ways that resonate much more than Republican moves like banning books. Plus, Republicans are just better at riling up their supporters over these woke issues.

When you look at the demographic trends in the 1960s/1970s when overpopulation related works like *The Population Bomb* were written, it seemed like the population of any non industrialized country  including India and China would continue to grow exponentially. Then the population would disastrously decline in a sort of Malthusian way where we run out of resources thus basically resulting in a civilization ending global mega famine.What these overpopulation alarmists didnt account for is that pretty much every non industrialized country at the time would eventually industrialize or at least begin the process so the declining birth rate part of the demographic transition would happen in places like India and China. Additionally, Chinas one child policy effectively destroyed the countrys growth rate as they fail to get anything but a negative growth rate in the modern day.Overpopulation has become such a non issue that certain right wing personalities like Musk try to stoke the fear of underpopulation or Africa growing too quickly in comparison to other places and promote a weird misogynistic fixation on increasing the birth rate. The worst part is that while these people are horrible in what they suggest to resolve it, underpopulation is a real issue. An aging population cannot be supported by a smaller younger generation both economically and labor wise. We already see this in countries like Japan that are basically economically stagnant as more and more of their population leaves the workforce. And addressing this has good and bad policy-related solutions. Limiting bodily autonomy, raising the retirement age, or just giving money/child welfare payments to people without changing the surrounding culture have proven to be ineffective while things like increasing immigration and creating a better environment for families with things like good child care and education are more effective.The US is actually one of the countries best situated to do well throughout the demographic transition because of immigration, so in a way people like Musk and JD Vance are self-defeating by opposing actually good solutions to underpopulation.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 29, 2024"},{"text":"\\nThis: if you need the threat of eternal punishment to be a good person you are not a good personIs normally a response to religious people saying \\"Atheists:if you don't believe in God, what prevents you from committing murder?\\" Or \\"how do you know right from wrong\\"In reality, most people, even most of the ones walking that, have an internal sense of right and wrong and would find killing someone distasteful even if it was consequence free.But a few people do not have this sense.

Most naturalized citizens anywhere start with practical motivations (jobs, security, opportunities) and develop deeper cultural connections over time. Demanding that people have some pure cultural motivation before they even start the process is unrealistic.The fact that applications spike during political instability is exactly why these laws exist - to provide refuge to descendants when needed.

Its the United States that has a strategic framework for cooperation with Russia that has everything in it from economic cooperation to political cooperation, cultural cooperation, indeed even offers of defense cooperation. So the United States doesnt seek to isolate Russia. The behavior of Russia in this most recent crisis is isolating Russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states when you start invading small neighbors, bombing civilian infrastructure, going into villages and wreaked havoc and wanton destruction of this infrastructure. Thats what isolates Russia.And so it is not an act of the United States or Europe or anybody else to isolate Russia; its what Russia is doing. And I would just call your attention to the language that there can be no business as usual with Russia while this kind of activity goes on. And so I want to be very clear: the United States sought precisely what we got in this statement, which is, most importantly, support for Germanys C for Georgias democracy; secondly, a very strong message that the Russian President ought to keep his word; and third, a very clear statement of principle from this alliance that a new line in Europe where Russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a transatlantic future is unacceptable.https://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2008/s080819a.html","title":"Trumps Ukraine envoy pick proposed forcing peace talks by withdrawing US weapons"},{"text":"Please elaborate a bit, if you would?","title":"Ex-Trump Official Mocks Elon Musk's DOGE Task Force: It 'Isn't a Real Thing'"},{"text":"Its sad when TEN top ranked, former military officials came out against him and said that Trump is dangerous, but yet his MAGA chuds will still believe any lie he tells about his military prowess.","title":"Trump says hes planning large-scale ad campaign on fentanyl crisis"},{"text":"It doesn't help Musk that he has such an ugly face.

As you said the New Deal wasn't really supported originally when it was meant to be for all Americans, however once FDR took his political landscape into account and realized that he needed Southern Democrats to pass it which meant compromising on his end and accommodating their racist views and limiting Black participation in New Deal programs. New Deal largely excluded Black people, with many of its programs discriminating against African Americans and leaving them with limited access to benefits like jobs, housing, and social security due to the prevalent segregation and political pressures to maintain support from the Southern Democratic Party; this effectively worsened racial inequality rather than addressing it. Now if you tell people that they'll think you are \\"woke\\" or something. But when you think about it, when it was originally passed the Social Security Act specifically excluded agricultural and domestic workers, which were predominantly held by Black people, leaving them ineligible for benefits. Even programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) maintained segregated camps, preventing Black people from accessing equal opportunities. And this doesn't get into redlining and the Federal Housing Administration, refusing mortgages to Black people attempting to buy homes in white neighborhoods.  A lot of white Americans are super in favor of social democracy so long as its just limited to benefitting white Americans. ?100% right here. And when the civil rights movement happens that is where you see a lot of what is happening right now where people want social security, Medicaid, tax breaks, etc for themselves and their families but not for other people they don't think deserve it. The same type of stuff happened during reconstruction when policies were pushed to help poor people, they were framed as helping black people and socialism. Literally the same type of rhetorics and political issues we were dealing with a century or more ago haven't gone away.","title":"Republican Populism Aims To Expand the Nanny State"},{"text":"Yes, and?","title":"CMV: Most Young People (Younger Millenials and Gen Z) Pursuing EU Citizenship By Descent Aren't Actually Doing It Out Of Appreciation For Their Culture, But For Convenience or Escape"},{"text":"I have a feeling that Trump is okay with Russian expansionism.","title":"Trumps Ukraine envoy pick proposed forcing peace talks by withdrawing US weapons"},{"text":"The other aspect of this that bothers me is how many of these people are just completely... out of touch, so to speak (which is mostly behaviour I've seen in such people around me in Toronto). Their behaviour is often rooted from a youth full of immaturity, cliques, individualism, consumerism, and just an overall lack of authenticity, which also suggests to me that they have little understanding of or respect for the culture they claim to value. They seem to lean on the idea of blood or a distant heritage, but their actions show little engagement with the history, language, or traditions of their ancestral countries.I work in translations, I am an Italian citizen since birth who speaks Italian as one of my first languages (I'm also from a South American country lol I moved back and forth as a kid until my parents decided to settle in the US when I was 8, so I spoke both Spanish and Italian as long as I can remember). This is spot on. I have seen so many people trying to get birth certificates translated and apostilled to try and get Italian citizenship in the last three months, and every single person does not speak even the most basic Italian. I, myself, am planning on moving back in a few years and wouldn't even dream of doing that without practicing my italian more (you tend to forget some stuff if you're not constantly using it). I can't speak to the other nationalities you mentioned, obviously, but i can tell you Italian-Americans VERY MUCH lean on the idea of \\"blood\\" when it comes to their Italian heritage over anything else. And it's going to be a huge wake-up call to those of them that do end up living in Italy-- if you don't speak Italian and go about like most Italian-Americans do, they're going to have an incredibly difficult time. A lot (I'd be willing to bet the majority) of Italians are not going to welcome them with open arms like they belong.ETA: trying to move for a better life is completely normal though, and shit is fucked in the US. So i get it. But people should be doing a little more learning and research before moving to a completely different country, and definitely not go into it thinking that just having a citizenship is enough to get by.","title":"CMV: Most Young People (Younger Millenials and Gen Z) Pursuing EU Citizenship By Descent Aren't Actually Doing It Out Of Appreciation For Their Culture, But For Convenience or Escape"},{"text":"same as anyone who has got a speeding ticket is a criminal right?","title":"Immigrant 'Criminals' Trump Wants To Deport Only Make Up Tiny Fraction Of Migrants In US, Analysis Found"},{"text":"Can you say Felony?","title":"Blue Cities Finalizing Efforts to Thwart Trump's Deportations"},{"text":"Isnt this grounds for a major lawsuit in Rivians favor?

I would like to see local Democratic Party clubs create social arms that can be very loosely affiliated with the party--things designed to create third spaces and fill the social calendars for folks, to fight loneliness and build community. To be clear--these would be events for which the only political link is everyone is an active Democrat. Things such as tabling, canvassing, and community litter clean-up crews would be a separate slate of events run by the local party, but IMO there should be no pressure whatsoever for the people going to the purely fun events to join the ones that have work elements.And! At least some of these fun events should be scheduled for Sunday mornings, to give non-Christian folks a place to hang out.The point, IMO, is to try to deliver what church/temple/mosque/synagogue communities and groups such as the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Lions, Toastmasters, etc try to do or used to do.2.While we should be more aggressive about building a federation of left/liberal/progressive/Democratic party media outlets, IMO, we should not deliberately try to come up with 'our own Joe Rogan'. We should try to nurture multiple personalities in the hopes that one or more will ultimately have the reach of a Joe Rogan, but you can't grow that in a lab. We SHOULD try to circulate talking points to all these outlets, so they can sing from the same hymnal, but in their own unique voices.2a.I want to see more of what I call 'functional journalism'.

That's how they were recorded.  If Trudeau's work to prevent illegal crossings is working, you'll see the number go up as more crossings are prevented. 2) That said, i need to point out that the article leaves September '23 out of the chart and only focuses on October '23 - May '24 which is *fucking winter* here.  People can and do, freeze to death trying to illegally cross the border during winter. I could be at the border within a hours by car and it can go down to -40F in January - February*Of course* you're going to see numbers rise once the snow melts and it warms up in April-May. A few other things to consider: -  [Numbers before 2017 aren't readily available.](https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/statistics/Pages/Irregular-border-crosser-statistics.aspx)  It's easy to 'set records' when you're looking at less than a decade of data- [Things changed since 2017 with how refugees are treated.](https://globalnews.ca/news/10860226/rcmp-asylum-seekers-canada-trump-us/) Many of those who would have been counted as refugees from the U.S into Canada are now counted as illegal attempted entries and vice versa after Trump's changes. \\"When you dont create legitimate pathways, or when you only create pathways where people have to do the impossible to receive safety, you know, unfortunately, people are going to try to do the impossible, said Abdulla Daoud, director of The Refugee Centre in Montreal, which provides services.\\" This inflates the numbers on paper, even if the amount of people stay the same. - We just recovered from a pandemic.  The numbers dropping in 2020-2022 to increase in 2023-2024 are in part some people post ponning their attempts due to the pandemic- While Mexico has been doing a lot lately to curb people attempting to cross their north border into the U.S, the amount of people attempting to enter the U.S from Canada is still only 1/10th of those attempting from Mexico.","title":"Mexican president claims no potential tariff war with US after call with Trump"},{"text":"Thats part of the downside with his regime cutting the State Department out of his calls with foreign leaders: No official transcript, no government translators, just chaos.","title":"Mexicos president denies Trumps claim that she agreed to shut down the US-Mexico border"},{"text":"No, I'm not.
