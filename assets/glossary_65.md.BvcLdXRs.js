It was kind of fascinating because while the entire House wouldn't be seated, state legislatures could send some of them back as appointees--but it didn't look like they would hit the threshold to hold a Speaker election. In the Senate, at least 2/3 would still be seated, and governors could appoint the rest... but there was a question of whether certain blue state governors would still appoint GOP winners to their seats.All in all, I figured that it would be President Grassley back then too, because Pelosi wouldn't get enough support with a fractured state system of who to send in, and whether they could be sworn in at that. The bottom line there was that the President's term ends at noon on January 20th, four years after they're sworn in, no exceptions. The position becomes vacant whether or not there's an election or certification or anything.ps. It was interesting to think about whether, in my 2021 example, states would deliberately send/appoint other legislators than the ones who won their seats, in an attempt to influence the coming political catastrophe--or whether the senate itself would intervene. For example, appointing Bernie Sanders as Pro Tem with an eye towards him taking the Presidency, as one of the few Senators who had actually gained primary votes in the previous year's Presidential primary.

Let me explain:The moment we try to buy Greenland, we'd instantly validate China's territorial expansion tactics in the South China Sea and Russia's in the Arctic. We'd lose all moral high ground in international diplomacy. As a centrist, you must see how this would destroy our ability to challenge their aggressive policies.The rare earth minerals angle? That's actually counterproductive. Right now, we're making huge progress in rare earth processing right here in the US - MP Materials in California is already processing them, and we're building more facilities in Texas. Buying Greenland would cost us hundreds of billions while these domestic solutions are already working.Plus, you're overlooking the massive environmental damage we'd cause by extracting those resources. The melting ice sheets there are already a climate tipping point. Drilling for oil and mining would accelerate that process, flooding coastal cities worldwide. The \\"unlimited concrete\\" from glacier sand would mean destroying ancient ice formations. That's not the kind of legacy we want.Also, Denmark and the EU would never allow it. They've already shot down the idea multiple times. Pushing for it would damage our NATO relationships when we need them most against Russia and China.Instead of trying to buy territory like it's the 1800s, we should focus on strengthening our Arctic partnerships and investing in our own resource independence. That's real strategic thinking for the 2020s.","title":"CMV: Trump is right about Greenland acquisition being a necessity to the United States of America.

Did you see it as simply a way to change a politically charged discussion between two individuals? Or do you envision it happening at a much larger scale, so it forms a kind of \\"prediction market\\"?===In this comment, you seem to be viewing it in the latter sense, and you're dismissing the idea that politicians will throw a race for money. And I agree with you that a politician is unlikely to deliberately throw the race in order to win a bet, just as they are unlikely to throw a race because of a big cash offer from the opposition. (Maybe)However, there are lots of ways to \\"game\\" a betting market. Just as many as there are to game a stock market, where experience has taught us we need strict laws in place to prevent \\"insider trading\\"., to force listed companies to have their accounts audited, to provide honest and timely news to shareholders, etc. And this still doesn't prevent every abuse. You point out that a billion dollar bribe wouldn't be enough to make Kamala drop out of the race. You might be be right. However, the price of getting an individual Congressman to vote a particular way on one specific bill is certainly much less. [It's already well documented that lobbying is incredibly lucrative](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2019/05/14/how-the-fortune-100-turned-2-billion-in-lobbying-spend-into-400-billion-of-taxpayer-cash/), so corporations are already swaying political outcomes for cash. If the betting market is a tiny market, then it will work fine as a prediction market. If it gets large enough that it's worth pushing the odds a few percentage points in one direction or another, to make a quick buck on some shorts, then we can expect politicians, pollsters, commentators, lobbyists, and other players to start manipulation news. Make the markets larger still, and they'll start manipulating outcomes as well.","title":"CMV: political gambling is a good thing"},{"text":"Answer the question","title":"I believe I spotted grounds to Disqualify Trump under the 20th Amendment.

This even filters back to the American workers, the good ones leave and the rest also start fearing for their jobs and stop reporting problems. If Boeing had done the same whilst keeping entirely American workers they would have had whistleblowers reporting them and probably things like the whole 737 Max debacle would never have happened. We've got similar problems over here. Outsourcing to India destroys the companies that do it, but the managers get their promotions and don't care.

But your view seems to go far beyond that.The problem, I think, is that you're putting the cart before the horse. Sure, in principle, it might well make sense to tolerate the personal failings of a politician who would govern much more effectively than the next best alternative. However, we can't actually know what the outcome of a political term will be ahead of time. Future competence isn't an independent trait that we can directly assess. The public has to try and anticipate what might happen if a politician is in office. Avowed policy positions are useful for predicting the future behaviours of politicians. But so is information about the character and behaviour of the politician. If a politician is known to be reliable, diligent and effective at swaying people, that indicates that they might be effective in office. If a person is inconsistent and frequently alienates others, that calls their ability to govern well into question. I find it particularly strange that you don't think we should be concerned about whether a politician engages in fraud and corruption. We don't ban fraud and corruption because they're moral vices. We ban them because they encourage unaccountability and mismanagement. You're basically saying that as long as a politician does their job well, we shouldn't care if they do their job badly.","title":"CMV: discussions about a politician's personality and personal life is irrelevant, pointless and stupid (like the media buzz around corruption scandals)"},{"text":"My conspiracy theory is they push for Musk to be the speaker, Trump pardons himself and resigns leaving us with President Vance and VP MuskI dont actually believe that would happen,  but it would be my tin hat, MLB baseball spying on us Bart Simpson moment","title":"Republicans raising questions about Johnson's reelection as House speaker"},{"text":"Gas prices right now in my area are better than they were as we were coming out of Covid by about 40 cents","title":"Tesla Cybertruck Explodes in Front of Trump International Hotel in Nevada"},{"text":"/s dude.??You really gonna defend Oprah? ??","title":"Trumps Medicare pick Dr. Oz once said uninsured have no right to health"},{"text":"Trump has repeatedly flip flopped his position. \\"Leave it to the states\\" is just the current spin. https://whyy.org/articles/trump-abortion-reproductive-rights-elections/","title":"cmv: Political flip-flopping and pandering is not a bad thing"},{"text":"Israel is taking the US down and fast.

At the ballot box and in the streets, these diverse activists demanded not only integration but economic justice, labor rights, and real political power for all.

I see what are saying in terms of the complexity of connecting a leaders problematic views to long-term harm for a group, but I think its worth considering a few things. Firstly, while Spain today is progressive in its attitudes toward homosexuality, that progress might not erase the harm Francos regime caused to LGBTQ+ people during his rule. Many individuals suffered deeply &amp; societal progress often happens despite oppressive regimes, not because of them.Secondly, the fact that there are still Francoists in Spain today (potentially with homophobic leanings) might suggest that such ideologies dont just vanish, but can linger &amp; resurface in ways that threaten progress. Even if Spain as a whole is more accepting now, it does not mean that Francos policies didnt leave a mark, or contribute to a (harmful) foundation that others might try to rebuild upon.So, while the direct connection between a leaders views &amp; long-term societal attitudes might not always be clear-cut, I personally believe its important to recognise the broader ripple effects their actions &amp; ideologies can have on both the people they oppress &amp; the cultural narrative they shape. I could yap all day about Trump &amp; the negative impact he has had (&amp; most likely will have during his next term) on women.

This was about how we shouldn't care about a politician's character or potential crimes regardless of what they may be. While not all corruption scandals are the same, they can clearly be incredibly damaging to the public on both the short-term and long-term. It doesn't matter what percentage of scandals have negative repercussions - as long as it's has happened before and nothing has changed to stop it from happening again, it can happen again in the future with the right official. Politicans who have already committed crimes or have even used their positions to facilitate crime, such as Trump, *and have gotten away with it* will only continue to do so in the future because they have nothing to fear.In an ideal system, you would be correct. That is because in an ideal system, it would be impossible for politicians to find loopholes or commit scandals that can be as damaging as the Covid scandal. However, the current system is flawed and easily abuseable, so a part of the voting process must be understanding whether a politician will proceed to abuse the system for their advantage.","title":"CMV: discussions about a politician's personality and personal life is irrelevant, pointless and stupid (like the media buzz around corruption scandals)"},{"text":"I've heard my sister asking friends kids about what they think and they honestly don't understand the issue.People literally make up most of the problems as they get older and more intolerant.Any of these bathroom bills would require sexual assault to actually be enforced, there is no way that helps women.","title":"Sure Trump spat on us by running his entire campaign on America first and then co-signing with a South African billionaire that said Americans are too stupid for STEM jobs, but at least hes gonna ban transgender athletes guys ??."},{"text":"And when you remember a lot of Christians want revelations to happen in their life time.","title":"Pro-Palestinian Activists Lambasted Biden and Harris.

My fellow Lebanese too.I swear i truly understand the complexities and structural barriers and all the mechanisms that make change nigh impossible at times, but damn i am so disappointed in both my fellow Lebanese and fellow Americans.Lebanon is literally in ruins, just not the same level as Gaza obviously.America? Like this has to be a perpetual sick and twisted black mirror nightmare we're all in, right?Like fuck - forget 99% of everything else just for a moment, we have a right-wing nazi supporters suddenly impacting policy along side a man who literally tried to overthrow a democratically elected government?The fact that Gaetz could even be mentioned in a conversation about AG?Garland totally abdicating his duty as an officer of the court and the highest law enforcement official in the nation?Don't get me started on my fellow Lebanese and how they work together against their own interests, futures, and livelihoods. It just sucks. because my empathy and your empathy isn't really going to change what's already happened and what comes next.in lebanon, i got to vote only **twice** and im almost 40. because the government here would just unilaterally and constitutionally postpone or not hold elections. and the two times they did, they were unironically and like for real not actually fair and free elections and anyway i am not sure the results would ever have been accepted had the lebanese population somehow voted for once in their own collective interests.so voting is very special for me, becuase ive basically been effectively denied that right as a lebaneseand as an american, my fucking vote means almost nothing because of the EC and yet even as a fucking atheist i feel its a spiritual act to do so.maybe its because i know whats it like to have my voice matter not one iota.so it deeply wounds me to know that all we needed to do, all we needed to do was actually vote in the usbut for all the reasons we all know, our voter turnout and our electorate has just not produced that outcome.and unlike in lebanon, it's infinitely easier in the us and your vote actually fucking matters.even with all the gop ratfucking and all the structural barriers, there is enough decent americans like you and me that we could have overcame all of this. yes we needed to vote many times more than the trumpists, but we could have still won.i despise this timeline because so many innocent everyday people are suffering and will continue to suffer.i fear my fellow lebanese don't even comprehend what it means to actually live in a  society where real change is possible, and i fear my fellow americans took our freedoms for granted and don't take the threat of fascism seriously at all.sorry for the rant. been  a rough few months in my part of lebanon, what with the war and all and having to wait week by week for silo to drop and it's gonna take foreverrrrrrrr for severance season 2 to come out from my perspective lol.thanks for listening btw, username checks out :) i hope you have a good one my friend. happy new year. and i hope this year we rise to the ocassion like never before.our fight isn't over, and remember, do not obey in advance.

You press the issue you fight back and you hope that promises made to the press by politicians are fulfilled (Kennedy Medicare speech 1961).But I see your point, and I dont think its forgotten that  talk is cheap [just show me the money]https://youtu.be/cYiICFU0xWs?si=T8LkJB35yC9uQ26zbut unless youve got big ideas the policies will probably just flow to your friends and funders.","title":"CMV: discussions about a politician's personality and personal life is irrelevant, pointless and stupid (like the media buzz around corruption scandals)"},{"text":"I was talking about Vegas","title":"Someone is clearly sending a message to Elon and the incoming Trump administration."},{"text":"From NBC News.

His administration did good things, but you could have told me he vanished from the White House and was found six months later in a nursing home. He absolutely spoiled the incumbent advantage but just being silent / out of the spotlight. He didnt campaign using the office - he waited till election season. Then his horrible performance sealed his fate. BUT he pushed to stay in for weeks. Tons of cope online. Tons of cope from the party. Until he was pushed out (and sold as him stepping down). Leaving poor Kamala to pick of the shambles of his campaign. Notice the 180 switch in messaging as soon as she got control?  Notice how fast she was closing the gap?

Just look at the anti-LGBTQ laws in Dearborn that were created by and supported by Muslim Americans. Look at the Arab Spring as another example. EVERY natino that participated in that dramatic theater ended up **MORE** authoritarian as a result.Tlaib feeds on that kind of drama and authoritarian energy; she engages in constant, extreme political drama and grand nonsense statements that keep her Muslim base inflamed. It's all about Tlaib using her base to maintain power. It's all about HER; she's a loose cannon with a big mouth who has been an embarrassment to The Squad and serious liberals ever since she was elected - constantly shooting off her big mouth and letting the rest of the liberal community apologize for her gaffes. Result? She helped Trump become POTUS. So now, her base can kiss Gaza (and maybe Palestine) goodbye because Trump would just as soon vaporize Palestinians as help them. What the hell were people thinking? Answer: they weren't! They were helped by Tlaib and others of her ilk to create doubts about Harris and ACTIVELY work against her election.Yes, Gaza is a massive tragedy that the US has played a part in, but to ACTIVELY oppose Harris and instead encourage her base to be non-committal (I think 16% of Dearborn Muslims went for Stein) is tantamount to betrayal of her base's desire to save Gaza; to Gaza (and Palestine); and to the American people.

You can read the [Presidential Succession Act of 1947](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-61/pdf/STATUTE-61-Pg380.pdf#page=1). Grassley would only stay as acting president (which is the term used in Section (a)(1) of the statute) until a President or Vice President qualifies (see Section (c)(1)). So, hes not any more a president than any of the VPs who have stepped in due to presidential disability; in all cases, they (and Grassley) simply serve as acting president. And the tenure of their acting presidencies terminates upon the qualification of the president for office; namely, the certification of the electoral votes by Congress.This [2009 report](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06_continuity_of_government.pdf) (p.33) from the Brookings Institution (which is a so-called left of center think tank) makes this clear. The Act makes it clear that a president or vice president who recovers from a disability or qualifies for office (say a president elected after a long election dispute with a Speaker of the House serving as president for a time) may bump out a congressional leader or cabinet member who is acting as president.","title":"Johnsons Dim Speakership Chances Could Imperil Trumps Certification on Jan. 6"},{"text":"Wasn't flying on the list to eradicate for normal people by 2030.

Theyre the people who will contribute to the economy and pay taxes more than the average American, so its beneficial to hire pretty much as much top talent as possible. Deporting the people who do the other jobs is where they get it wrong, but people have been focusing on the other part. Americans want companies to hire Americans so everyone basically has a shot at getting promoted and moving up the ladder. But in order for America to be #1 in STEM fields, you need to be able to recruit the best, wherever they happen to have been born. Thats what Democrats believe in. Republicans believe in trickle-down economics and kind of figure that if they deport the people who are doing low-paying jobs, those jobs will be available for Americans so the total number of jobs wont be cut the same as if they had just let the immigrants stay, and Americans will have jobs, but the jobs available will be low-skill, low-pay. This includes jobs like working in a field picking fruits and vegetables all dayand since it takes money to make money (and be born in a school district that will get you the best shot at getting into a top school and therefore a top-paying job), it would be nice if Republicans understood that things like education, school lunches, and healthcare are essential to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to get the best job possible like the rich kids getbut they start being hypocrites right around there and dont want their taxes to be even one penny higher than they have to be while still telling themselves that theyre good people that are doing whats right for America.

There will be rough days ahead, but also good days.  Trump's populist rhetoric is a double edge sword.  It helped him win but it also set many expectations that simply are not going to be met. Most of his horrid plans will not get off the ground. The ones that do will be awful, but will only end up hurting him and the gop. These plans aren't going to help prices, they aren't going to bring calm.  They are going to do nothing to change the norm that many that voted for him are so frustrated with.  It's the main reason why he's already trying to back track on his nonsensical promises. Lets also not forget that Trump, his maga loyalists and many of the GOP are: 1. Incompetent.  2. Have massive fragile egos.  3. And have the mental maturity of a toddler. These people will spend more time infighting with each other than spending time to actually get their horrid plans off the ground. Especially so given their extremely thin majority in the house. We can take advantage of all of this, using it to give us more success in elections going forward. We have a lot to learn from the presidential result but future success is closer than we think.  Many online rhetoric outside here make it seem that it was a landside, and a complete rejection of the party.  Yet GOP could only win one out of five swing state senate races and lost seats in the house in an anti incumbency climate.It's also important not to lose sight of recent past successes.  Before this, since 2016 the gop had loss after loss.  2022 being a big one.  A big under performance in a Biden mid term where inflation was very high.  Gop barely taking the house and Dems gaining a senate seat.  Plus many successes for us on the state executive and legislative level. There is a very solid foundation to build on, that has held strong in even the worst climates.  Excited to see what we can do in more favorable ones going forward. And another thing! There are so many great people in the party, those here, those elsewhere behind the scenes in the party, and so many great candidates going forward.  In sports terms, the bench is stacked!  A big advantage we have over the opposition.  A party that nominates folks like Mark Robinson, Kari Lake, Royce White, Mastriano and so on, and so on... To close things aren't going to be easy these next four years that is for sure.  There will be dark days, but it's all the reason to focus on the light.  And there is so much of it even at times there doesn't seem to be.  In others, and most importantly in ourselves.  Things can get better and have.  Humanity would of never gotten this far if that wasn't true. Be kind to yourself, take breaks when you need to, and work to create even more good! Thanks all for bringing some sanity in these crazy times and thank you mods for doing what you do to help keep it that way!

But 15 months into the war in the Middle East, as the GOP trifecta prepares to control the White House and Congress, leaders in the movement find themselves with far less leverage  and much more to lose.The Palestinian rights movement is very clear eyed in understanding that it is very likely that this Trump administration will mean that things get much worse for Palestinians, said Beth Miller, the political director for Jewish Voice for Peace Action, a left-wing advocacy organization.\\nThis administration will likely be coming very quickly to try to take down the Palestinian rights movement, she added.Support for Israel is largely bipartisan, but Republicans have led the charge in criticizing the broader pro-Palestinian movement. A Republican-led House panel has sunk three Ivy League presidents over allegations of antisemitism around pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses. And last month, the House passed a bill that jeopardizes the tax-exempt status of any group the Treasury secretary deems a terrorist supporting organization, which movement leaders fear will chill pro-Palestinian speech.Palestine is, in many ways, the canary in the coal mine, said Sandra Tamari, the executive director of Adalah Justice Project. And so our organizations are under more threats, because what all those authoritarian forces would love to do is to shut down any dissent in the country.A spokesperson for Trumps transition did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump himself is a staunch ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has a number of pro-Israel backers, including megadonor Miriam Adelson, an Israeli billionaire on whom Trump bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018. During his 2024 campaign, Trump called Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, a proud member of Hamas because he refused to shake the Israeli prime ministers hand.Im pretty sure you will see real concern around legislative efforts to silence speech, to control demonstrations and actions of that sort, said James Zogby, the founder of the Arab American Institute and Democratic National Committee veteran currently running to be its vice chair. We dont know how off the rails Trump will go with acceding to Netanyahus plans.From the onset of the war, pro-Palestinian groups across the U.S. hit Democrats hard. They launched the uncommitted campaign against President Joe Biden in the primary, marched en masse on the Democratic National Convention in August and often held out on full endorsements of Vice President Kamala Harris  even as they acknowledged Trump would likely be worse for their cause.I dont know what we could have done to push harder, said ncommitted co-founder Layla Elabed.Continue reading at [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/01/pro-palestinian-activists-biden-trump-00195989) ","title":"Pro-Palestinian Activists Lambasted Biden and Harris.

If he can try to hurt people, he will. If he can't, or it requires too much effort, he won't.   He may try again later, he may not, but his words have meant absolutely *nothing.*    \\nAnd I would strongly advise people against listening to him, or indeed any republican, on anything, ever.     \\nIf you are talking to one on an individual level, *listen* to them, of course - as will I.   \\nBut don't take what they say as proof of anything, any position or commitment.Instead, observe their *actions.*   \\nWe're going to see a lot of those coming up, and it is through them that we're going to have a better idea of how to first bring the fight home. Right now, we are playing defence, and that means being careful and working with and around what our enemies do.Personally, I think our enemies know this mistaken empathy, this desire to assume the best, and it is how they camouflage themselves.   \\nIt is why I have been uninterested in all the talk about 'messaging' and 'new blood' and so on.I talk to people regularly, as many of you do.   \\nThey are human beings with intelligence and agency.   \\nMany of the people saying they want things *we* want, did so because they knew it was what *we wanted to hear.*    \\nFor them, the key policy plank was what Trump offered, cruelty.   \\nIt is what they are trying, successfully, to inculcate in our society as a whole.   It was not a feature they put up with, or something they bore with stoically to get other desired policy items. So, even if you don't see people the way I do, and I am glad of that, please consider that it is very easy for someone to tell you what you want to hear.   \\nAt least 50% of voters have people like you or me in their life, whom they are constantly trying to win over.Every time Dems are made out to be worse than live torture, every time they start with a statement on a position you love, but segue into right-wing talk and you say 'well yeah, I guess I hear you' even if you don't at the time - those add up into memories, reasons we don't want to pull ourselves apart from people and their causes when those people and causes do not have any of our interests at heart.This train of thought has gone on long enough already;         \\nIf you worry a lot, if you depend on others for hope, if you have anxieties -   \\nDo not hang off the words of your enemies, looking for clues.
