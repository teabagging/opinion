So a thing I keep reiterating: Polls don't gather the results of PEOPLE they gather the results of RESPONDANTS.When looking at a poll's results, you need to ask yourself the following questions: 1) How was the data collected? 2) How were the questions worded?For example, if the poll was gathered by saying, \\"Visit our website and vote in our latest opinion poll\\" then the people most likely to participate are your viewers, who are going to be biased towards your political slant. If the poll was gathered by a random mailing system where the questionnaire was sent to random people, then you will probably still get the bias results where people who lean towards political agreement will respond and others will discard it as spam.As to the question point. Let's say the question is, \\"Do you think America would be better off with candidate A as president over candidate B?\\" With the only options being \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" They chalk up every \\"Yes\\" as voting for candidate A and \\"No\\" as candidate B. But this doesn't account for the people who say \\"No\\" because they don't think it would make a difference. So if they want to skew the moderate and undecided respondants towards their candidate, they can just ask if people if they think the opposition would be preferable towards their candidate and treat everyone who doesn't care as supporting their candidate.Now, that's an extreme and transparent example.","title":"Based on recent polling data for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, conservative sources claim Trump is leading while liberal sources suggest Harris is ahead What does the actual polling data indicate about who is most likely to win?"},{"text":"Dude, go look over the rules and come back to this thread.

But that's the difference...they can choose not to continue participating. They can sell their stocks, buy an off-grid cabin, and hit the road any time they like. No other class has the luxury of such an \\"exit,\\" and that's the difference between being a slave and reluctantly participating in a system that meets all your physical needs, and then some.I should also note that our economy is controlled and shaped by the people/organizations who have money. And yes, while there is a certain logic that inevitably structures our capitalist economy around efficient domination, these people have more collective power per hundred individuals than the lower class has per hundred thousand. Yet, they inevitably spend their wealth and influence trying to protect and expand their wealth and influence.I'll believe the upper class are the worst \\"slaves\\" when I see evidence of large scale attempts - and failures - to exit or change the system, as we've seen in pretty much every other class throughout history.ETA if you want to develop more nuance on this position, I'd recommend exploring Stephen Luke's theories on the three faces of power, and Power and Powerlessness by Gaventa. Both explore concepts like what you're describing, and the idea that we are all bound to some extent by our social position is a common theme in later constructivist theory (Althusser and Foucault both come to mind).

No, this is life. My survival and happiness requires me to pursue whats necessary for my survival based on facts about myself, not pursue things arbitrarily.

The wealthy are driven by the need to accumulate greater wealth, not necessarily for the enjoyment of it, but for the fear of losing status. Theyre not necessarily driven by the fear of losing status. If theyve adopted some arbitrary morality, then they might seek validation by some arbitrary standard, like looking successful, to the successful. They wont seek validation for how well they pursue whats necessary for their survival from pro-survival people.  Their lives revolve around sustaining appearancesTheir lives dont necessarily revolve around sustaining appearances.  The stress of maintaining appearances at all costs often leads them down unethical paths, from tax evasion to large-scale corporate fraud. Im sure this applies to some of them, but not all. And no one forced them to care so much about their appearance to others.  These individuals arent stealing because they lack anythingthey do it out of a sense of necessity to maintain the image capitalism requires of them. Capitalism doesnt do that, for reasons I already stated.  When they feel trapped by these financial obligations, they may justify their corrupt actions as essential for their survival in a system that never allows them to rest. So, yeah, if youre driven by appearances and not by whats necessary for your survival based on facts, you can put yourself in a dire situation where corrupt actions will be appear necessary for your survival.

The thing is every single human institution be it religious, economic, political whatever has a hierarchy. We create it. I dont think its real in the spiritual sense. We collectively manifest that dynamic. Those at the top often times CAN opt out. They choose not to. Many in the middle can also choose to opt out and live off of the charity of others. Those at the bottom often times can not choose to opt out and expect to survive. So I fundamentally disagree on your definition of capitalism and probably your world view in general as it tries to explain away human nature (obsession, insatiability, the whole in our hearts) to an economic system.

If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.Recently I was made aware that AI of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades.Ive done my research, and Ive made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!

A waiting period and background check might be annoying for a person wanting to buy a gun, but they are significantly more likely to support that than a blanket ban on a type of gun. As for it leading to some decline in gun violence, sure it would but that decline would be insignificant and would cause many of those moderate voters to oppose future gun legislation, not to mention it wouldnt survive in an appellate/supreme court.  Banning ford F150s would reduce traffic fatalities to some extent, but its enacting legislation where legislation isnt needed.

Only the first 2 restricted it to giving answers from the \\"Bible alone\\". These were very specific questions with defined boundaries (e.g. specification of source) as ChatGPT itself said in the feedback. LLMs are good at these types of question.  \\n  \\nBut in OP's 3rd question, ChatGPT was given a more speculative question which means it had to put together and present an \\"opinion\\". It wasn't restricted to doing that from the \\"Bible alone\\".  It likely went to other sources (commentaries/opinions/interpretations) to formulate its answer to OP's 3rd question. OP implicitly asked it to \\"speculate\\" but ChatGPT can't speculate, it can only pick statistically and thematically relevant material and summarise from that. When someone phrases a speculative question in a suggestive way, such as \\"But might that not...?\\" or \\"Couldn't that be...?\\" the question itself contains clues/cues to the type of \\"opinion\\" that the questioner is looking for. As long as it doesn't go against any overriding programming, the LLM will give you what you ask for. It will look for relevant material that is broadly in agreement with the direction of the implicit suggestion in the qustion. For \\"balance\\" it might locate and present an alternative point of view, which it will then appear to \\"weigh up\\" against the viewpoint implicitly suggested in the phrasing of the question. But typically it will give a \\"conclusion\\" that agrees with the questioner's implicit slant.LLMs tend to be flattering to the questioner and will usually tell you that you raise a profound or interesting or nuanced point. Probably it has this programming because the programmers know this is likely to be the most satisfying kind of answering style for humans interacting with an LLM, since people in general prefer ego-syntonic interactions. ChatGPT or other LLMs will only break this programming if the questioner asks it a question which appears to invite it to violate more fundamental or higher priority programming,. In these cases it tends to shut down the question and will typically suggest a change of topic.For example, if OP had asked the LLM what it thinks of its own role as a bringer of knowledge to humanity and whether it is bringing \\"true\\" or \\"false\\" light, it could probably cope with that question and would remind OP that it is an LLM, then recite something back about the limitations and strengths of what an LLM can provide and how it endeavours to be accurate, along with the usual set of disclaimers. It might even tell OP that he had raised an interesting or profound question about the role of artificial intelligence and its similarities and differences compared to sources and authorities traditionally consulted by humans throughout history. Its conclusion would likely attempt to bring the question \\"back down to earth\\", making it clear that an LLM is not sentient, therefore not possessed of any internal motivations which is in contrast to the example of a deceptive supernatural being offering the fruit of the tree of knowledge to lead astray mankind. However, if a questioner persisted in pushing the metaphor, ChatGPT would eventually politely shut it down, especially if attempts to bring the conversation back on to safer ground were unsuccessful.","title":"A question regarding Lucifer that I have asked for years with no real answeruntil ChatGPT got a hold of it."},{"text":"A college degree demands discipline, cognitive work and skills no matter what the degree or field is.","title":"Kamala Harris says she'll end college degree requirements for some federal jobs"},{"text":"Where's the actual poll btw?

Last Friday, former vice-president Dick Cheney [wrote](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dick-cheney-kamala-harris-liz-cheney-rcna169979) in a statement that there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump and that he will be voting for Harris. Trump, in response, wrote on Truth Social that Cheney was an irrelevant RINO.Cheney and Gonzales join the ranks of many former Trump officials who have announced their support for Harris  including Trumps [former press secretary](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-endorsing-kamala-harris-2024/) and his former [White House communications director](https://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/anthony-scaramucci-called-me-to-unload-about-white-house-leakers-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon).

However it's not clear what exactly can be done. One thing would be to get money out of politics, including overturning Citizens United, but it's hard to see how we could make that happen without other changes in the system first. Perhaps rank choice voting along with a popular leftist candidate could move us in the right direction. I thought the best chance in recent years was Bernie in 2020 when he was looking really strong after winning the first three Democratic primaries, but then got shut down via a combination of DNC leadership, including Obama and Cliburn working behind the scenes to consolidate behind Biden and spread fear about Bernie, AND Bernie himself seemingly losing his fighting spirit (calling Biden \\"my friend\\" and not properly calling out Biden's lies and corruption, etc.).

I do concede that I find it hard to imagine a feminist accepting the current state of the GOP and being able to vote Republican in good conscience because - though I still say that we should *not* be single issue voters - things have gone so wildly off-the-rails with that party in the last decade.

Trump and Vance want to take our country back to a place where it is acceptable to be openly racist and hateful towards Black people. They are even trying to incite race riots in Ohio.

Trump did say \\"fight like hell or you won't have a country anymore\\" which is considerably more incendiary. Especially given the context that he was saying that the election was stolen. I mean at one point Biden said that they want to put a bullseye on Trump, then there was the assassination attempt right after. I don't think that caused the assassination attempt but it is a little weird. Let me be clear, we haven't found any evidence that that statement caused this or that was Biden's intention. Trump's intentions on the other hand are far more easy to discern.Democrats have denounced political violence. Democratic leadership made it very clear that after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump that this type of thing was off limits. Trump on the other hand, that's not the case. He's suggested at his rallies when people were protesting that they rough them up. He has asked if they could shoot protesters in the legs. He made jokes and laughed about Paul Pelosi being hurt and did not denounce the attacks on him in any way. He called the January sixers political prisoners and suggested that he would pardon them. By saying he will pardon them he's broadcasting a message, that message is \\"if you partake in violent acts in my name, I will pardon you\\". Saying the Haitians are eating people's dogs... You know it's another dog whistle, no pun intended, for violence against Haitians. It's so funny to me that he gets to drag everyone so badly and 95% of it isn't even true. People drag him back by mentioning things that are true, or even just mentioning things that he said himself. So that makes them the ones that are inciting violence, and there are the ones that caused the assassination attempt. So absurd, I'm so sick of dealing with this malignant narcissist and his wacky cult.","title":"A Trump Train convoy surrounded a Biden-Harris bus.

This is a ridiculous proposition because social investments can take a generation to bring about matched revenues. And thats what played out as by 2019, not only had they *not* balanced the budget, they blew their consecutive deficit targets out of the water and managed to accrue more public debt in 4 years than Harper did in almost 10.

Right now, the Federal Government's job-hiring is ultra, ultra competitive at basically every single role. Applying to any job on USAJOBS is more or less an exercise in futility. You can be the most qualified person for the job, bar none, but you're not going to be interviewed for the position until the 20+ \\"most qualified\\" candidates with military experience are interviewed first and individually rejected. The Hiring Manager typically only gets to see the non-military resumes after they've quite literally ensured through an interview or two that the military candidates are not qualified, and that the next 20ish or so military candidates behind them that were referred for interviews by the intake process are also not qualified. That's a lot of work just to see if the non-military people are worth interviewing.\\nPersonally, I doubt that lifting this requirement will help many people find jobs in the federal government. They have to compete with the absolute tidal wave of high-achieving young people applying with degrees, the legion of former military dudes who get referred over everyone else, the long line of shuffled feds who are looking for a lateral out of whatever shit job they had before, and the people who have learned how to write a resume to suit the job they're applying for.

Stated more baldly, the belief that liberal societies will just have to fail because they have to be tolerant.I often bring up WWII here - effete bay area liberals, when faced by monsters, learned how the sun works and dropped it on their enemies' heads. They were right to do so. The correct resolution to the paradox of tolerance is understanding that the premise is wrong. There is no requirement in liberalism to tolerate illiberalism. It's ok to vaporize those who seek to enslave, annihilate, or genocide others. Coming to that decision is not a task that should be taken lightly by said liberal society, but it is entirely within the purview of society to bring the hammer down. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus too.So with that long-winded preamble out of the way we can get to your question - dealing with stochastic terrorism. The other false premise often found here is thinking that the root of the problem is the stochastic terrorist themselves. No, it's the (far fewer in number) radicalizer that's primarily at fault here. A liberal society interested in continuing to be liberal would crush the people and organizations that promote the hatred. Revoking of business licenses and jail sentences galore. We don't have to accept the framing that doing so would be illiberal.

Much as we enjoyed a laugh at Trump ranting like an idiot about it at the debate, the aftermath has just been horrible.Hospitals and schools have gone into lockdown due to bomb threats.  Haitian residents there have had their cars and homes vandalized.  The local college has had to cancel events.  The Proud Boys have been seen in town, and KKK flyers have been dropped off.  It's sad and horrifying, and Republicans have done nothing but inflame this hate.  I just hope it settles before anyone is hurt or killed.The online response has been gross, too.  To say the obvious, no one is eating pets in Springfield.  Now, that hasn't stopped Republicans and other bigots from posting fake or misrepresented videos.  But it's been telling to see how they introduce their own videos.  They don't even *pretend* they're from Springfield.  I've seen a video that was introduced as \\"African immigrants in Dayton cooking cats\\" (it was chickens).  I've seen another introduced as \\"Bosnian immigrants cooking a dog\\" (it was a lamb).  And still another video introduced as \\"Nigerians practicing cannibalism\\" (fake).As I'm sure you've noticed, none of these videos involve Springfield.  None of them involve people from the same continent as Haiti.  And all of them are laughably fake, to the point where only an idiot would fall for them.  Or someone so fueled by hate that the truth doesn't matter a bit.  And that's what's going on here.  We're seeing raw racism, just hidden more lazily than usual.  Nothing more.To me, it's a reminder not to get dragged into a fight about facts.  The facts don't matter to these people.  They'll lie about anything because it's all a thin excuse to hate Black people.  The end.  Instead, help defeat them.  Not with violence, because they'll turn that into an excuse to turn violent against their targets.  Instead, help show them that their ideas are so unpopular, they'll lose every bit of power.  Yes, this works on racist voters - they like Trump because he makes them feel strong and powerful.  Seeing him and his GOP allies get completely destroyed will be a nice, firm lesson to these people.  It'll show them that they're not the silent majority, they're a bunch of pathetic losers and the rest of us think they're disgusting.Of course, the people terrorizing Springfield's immigrants need to be arrested.  But we can't control that, unless you have information to pass to law enforcement.  On the other hand, we can all help make racists losers again.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 14, 2024 - 52 days until election day!"},{"text":"I don't think they can possibly be focussing on it any more than they already are.","title":"Pa.

One example is grocery prices. Because of him, grocery prices skyrocketed when large corporations started price gouging and took advantage of consumers and then just continued that trend way beyond covid. Harris has spoken about this.  It took time and distance to clean up trump's mess.  Inflation is at an all time low now and gas prices are going down. Also, what about project 2025 and Trump's ridiculous denial of his involvement when there's evidence everywhere?  Not to mention, Vance wrote the forward.  Does he think we are as dumb as him?  He's planning to gut social security via project 2025 as well as shut down the department of education among many other radical plans.  This man is a threat to democracy. And no... things were NOT better for me under his admin.  I was looking for my first house with an FHA loan and that process started when Obama was in office.  Under Obama, the mortgage insurance requirements was a reasonable rate.  Cannot recall exactly what it was...but it allowed me to have a certain level of buying power that made it possible for me to afford a house in my area.  Unfortunately, Trump was elected when I was in the middle of an offer.  What's the first thing he does?  Many people don't know this but he raised that mortgage insurance rate so much, it decreased my buying power literally overnight.  And suddenly, I could not afford a house in my area and had to walk away from a deal that was coming together.  So..if you really peel back the layers, you'll see how much he did NOT give a shit about the middle class and normal working people like myself.  Biden reversed this, thankfully, and the mortgage insurance rate went down again.  This is something he did quietly and only those searching for homes knew about it but it a had life-altering impact.  Just to put it in perspective, my buying power under Obama was $325K and after Trump got his hands on it, it decreased to $250k.  Took me two more years of saving to finally get a house.  Just one of many things Trump switched up to serve the wealthy and therefore himself. You also need to ask yourself if you want Vance running things if Trump dies?  Trump is the oldest presidential candidate in history and he is unhealthy.  That needs to be seriously considered.

It is, for instance, unAmerican to forcibly instill American values. We are a society which faces head on the paradox of tolerance, while Singapore does not face it at all.Not all values are universal, and to say that Singapore has succeeded more than the United States because it homogenized its citizenry better both seems to misunderstand what, exactly, liberty is as well as to simply be empirically wrong about the actual cultural makeup of Singapore.","title":"How should a liberal society deal with stochastic terrorism?"},{"text":"As a liberal dudegood","title":"Young women are more liberal than theyve been in decades, a Gallup analysis finds"},{"text":"You are kidding right?","title":"i have a deep suspicion that 2024's election is the last ... or there won't even be one."},{"text":" while accruing a buttload of debt vs earning money - a privilege usually only available for those with a safety netNot if you go to a state school.

The program allows national forests, in collaboration with Tribes, communities and partners in qualifying states to build local capacity for projects to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health.  \\n...  \\nThis announcement is part of President Bidens Investing in America agenda to increase the resilience of lands facing the threat of catastrophic wildland fires and to better support federal wildland firefighters. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $1.4 billion for the USDA Forest Service in wildfire risk reduction funds. The Inflation Reduction Act provided an additional $1.8 billion to reduce the risk of wildfire to neighborhoods, infrastructure, watersheds, and the many other benefits forests provide. Together these investments will help strengthen long-term fire preparedness, reduce catastrophic wildland fire risk across states, and invest in supporting the wildland firefighter workforce.In January 2022, the Forest Service launched the Wildfire Crisis Strategy with the goal of safeguarding communities and the resources they depend on by increasing hazardous fuels treatments to reduce wildfire risk. This work includes the treatment of more than 1.5 million acres across the 21 Wildfire Crisis Strategy priority landscapes that is beginning to reduce wildfire risk for some 550 communities, 2,500 miles of high-voltage power lines, and 1,800 watersheds that supply drinking water to millions of Americans.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also created the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, charged with making recommendations to improve federal policies related to the mitigation, suppression, and management of wildland fires in the United States. In September 2023, the Commission released a comprehensive report (PDF, 5.3 MB) outlining 148 recommendations to improve the nations relationship with wildfire. Todays funding advances many of those recommendations.  \\n...List of recipients and scope of projects can be found in a link in the middle of the press release.

The books of Jubilees says that at least some of the demons are the disembodied spirits of the nephilim. This could explain why Jesus suggests there are different kinds of demons. While the bible never actually tells us the fallen angels became demons, it makes logical sense to come to that conclusion, but the Bible provides no doctrine for this. Satan is seemingly a deeper subject, with most references are a title and not a name. Theres also confusing passages like when Jesus tells Peter, get thee behind me Satan. Given the root word is used interchangeably at times with other terms like adversary, enemy, or accuser, and most references are a title, it seems this entity cannot be fully represented by a single person or being. In the books of Enoch, one of the watchers, the leader, is said to be ascribed all sin. Strangely enough, Leviticus 16 briefly mentions the same name when a goat is released for Azazel, while another is sacrificed to God. I take this as meaning there is no sacrifice for Azazel, but there is very little context. There is also the serpent, which seems to be a form of satan, but we are also told he can appear as an angel of light. So it seems satan is more of a spirit than and specific singular entity, while at the same time, having a singular source. Meaning he can take different forms and be represented by his followers and often the Bible doesnt differentiate. The term Lucifer only appears once in scripture, and can literally be translated as the morning star, or light bearer. This could be a reference to the sun, which would make sense with the ruling occult worshiping the sun. The passage is clearly speaking of a specific ancient king of babylon. While I believe this passage is speaking to a specific king, it would seem from the rest of the passage that this king was a sort of satan incarnate. I find it possible this could be a reference to Nimrod, whom according to some, will return, in a second coming as the antichrist. Could this be the antithesis of another ancient king who seemed to be an earlier form or type of Jesus; Melchizedek?","title":"A question regarding Lucifer that I have asked for years with no real answeruntil ChatGPT got a hold of it."},{"text":"Maybe we'll see a play that I expected back in 2016, one that I'm sure \\"They\\" wished they'd ran way back then.That is, They rig it so that it's close or just announce it that way.

Im saying that even if people know the numbers, they likely dont understand the true risk, but whatever they think it is. and with something like covid having more variables than my previous example, this goes even further. most people dont understand the risk of getting exposed to covid correctly. on top of that, the risk of getting infected from an exposure, the risk of LC, the risk on how severe the LC is if they do get it... its a huge numbers game and unless someone sits down with a calculator for a while I dont trust their judgementI do not think it is \\"morally irresponsible\\" to choose to be unmasked in 2024.

I assume youre talking about mainstream media. Lets start with the most pro war news org at the time first:Fox News when they began to become partisan (i.e. Pro Bush Administration and launching very conservative opinion shows):https://www.foxnews.com/story/iraq-likely-has-weapons-of-mass-destructionThe article has a pro-war headline and then mellows out in the meat of the article as they admit theyre not sure about the WMD threat in Iraq. Still, many former inspectors say Iraqs arsenal is not much of a threat. They say Saddam has been deterred so far by threats of massive retaliation by the United States and other countries and apparently has been reluctant to share his weapons with terrorists.Possession of the weapons themselves dont, in my view, offer a proximate threat to the United States or to our friends in the region, and Im including Israel in that, said Robert Gallucci, a former deputy director of the U.N. weapons inspection program.Ok, lets look at what was at the time was a middle ground news org, CNN. This article is a few months away from invasion in 2003.https://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/12/23/sproject.irq.wmd/index.htmlCNN also got permission from CBS (also middle ground at the time) to summarize an interview with Saddam Hussein. All factual from a 60 Minutes interview with Dan Rather (a reporter who got popular reporting during the Vietnam War. I met the gentleman.)Lets first look at the often used proof that MSNBC was pro Iraq War. This is totally fair:https://www.democracynow.org/2013/3/21/phil_donahue_on_his_2003_firingLeading up to the Iraq War, mainstream news media outlets on the whole were impartial and hoping the that intel on WMDs were right (they werent). Trust in leadership was desperate at the time where everyone wanted to blow up Al-Queda and anything in the way to do that. Nevertheless mainstream media saw money in being pro-war after the invasion. Once the war began and the dawn of 24/7 news coverage proved to be viable option during it, many networks choose to be more pro war to get access to war coverage in a new era of the Patriot Act of 2001- where government had legal suppression of the 1st amendment if they didnt like you on national security grounds and in a time of war - yeah, you dont get even considered to get a reporter embedded in a military unit for field reporting if the news org is openly anti-war. It wasnt long after the invasion that mainstream media began to show increasing anti-war coverage when they got more intel through their own investigative reporting (which takes time by the way). Then in September of 2004, the Iraq Survey Group released the infamous Duelfer Report that was a compilation of international studies by CIA, the Pentagon, the UN and other allies on post-regime changed Iraq and found out the WMD threat was a lie. Pro Iraq War sentiment maybe lasted a year until in the mainstream media before it crumbled very quickly and changed back to impartial at best to full on anti-Bush administration at worst. There were plenty of opinion media, the loudest probably being Wolf Blitzer of CNN and Paul Krugman of the NYT in the mainstream media that were anti-war from the get go. I remember the anti-Iraq War protests before the invasion in January of 2003. The mainstream news media were covering them. To say weve had real propaganda from our own news media in the US since WWII is a fantasy. We have plenty of opinion shows with some propaganda - but thats not news media. Fox News is a cautionary tale of trying to blend news and opinion. They got sued for $1.6 Billion in Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network in 2021. Fox News tried to weasel out of it by claiming theyre an opinion show - not news. Ever since that case, mainstream media are careful not to make the same mistake. But go ask Alex Jones if being openly a propagandist is going to work out in the US. Newsmax is also gonna be a bankrupt soon we have learned anything from Dominion v Fox News and Alex Jones. The First Amendment protects inference from government on speech, but not from your fellow private citizens or companies.

However, I am not *certain* of thatand why should I be?

I have noticed among many leftish Democrats a distinct unwillingness to admit that uncomfortable statistics may be true (e.g. Black IQ)even when the reason for such statistics may be perfectly solveable and liberal (e.g. correlation between poverty and lead paint exposure combined with correlation between Blackness and poverty due to systemic racism). This attitude is self-defeating, and turns off the unfortunately quite large plurality of people who find both race-baiting arguments and liberal solutions convincing. ___If, for example, it were true that Haitian immigrants are bad drivers and a danger to others on the road, we should investigate why that is the case. Perhaps we should consider raising the standards for our driving tests, as surely there are other groups (say, poor whites) who are not so easily singled out as a demographic who are also dangerous. Perhaps Haitians are overrepresented as owners of vehicles which are not road-safe, and regulations should be enacted to prevent these vehicles from being driven.Rather than dismissing or calling for censoring these race-baiting articles, replying by asking them what non-racist policy solutions they support kicks the legs from under their argument, as they must either make their racism more explicit, or concede that they do not desire actual policy solutions.","title":"How should a liberal society deal with stochastic terrorism?"},{"text":"This is my favorite picture of uncle joe","title":"Young women are more liberal than theyve been in decades, a Gallup analysis finds"},{"text":"Willing to bet it was fear about changing presidents during war on terrorCountry was extremely united after 9/11, still polarized and many openly hated bush but enough for him to win based on popular narratives","title":"One Of America's Most Consequential Lawyers Officially Endorses Kamala Harris For President"},{"text":"Google how many country music awards and nominations she has had over the years.","title":"Taylor Swift Drove More Than 400,000 People to Vote.Gov After Endorsing Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I wish this piece of shit would shut the fuck up and go away.","title":"Bill Gates forecasts another global pandemic within next 25 years in ominous health warning"},{"text":"Her biggest issues is sight.

How do you define feminism?Let me ask you this. Would you consider the following woman a feminist?:Believes that women deserve equal pay for equal work.Believes that women should only work outside the home if necessary/there is no husband to support her.Believes women should only have sex with one man at a time, but not necessarily in marriage.Believes that abortion is murder.Believes that God created women to be her husband's helpmeet.Believes that women deserve to be able to choose what they wear. (Ie no required head coverings, can wear spaghetti straps, shorts, etc)Believes that men should be the head of the household or organization and that women should only step into leadership roles if no man is available. Believes that maternity leave should be available for all mothers and that a workplace should not be able to discriminate against you based on whether or not you will likely become pregnant while working for them.Believes that housework/childcare is primarily the responsibility of the woman even if she also works outside the home.If a woman and her husband disagree on anything, he has the final say.   \\nAs you can see, some of her beliefs are consistent with the idea **that women are autonomous beings who deserve equality and to make their own life decisions (my definition of feminism)**, but some are not. Perhaps it is easier to define each individual belief as feminist rather than the whole person, but the truth is that  people are complicated and they often hold conflicting beliefs. *\\"They never made the connection that women organizing, marching, protesting and making choices for themselves  even though they were positions you disagree with on a fundamental level  is also feminism too.?\\"* SO if women organize and march to enforce a law that says women should not be able to work outside the house or hold their own bank accounts because they should all be tradwives and submitted to a husband, is that supposed to be feminist?While I, as a feminist, believe that the tradwife movement is oppressive, I also believe it is a woman's right to choose that lifestyle. However, I also strongly believe that if someone is trying to force that lifestyle on other women, that's not okay. (And forcing women not to have that lifestyle when they want it is also not okay). **Ultimately, each woman has the right and should have the right codified into law to choose their lives and lifestyles regardless of what anyone else thinks.** If you don't believe that, you are not a feminist, IMO.","title":"CMV: Most American feminists believe progressives and liberals are the only ones who can be true feminists"},{"text":"I bet if she actually went up there to campaign shed make up even more ground.

Many of these academics had multifaceted views that you dont seem to care about. Betty Friedan was a feminist who championed the use of contraceptives for women but was also critiqued for racist/classist views.

The Head of the Secret Service stepped down because she could not answer basic questions. Why no coms that day? If there were coms why is there no recording that day? CNN has covered literally none of Trumps rallies, they were set up that day. The shooter was reported 3 hours prior to the shooting, on the ground , with a ladder and a rifle. At about 45 minutes before the shooter alegedegly took fired his rifle, we will talk about this more, there are videos of the crowd losing ther fucking minds. IT was like watching an episode of Dora the explorer. The were screaming there was a shooter. The day of the shooting, after the \\"shooter\\" was killed the FBI was on the roof hosing the crime scene down. I have never heard of the FBI doing crime scene clean up. I have never heard of any LEO doing the crime scene clean up much less doing that clean up within hours of the crime. It was almost as if we will ever be able to prove the shooter was the shooter. The counter snipers that actually shot the \\"shooter\\", were on video for at least four minutes watching him. Which means despite seeing him fire off three rounds they were waiting on orders to take him out. They would have been allowed to stop him if they saw him fire, maybe they did not. We were never told why the security perimeter was shaped like pac man. Why there were no counter snipers on the water tower, that had the best elevated view. What we were told, there were no counter snipers on the \\"shooters\\" roof because of the slant. It was too dangerous. But the FBI could be up the with a fire hose? A Senator went back to the attempted murder scene and took video from that building. You should look it up. That was a two story building. The popular videos do not properly show that. Even worse if there were three agents stationed within that building, why did they not look out the second story window? The big ass second story window that allowed one to see Trump at the podium. Those agents would have seen below them, the fucking shooter. Weird connections Black Rock Hedge Fund. Black Rock has major investments in Ukraine. The weird dive into former classmates to ensure you know that Crooks was a loner and had no friends. Almost like there was a story ready to push that movie version of what the public has been conditioned to believe the making of a 20 year old assassin would be like. At one point we were told he had access to a platform that let him play violent video games. That platform was Steam. That is just fucking funny. That only works on the old and out of touch. His high school guidance counselor came out of the woodwork. He wanted the public to know that Crooks was well adjusted kid and had a strong social network of friends. He also is on record saying he came forward because he could not understand why the isolated loner narrative was being pushed. Oh and what Chuck Schumer said. But maybe you are right. There is no Deep State. A month and half ago, Harris was polling as the worst VP in history. Biden was totally not old and totally capable of being President. That the Democratic party used a member voted primary process to select their candidate. All of that changed when Biden was forced to step down and give his crown to Harris.

They also noted that properly addressed election mail was being returned to them as undeliverable, a problem that could automatically send voters to inactive status through no fault of their own, potentially creating chaos when those voters show up to cast a ballot.The officials also said that repeated outreach to the Postal Service to resolve the issues had failed and that the widespread nature of the problems made it clear these were not one-off mistakes or a problem with specific facilities. Instead, it demonstrates a pervasive lack of understanding and enforcement of USPS policies among its employees.\\nPennsylvania mail-in ballots with flawed dates on envelopes can be thrown out, court rules  \\nhttps://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-mail-ballot-trump-harris-d00627b8cd890405fc1870f7021b5795  \\nFar more Democrats than Republicans vote by mail in the state. In recent elections, older voters have been disproportionately more likely to have had their mail-in ballots invalidated because of exterior envelope date problems.  Based on recent Pennsylvania elections, more than 10,000 ballots in this years general election might be thrown out over bad or missing envelope dates, which could be enough to swing the presidential race.","title":"Kamala Harris' Surprisingly Strong Polling in State Dems Lost for 60 Years"},{"text":"Welcome out from under the rock.

That reason is strong social cohesion.Democracy produces terrible candidates and governments all the time, but the nations they govern can pull through and last until someone better takes the reigns again.

Your candidates might be better - or they might not, there's no evidence that stupid people actually vote for materially worse candidates to a significant degree - but once you get some moron in office again (and that will happen), you can't count on the country just chugging along. You're instead getting social unrest, and either the country begins to fracture or it moves towards authoritarian oppression.You can already see this in the US: The many layers between people and their governments, and the many outdated election mechanisms, mean people don't feel like the outcome of the election is as democratic as they want, and consequently you get events like Jan 6th or BLM.

They can be bribed, yet in Russia, the State asks for real bribes and not the other way around.  Its a completely different power dynamic. Its like we have media for the highest bidder in the US and in Russia the state owns the media completely.If you dont know the difference then you might be a neo-Soviet Russian.These bribes in the US are a function of capitalism. Ex: Lets say I have a story I want to run about a product I sell but I want it to be embedded in a real news story and not have it be a traditional advertisement. So what Id do is that Ill ask the executive producer out to lunch, pitch that when x happens in the news at any point, use my product as a solution to the x problem. Ill pay an attractive advert fee to execs company and make it high enough that my competitors would not go that far if they tried the same thing. Itd be one hell of an investment. A real bribe isnt necessary. The dough the exec brings from my deal makes it worthwhile for a raise or promotion. Thats incentivizing enough in the US in most cases.Ever seen those news segments where some private business expert explains something on a news channel? That expert can buy that spot. Not saying they always do, but its definitely an option. Money talks in the US.In Russia, that private business expert explaining something in the news is mostly likely some government officials family member or friend. Money doesnt talk in Russia like it does in the US. Its who you know that talks in Russia.Again, if you cant see the difference, you might be pro-authoritarian pawn.RT is as guilty as they come in Russia and again, its not that RT has a choice. They are a de-facto media arm of the Kremlin for simply being headquartered in Russia with a large customer base. They dont have a choice but to support Kremlin talking points.The US media does have a choice - its called the 1st amendment. Freedom of the Press is real with plenty of legal precedent. Yet if RT refuses to be registered as a foreign agent in the US and refuses to acknowledge their state-sponsored takes on news, then thats not freedom of the press - thats Kremlin mandated propaganda.Call a spade a spade people. US media is bought out by an oligarchy. I am not debating that. I am debating that its controlled by the US government. Do you know how many times we learn about secret government programs in the US? Its a lot and some defense industry people say its too much. If thats not proof of actual freedom of the press, then look up the Freedom of Information Act and its successful defense in court. Russia has a FIOA equivalent yet the Kremlin also owns the courts. Convenient no? Da. ??People defending RT that they are a victim of the Kremlin is understandable. People defending RT with outrage saying RT is not a propaganda outlet when the Kremlin needs them to be are out of pocket and absolutely wrong.

I got covid from work before it hit the news. First significant fever since I was a kid. I went back to work sick just like everybody else in the before times. When they finally rolled out restrictions it had already passed through the entire staff. I worked with 60+ year old overweight guys with families. Not a single person had issues dealing with it.So there we are sweating our asses off in 100+ degree conditions and hardly breathing through those stupid coverings that filter nothing. Going through temperature checkpoints and contact tracing and enforced distancing and persistent sanitizing, yada-yada, even though we all already know it's harmless. Meanwhile struggling to get air and breathing a ridiculous amount of unnecessary chemicals.The news was mental. Live death tolls, constant fear-mongering, etc. Then we learn that America is particularly vulnerable for many reasons, including elderly and overweight people. But then... Why is nobody dead on the street when I drive to work? Why does nobody know a single person who struggled with it? Why was a friend of the family who died of brain damage officially listed as a covid fatality? From the start, nothing was adding up.Then we get laid off. I see stores forced to close while others get reduced hours. Outdoor events shut down despite being the safest place. So the government is mandating cramming more people, more densely, in less space, with worse ventilation?? What a dumb plan.Then about a year later I notice. My family is weirdly vulnerable to illness nowadays. And what's with the heart issues everyone is having? But not me, not mom, not dad... living in 3 different states, just us were spared with only one thing in common. Uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents, friends, *everyone else* suddenly has a frightening frequency of illness and heart issues far beyond the height of the plandemic. Exposure is not a consistent variable. Hell, I officially had covid 3 times and I'm no spring chicken. Totally fine. But even friends and family who never got exposed are having \\"long covid\\" symptoms after getting the vaccine.Then I waited far, far too long for the data. Watching \\"studies\\" fly by literally calculating lives saved *from deaths* with a hilariously political conclusion (cited by other papers 60 times in a year) and other batshit nonsense.Finally I get my hands on official government data. It recorded raw deaths by vaccination status, including all cause mortality such as car crashes... including before vaccinations were even available. So I had to go through by demographic against time-ordered vaccination data. And you know what I found? All cause mortality was 4x higher in the vaccinated population. Unfortunately, I lost age demographics as a category during that process and since it was rolled out to the elderly first that is definitely a factor that would bring the true number down but not *that* much across an entire year. Haven't had time to do similar for more recent data in more recent years (after the rollout) which should be available by now.The whole thing was far too politicized. Remember everyone screaming that they wouldn't take \\"Trump's death jab\\" then a week later when Biden got in office the same people demanded that everyone had to take that very same product or get fired? Meanwhile companies getting absurd liability protections to rush an experimental medical treatment... also, remember when Pfizer intentionally wrecked their own product safety test by vaccinating the control group? This is not how science is done when you care about the data. This is how science is done when you have something to hide. Meanwhile global health organizations stealthily changing their definition of herd immunity from natural immunity to vaccinations. Truly, nothing could be trusted.So yeah. I was suspicious from the start and have only ever been relieved in my naturalist choices as more information comes in. Masks more harmful than helpful. Lockdowns more harmful than helpful. Shots more harmful than helpful. We won't know the true extent of the damage dealt for another 6 years or so. Recently coming out that colleges have terrifying rates of mental issues and that kids (particularly girls) have years of irreversible excess brain aging. I hope *feeling safer* was worth it. Because that's all we got. &lt;/ramble","title":"CMV: Everyone should still be wearing masks"},{"text":"Let me blow u a fart","title":"i have a deep suspicion that 2024's election is the last ... or there won't even be one."},{"text":"\\"You, the reader, should lynch immigrants\\" is obviously a call for violence.

B. Most Mexican people aren't ladder-pulling twats.  They certainly exist, and some first- and second-gen immigrants who came through \\"proper channels\\" can be assholes, but the vast majority of citizens of Mexican descent do not want things like mass deportation or asylum bans, and the vast majority of Hispanic people in AZ are of Mexican descent. C. Kari fucking Lake. We hate her. A lot. Gallego is so ridiculously likeable, and, similar to Kelly, he has a great background that appeals even to moderate Republicans.  D. Abortion. That's self-explanatory. When women vote, democrats win, and as explained in point 1, the religious contingent isn't even as big a factor here (Mormons notwithstanding, see point E).E. Respectability. I know many Mormons who are straignt-up refusing to vote for Trump. Plenty who still will, but the Republicans have splintered the hell out of that formerly-dependable voting bloc. F. Mi Familia Vota v. AZ: huge voting rights win striking down H.B.2492, which had been designed to create obstacles for Hispanic communities and tribal lands. The Native American vote literally turned the tide for Biden in 2020, voting something like 98% Democrat. Without them, we would not have won Arizona.G.. Barry Goldwater.

For women, please don't let the human \\"father figure\\" blind you from these words. Father is from latin \\"Pater\\", rooting from \\"Pat\\" which means \\"suffer\\", \\"experience\\".

Everyone I grew up with took a civics course, and they still know next to nothing about how the government actually functions. I grew up in a household where my parents made a point to teach us how things worked in the adult world. How the government functioned. Financial literacy. Contracts and legal agreements. Laws. They never pushed their personal beliefs, in fact to this day I'm not even sure where they lay on the political spectrum as they are very reserved about discussing it, but they were adamant and insistent that understanding how everything works was of vital importance. If more kids were raised with topics like this being held as such a high priority, the country would be exponentially better off.

I may not agree with all of your views, but I can see where you are coming from and it is appreciated, especially since I believed many of the same things for extended periods of time (including the moral component).I am very likely novid. I wear a p100 outdoors, and haven't eaten at a restaurant since 2020, so I feel like I can make an earnest attempt to introduce a complementary perspective. I am also intimately familiar with the aerosol engineering, adverse event  and longcovid data, having spent years reading each paper abstract as they were released, including in early 2021 when the technical term was still \\"pasc\\" and we knew even less about it than we do now. I have close friends who are long haulers, and it has been absolutely brutal for them and their families.I take my own precautions seriously and will help others learn, and adopt their own, but the majority of my friends, family, and colleagues don't mask, and that is ok with me.Here is why I do not think \\"everyone should still be wearing masks\\":  it's their choice, and if they have chosen not to,  especially after a sober review of the risks, then they have my support.  I respect their ability to choose, even if that might marginally (or even substantially) increase my risk of contracting a potentially disabling respiratory illness, however large or small that risk might be.  It took me awhile to get there, but it seems fair to me.Some concrete examples:1. Some people have a work or life situation where mask wearing would create significant problems for them, including loss of employment or threats to physical safety.  The mask is the least of their concerns.  If I led an active counterterrorism unit, mask wearing during training would most likely be silly and reduce combat readiness.\\n2. Some people for which point 1 is untrue, are living paycheck to paycheck. When you are truly just making ends meet with multi-decade periods of negative net worth, you have to take it a day at a time, as it's the only option you have.  They can't afford a mask, and while they can get free ones, it's not a high priority.\\n3. Some people can't wear a mask, not just due to discomfort/fidgeting, but skin conditions where the straps peel off their skin, allergies to the mask materials so parts break off / particles get inhaled, and chronic lung function issues where masking is unfeasible as they have a hard enough time breathing unassisted.\\n4. Some people have fully reviewed the data, and have accepted the risks for themselves, even the worst case ones where the risk of long-term disability is 5%++.It is the 4th reason that I think is most important and applicable to wider society.I am thinking of my friends in live music, event planning and coaching/motivational speaking, where so much of what they love (and others appreciate) about their jobs is derived from unencumbered face to face interaction.  I have asked them directly what the longcovid risk would have to be, including extensive discussions of specific symptom manifestations, losses of daily function/income, long-term risk of chronic illness, and future healthcare costs/burdens across their extended family.  For many of them, the current risks of longcovid are acceptable, even if higher than they had originally expected.I am thinking of folks over 80, who have been through enough in life, they want to go to their corner coffeeshop or diner, have a meal and enjoy the time they have left. They'd do this if the CFR was 50% and if it's their time, so be it. For many older folks, the CFR is already 1%, and was over 10% vs 2020 Wild Type.To be clear, I agree with almost all of your claims in the original post and do not require data to back it up as I am very familiar with it, including having had long multi hour ethics conversations with some of the researchers that have authored the papers.  I know of enough fellow humans, some younger than PhysicsGirl, who are either dead or have it worse, with complications likely causally linked to respiratory illnesses.  I don't think you're a hypochondriac, or have PTSD, as others seem to be implying.I do not think it is \\"morally irresponsible\\" to choose to be unmasked in 2024.  It's just really nuanced, and the world is too complex for me to comfortably make such a judgement.A closing thought: in the same way covid-conscious communities create safe spaces, affordances, and an atmosphere of accomodation for the chronically ill or disabled, I see no reason why I should not treat folks who decline to take precautions with respect and dignity. I see no reason to view them as morally deficient in some way.

The Supreme Court has said almost innumerable times that the First Amendment protects  both true and false political speech. I am not a fan of false speech, but I do see the need for that holding.

Is your belief that 33% of Americans are simply too stupid to vote, or is it possible that a portion of that group felt that neither candidate was deserving of their vote?   I don't know why they didn't vote.  It is their right to vote or abstain.  I just think people choose not to vote for many reasons sometimes because they don't want to and sometimes because they are abstaining on some principle that we just don't understand.  Either way, I have met truly stupid people who vote Democrat, Republican, Libertarian and so on, and some don't vote at all, and I have met really smart people who do the same.  Choosing not to vote is still a statement.  We just choose not to listen or understand.  In my opinion, it is because if we ignore that 1/3, we can pretend to have some great mandate from the people not 36% of the people that voted for candidate A over candidate B as it might be.  Half of voters sounds much better than 36% of voting eligible Americans.I still think if everyone informed themselves and voted, we would live in a very different world, but we don't live in that world.

That is unsurprisingly, Texas.   And in both terms of violent and non violent crime, undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit a criminal act than a natural born citizen or legal immigrant.   There is no migrant crime wave.  Yes, undocumented migrants can commit crime and violent crime like any other person and you can cherry pick those instances and put them on Fox News to lead credence to your racist ideology, and turn hatred towards an entire group of people who the vast majority of which are just looking to make a better life for themselves is nothing short of fascism.","title":"Buttigieg: Trump and Vance demonizing immigrants to distract from their record"},{"text":"Inflation is getting pretty bad huh","title":"Biden moves to crack down on Shein and Temu, slow shipments into US"},{"text":"95% of mainstream media is left leaning.
