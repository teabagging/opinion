Biden also caused a significant amount of inflation. He refused to get rid of the Trump tariffs in a stupid play for labor that didn't even work, getting rid of the tariffs alone could have gotten rid of around 1 point of inflation at its peak (and further reducing tariffs could have done more). Plus the Biden stimulus massively overspent (and Dems could have taken the GOP compromise offer instead which would have patched the output gap) and is estimated to have caused around 2 to 4 points of inflation directly, plus the overspending on stimulus also may have contributed to the demand shock that hurt the weakened supply chains, thus indirectly causing even more inflation. So if Biden had done things differently, he could have removed at least something like 3 to 5 points from inflation at its peak (around 8 points), and with those swings, US inflation would have been genuinely considerably lower than much of the developed world. But instead Biden played to labor and the progressive wing, neither appreciated it at all, and we ended up with more inflation than was necessary, and voters blaming Biden in a way that frankly wasn't fully inaccurate anywayBiden has been less bad than Trump would have been, but he's shown genuinely not great leadership himself","title":"Maybe Democrats Didnt Do So Badly After All"},{"text":"He literally won and hes mad about polls. ??","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"And thats basic empathy and understanding there.

I'm always frustrated with laypeople's perceptions of our judicial system. As a lawyer, I can assure you that 99% of the differences between the \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" justices comes down to how they apply philosophical/theoretical perspectives (which have been around for 100 years by the way) to a particular legal problem. I wrote an explanation for laypeople some time ago and I'll try to find it and link to it. I promise the justices aren't just doing whatever they want. People only hear about the big culture war related topics like abortion, guns, etc., but the justices see things very similarly overall. There have been arbitrary decisions, yes, but those decisions came from all sides of the court throughout the centuries. I'd like to highlight two cases for you that are good examples. Justice Kavanagh wrote a fairly pro-environmental protection concurrence in Sackett v. EPA. He applied a theory typically favored by \\"conservative\\" justices. Justice Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in Bostock, which extended workplace protections, applying the same approach. I would write you a book chapter defending the institution of the S. Ct., but I have a job.3. Evidence for this? Would it be different from how the Democrat Party treated Bernie Sanders (three times), Tulsi Gabbard and a slew of other candidates in 2020, or RFK Jr. (lifelong democrat, environmental attorney, and *Kennedy*)? Talk about undemocratic... The Republican Party establishment *loathed* Trump when he ran in 2016. Even diehards like Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney and Nikki Haley clung to the Bush-era Party as long as they could. Liz Cheney is still clinging to it. Probably because her dad was VP at the time... who knows..4. Biden *currently* has a \\"stacked military\\" and could do it right now. Trump didn't last time and won't do it this time. He could have fired generals and \\"stacked\\" it last time. He is the commander in chief. *Every* president since George Washington has had the same extensive power to do this. Trump has been consistent in that he wants the whole country to succeed. Launching an impossible military coup is not part of that. Even if it were, it would be practically impossible because that's not what the military personnel want and it's not what the armed population wants (2A). There are enough checks and balances to prevent this from happening. You can dislike Trump all you want. I can relate. You can dislike his policies all you want. I could relate if we were speaking several years ago. But the idea that he will become a dictator is not going to happen. The thought is, respectfully, outlandish. But I won't hold the fact that you're not a lawyer against you. I understand where you're coming from.

He threatened to \\"lock \\\\[Hillary Clinton\\\\] up.\\" When he actually came into office he refused to do so because he thought it would be terrible for national unity and bringing people together to prosecute a former first lady. He has said what I relay to you now in multiple interviews since then. Many people in the Republican Party were pressing him to do it in the early days of his administration. Hillary Clinton deleted tens of thousands of emails *in violation of a Congressional subpoena*! She insinuated that these were just irrelevant to the Congressional inquiry but there are two problems with that. First, claiming evidence is irrelevant is not a justification to destroy it forever. I've seen lawsuits where emails are subpoenaed and the first thing any honest lawyer tells you is not to delete anything relevant because it's a serious ethical violation that could get you disbarred if you advocate for things like that. Those deletions look extremely suspicious, but the world will never know what was on those hard drives. Second, a technician with the company that maintained the data on Clinton's servers told the FBI in the investigation that Clinton's team requested that the emails be deleted shortly after the Benghazi attack. **Bottom line**: Clinton was in deep sh-t and Trump refused to prosecute to help promote national unity. 4. I'm not sure how this fits \\"why he'll try,\\" but if it's true and people like you can see through it then there are plenty of other eyes on it if there is a threat in the future. Therefore, it becomes less likely, not more likely.5. Trump has promised to remove incompetent generals. Like the one who played a part in logistically botching the Afghanistan withdrawal. Generals may have started as field soldiers, but they are government employees in very bureaucratic positions. I've worked in government and the private sector. Everything I've seen tells me many (not all, but many) government employees and middle managers of the bureaucracy expect nothing to challenge their position in that bureaucracy. Trump fired a few people last time for incompetence and they lashed out at him. I've also heard the term \\"loyalist\\" being thrown around a lot. Every time Trump nominates or plans to appoint someone who agrees with him on policy the media call that person a \\"loyalist.\\" Guess what, Biden *only* hired loyalists. When is the last time you heard a top bureaucrat trash talk Biden? Part of the reason is he refuses to fire *anyone*. Mayorkas should have resigned years ago out of embarrassment for failure to do his job. Then when he didn't Biden should have fired him. That never happened, so you've never heard Mayoraks say anything bad about Biden. **Addressing \\"why he'll succeed\\":**1. Republicans have been complaining about this for years. Democrats have been fighting voter ID laws and paper ballots since I was politically active over a decade ago. We should have paper ballots and proof of citizenship required to register. I recently moved to a blue state and with the information I had to show (barely anything) I could literally have been a non-US citizen and voted in last month's election no problem.

If you want to skip to my response below, see the **bold** text. I care about policies and outcomes. In 2016 I was staunchly anti-Trump. Then, for four years I compared his policies and their outcomes to the gross mischaracterizations of those policies and outcomes by the legacy media. About one year into his presidency I thought \\"wow that article got so much wrong,\\" article after article. I started consuming media from both sides of the spectrum. Two years into his presidency I didn't care for him on a personal level (and still don't), but was happy with a lot of what he was accomplishing (paid family leave for lots of gov't employees, lowered my taxes, etc.). The covid lockdowns long after the science supported it broke me and turned me pro-Trump. Mischaracterization after mischaracterization and borderline lies were perpetrated by the media. If he would say \\"drink water,\\" the media would report it as \\"Trump advocates for drinking dangerous drowning agent\\" (technically true but gives an unequivocally false impression). **Addressing \\"why he'll try\\":**1. Short answer: if you watch the video, you can see he means it facetiously. Long answer: He was upset that people were saying ridiculous things like that. So he used that phrase to basically say \\"people who make that claim about me think enforcing border laws passed by Congress makes someone a dictator, so if people are going to misuse the term, f-ck it, I'll use it to describe me enforcing laws Congress passed.\\" He was talking about reversing illegal immigration and fossil fuel energy production on federal lands. Both things that literally every president for decades (if not a century) has done or tried to do. Finally, he wasn't a dictator during his first term. \\n2. This is not a violation of the First Amendment. Trump is entirely within his right to try to sue an organization that editorializes before it publishes content if that content affects him AND is untrue. Outside of the political context, those lawsuits are fairly standard as a species of libel, depending on the actual allegations. The First Amendment does not mean that the press can say whatever it wants; the Amendment only protects (simplifying) true statements or statements of opinion or statements that are very difficult to get to the bottom of. That's part of the reason that journalistic standards promote such careful wording. Trump thinks Ann Selzer knew or had reason to know that the poll she published was false or misleading in a way that effected his rights in the election.

Precisely because there is no other figure in recent history that you can point to that has had such a negative impact on the middle class and American worker's way of life.Reagan's Administration ushered in the greatest redistribution of wealth in a generation. His administration cut social programs and welfare benefits for countless Americans.He took money from the social security fund to pay for his budget deficits.His admin rolled back labor organizing dramatically, and his handling of the air traffic controllers union strike is widely considered to be an effort that was heavy handed and normalized union busting, your revisionist explanation doesn't change that.Reagan's legacy as the facilitator of \\"supply side economics,\\" *is* his legacy because despite any efforts to blame the outcomes on anyone and everything that materialized prior to Reagan stepping into office, he played the most prominent role in carrying out this economic policy.Part of this policy involved removing regulations and lowering taxes on businesses and corporations, which would eventually translate into things like higher wages for workers, better jobs, etc, hence the \\"trickle down\\" label.However, unlike the new deal response to the Great depression, which depended on the federal government intervening in the economy, the Reagan administrations response to \\"stagflation,\\" did not result in long lasting positive outcomes for the working and middle classes.Before Reagan's presidency, income tax on the wealthiest Americans was as high as 70%. By the end of Reagan's presidency that number dropped to 28%. Reagan was also responsible for generating major tax breaks for corporations and estates, all for the sake of limited government and a redistribution of wealth to the top.People brag about short-term improvements during Reagan's presidency, but the emphasis should be on short term, while it should also be emphasized that during this time, the rich got richer, and the poor, middle and working class saw little improvement.The incomes of the wealthiest Americans rose by over 100%, by comparison, the incomes of workers rose by a whopping 17%. All that wealth really trickled down huh? And since then, that wealth gap has only continued to widen. Since Reagan stepped into office, executive salaries have skyrocketed as much as over a thousand percent, while average worker compensation has increased by only 18%In 1980, the average CEO earned 36 times the average worker. Today, the average CEO earns 400 times the average worker.For the average worker, wages haven't even kept up with inflation. Where's the trickle down?And throughout Reagan's presidency, even though there were concerns directed at his policies, Reagan still maintained that if workers weren't getting richer, It was solely due to their own moral failures. And ever since Reagan, this idea has taken hold in the Republican consciousness.Now let's talk about Reagan's attitude, stance and policies on labor unions and workers rights. The mid 20th century saw a peak in Union activity, nearly 1/3 of workers belonged to a union. Not only that, but unions had power, power to mount challenges against their employers. This even allowed unions to bring about important labor laws like the eight hour work day, minimum wage, child labor laws and even civil rights laws.Ironically, during this time, Reagan was a member of a union himself. He was even president of the screen actors guild. But then he flipped...While he was president of the screen actors guild, he abused his power to grant his talent agency a waiver that would get him comfortable and well paid television roles. The FBI actually investigated this for anti-competitive behavior. His talent agency was eventually forced to dissolve, and this is when Reagan conveniently became anti-union and anti-regulation. Are you seeing the picture yet?He still used his previous position as a union president to appeal to union workers on the campaign trail by the way. Fucking gross. A lot of these laborers ended up voting against their best interests.Now let's talk about their traffic controllers Union strike, because you have been seriously misled. These workers were striking for better working conditions and higher pay.The problem is that they were federal workers, and Reagan made it perfectly clear during a press conference that what they were doing was against the law, and that if they did not end their strike immediately, they would all be fired. Yeah, what a real working class fucking hero.Two days later, 12,000 workers were fired, not only that, but they were barred from working for the federal government ever again. Hmm, what a real small government move huh?This actually crippled the labor movement, and it hasn't recovered since. So for you to have the audacity to claim that it somehow positively impacted the labor movement is just astounding to me.At its peak, union membership accounted for over a third of all workers in the United States, at the end of Reagan's presidency that number was cut in half. Today, union membership accounts for around 10% of all workers. Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers sent a heavy-handed message to Union workers. That message, in part, not only legitimized Union busting, but made it more acceptable.And again, Reagan also normalized appointing corporate cronies into positions within the labor relations board where they can further hamstring the labor movement, disrupt the balance between employers and employees, take power away from unions and make it harder for unions to strike and operate effectively, all the while loosening regulations on businesses and corporations.And not only has the number of union workers declined since Reagan stepped into office, but the number of strikes have declined as well. Before Reagan stepped into office, there were an average of between 200 to 400 strikes and any given year, right after Reagan left office, that number was cut down to 40.Strikes are one of the few tools that unions can use to challenge their employers, these kinds of strikes have, as I've explained before, helped actually advance a labor movement and help create labor laws that protect workers and their livelihoods.And I haven't even gotten into the whole \\"welfare queen\\" narrative and lie, the racist, Law &amp; Order dog whistling, the Iran contra affair and supplying weapons to America's enemies, caving into terrorist demands, the assault on Grenada to distract from his failure in Beirut, his support of dictators, record budget deficits, his vetoing of the farm credit bill that put many farmers out of business, his financial deregulation policies that caused hundreds of financial institutions to fail, his mishandling of the AIDS epidemic, drugs, and race related issues.","title":"Department of Labor welcomes President Biden as newest Hall of Honor inductee"},{"text":"Lock him up ??","title":"Biden Claims His Campaign Was Basically Scandal Free And People Have Thoughts"},{"text":"Fuck Debbie!","title":"This Parkland Shooting Survivor Wants a Top DNC Leadership Spot - We need to realize that we are increasingly the party of sycophants, David Hogg warned, stressing the need for a shift in the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Not sure how a 24 year old thats never run a campaign or held elected office will win over the DNC.","title":"David Hogg is running for DNC vice chair"},{"text":"Hed sue his mom if he had the chance.","title":"Donald Trump Apparently Thinks Bad Polling Is Illegal | He suggested Monday that hes going to sue Iowa pollster Ann Selzer for wrongly putting Kamala Harris ahead of him in the state."},{"text":"Be great if they fractured into a newly registered 3rd party.

He borrowed $500,000 from Encino-based firm D&amp;D Marketing and was sued in 2015 when he did not repay the loan.[8] He was also sued in 2016 when two men claimed that he had sold them fake stock certificates.[8] On February 14, 2024, Smirnov was returning to the US from abroad. He was arrested by FBI agents at Harry Reid International Airport.[9] Smirnov is a dual US-Israeli citizen and had both an Israeli passport and a U.S. passport; both were seized by the FBI.[10][11] On February 15, Smirnov was charged with lying to the FBI.[3] Smirnov faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.[9] On February 20, a United States magistrate judge in Smirnov's home state of Nevada ordered him released with a GPS monitor.[12][13][14][15] However, a federal judge in California had him re-arrested on February 24, on the grounds that his release would be \\"likely to facilitate his absconding from the United States.\\"[16][6] In 2020, Smirnov was paid $600,000 by Economic Transformation Technologies (ETT), prosecutors said. That same year, Smirnov began lying to the FBI about the Bidens, according to the indictment. Two of ETT's three owners, Shahal M. Khan and Farooq Arjomand, along with their associate DAMAC Properties chairman Hussain Sajwani are friends of or have done business with Donald Trump.[17]First there's the obvious issue of this dude being paid  by Trump's homies the same year he fabricated dirt on the Bidens. Then there's the issue of his clearly criminal and fraudulent past, which should leave his claims non-credible.

The collapse of civic groups in the US means people turn more and more toward online communities to find people who share interests. Form a group based around something you enjoy  hiking, basketball, board games, whatever  and advertise it any way you can. Its harder to be a troll during face to face interactions, especially if youre meeting up for a neutral (read: non-political) activity. Community building is vital, which leads me to the second recommendation.People function better when theyre have a sense of purpose. (You dont need to believe in the divine to understand that religion gives people a sense of purpose, and that rapid secularization can leave many feeling adrift.) Young men in particular are feeling like their lives lack meaning; when the dominant narrative is that men are supposed to be strong providers, income inequality can feed into feelings of inadequacy and anger. While you dont have to make your group explicitly about charity or civic organizing, it may not hurt to have your group do something once a month/a few times a year to give back to the community. Maybe you have a food drive that features some friendly competition (top donor gets a gift card, or just bragging rights), or learn a skill together that can be used to help people in need. Giving people a reason to belong and engage in self-development helps them connect with their community and build self-confidence, both of which can insulate them from the siren song of extremism.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"I mean, it might even be treatable, and he could live 30 more years, but hes definitely going to be distracted/exhausted by it in the near term!","title":"AOC loses key vote in House Oversight race to Gerry Connolly"},{"text":"[Let them ~~eat cake~~ play Mario Kart](https://c.tenor.com/VpBsXKLgE_EAAAAC/mario-kart8-death-stare.gif)","title":"AOC loses key vote in House Oversight race to Gerry Connolly"},{"text":"The point is to own the allegations, and just not give a damn.

They've ALWAYS had excess power,  At the founding, only the top couple percent were even ALLOWED to vote.  We've made a lot of progress.  There's plenty more to go.  By the way, we're a hegemonic power because of geography (we have two giant oceans, no strong neighbors, and a buttload of land and natural resources to build the country before we REALLY got into foreign politics.)

We are wealthy because we set up an international order of laws and trade for the mutual benefit of everyone involved, and it worked.  But to maintain it, we made promises to MAINTAIN those rules.

Now, some workers are losing pay raises"},{"text":"It's really baffling to me that Republicans have been able to run on a message that's pro-working class when they've been chipping away at the labor movement since Reagan.And precisely because they've installed corporate loyalists into positions of power within agencies like the labor relations board, where these cronies can cripple the power of unions, make it harder for them to operate effectively, and continue disrupting whatever balance is left between employers and employees, all while loosening regulations on businesses and corporations.The next Trump administration, in conjunction with Republicans in power, will work towards weakening and finally dismantling whatever is left of the labor movement. Over the years, the Republican agenda has been to redistribute wealth to the top, weaken the labor movement, widen the wealth gap, sometimes literally taking from the poor and giving to the rich, all while safeguarding a tax code that disproportionately taxes income over wealth, benefiting those who avoid paying income tax, who hoard their wealth in tax havens, who leverage other people's money for profit, and who use debt as a rich man's tool to evade paying taxes, while debt is simply a burden for everyone else Under Reagan, union activity plummeted, CEO salaries skyrocketed, especially in comparison to their workers income. After Reagan's administration, unions and laborers held less political power and leverage, and the amount of strikes fell dramatically. Strikes were one of the few tools that workers had left to bargain for better working conditions, wages, etc.Since Reagan, these issues have only worsened. Republicans like Reagan have appointed their rich, self serving and agenda driven allies into positions of power where they can take power away from workers and hamstring the labor movement. And useful idiots like Trump will assist the GOP in landing its final blow against the working class.The labor movement is a shell of its former self thanks, in large part, to Republicans. Trump literally just had the audacity to complain about giving overtime pay to a crowd of union workers.Trump and Republicans can say whatever they want on the campaign trail to appeal to \\"the working class,\\" but instead of following through on their campaign promises, they have consistently carried out an agenda against unions, laborers, workers and human rights.And here's the rub. Clinton gets blamed for NAFTA all the time by Republicans. It's one of their misleading talking points they use to shirk responsibility for their part in all of this. But NAFTA was an inevitability. It was actually George HW Bush who pursued the free trade and NAFTA agenda, while it was a widely agreed upon policy among experts back then.This forced Clinton to articulate his position on a free trade agreement. During the presidential campaign, Bush  argued for a NAFTA with no limitations or restrictions, Clinton argued in favor of an agreement with terms that still protected American jobs and labor, American investments and environmental regulations. Clinton tried to find a middle ground between the stances of Bush and Ross PerotNAFTA received overwhelming support from Republicans in Congress, and it was Democrats who came out in force and spoke out passionately against the treaty. Nearly all Republicans voted in favor, half of Democrats voted against. The agreement passed narrowly in the house.Since then, many Democrats who voted in favor of it, like even Joe Biden himself, have switched their stance on these policies and their impact on the working class. Instead, coming out in favor of rebuilding and safeguarding organized labor. FFS, Joe Biden is the first president to join the picket line!And don't get me started on how Trump's disastrous tariff policies play into all of this.Nearly every economist has determined that Trump's previous tariff policies did more harm than good and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans. And now he wants to impose more extreme, sweeping tariffs that will amount to what Harris called a \\"national sales tax.\\"We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression and brought global trade to a stand still.The cost of Trump's sweeping tariffs will be passed down to the consumer, they will stifle innovation and even make domestic industries less efficient. They will likely even result in job loss.His tariffs will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities.Small businesses will face challenges of their own as well as they do not have the same power as larger businesses or industries to do something about these policies. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... All in all, none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And this next part is important, because whenever Trump gets the opportunity, he criticizes Biden for \\"the trade deficit,\\" when in reality:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.The trade war Trump started targeted American farmers and agricultural workers in the Midwest most of all, These are the same political groups that voted for him in droves.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesAnd as far as the labor movement goes, when Trump comes into power, he will neglect what's left of it while spearheading a Republican agenda that has been chipping away at organized labor ever since Reagan stepped into office.Trump's rich backers and allies will benefit most at the expense of everyone else of course. I mean, you could describe most Republican policies as benefitting the few at the expense of the many.But, \\"Republicans are better for the working class!\\" Go figure...Trump's new administration is expected to be the richest in US history. Billionaires funding billionaires helping billionaires, yet they run on a so-called populist platform.But in reality, over the next four years, CEO salaries are likely to continue increasing, while union activity is likely to continue declining, all while Trump is expected to maintain a Republican agenda that has been redistributing wealth to the top, degrading our environment, prioritizing the interests of the rich over the rights and livelihoods of laborers and Union workers.

And to a certain extent the key factor here to keep the republicans in check is a solid dem opposition because one thing Trump is *not* going to be able to do is stop the election process all together.The first thing the Dems can do is accept what the British Government did (labor, not conservative) which is ban puberty blockers (in the British case pause for more study which is damning they were ever used at all given science clearly was fudged and lied about including by dem party officials in a way involving childrens health) It was the first thing Trump brought up in announcing his election campaign, and he mentioned it early and often on the stump.  It also was mentioned by Putin in his last public statements before assaulting Ukraine (he called it child abuse).  Theres a code of silence in dem circles about it, but moderates have despised the dem policy and lies about science and their push to get it in schoolsand it looked like 14 million of them sitting this election out.  The next thing they need to do is get rid of the Clinton / Obama / Biden power in the dem party, nor ever, ever, run as their candidate someone who was selected by them without a primary process (Biden / Kamala basically became dictators of the dem party when he and she appointed her as the dem candidate).

And the dems need to drop this crew, now, and find better people who are better candidates who arent covered in blood and guts.If they can do that, and quickly, they will be back in control of the house and senate in two years because Trump and many republicans are in fact, schmucks.  But the dems have been so so so so bad since 08 about so so so so many life and death matters that to a certain extent many people agree that many of their high ranking members should be prosecuted *with good cause*They are way to easy beat right now and way to evil to support.  And thats emboldening the extreme parts of the conservatives to move in ways a moderate, competent, Democratic Party would quite easily prevent.In the interim, Trump is pushing 80.  He is not a threat in the sense of ending American elections and in a lot of ways has pretty much destroyed cultural conservativatism once and for all in the states - his base is WWE republicans who have a few rum and cokes and take a picture with Santa and then watch football.  I dont want to get cocky about that and speak to soonand his right hand man is the leading electric car salesman / climate change not denier in the world really whose company Tesla employee policy is not anywhere near the Christian conservative baseline and in fact socially is more or less a liberal.The best thing is to wait him out - Trump is a spectacularly unique figure in American history - from apprentice to Tyson fights to towers to WWE hall of fame.  He cannot be replaced.  There will only ever be one like him.  And hes near 80.  The best thing for everyone is to wait him out, support moderate reasonable dems and repubs, and oddly enough Im hopeful when he leaves he may have carved out a sort of odd middle ground space where 10 years from now there is actually a lot of room for the country to unite in this new ageOf course America is also super ready for a third major party and many more.","title":"CMV: Trump will be a dictator."},{"text":"This is the guy who loves private insurance.\\n \\"Our system is based on private employer insurance, and it's going to stay that way.\\"\\nWhatever could be done to make it so insurers stop murdering people?","title":"AOC loses key vote in House Oversight race to Gerry Connolly"},{"text":"There's no evidence of remotely consequential voter fraud.

The issue isn't so much how he used it, as I said it's totally understandable, but what this means for the pardon power going forward. If Trump uses it the same way it becomes something we have less leverage over since Biden also used blanket pardons for his family and possibly people who could be targeted by the incoming admin. It's similar to corporate donors. Democrats (in most cases) can't really go \\"Republicans are the party of big corporate donors\\" while also taking in just as much money from corporate donors.

Given the exponential growth of the transgender population, especially among youth, using desist statistics from 2014 are wildly inaccurate and borders on bad faith as you're insinuating things are the same now as they were then.So by your own commentary, the only issue you have with this prohibition of tax use is the group of 15-18 year olds who cannot have a chemical or surgical sex change, but can maintain their puberty blocking through 18, but also feel that they cannot make it to 18 without a sex change. That's an incredibly small and niche group that I'm not even sure exists.","title":"Democratic senators seek to ax transgender care ban from defense bill"},{"text":"It was close to \\"unfortunately we ARE going back.

The commute to school (or the grocery store) is far more dangerous than being in a school.Cars are safer. With kids buckled safely into seats, my phone tucked away if not needed to be a GPS and the will to let the kid babble and ignore any screaming I'd feel safe. The thought of my child gunned down in a place they're supposed to be safe and happy feels so much scarier and more real.Schools occasionally use software on tablets or computers. For example, my grade school daughter has used a computer to type stories, and they used a math program to learn some math concepts. I think learning to type, and in limited situations using tablets for learning is just fine. It's not like they're zoned out watching YouTube.Kids vs IT staff is a battle thats been fought since the schools got internet. In my experience kids always win and share their tips with classmates. Weirdly I somewhat like that, it shows they can learn to use technology and problem solve. However, it can impede with learning and I'd rather my kids not be given tablets at all. This isn't even getting into why I want my kid walking around with a camera and microphone the school gave them. Yes I worry about my phone recording me and don't bring it into doctors appointments, even thought I'm less important to large corporations than my kid would be to a school.I haven't seen / heard any \\"I said so\\" learning. As far as I can tell, teachers are very interested in kids asking questions, explaining science/math in seventeen different ways to try to make them understand numbers. I think you should talk to a teacher at a local school before assuming some type of memorization style teaching. I've always been impressed when I talked to a real human.I'm sure they would. The reality is at least one kid who want to get laughs from classmates or make a teachers life hard because they don't want to be in school or are embarrassed at their lack of math essence. Somethings got to give and it makes a teachers day and mood that much harder. I don't blame them but I don't trust my own kid to learn well in that environment.Banned books make the news, but it's not a huge thing. It's not like there's a short limited list of books allowed in schools. And there's nothing stopping you from assigning your own kid some reading of banned books if you think an important one was skipped. But there's such a long list of excellent books they'll read in school.That's a good point, but the concept of a banned book makes it hard to trust a schools leadership. What else are they trying to make child avoid? Will my child be made into an outcast for bringing the topic up in class? Wouldn't that make a teachers job harder even if they agree with the topic, they'd still but their job at risk for allowing the discussion.I feel they did a really good job of history lessons. They barely mention \\"columbus day\\", which has mostly been renamed. They talk about native americans, and how they were poorly treated. I think the complex topics (long term racism impact on suburban demographics for example) take time to teach, but they're not \\"white washing\\" everything - they're giving them age appropriate explanations of topics their brains could understand. Not something you'd be able to credibly teach a kid before middle school anyway.That is reliving to know, but the concepts of \\"America perfect\\" start way too young and are way too broad for impressionable young brains.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"There is a huge problem with over-classification in this country.

All you have to do is go to the website of March for Our Lives and see what they support:[https://marchforourlives.org/policy-plan/#access-and-prevention](https://marchforourlives.org/policy-plan/#access-and-prevention)Countless studies have revealed that the most effective way to save lives is to ensure that firearms dont fall into the hands of people who would hurt or kill themselves or others. That means common sense laws like; universal background checks to limit access; permitting requirements that ensure safe training for would-be owners; safe storage regulations to ensure children cant access firearms by accident; and banning ghost guns that circumvent legal protections. These are relatively low bars to clear that ensure safe, responsible gun ownership. Importantly, they work to prevent gun violence long before it occurspreventing deadly accidents and ensuring that folks who might harm themselves or others dont have access to lethal means.Further upstream, we are strongly in favor of strategies that address violence long before it occurs and interrupt cycles of violence that harm not only those shot by a gun but also those pulling the trigger. The decision to turn to a firearm is, in many ways, an indication that our social system is failing. We advocate solutions like community violence prevention programs that interrupt potential pathways toward violence and open new pathways toward health and wellness.Addressing access and violence interruption strategies are the most effective, data-driven policy solutions to curtail violence, and states and localities with robust programs that use upstream approachesrather than carceral solutions like flooding communities with police officerssee long-term, sustainable safety and dramatically lower rates of violence than states and localities without these solutions. We advocate for this comprehensive approach through the following solutions:I mean, seriously, how fucking hard is it to go read a web page?  You don't like these policies, then fine.  But, this org isn't talking about banning all guns, so stop claiming it is.

In that sense, hes kind of the GOP Bill Clinton.The biggest mistake Democrats (and we) have made is writing off Trump because hes stupid. Yes, Trump is a clownish buffoon, but hes a clownish buffoon who understands the American people because hes moved by what he sees as common sense rather than any higher ideology. People compare Trump to Obama, but I think its infinitely more apt to compare him to Bill Clinton.The Republicans lost the popular vote in every single Presidential election since 1988 (except for 2004, which was largely due to 9/11 boosting Bushs popularity, and even that election was extremely close). By 2016, Republicans had lost 4 of the past 6 Presidential elections, and of the two they won, one was a historically narrow election where they lost the popular vote and the other was a historically narrow election still. While the comparison is far from perfect, I dont think its that much of a leap to compare the state of the Republican Party in 2016 to the state of the Democratic Party in 1992; both were competitive in Congressional elections, but were struggling to make inroads to the White House.Then, in comes a new candidate that runs partially on not being an establishment candidate, and who completely shakes up their respective party to make them competitive again. For all intents and purposes, Trump ran a fairly optimal campaign in a similar way that Kamala did in 2024; remember that before Trump in 2016, there wasnt *that* much of an EC favorability for Republicans. Sure, Bush won in 2000 because of the EC, but both the EC and popular vote were close that year. If anything, the EC was very close to giving Kerry the win over Bush despite Kerry losing the popular vote if hed had won Ohio. Trump was able to target and create the modern EC map, which significantly favors Republicans (Trump had a narrow popular vote win and still won every swing state). Not only that, but he was able to deliver the Republican Party their first popular vote win since 2004 and 2 of their 3 trifectas since 1955. Trump basically revived the GOP as a competitive party on the Presidential level, just as Clinton did in 1992.Both Clinton and Trump achieved this by having an excellent instinct for how the American people were feeling/thinking, and being willing to make compromises with the other sides positions to be competitive. Trump, to an extent, moderated on issues in 2016 that had turned voters off to Romney in 2012 (stuff like Medicaid/Medicare, and also gay marriage to an extent) and in 2024 made public attempts to moderate on abortion. By comparing Clinton and Trumps success, I think we can note an important element: dynamicism. Trump genuinely does not give a flying fuck about politics other than boosting his power and ego, and since many of his voters feel the same way, it is a significant advantage for him because he can adopt whatever position he wants to gain crucial swing voters. The Democrats cant really do the same since their candidates, staffers, and voters are people who actually believe in things and who wont just accept any positions from their candidate. In 2024, Trump was able to focus on making in roads that expanded the partys base, while the Democrats spent the whole time desperately trying to hold the big tent together.The way forward for the Democrats is most likely to find someone who doesnt feel as constrained by the current establishment and can bend policies to meet the median voter where theyre at. But itll be harder for the Dems, since they lack the cult of personality Trump has which keeps his base in line.","title":"Maybe Democrats Didnt Do So Badly After All"},{"text":"??","title":"Crazy night at The Dakota"},{"text":"32 million each is a steal.

I think a lot of the people who were quick to accept trans people in their restroom of choice, were not anticipating anything from there- not in sport or prisons or for the medical lexicon to adjust in any way. I think many found it easier to laugh at the magas clutching their pearls about public restrooms, but when stories of *locker rooms* or  *changing rooms* being accessible started to change the focus, a lot of people reconsidered their actual stance on twaw-/tmam....I don't think that the *majority* of people believe that literally a tw is the same as any other woman? I don't think that people were anticipating anything more than a rare expectation of sharing a public space with a stranger they wouldn't interact much with anyway, as most people aren't very friendly or social in a public restroom, or using the preferred pronouns of someone who made them known... they didn't expect to be confronted with the possibility of sharing a gym locker room, for example. Or a competitive sports team. I also think that the general idea of \\"who\\" a trans woman is, was less nebulous, they pictured Blair white and Caitlin Jenner and not less passing members of the community. I also think the (honestly- only online, in my experience) campaigns of \\"some women have dicks\\" and \\"normalizing the bulge\\" were another nail in the coffin for a lot of supporters? I think the lukewarm support of 10 years ago wasn't enough to sustain any further \\"boundary pressing,\\" and pressing the boundaries anyway, led to people just revoking support or supporting under conditions , and any conditional support is pretty much met with hostility- so it's kind of just withered further. and I think not wanting to get into it, or risk being called out, or whavever, has led to a lot of really superficial support and very little dedicated support. idk. just my thoughts about it.","title":"The woman behind Capitol bathroom protest says trans people cant trust Democrats to protect them"},{"text":"But see, that would require the author reflect deeper into why their situation was so poor.

He already did pardon family during his first admin. And with Biden eyeing more blanket pardons for people on Patel's enemies list it does create an example to follow. I think the bigger issue really is the pardon power itself. Changing it is obviously very difficult, but I think relying on norms to guard against it's abuse is something we can no longer expect. Like term limits, it's time something was done to codify it's use against abuse. This is something we can point to on both sides of the aisle as examples of why it needs changed.","title":"Sanders: We can all understand Hunter Biden pardon, but worried about precedent"},{"text":"I don't know enough about Hogg to say if he is qualified but I think his participation makes it a better process.","title":"David Hogg is running for DNC vice chair"},{"text":"Correct","title":"Trump presser on now."},{"text":"Yes.

TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their visible anatomy at birth can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. The *\\"90% desist\\"* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth.According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is temporary, reversible puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will \\"desist\\" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.And transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care by every major medical authority. ---\\n**#1:*Citations on transition as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care, and the only effective treatment for gender dysphoria, as recognized by every major medical authority: Here is a resolution from the [**American Psychological Association**](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-gender-identity.pdf); *\\"THEREFORE  BE  IT  FURTHER  RESOLVED  that  APA  recognizes  the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public  and  private  insurers  to  cover  these  medically  necessary  treatments.\\"* More from the APA [**here**](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/programs/transgender/?tab=1)* Here is an [**AMA resolution**](http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf) on the efficacy and necessity of transition as appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria, and call for an end to insurance companies categorically excluding transition-related care from coverage* A policy statement from the [**American College of Physicians**](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M14-2482)* [**Here**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines* [**Here**](https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/events/alf_ncsc/Education.pdf) is a resolution from the American Academy of Family Physicians* [**Here**](https://www.socialworkers.org/assets/secured/documents/da/da2008/reffered/Transgender.pdf) is one from the National Association of Social Workers---**Condemnation of \\"Gender Identity Change Efforts\\", aka \\"conversion therapy\\", which attempt to alleviate dysphoria without transition by changing trans people's genders so they are happy and comfortable as their assigned sex at birth, as futile and destructive pseudo-scientific abuse: [**From the APA**](http://www.apa.org/about/policy/orientation-diversity.aspx).

I'd be afraid that they're taking the 3-5 highlights of homeschooling - without regards to the downsides - but weighing against their entire experience of in-class schooling. I see some internal contradictions. For instance, you're saying you'd home school for the \\"first few years\\" but also that history is whitewashed. I think it's too tough of a task to ask pre-schoolers to learn that Thomas Jefferson raped slaves, right? That's more of highschool/college topics. And the underlying issue that you never really answer is *why are schools expected to be the exclusive knowledge giver*? If certain items are especially important, then you can always supplement what your kid is exposed to. What I'm saying is I don't see the mutual exclusivity.I also see that you cite the status quo uses more screens - but how do you think that home schools give their information? Either via screens or via a parent. Which means either more screens or a parent has to lose income and dedicate their day time to instructing a child. That leads to the issue of how qualified are you to teach?I have a 17 month old - she goes to an early learning center daycare. The people that run it are amazing and have seen decades of children's worth of childhood development. They constantly teach us little tricks here and there; for instance, introducing table food to baby when she was hitting 1 year old. She's an oly child (for now) and the amount that she's been around peers is more than we could normally do. It's really helped her out and helped her confidence. Seeing peers her own size helped her realize she can walk, too, and has driven her for other mile stones.I think that benefit of peer socialization goes along way.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Im not being divisive. \\nIm didnt say its a young people problem.

Public school education took a turn in the last 15 years or so. Read the book the knowledge gap and listen to the podcasts Sold a Story and Knowledge Matters. Its moreso about the failings of teaching literacy and comprehension vs math but its fucking shocking. Heres my little summary to get you started. Weve, as a teaching society, decided that rote memorization was too boring, not important (kids can just google things). We stopped teaching little kids facts about nature, society, history, and favored teaching Skills like identifying the main point of a reading excerpt to enhance reading comprehension. Same with math, we dont teach memorizing the multiplication tables but instead teach several different strategies to figure out an answer. This was thought it would help kids be better at algebra. And what researchers have realized over this nearly 20 yr experiment is that you need foundational knowledge (rote memorization, facts) to build upon in order to use your mental energy to actually solve the hard parts of math. You gotta be quick at the easy stuff so you can focus on the hard stuff. The quick stuff is stored as a different type of memory that can be recalled quickly and allows you to use your mental resources to do the hard stuff more efficiently. For reading, comprehension, and memory, its a similar thing. Knowledge is sticky like Velcro and a new fact needs something to stick to in order to make sense and be retained and built upon. Teachers were told that facts dont matter, so they stopped teaching first graders basic stuff about the world and didnt build upon topics. And now kids cant remember anything and we blame it on social media or their parents. Sold a story is about how teachers were told that phonics didnt matter and stopped teaching it in kindergarten for the past 20-30 years. And at least 30% of kids were not taught that letters made sounds and put together form words. They memorized the shape of words instead and were taught to guess at what a word is based on the first letter and the picture above. This contributed to a lifetime of poor reading and horrible spelling because they never learned the phonics rules (yes English has a lot but its still learnable).

Biden's centrist coalition always had him outnumbered. while the progressive votes had to split, and no Bloomberg absolutely did not steal voter share from Biden like Warren had from BernieThis is just patently false. Bloomberg pulled 2.5 million primary votes. Warren 2.8 million. Half of that difference is summed up by Bloomberg not even competing in the first 4 primaries. They dropped out at the same time. Bloomberg voters were absolutely never voting for Bernie/Warren. Also Warren voters were NOT all behind Bernie. Here's some [sources](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-no-guarantee-warren-voters-will-line-up-behind-sanders/) on it but basically there were several polls when she dropped out and Bernie led 43-36 and 47-46 in two major polls in preference but you can see Warren supporters were very mixed.

He was always in a massive hole for Super Tuesday but was hoping to bully people out with strong finishes in the first two contests.

It's also very sad that political leaders on the right are unwilling to put in place basic, common-sense rules that would make our schools safer, like requiring more background checks and making it harder to get the very deadliest weapons.All that being said: do you think that your extra safe driving training will drop their odds of dying by a factor of many hundreds? Do you think that you, yourself, are *hundreds* of times safer than the average driver?Keep in mind that some people die in car accidents while driving perfectly safely, simply because the drivers around them are driving irresponsibly. Even if you could make your kids the perfect drivers, they would never be perfectly safe. That's one of the challenges of being a parent: when you release them into the world, even if you *could* control their every action, you have to accept that they might get hurt.That said, if you don't like the car example, consider: [1800 kids](https://www.alexslemonade.org/childhood-cancer/about-childhood-cancer/facts) die of cancer each year in the US, compared to (as I mentioned) 6 kids dying in school shootings.

When Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama in 2012, his defeat was blamed, in part, on his hard-line stance in favor of self-deportationmaking life so hard for immigrants that they would choose to return to their home country. Obama had backed a more popular approach, which balanced strong enforcement at the border and the workplace with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and an expansion of legal immigration. That policy, called comprehensive immigration reform, was supported by the immigrant-advocacy movement and by 77 percent of the public.In the elections aftermath, leading conservatives  announced their support for reform. A bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight was approved by a resounding 68C32. In the end, however, the bill was never taken up by House Republicans. Obama pivoted to a series of executive actions to shield some 5 million of the nations 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation, but Republican state attorneys general sued to stop the largest from going forward. The pro-immigrant movement began to splinter; advocates, frustrated with the failure of a coalition that had included unions, business, law enforcement, and churches, moved swiftly left.Much has changed since then. This year, Donald Trump ran on the border issue to victory. He blamed housing costs, wage pressures, and crime on a migrant invasion; branded Democrats the party of open borders; and promised extreme deportation measures. Voters didnt care that it was Republicans who had tanked another border bill early in 2024, or that, after executive actions on border security, crossings this fall were down from the end of Trumps presidency. Few noticed when Harris gave a major policy speech promising more action at the border. According to a postelection Navigator poll, Trumps promise to secure the border and fight illegal immigration was the top reason to vote for him. Even among voters of color, opposition to immigration drove support for Trump. The GOP had successfully tattooed the Biden border crisis on Kamala Harriss forehead.How did Democrats fall so far and so quickly on immigration? Its easy to blame Trump, and the lure of his xenophobic rhetoric. But we believe that immigration has become a losing issue for Democrats over the past decade because elected leaders have followed progressive advocates to the left, beyond the political space available to them. Voters, feeling unheard and frustrated, may have squirmed at Trumps racism and radicalism, but they also saw him as someone who took the problem seriously and was trying to address it.One of us, Cecilia, spent two decades at the National Council of La Raza, Americas biggest Latino advocacy group, and later advised Obama on immigration issues as head of his White House Domestic Policy Council. The other, Frank, ran pro-immigrant organizations for more than three decades, and advised the Harris campaign on immigration. This is a heartfelt critique, informed by our decades of experience as immigrant advocates who also understand the realities of governing. Unless something changes, Republicans will continue exploiting the situation at the border, more immigrants will suffer, and Democrats will continue to lose the trust of votersdamaging their chances of unseating the authoritarians now returning to power.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/VXzsnsSg](https://theatln.tc/VXzsnsSg)","title":"How Democrats Lost Their Way on Immigration"},{"text":"Notre dame de?","title":"Trump presser on now."},{"text":"Im assuming it was just some doomer post?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"See it's funny that I'm getting downvoteded but I'm on your side.

I.e. rethinking how or if you wish to do homeschool. As for IT, they could make it impossible to game but I admit they don't. I will say though, attempting to game is limited due to the monitoring i.e. watching every kids screen simultaneously using a program as well as the punishments and rewards in place for doing what they're supposed to do. My district uses classdojo to punish and reward kids depending on behavior. If kids do x minutes of ST math they get xyz and if they don't do what they're supposed to then they \\"get a red point\\" which means they lose a point. These points are tied to various rewards depending on class. In my school at least, kids fooling around is not much of an issue. Plus many homeschoolers do not have the same programs to allow for proper monitoring and they may end up using it in a way that negatively impacts social and emotional development. I.e. parents who track kids phones often cause their kids to develop trust issues and inadvertently encourage them to be sneaky and break the rules.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Unless its a progressive member of their caucus or a challenger in a primary, then they become seal team 6.","title":"Biden, Harris Urge Major Democratic Donors To Stay Engaged After Tough Loss To Trump"},{"text":"He also owns and shoots guns so hes not anti-gun hes just anti lets give crazy unstable people carte blance access to guns.","title":"National anti-violence activist David Hogg launches bid for DNC leadership"},{"text":"Youre going to hear a lot about socialization, but if youre in a relatively well-populated area, that actually shouldnt be an issue. Co-ops and classes abound, plenty of them are secular, and not to mention, there are lots of poorly socialized public school kids. They just dont have an easy scapegoat to explain it.Personally, as Im starting a homeschooling journey for my own daughter (also with the goal of eventually rejoining a school setting), I think the real questions are about parental means and abilities. As in, these were the things we had to take a hard look at in ourselves:* Can you live comfortably on one income? Have you put together a full budget for supplies, activities, etc., and confirmed that you can afford all elements without undue hardship on your family?\\n* Do you have the executive function to keep to your children to some form of a daily schedule and ensure learning occurs each day?\\n* Do you have the patience to be with your kids essentially 24/7? Especially at the early ages, you will be *with them* all the time. All the time.\\n* Do you have the stamina and capacity to spend hours researching curricula, specialist classes (i.e., P.E., art, music supplements), state standards, standardized testing procedures, compliance, and ways to go above and beyond for your childrens education, while also having the energy to implement these ideas on, again, a daily basis? \\n* Do you have the humility and self-awareness to seek out expert help to fill gaps in either your knowledge and/or your childrens knowledge as they come up?\\n* Are you a steady and consistent person who can help your child through both hard and sometimes boring things without either of you losing your cool or giving up?\\n* Are you a flexible person who can see if/when something isnt working, and adjust accordingly?\\n* Assuming you have a spouse, do the two of you have really strong communication and a joint commitment to devoting a major portion of your daily lives (monetary, emotional, physical) to your childrens education?If the answer to any of these is no or even Im not sure, then I would not recommend homeschooling.(Obviously this is assuming you do eventually want them back in a traditional classroom and youre not interested in philosophies like unschooling, which is a different discussion altogether.)(ETA: I also want to note that while I am new to homeschooling, my husband was homeschooled from 1st-9th grade and these questions are based on his experience along with our copious research. He is what most would consider a homeschool success storyvery successful in his work, multiple higher ed degrees from well-known/impressive schools, super sociable and charming guyso we know firsthand how well it can go.

Most folks are fine with gay marriage, but if you took a secret poll of those people and asked them how they would truly react if their kid came out to them, there'd be a pretty significant percentage of people who would react negatively.So when you campaign on the economy and taxes and social services and you win, then you also get the chance to pass these other laws that align with your values.

I'll start by focusing on the idea that kids aren't safe in schools.A question for you: when your kid is 16, will you allow them to drive a car?The average American has a roughly [1% lifetime risk](https://meyersinjurylaw.com/blog/what-are-the-odds-of-dying-in-a-car-crash/) of dying in a car accident. I think it's fair to say that this makes driving a car a risky activity - if you do it regularly, you could die, and many people do! However, we still drive cars, for a variety of reasons. Partly, we drive because we can control our risk to a certain extent. For example, if you avoid excessive speeding, always use your turn signal, never engage in road rage, never drink &amp; drive, avoid driving when you're exhausted, etc. etc., you can reduce your risk significantly below 1%.Partly, though, this comes down to the fact that a tiny chance of dying in a car accident over your entire life is an acceptable risk.Now, what do you think the odds of dying in a school shooting are? Keep in mind that kids spend much more time in school than they spend driving - 7+ hours per day, every day. The answer: average, about [6 kids per year](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/a01/violent-deaths-and-shootings) die in school shootings. By comparison, [3 kids die per day](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/813456) in car accidents. In other words, your kids are *hundreds* of times more likely to die in a car accident than they are in a school shooting.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Just keep giving us money while we do nothing.","title":"Biden, Harris Urge Major Democratic Donors To Stay Engaged After Tough Loss To Trump"},{"text":"Im confused where you are getting your ideas about math in school.

While school violence is in the news a lot, percentage wise kids are extremely safe at schools. The commute to school (or the grocery store) is far more dangerous than being in a school.2. Schools occasionally use software on tablets or computers. For example, my grade school daughter has used a computer to type stories, and they used a math program to learn some math concepts. I think learning to type, and in limited situations using tablets for learning is just fine. It's not like they're zoned out watching YouTube.3. I haven't seen / heard any \\"I said so\\" learning. As far as I can tell, teachers are very interested in kids asking questions, explaining science/math in seventeen different ways to try to make them understand numbers. I think you should talk to a teacher at a local school before assuming some type of memorization style teaching. I've always been impressed when I talked to a real human.4. Kids do spend far too much time sitting. I think for young kids they do a great job of getting them out of their seats, walking around the classroom, recess - but it's still a confined space. In my mind one of the best reasons to home school is if you intend to get your kid to be active.5. Banned books make the news, but it's not a huge thing. It's not like there's a short limited list of books allowed in schools. And there's nothing stopping you from assigning your own kid some reading of banned books if you think an important one was skipped. But there's such a long list of excellent books they'll read in school.6. I feel they did a really good job of history lessons. They barely mention \\"columbus day\\", which has mostly been renamed. They talk about native americans, and how they were poorly treated. I think the complex topics (long term racism impact on suburban demographics for example) take time to teach, but they're not \\"white washing\\" everything - they're giving them age appropriate explanations of topics their brains could understand. Not something you'd be able to credibly teach a kid before middle school anyway.There are absolutely great reasons to home school kids, but I think most of yours are overblown by the media, and don't necessarily represent a real school experience.Reasons I think you could homeschool:1) Schools go at set paces. If your kid is extra bright, it can be boring as heck to wait for the rest of the classroom to catch up if they could learn much faster.2) Movement. As you said, they're stuck in a classroom. If you were a great homeschooling parent, you'd hopefully hike with them, travel the world, etc. Because that'd be a great differentiator.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"They take over my local library three afternoons a week, and I do NOT live in a terribly crunchy area.?","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"so after they burn all the bridges with dems how are you going to protect them?","title":"The woman behind Capitol bathroom protest says trans people cant trust Democrats to protect them"},{"text":"Was that socialization outside of yours or another adults view?

America seems to be ok with children laying their lives on the line for the right to bear arms.Yes, there is a risk here. But you have to consider how high that risk is (the chances are incredibly low, and we overestimate the risk because the violence is so spectacular). It's like how most people don't realize driving is the most dangerous activity you do, and get nervous on planes when planes are orders of magnitude safer. ALSO C?balance this against some of the social risks of home schooling (ex. not having friends, shared experiences, dealing with groups of other kids)Too much screen time. I'm not anti technology but I think it should be introduced to kids in bits and pieces, while being warned of how addicting it is. I'm told schools give kids tablets to work on their in class work. This strikes me as bizarre, unsafe and unhealthy.Tablets at school are EDUCATIONAL. They aren't letting kids watch coco melon for 8 hours. The real risk of screen time is at home, not at school. If your kid is a toddler, it isn't a huge deal and you're overblowing the risk.Math and science being poorly taught. Math and science in the US don't seem to be taught as tools for problem solving. Both seem to be lectured to kids in a \\"because I said so\\" fashion with rote memorization in being seen as a key. I loved the concept of \\"new math\\" and I was alarmed to see how much push-back it got from educators. I also refer to my point about screen time and think more math should be taught as mental math and/or done by pencil and paper. Calculators are valuable tools, but it's important to know how and why they work.Are you a math or science teacher? If so C are you going to be able to teach your kid better than a teacher trained to teach math or science? Your criticism is valid, but what's the alternative, and is it realistic to think you can do it better, just because you can critique it? I agree rote memorization sucks, but when you're between kindergarten and third grade, you are learning basics (ex. memorizing basic arithmetic) not constructing proofs.School kids spend entirely too much time sitting still paying attention. Recess is being slashed in schools. Requiring kids to spend 8 hours per day focused on obeyed adults and listening to lecture is a recipe for disaster. How about more hands on classes? How about requiring more short periods of time walking just to take a walk and be alone with their thoughts? Adults are taught this is healthy why can't we teach kids to do it?Are there specific schools you will send your kid to, and do they have recess? I also strongly would ask yourself C?can you give 8 hours of quality education to your kid, or are you going to be \\"giving them a break\\" and they'll end up with half the education of a kid their same age? I get school can be glorified daycare, but consider the alternative.Banned books is a ridiculous concept. I know that most educators agree with me on this but come the hell on.Is this happening in local schools around you? If so, take up the problem with them and read the books with your kid out of school.History is terribly whitewashed. America has a problem with putting its historical figures on pedestals. The founding fathers didn't build this country by themselves. They had enslaved people running their households or made loads of money buying and selling enslaved people. Thomas Jefferson raped a teenager repeatedly, he isn't a demigod because he signed the constitution. Do kids know why the cities and suburbs have such different demographics? Do they know the ramifications of Black people not being allowed to purchase homes or take advantage of the GI Bill? Do they know what year woman could finally have financial independence without a husbands signature?Show me a single elementary school that teaches about the GI bill or slavery, or alternative histories. Kids basically can't understand history at this age beyond wide strokes.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"I feel like this is just a ploy to blame disasters on Dems, and kneecap any potential actions he could take along the way by refusing funding.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"Its not about the schools or being monitored.   \\nIts about interaction with their peers.   \\nSome are nice, some are assholes, some get away with stuff, some dont, just like real life.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Public school is an absolutely inferior context for development of social skills.

Warren was much much more popular with the base than Bloomberg was, it's not even close. Biden was dead &amp; buried before this maneuver and there's no world in which he didn't drop out first if things were allowed to play out naturally according to the whims of the voters. He wasn't fundraising as well, he wasn't polling as well, he had 0 momentum... Biden was dead &amp; buried before Super Tuesday.  On the eve of Super Tuesday, the shift in the 2020 race was in full force. Money gushed in: $10 million in 48 hours. The Biden campaign enjoyed a windfall of support from members of Congress, influential African American leaders and elected officials across pivotal states. It was capped by the rapid withdrawal of two other moderate top-tier contenders in the race  Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They, along with a third former 2020 candidate, Beto ORourke, swiftly turned to back Biden. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and ORourke joined Biden at a Dallas rally Monday evening.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/02/centrists-biden-super-tuesday-bloomberg-118853Sounds a lot like the establishment decided \\"this is our guy\\" and backed him with full force to beat Bernie vs. letting the voters decide who the better man is.

Somebody far to Pelosi's left needs to primary her.","title":"National anti-violence activist David Hogg launches bid for DNC leadership"},{"text":"From Semafor's Max Tani:Soon after Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty turned his attention to sports.The campaign needed to introduce Harris quickly to people who arent obsessed with politics. Sports is perhaps Americas last remaining monoculture, and Flaherty and the Harris team decided to book her on sports shows and podcasts.But one by one, the biggest personalities and shows politely turned them down.Sports and culture have sort of merged together, and as sports and culture became more publicly and sort of natively associated with this Trump-conservative set of values, it got more complicated for athletes to come out in favor of us, Flaherty, 33, told me in an interview last week. It got more complicated for sports personalities to take us on their shows because they didnt want to do politics.Thats not to say Steph Curry and Steve Kerr and LeBron [James] and all them coming out wasnt impactful or important, he said. It was more impactful because it had gotten so much harder. But certainly the culture that has been associated with heavy sports-watching has become associated with right-wing culture in a way that makes it harder for us to reach people.Faherty declined to say who turned Harris down, but she didnt appear on key shows hosted by sports figures sympathetic to Democrats, like Colin Cowherd, Bill Simmons, or the Kelce brothers. (As Semafor first reported at the time, Harris did appear on All The Smoke, a popular but more niche basketball podcast, and NFL hall-of-famer Shannon Sharpes Club Shay Shay podcast.)The campaigns failure to completely crack the sports sphere was, to Flaherty, ominous, and part of a larger trend in which some influencers who had felt comfortable engaging with the Biden White House, demurred when asked to help Harris make her case to their followers.

Downballot candidates were pretty successful in many places, and we were only an estimated 7,309 votes from taking the House across multiple races. We did well in state races.Still, some ideas raised to center party focus on the working- and lower-class have been raised by people like Chris Murphy and Pat Ryan (the latter of whom outperformed Harris by double digits), and still hold enough weight to be true. Others, like Kristen McDonald Rivet (outperformed Harris by 9%), see it mostly on a partisan scale rather than an economic one, saying her new constituents don't like either party. Whether any direction is the right one to take, the big conclusion is that Democrats did nowhere near as terribly as it seemed the first morning after.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"It's not deleted though?

Telling the public would probably defeat the whole purpose. They want to see how the public reacts. Americans predictably lost their minds .","title":"Trump presser on now."},{"text":"Biden, Obama and the deep state have a plan here and its fairly simple and obvious. They have let a dirty bo*b into the country and are pretending to try to find it with these drones but will tell us that after the fact and of course it gives them an excuse for not disclosing the drones for fear of mass panic. But it also gives them something fall back on as appearing to try to stop it. I believe this is the best theory out there rn and is probably true. Theyre using those drones to pretend search for it Im outside of Philly and if you were to do something like that the tri state areas would be the place to do it, massive concentrated population, Wall Street and financial institutions its even close to DC. Im afraid and I rarely fear this kind of thing but its very close to me and my family and in the wrong hands we would be talking about a disaster far greater than anything the world has ever seen. I also do not doubt that Biden/obama would allow this to happen as an election contingency plan. Those two took American politics and the gov from one of the most balanced and moral in the world to a complete joke thats corruption and willingness to do evil puts us in competition with African countries and North Korea. With the crimes against humanity they have to cover up along with the largest and most blatant money laundering scheme in history to the covid vaccine thats finally starting to be uncovered they desperately need to do something this extreme to avoid spending their life in jail. \\nWhen the pentagon lost all those billions of dollars a plane just happened to strike the exact place (on 9/11) that had the records on the missing money. Oh and prob just a coincidence but they insisted that they had no backups and never stored this info anywhere else. Sounds reasonable, you know they prob didnt want to spend all that money making a backup of those files, I bet they were just trying to save the tax payers money- thats usually their priority right?? Bottom line, killing 3,000 people that day to get us into a war and cover up the pentagons 6B fraud (who knows how bad that was) was the trade off bush and Cheney felt was worth it to pump up themselves and their buddies in the industrial military complex while protecting themselves and their buddies with the 6B. Now diff with Obama and Biden, here we are talking about two guys that have even less morality and are far more motivated bc they are backed into a corner with serious risk of being destroyed by any one of many many things they did. Maybe its related to diddy, or covid or Ukraine, assassination attempt, more likely its a combination of a lot of things they know could be uncovered from the last 4 years- this was when they went full out, nothing to lose bc Biden wasnt planning to run in 2024 originally so he and Obama saw it as possibly the last time they would be able to exert their power to shape the world. Then by the time Biden changed his mind he was mentally inept and Obama was the one holding the power, giving him the ability to do anything through the empty vessel of Biden bc obama would never have to explain it or be accountable for it as he wasnt in politics at the time. So they held nothing back with the boarder, giving trillions to be laundered tho other countries, fully and openly used every gov agency to go after political opposition/christian/white people, even trying to kill political opponents. The list goes on guys, if you think they were going peacefully I think you could be very wrong. Also, why did every billionaire build a bunker in the past 5-10 years? If I had the money I would take myself and my family away from the east coast until a month or two after Trump has been in office, assuming he even gets that far. Best guess on how this goes down - while Biden and Obama are far away from the east coast this nuke that was very easy to get here with a conveniently and unprecedented open boarder, goes off and Trump just happens to be in the vicinity, maybe playing golf in bedminster by chance. Biden calls a state of emergency of course, gives himself temporary unilateral power as the King of America, blames the disaster on a scapegoat country with a gov we wanted to overthrow already. Says Americans wont be safe until this is resolved so he must stay in power as a transition give the enemy an advantage would put too many lives at Risk.  Trump isnt alive to fight about it anyway and that makes it much easier to justify. Then it goes as you would expect from there, the end of freedom, we will still have the illusion of democracy but the elections will be pre determined by Obama and the deep state. There by they keep the power they need to keep their crimes covered up and nothing of significance will stand in the way of the new world order which will be shaped in whatever way the deep state and Obama wants. I would say this is more probable than the alternative of them letting Trump take power bc once he gets a couple people in these agencies on other crimes they will start divulging info little by little to save themselves and things wont stay covered up. They were too grand, too brash and large to be hidden without holding absolute power over every gov agency - btw very convenient that those two are the only presidents I can remember who filled the cia fbi doj fema and every other gov agency with extremist who are willing to do anything asked of them no matter how immoral as it can be justified and rationalized as for the greater good and preventing Hitler from destroying democracy lol. And this need for control of all levels of all government institutions is why DEI was created! COULDNT DREAM OF A BETTER WAY TO  MAKE SURE THOSE IN POWER ARE LEFTIST!? Use billions of dollars of our money to openly discriminate against whites, Christians and conservatives. Very clever way to get left leaning people into every gov position from top to bottom and even were able to use esg and DEI in the private sector. Anyone who could see how wrong it was or realize it was completely against the constitution/BOR was harassed into quitting with biased unfair performance reviews which then are used to determine raises/promotions, with bad reviews and no promotion opportunities the white male sat back and watched their co workers get unending praise and promotions for doing the same job but slightly worse. If that didnt get the white conservative to quit they turned to mandatory white hate training that was used to humiliate and destroy their self worth but more importantly to show them how powerless they were to stop it while removing any hope. Telling people that youre bad and should feel shame for how you were born and if you fight that good luck bc we have all the money and all the power to make sure you get this message and properly settle into your new role as second class citizens. You wont advance and you white men need to understand that this what you deserve, what your children deserve. Make them believe they should be apologizing for their privileges and their horrible history, make them apologize for all the benefits they have in a society that gives them every disadvantage possible what better way to complete a mission than that, this will truly be studied by historians and its insane to witness it.
