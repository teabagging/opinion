If your decisions have no impact on anyone but yourself, then by all means exercise the freedom to hurt yourself all you want. However, once your decisions can harm others, part of living in a society is coming to an agreement on what is good behavior. In the case of vaccinations, children, elderly, and immune compromised people often rely on herd immunity which means your vaccination protects them by making it less likely they will come in contact with the disease. In addition, being vaccinated lowers the overall burden to provide emergency medical services which has a financial and opportunity cost to the society as well.  People can debate where the line should be on social obligations in these situations but to be so dismissive and ignorant about how vaccines and medicines work in a social setting is unacceptable.Edit: Also wanted to add because troll is talking about abortion. We as a society previously agreed that once a fetus can survive on its own and is no harm to the mother, that every effort should be made to preserve its life. A fetus that cannot survive on its own or may kill the mother is obviously very different from a scientifically proven safe disease prevention.","title":"RFK Jr. says he wont take away anybodys vaccines after Trump win"},{"text":"Because he prefers Fuhrer.","title":"Special Counsel Jack Smith taking steps to wind down federal cases against Trump"},{"text":"Arrange a nice little office for him in Rykers.","title":"Justice Department weighs how to drop charges against President-elect Donald Trump"},{"text":"The product of a non-sensical word derived by interactions with an algorithm displaying suggested content: \\"stop the things that I don't like, which are different than the things other people so none of us can define it\\"","title":"People are tired of wokery.

The penalties for the conviction range from four years in prison to house arrest or a fine.However, the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, is considering the possibility of dismissing the case and has given himself a deadline of Nov 12 to make a decision.If Mr Merchan were to press ahead with the case, Trumps lawyers have indicated they would seek a delay.Sentencing a president-elect ahead of Inauguration Day would be unprecedented in US history, and legal experts believe a delay would be swiftly granted pending an appeal.Meanwhile, officials at the US Department of Justice (DoJ) spent Wednesday reviewing how to wind down the two federal cases against Trump.They have been spearheaded by Jack Smith, the independent special counsel who has been doggedly pursuing Trump through the courts for the last two years.Sources within the DoJ said the cases would be shuttered because of the departments long-standing policy against prosecuting a sitting president.Trump had already threatened to fire Mr Smith if he regained the White House, telling a radio host last month he would sack the special counsel within two seconds of being sworn in as the 47th US president.One of the cases was brought by Mr Smith in Washington and centred on Trumps alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat.The second was filed in southern Florida over the former presidents alleged retention of classified documents after leaving office.Both had faced significant delays after Trump appealed to the US Supreme Court, which partly agreed with his claim that he had enjoyed broad immunity while president.As president, Trump will have less control over the New York hush money case or an election interference case in Georgia, given both are brought by state prosecutors.But his legal team has already said they will argue that a president should not face the burden of criminal prosecution while in office.His lawyers and legal analysts are confident that his return to the White House makes it unlikely he will face legal consequences in either case during his term in office.The case could still proceed against the other co-defendants, who include Trumps former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.Trump had pleaded not guilty to all charges and cast the prosecutions as politically motivated.The American people have heard these Democrat prosecutors cases against President Trump and theyre still going to elect him anyway, said Mike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project, a conservative legal advocacy group.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-legal-woes-vanish-us-election/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-legal-woes-vanish-us-election/)","title":"Donald Trump's legal woes to vanish following US election"},{"text":"Well, she loves giving them.

Whether is was her own stupidity or play it safe strategy to not answer questions well, people saw her as a weak and indecisive flip-flopper with no vision.  She sounded like nails on a chalkboard -- much worse than Trump -- and that's saying something.  Her stupidity and lack of leadership skills were on full display in everything from her awful speaking skills stating she couldn't see what she would do differently from Biden on The View, to choosing a totally wrong VP from a state that was in the bag already. She looked like an unprepared candidate at a job interview who went out drinking and dancing the night before.\\n-* Kamala was installed, not chosen against a field of other BETTER candidates. The obsession with a woman of color over the best candidate for the job was forced -- literally a DEI/Identity Politics failure.  Thank the Obama's and Pelosi influence.  There should have been an open convention.  When running against Biden and Sanders, Kamala had ZERO delegates and had to drop out.  Let that sink in.  A better candidate could have won this for Democrats.  Identity politics has got to stop.\\n-* The power of podcasts was completely underestimated.  Democrats were, as usual, obsessed with their friends in Legacy Media (which no longer carries weight with the public in a post-cord-cutting era) and visa/versa. Oprah is no longer credible with anyone but her daily viewers.  She looked ridiculous stating, \\"We may never be able to vote again!\\" How dumb!  We are already seeing a paranoid attack against conservative YouTubers and podcasters being attacked and sent legal letters by Media Matters, as of last week.  \\n-\\n*  Minority voters broke for Trump more that ever this time.  Again, a failure of Identity Politics. I am curious to see what the Muslim vote was like in Michigan. Democrats let in so many immigrants expecting they would all vote Democrat for life, but they are now learning that Muslims and Catholic Hispanics don't agree with LGBTQIA-XYZ topics and wars.

And that's a problem, because while he may be able to convince the average US racist that anyone with brown skin is \\"Mexican\\", Mexico isn't going to accept millions of people unless the US can prove they're actually Mexican citizens and actually go through the process.So in practice this mass deportation effort is just going to be a mass incarceration project...and we already use prison slave labor to do all kinds of things. So it's a natural progression to force immigrants in indefinite detainment to do it as well. Hell, he'll probably offer to lease their labor back to the company that was originally employing them -- companies who currently hire undocumented immigrants can simply hand them over and turn them into slaves.So move manufacturing into the country, and hand it over to domestic slaves rather than foreign ones.It's intra-national colonialism.","title":"Heres what Trump is proposing for the economy"},{"text":"They're about to join the school of hard knocks.

Congressional offices track the number of constituents who call about specific issues, and these numbers can influence decision-making. Speaking to staff directly, especially by phone, can make your concerns heard.\\n \\nAttend Town Halls and Public Meetings: Many representatives hold town halls or public forums where constituents can ask questions and express their views. Attending these events, whether in-person or virtually, allows you to address concerns directly with lawmakers.\\n \\n    Organize or Participate in Protests and Rallies: Protests and rallies draw attention to issues and signal widespread concern. When organized locally or nationally, they can lead to media coverage, which puts public pressure on Congress to respond.\\n \\n    Write Letters to the Editor or Op-Eds: Publishing letters or op-eds in local newspapers helps reach a broader audience and can highlight public sentiment on an issue. Lawmakers and their staff often monitor local media for constituent feedback.\\n \\n    Engage on Social Media: Tagging representatives on social media platforms (like Twitter or Facebook) with concise messages about specific legislation or policies can amplify your voice, especially if it catches public attention or goes viral.\\n \\n    Join Advocacy Groups: Many organizations lobby Congress on behalf of their members, from environmental groups to civil rights organizations. By joining these groups, you contribute to larger lobbying efforts with experienced professionals advocating on your behalf.\\n \\n    Organize or Sign Petitions: Petitions can demonstrate widespread support or opposition. Submitting a well-supported petition with many signatures to a Congressional office can sometimes move the needle on a given issue.\\n \\n    Meet with Congressional Staff: Scheduling meetings with the staff members of your representatives allows you to present issues in detail. Staff members relay constituent concerns and can provide insight into where the representative stands.\\n \\n    Donate to Candidates or Political Action Committees (PACs): Donations to campaigns, PACs, or Super PACs can give you influence indirectly by supporting candidates who align with your interests or by helping fund issue-specific campaigns.\\n \\n    Stay Informed and Educate Others: Knowledge is power. Being informed on issues and educating your community encourages more active participation, which collectively increases the pressure on Congress.\\n \\n Taking these actions consistently, especially with local representatives, can make a substantial impact over time.","title":"Trump says he wants to be a dictator on day one.

I disagree at a fundamental level with his assertion regarding the editing, but even if it were true, he obviously isn't unbiased in this application of the law.This is an issue with all media, gotta start somewhere. Fox News also didn't do the same with the Brett Baier interview so of course the most immediate example is going to be the face of the criticism. By the way, i honestly think legacy media is going to burn soon. This election proved podcasts to be much more effective (the trump rogan episode alone basically amounted to multiple days of legacy media viewership) i think we should just do away with the mainstream media (not through force but through societal change) independent journalists and media tends to be a lot more truthful. you're \\"so?\\" regarding banning journalistic access. It was done in order to punish opposing views, not journalistic integrity.This i would need to look at on a case to case basis. I can see why trump would not want say, CNN who said he refused to condemn neo nazis around 40 times despite it being completely untrue, continuing to go to press conferences and derail the conference with absurd repeat questions. I bet we can both agree answering the same question a thousand times is not productive and is annoying. At a certain point we need to evaluate the real why and not the apparent why. These are 2 very different things. banning content that features gay people simply existing is a direct attack on my existence.As a woman i highly recommend you actually go buy these books and read them. Put simply, you cannot read them in school board meetings (people have legitimately been removed from meetings), they cannot be read on live TV, and they cannot be read on YouTube without complete demonetization and your video getting marked as mature content. There is no ban on books with just gay people in it. These books are heavily explicit (such as explaining in deep detail how to give a blow job, with illustrations) these are sitting in jr high and elementary school libraries. At a certain point we have to draw the line on that. These book bans are not because of gay stuff or gender ideology (there's that mainstream media bias i referred to earlier) they only use that because it scares gay people into thinking people are after them. In reality it's the sexually explicit nature that's the problem. Because they are gay orientated they hyperfixate on that to scare people. It's annoying and i wish people would stop falling for it. I'm not religious but here's my view. If gender ideology is allowed then religion should be as well. We either ban both or allow both. Both are ideologies.","title":"States Abortion Rights Wins May Be Short-Lived Under a Second Trump Term"},{"text":"The climate change part is truly terrifying given how close we are to the edge","title":"Harris set to speak at Howard University following Trump's win"},{"text":"Anyone can buy stock.Try telling that to someone who is already living paycheck to paycheckThe more correct phrasing is: Anyone, *with the money,* can buy stock.","title":"Here's what President-elect Trump's tariff plan may mean for your wallet"},{"text":"Joe still playing by the old rules not noticing that box has been thrown out.","title":"Biden congratulates Trump in phone call, invites him to meeting at White House"},{"text":"Well maybe it is telling that the same people whining about the culture changing are the same people who haven't held this kind of scum accountable unless they are across the aisle.

David was supposedly a Knight of Malta. Kissinger more than anyone survived so many political shakeups and war crimes. Kissinger was also an intelligence operative during WW2. Perhaps Henry, and his Rockefeller bosses, were actually working for European nobility and/or the Rothschilds. David Rockefeller was close friends with Gianni Agnelli. They gave us the Club of Rome. Agnellis mother was Italian nobility. Averell Harriman (Skull &amp; Bones) was involved with that crew as well.Then theres plenty of Skull &amp; Bones cronies mixed in throughout the years. George H.W. Bush and Winston Lord were both Skull &amp; Bones members. Those two worked with Kissinger regarding China relations. Nixon was in that mix. Nixons political boss was Nazi financier and Bonesman Prescott Bush.Ive always wondered what these secret societies, fraternities, and clubs these people have in common. I think its fraternities in some cases.Col. Edward M. House was not in Skull &amp; Bones but was in Alpha Delta Phi and close to the Bones people. House attended Cornell. Cornells first president was Skull &amp; Bones member Andrew Dickson White.  Johns Hopkins first president was Bonesman Daniel Coit Gilman.* At Yale University, it was mostly brothers of Alpha Delta Phi who were invited to join the universitys top-ranked senior society Skull and Bones.\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Delta_PhiAntony Sutton writes:Houses novel, Philip Dru, was written in New Haven, Connecticut and in those days House was closer to the Taft segment of The Order than Woodrow Wilson.

House was also something of a joker because part of the story of The Order is encoded within Philip Dru!Wonder if Kissinger knew about the Skull &amp; Bones crew.

First generation Latinos are marginalized based on accent and language which is why they loved Obama. Latinos (and Asians, and all other non-black groups) who were born and raised here aren't really marginalized in any meaningful capacity. I don't think voting red is a fundamental betrayal of their social interests like it is when black people vote red. Every non-black racial group has the privilege to ignore race as a topic when deciding who to vote for. Every non-black racial groups voting patterns is pretty much the same. Basically 50-50. Maybe 60-40. Even Arabs have that privilege. Trump won Dearborn, Michigan which is the largest Arab-majority city in America.

Thats another thing. Sure star studded endorsements are cool and all, but just as in 2016, the rich and famous tried to tell people who they should vote for. And it still did nothing just like 2016. Im guessing at this point having a ton of celebrity endorsements is a big negative. We had the swifties, we had sooo many celeb endorsements. And still nothing.

You're someone I could actually speak with, and I hear your points. I take three issues with your rebuttals: \\n1) fox news is notoriously misleading, and have openly admitted so, yet he doesn't hold both feet to the fire. I disagree at a fundamental level with his assertion regarding the editing, but even if it were true, he obviously isn't unbiased in this application of the law. \\n2) your \\"so?\\" regarding banning journalistic access. It was done in order to punish opposing views, not journalistic integrity. I appreciate you believe there should be a safeguard, but that implies you understand the harm. I'd be more convinced if you admitted that it was problematic. This is why people on my side have such a hard time crossing lines - why can't you just say \\"I don't agree with that\\" instead of dismissing it?  It's like you see the harm, but you give a pass if it benefits your side. \\n3) the book banning is in tangent with forced Bible study and posting of biblical statements.  Also, while some of the books are inappropriate, some aren't.  There needs to be a clear line of what is and isn't acceptable content. Pornography is easily definable.  A book featuring two dads is innocuous. I'm not a fan of gender ideology so you won't find me fighting that. But banning content that features gay people simply existing is a direct attack on my existence. There's a difference between teaching about a lifestyle and acknowledging certain types of people and families exist. There's nuance there to be discussed but before we start making bans there needs to be definitions on the subjected content.","title":"States Abortion Rights Wins May Be Short-Lived Under a Second Trump Term"},{"text":"Peep the stock market and tell me again trump wont be good for the economy.","title":"Britain braces for a Trump tariff war"},{"text":"But after saying all this you just realize the democratic side has its own agenda as well that does not align with the best interests of the people.","title":"Trump wins the presidential election.

It was 831 billion in spending, but included multiple years of ACA subsidies, which I'm still waiting on Trump's replacement for the ACA from back in 2016.  Meanwhile the PPP program was 953 billion and had almost no oversight, and we now know it was largely used fraudulently. Trump was president for PPP. Is he to blame? It was passed by both houses with bipartisan support. Between PPP, the covid stimulus checks, and extra unemployment payouts, mixed with reduced cost of living from staying home, left a lot of people with extra disposable income. Businesses pounced on the chance to raise prices, increasing profit margins, which we are able to clearly see on their earnings reports. Complicated problem, but blaming the inflation reduction act is not accurate. You can argue it failed to slow it, but inflation was not limited to the US. No single US law caused what we saw. So trump still doesn't have the answer to healthcare 8 years later, but we are to trust him to come up with an answer to price gauging? Going to be a no from me.","title":"Trump wins Pennsylvania, securing the biggest battleground state"},{"text":"This is going to be unpopular, but Ukraine has been losing the war for months now, continuing support is just going to drag on the war and lead to more deaths.

I made this comment earlier which Ill copy and paste below but social media and bullshit information has done a fucking number on people.Reddit is just a small piece of this in the end.  Tons of people arent on Reddit.  They get their information off of either the news and/or social media.  The latter is misinforming the living fuck out of people and its having a ripple effect impacting all kinds of shit, not even just politics.  The news does this too, the extent depends on which news sources they watch specifically.Back to the topic of social media and people being terribly misinformed, (this is all anecdotal btw) I know some people in high up government positions who are seeing colleagues who should know better consuming all kinds of bullshit.  My friends have told me theyre greatly concerned about the future of this country if this continues and it will.  The level of stupid shit some of our own officials are consuming is wild.Ive been to physical therapy off and on throughout my life and so Ive gotten kinda close with some PTs.  In recent years Ive heard crazy stories from therapists regarding growing amounts of people with health issues who think theyre going to cure their problems with supplements or some other nonsense.  Some instances were people with conditions like diabetes where they eventually put themselves in dangerous situations or even got themselves killed!  My PTs were saying that while people have shown this behavior before, they have never seen it get this bad until recent years.And then theres people working in schools dealing with kids who are spewing nonsense as fact consuming tik toks or whatever it is they watch.  Theres stories like this everywhere and its only getting worse.  Ive heard it from friends who are working in the education system, and theres tons of discussions about this online.This problem is pretty fucking massive and the trolls and those who wish to push this BS are outnumbering those who arent for this.  And I imagine theres a lot of people like myself who gave up on social media platforms like Facebook which probably helped feed into the problem in the end as the number of bullshitters stays strong while those would try to oppose them have dwindled cause theyve given up.","title":"Tim Walz loses home county to Trump"},{"text":"I believe this was the plan all along","title":"Tim Walz loses home county to Trump"},{"text":"So sad that this is the state in our country, no?

Traditionally the money class would fund the messenger - PACs, ECCs, 501c, buy media, etc. Some would be willing to discuss their views but always did so with caution and civility.

We saw the richest man in the word jump on stage and hand out check to people who registered to vote while talking about crashing the economy so that he could benefit. We saw billionaires openly discuss why they refused to let once independant news orgs endorse candidates. We saw billionaires openly discuss how they paid the way for candidates so that they could benefit from their acsent (theil/vance).

They no longer need to hide behind an astroturf advocy group or hedge their bets, they can openly discuss what they want and why without shame or repurcussion.This will only get worse.

This isn't 2016 where things were more or less stable both internally and externally. Right now besides the Russian war and the Middle East war we've got at least 6 other potential flash points and I'm not at all convinced Trump is capable of handling them to prevent further conflict.Then you've got an economic crisis in the US brewing largely from over financialization and excessive monopolization within the US economy which will like lead to a financial and economic crisis. Again not at all convinced Trump can handle that.Then you've got China which is building out a massive capacity of EVs and the RoRo ships needed to export them with a potential of nearly 15 million exports by 26 and as much as 50 million exports by 2030. This stands a very good chance to bankrupt the US automotive sector by 2028 and the US petroleum sector by 2032.Onto that you've got a global aging population that is only getting worse. Each year it adds further inflationary pressure onto the US. Again not at all convinced Trump has a plan to address this in the short medium term and if there plan for the long term was force women to give birth by abolishing abortion then the long term is likely shot for shit.Then you've got a brewing national debt crisis that from what Trump is describing is going to be geared up to 11. Not sure how long that will last but I'd wager not through another 4 years of Trumps term.Of course you've got a growing trade conflict around the world with Trump seeming like he doesn't fucking understands any of this and based on his own plan will likely notch that up a few degrees maybe even to a smoot-Hawley 2.0 period. For those to stupid to understand the reference that's basic a rerun of the 1930s.Of course Trump thinks he's going to undo the US move towards cleaner fuel source this is likely to end up making the US looking like the West Virginia of the world. To stupid to recognize a fundamental shift in global fuel sources ending up a backwater shit hole as the world passes us by.Then of course the whole anti immigration stance which is likely to chase away global talent and destroy our advantage when it comes to technology with China.I could go on but if Trump does what he claims he's gonna do then I suspect we will have an economic crisis, social crisis, political crisis, constitutional crisis and a geopolitical crisis within next 4 years.

Dems got complacent with relying on Urban areas to outvote rural counties.

Sadly Obama didn't have to go up against such a partisan government and people.  He had moderates like McCain and Romney that made up the Republican side and compromises could be made.  Today's government is so partisan that Obama wouldn't even be able to win and compromises are a thing of the past. In order for Dems to win back rural communities, simple direct talk will work best. Give direct examples of \\"capping this will reduce egg and milk prices to this. doing this will do this to you.\\" Dems focused too much on talking about how their plans affect the rich and corporations (while campaigning in urban areas) and not enough about it affects you this exact way out in \\"Bumrush, Kentucky.\\" They need to do what Pete Buttigieg did and sit across from them and talk directly to them.  Large crowds and podiums with the same speech won't get the job done.  Get dirty, go to small town halls and talk directly to them.  Get the VP doing the same in other places.  Start in states she should have won like PA, MI, WI. Maybe have policies that not only phase out coal, but bring the new forms of energy to those exact towns if possible.  So many small rural communities only have that type of industry keeping it alive.  So maybe replace the coal mines with a solar farm, or a wind farm, or if they are near rivers, hydro power.  Bring in some people who can really run it, and then give those people the ability to learn and replace that life.  Dems almost need to start back at square one.  They need Millennial and Gen Z votes (and start work on Alpha), Boomers are who they are and won't change, Gen X won't change and you won't find a person to really run from that generation.

Taft's conservatism angered Roosevelt, so he challenged Taft for the party nomination at the 1912 Republican National Convention. When Taft and his conservative allies narrowly prevailed, Roosevelt rallied his progressive supporters and launched a third-party bid. The Republican split enabled Wilson to win 40 states and a landslide victory in the electoral college with just 41.8% of the popular vote, the lowest vote share for a victorious presidential candidate since 1860.Or the [1860 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Democratic_National_Conventions): The Democratic convention reconvened in Baltimore on June 18, but many Southern delegates were either excluded from the convention or refused to participate. The convention adopted a platform in which it pledged to abide by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upon questions of Constitutional Law regarding slavery.[1] Douglas was ultimately nominated for president on the second ballot (the 59th ballot overall)[...] The Southern Democrats who had boycotted, or walked out of, the Baltimore convention held their own separate convention and adopted a pro-slavery platform, and nominated incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge for president, with Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon as vice president[...] James M. McPherson suggested in Battle Cry of Freedom that the Fire-eater program of breaking up the convention and running a rival ticket was deliberately intended to bring about the election of a Republican as president, and thus trigger secession declarations by the slave-owning states. Whatever the intent of the fire-eaters may have been, doubtless many of them favored secession, and the logical, probable, and actual consequence of their actions was to fragment the Democratic party and thereby virtually ensure a Republican victory.[6]When historians argue that members of a party may have intentionally split it in order to help the other side win, it's pretty clear that modern-day Democrats probably shouldn't support it, given our current political system.","title":"Should Democrats explore a message that the country needs more political parties?"},{"text":"Yes, but he also attempted zero by way of nuance.

Thats a great quote","title":"Tim Walz loses home county to Trump"},{"text":"I think there is some merit in the general perspective you're discussing. I think it's a byproduct of increasingly polarizing politics and it's not just limited to progressive spheres of influence. There is a growing trend among both progressives and conservatives of \\"here are our talking points and if you challenge them, you're the bad guy.\\" This is, in turn, a product of 21st century sensationalized journalism and click bait gotcha headlines. I think the lines between genuine artistic expression and rage bait are sometimes blurred, and hell maybe it's possible to be both. I don't envy the teachers and administrators at these schools who have to balance making the school feel like a welcoming place for all of their students against encouraging the creativity and expression of other students. It's a process that usually has no right answers. What I would caution people against is taking isolated incidents that are reported and highlighted in order to generate web traffic and then extrapolating it to the greater whole. Seeing one art show shut down by one school, or even 100 by 100 schools, is hardly representative of \\"progressive institutions\\" as a whole. There are over 5000 universities in the United States, most of which could at least arguably be called \\"progressive institutions\\".I think the *biggest* problem in politics and political discourse today is that we tend to identify the \\"side\\" that agrees most closely with our views by looking at ourselves and those close to us, and then look at the \\"side\\" we disagree with and characterize them by looking at the most extreme example that the media propaganda machines can find to slap a headline on. Most conservatives aren't represented by the Westborough Baptist Church, Project 2025, or the Confederate flag-waving extremists often shown on liberal media channels. Most liberals aren't represented by Antifa, eco-terrorists, or the overly cautious university staff who sometimes make bad calls and end up as headlines on conservative media.The fewer generalizations we make about the \\"other guys\\" based on sensationalized stories cherry picked from across the country, the closer we can get to bringing the country back together. The people in power want us fighting each other so we won't notice how badly they're fucking us.Edit: randomly perfect example of the counter point:https://www.reddit.com/r/NotHowGirlsWork/s/aPcRxaXrGJThis is hardly evidence of universities endorsing radical conservative ideology.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"It does but dont republican use that to their advantage?

The proper thing would have been to have biden step down a year ahead of time. And then have proper primaries when the ppl got to pick the democratic nominee way ahead of time. That didn't happen. They took the people's choice away and forced a candidate who wasn't liked and had no chance of winning.

There would be no leadership change at the RNC to supercharge our GOTV and election integrity efforts, and our nominee would have most likely been Mike Pence, the most milquetoast politician to ever live. Sure, Republican opinions of him wouldn't have soured because there would be no J6 in this timeline. But if Trump wins in 2020, we almost certainly take a beating in 2024 and revert back to the old Romney-era neocon Republican party and never win an election again for the foreseeable future.Losing in 2020 and then taking back the white house in 2024 gave Trump a clean slate to get better people into his administration and choose a VP who's more likely to carry the torch to a 2028 win.
