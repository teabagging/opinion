They don't understand how anything works or why things of incredible value are important.That's exactly how they did it. It doesn't matter if they have a garden of terrible policy ideas that are universally hated because they trick people with racist jokes. Why bother to have policies that people actually want when they can just trick people with BS? I hope people don't think the next election is going to be more honest, because it's definitely not going to be. They have proven time and time again that absolutely nothing matters, because they can just trick people with lies. Any problem they have as a political party, they just fix it by lying about it and then it works.Bad policy ideas? Doesn't matter lies fix that. Bad political candidates? Doesn't matter because their opponent is a minority. Economic conditions look bad for them? People can't remember what was going on 4 years ago, so lying about that is super easy.And it works, over and over again. People just fall for it over and over again.

They don't even understand the process to find information like that.","title":"Hamas reacts to Trump victory, says he must 'work seriously to stop the war' in Gaza"},{"text":"The elite will get their shots.

It is a complete failure of the Democratic Party leadership to realize the political reality of the 21st century.The right has a a decades-long plan in place. It started with gerrymandering Texas and then a resolute plan to take over state legislatures and do the same in as many states as possible.From there the plan was to take control of the House and Senate, eventually the White House, and finally the Supreme Court. They engaged with fundamentalist Christians as a means of accumulating voters and reaching them in ways media cannot.And they've been successful at every turn. Not every election, but they have consciously addressed missteps and come back stronger.Democrats are still practicing politics like it's the 1960s: find a candidate, run a campaign and hope to win. They have no cohesive, long term agenda like the right does. Until they consciously address this with a full plan, we can expect more nights like last night.  \\nHow about this: first establish a set of political goals for the next 10 years: Solid public education with food. Publicly funded heath care for all. Raise the minimum wage and once and for all index it to inflation. A reasonable plan to reduce military spending with fiscal responsibility. National standards to prevent price and rent gouging. Control corporate influence and support unionization. Eliminate the possibility of government shutdowns because the Rs hold funding hostage until they get their way. A tax code that makes sense and doesn't require paying TurboTax or an accountant to do as an individual. And FFS go to the midwest and TALK TO THE PEOPLE THERE, ESPECIALLY THE FARMERS. They are very smart, honest people who will tell you what they need if you just freaking listen to them instead of calling them the \\"fly over states\\".At the same time start solidifying states where we already win before we lose them: CA, OR, WA, NY, CO, NM and the east coast states. Have a permanent plan to retain those states no matter what by controlling their state legislatures. I'm not saying gerrymandering is the answer, **but appealing to voters with good policies that improve their lives so they stay loyal IS**. Then do what the Rs have been doing since Gingrich was in charge: have a set plan move to other states and support local candidates to swing the state legislatures to the Democrats. Using religion like the Rs do is appalling, but setting up good schools with free lunches, and setting up states with publicly-funded health care IS a way to sway voters and find out which programs will work on a national level. And MAKE THE SUCCESSES VERY PUBLIC.All politics is local, and we better start acting like it is. Stop hoping to win and make a plan to win over time.

I've read a few articles though that have made the claim that Biden hasn't cut any of Trump's tariffs out, which isn't true. His administration hasn't cut all of them out by any stretch, but I've not found anything that goes into the detailing reasons why some are still on the books.Not all tariffs are bad, IF you have a secondary market to import from or have the existing infrastructure in place to manufacture at the same cost (and when it comes to some markets, we can't compete cost-wise, it's as simple as that). A lot of the retaliatory tariffs China imposed on us were on goods that they could easily out-compete us on but we're still importing from us for higher as a good trade gesture. We don't have a lot of those secondary markets to import from that come even close to being as cheap as China (we might in the next 15-20 years as several African nations might be close to being competitive with China due to China's middle class growth and higher wages equating to higher costs). So whether we manufacture at home or find another market to import from, we're going to be paying more and exporting less.That's the problem with economic protectionism these days, it doesn't work as well as it used to with more even markets (pre WW1 days it was swell policy). It limits and discourages trade, which limits economic growth for both trade partners. 2015 economists were projecting massive gdp growths for the next several years, instead we got somewhat sluggish growth that was over two points under projections, mostly attributed to the tariff shenanigans. Trying to 'balance the trade deficit' is just outright idiotic. There's plenty of reason why having a trade deficit is a good thing (and a few reasons why it might be bad; \\\\[Edit\\\\] and sometimes it's both good and bad). A lot of our trade deficit is made up with foreign investment (to the point of surplus if weighed against), and that's not a bad thing either. It means that investors in other countries now have a stake in whether our country does well. Like any investor, they want a good return on their investment, so it's in their best financial interest to see us perform well economically. So, we're not 'losing money' on the import export scale if we weigh in incoming money vs outgoing money. I'm no expert though, and anything in this could very well be unintentionally wrong. Fuck this went on too long. I apologize for that, but hope it helped at least a little.","title":"Trump projected White House win sends Dow futures up 1,000 points"},{"text":"Just wait til Kamala 25ths Joe and becomes the 47th first.","title":"The AP has declared Trump the 47th President"},{"text":"I think machismo and racism had a hand in this.","title":"Hispanic men helped propel Donald Trump back to the White House"},{"text":"Nope.

Fatality doesn't equate to higher incidence. So even if it is actually more deadly than COVID, that doesn't mean it will be a more widespread problem. Also, keep in mind that the primary challenges of COVID was that the disease was novel, meaning that we had literally no idea what to expect from it, and had no real protocols for containing it. The six feet thing was just made up because it sounded reasonable, for instance, not due to any objective metric. At least not at the start. Then there was a problem with how infective it was. It spread quickly and overwhelmed healthcare capacity. That was what truly made COVID awful. A combination of uncertainty for treatment, prevention, fear as to mortality, and the novel and infectious nature of the disease is why COVID was so bad. I don't know that these will all hold true for bird flu, which we have a routine scare for.

The 12th Amendment leaves the door open. When you consider SCOTUS already determined that the office of the President isn't \\"an officer of the United States\\" during Colorado's bid to remove Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment: Section 3.\\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.So, if the office of the President isn't an \\"officer of the United States\\", and the Constitution doesn't say the public has the right to vote for the president, what stops them from just having Electors put Trump in office until he dies? The 12th Amendment doesn't say anything about popular vote elections, at the federal or state levels: The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;\\n ...and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.The 22nd doesn't say anything about popular vote by the people either:Twenty-Second Amendment\\nSection 1No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.We believe all these things about our country because it's always been that way, but these authoritarians don't care about any of that. How many norms did Trump and his cabinet ignore during his first term? How many \\"settled law\\" cases has SCOTUS ignored in the past 5 years?These people are dangerous, they have the power at all levels now, and nothing will stop them from trying to make sure they never lose that power again.

For example, immigration. It became apparent that people wanted illegal immigration under control. So even Harris started adopting some of Trump's rhetoric. But since the election just happened, my mind is in election analytics mode. Theres clearly some different camps within even the Republican party now. Theres more \\"establishment\\" Republicans that may lean towards not voting Trump even. These politicians include people like Jeb Bush, Nikki Haley, and McConnell. Suburban voters of bigger cities tend to favor these types and as a result, during these elections, Trump's numbers dropped there compared to say Bush's. Theres a constituionalist minded conservative side. These include people like Cruz, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and DeSantis. This group is easier to get to vote with Trump's crowd. Theres even a libertarian esque camp with the Paul's, and honestly Vivek reminded me a bit of it. They are also a bit easier to go with Trump's crowd.Then obviously theres the newfound MAGA crowd. Excluding the classic Republicans/conservatives who will pretty much vote for whoever is the Republicans nominee. MAGA had a new bunch that has completely turned Ohio red, and put usually blue swing states completely into play and even going his way. This is states like PA, MI, and even WI. He grabs blue collar workers like no tomorrow. He's turned the image of the Republican party from a fiscal conservative for the rich party, into a working class party. Lots of union members who always go blue have went red. Rural areas have always been more Republican, but theres been some rural counties that had blue history, and now they've gone for Trump the last few elections. He's grabbed more African American votes, more Hispanic votes. I haven't seen numbers on this one, but it sounded like more Muslim votes too. Groups that don't traditionally vote Republican have more with him. We'll see if this stays this way, and if the republican party will continue down this MAGA road. Vance seems popular, and if they stick with him after, they may keep this group. If they go with someone thats not a MAGA esque candidate, im curious to see if some of the never trump suburban voters will come back, and if we lose some of the new Republican voters.","title":"What's your take on Trump's impact on American politics?"},{"text":"I agree.

Trump has unprecedented minority- and young-men support--probably due to the lack of success of young men in this country. The thing that everyone was saying this whole election about how women turn out to vote in higher numbers than men has been true. But that's because a lot of women empowered themselves when they didn't feel like they were getting their fair share by voting. It seems men are starting to do the same. This is my main takeaway from this election.That said, I think it's hard to say a white man would have lost too. I think if a man on the dem ticket was virile (not Biden) and persuasive enough (not Biden), they probably could have convinced some young men that Trump was bad for them.I think Kamala is a prosecutor and a damn good one. She excels in situations like the debate. But she's not great with conversations that don't have conflict where she's just giving her elevator pitch about what benefits people. I think she's too honest to speak in platitudes like that. So when Trump ran away from more debates with her, her town halls were rough and her speeches were nothing special--and she kept repeating her same points in all of them so the excitement around her dissipated pretty fast.Someone probably could have made the case as to why their lives would get better under them and worse under Trump.

They don't know how to drive a point home to let everyone know that he was the reason for it.  They should have been repeating all the time we are fighting the inflation that is a result from the Trump Administration's actions and then just continue to label the exact actions that caused it. The shity thing though is that full economic impact of decisions they make takes three to five years to affect the general public usually so he's going to ride out the coat tails of the good stuff that Biden did do, take credit for it, and brag about it the way the Democrats should have. Entire investigations should have been opened by the Democrats for the price of groceries going up 20 and 30% when inflation was only around 9.1 at peak. The general public needed to see that they cared more instead of just offering words and hope. They did do a lot but most of it was quiet in the background bureaucracy.I am ashamed of my fellow countrymen and not paying enough attention to know what kind of a threat Donald Trump that he himself says he is, to have not just voted for her no matter how they felt about her but yeah I do agree that the Democrats definitely could have done more over the last 4 years to actually motivate people also.","title":"We know now why we lost: the Democratic Elite picked our candidate instead of letting the Democratic Rank and File pick them in the primaries."},{"text":"Nope.

If you don't remember how, let me drop a name and see if knocks any rust off the old thinker for y'all:  \\n*Anita Sarkeesian*  \\nI know some of you probably just had a visceral reaction to seeing that name again, and for good reason: that woman is the perfect encapsulation of the mistakes Progressives made back in the early 2000s that created the support among men aged 20-40 that has been the core of Trump and Trump supporters winning elections since 2016.She encapsulates the cultural fuck-up that allowed people like Rogan, Tate, Trump etc. to gain so much traction and support among young men because she, and the Progressive moment she was a part of, was when this *entire cohort* of men was either in high school or early college - AKA the time when their core political identities and ideas were being formed. And they were introduced to a political world that attacked them, called them pigs, toxic and women-haters and worse for liking something like *Dead or Alive* or preferring conventionally attractive women or just enjoying typically masculine activities. I know I'm being a bit reductionist when saying it, but to them it basically felt like \\"*I said I'm a boobs man and suddenly I've got this angry lady in class/on Youtube is now saying I'm terrible awful woman-hater*\\".Then the mistake was doubled down on when it came to men's issues, because this is when the three words that define men's experience with issues as far as others view them is concerned really became the universal experience:* Deny\\n* Minimize\\n* InfantilizeIt basically left this group of men wide open to being picked up by the Manosphere and attaching themselves to people like Trump, even across ethnic, racial and class differences. And hey, guess who has kept giving Trump and Trump-lites the boost they need to win?*Cough*  \\nAnd as much as people want to blame racism for part of the loss too, I think the creator of the *Boondocks* has a more likely explanation: it's not that people were inherently so evil or racist. They were in fact mostly neutral in modern times, and minorities - especially African Americans - had been trading in a sort of \\"Moral Credit\\" for the suffering they had gone through before that the general public was willing to be understanding and cooperative of them so long as they had it. But it's been so long, and the general public got tired of watching the AA community play the fool, self-sabotage and generally be it's own worst enemy (which is part of why he created the *Boondocks* \\\\- to mock all this nonsense he experienced) while constantly spending that moral credit to cover it up that the general public didn't become *racist* as in \\"Wear a White Hood and Lynch Someone\\" as they became *apathetic* and stopped caring because from the outside in it looks to them like less of an institutional problem and more of a self-sabotage problem. The influencers then exploited this apathy to great effect, or even used to turn them to real racism.","title":"Daily Discussion Hub for November 6, 2024"},{"text":"I left the sarcasm switch ff lol      he was a clownshow from the start  and cost her PA","title":"Trump Wins Pennsylvania, Key Battleground State"},{"text":"Literally every post here right now would be about how Kamala won the popular vote and the electoral college robbed her.

Inflation means that prices go up but never down. If they went down, wed have *deflation*, which is usually a symptom of a severe economic downturn like a depression. The fact that people dont understand this is a failure of our nations education system. Inflation increased following COVID, on a global scale and due in part to how fast the global economy rebounded and supply issues. They were able to bring it under control without causing an actual recession, which is remarkable.And as for the housing, the housing crisis has existed longer than the last four years. The fed controls interest rates to manage both inflation and the strength of the economy. They *had* to raise rates or else inflation would get worse. If anything, they were slow to raise them and then slow again to cut them. Worthy criticism, but again, nothing to do with Biden or Kamala Harris.It really is frustrating and frightening how people dont understand any of these basic economic concepts. They just see rents and groceries go up, and blame the president in power as if theyve got a price goes down button.

Secondly, Trump managed to do appeal to day to day life struggles of everyone with his \\"Look at the inflation\\" strategy. This might get me downvoted, but people struggling to keep a roof over their heads and food on their table don't give a fk about pronouns and identity politics, which somehow had become the central topics for the Harris camp. Also, the lax illegal immigrants policy resulted in fear mongering where regular people where concerned about sharing their resources with illegals in an already fked up economy.

In 2016 - the DNC worked to screw Bernie behind the scenes. We ended up with Clinton, who's overconfidence cost her the election. In 2020 - despite Bernie winning a fair number of delegates, the DNC again works behind the scenes to force the others to drop out. Obama himself calls Bernie to drop out and hand it to Biden. Biden barely manages to squeak past a win, in the middle of a deeply unpopular presidency, a global pandemic, and national unrest. In 2024 - the DNC and Biden administration gaslight the public that Biden's health hasn't declined, despite all of the available evidence. Once they can't hide it anymore (but after the time to hold the primaries), the party elites rally to force him out and replace him with Kamala.

They have a shit ton of money. Use it to flood the media zone with new left-wing podcasts. People are easily impressionable. Theres a reason why people think the economy is terrible even though indicators are pretty normal. Its because the information theyre hearing from their daily media consumption is characterizing the economy poorly. Work at it.- Speaking of the economy, it remains king in the American electoral system. Democrats need to  adjust to the gamethe game being balancing inflation and unemployment. Prices affect 100% of the population, whereas unemployment affects no more than 5-10% at a time in even the worst circumstances. And thats not to mention that people see prices as largely out of their control whereas jobs are more likely to be seen as within their control.

Men and women have different parts to play in reproduction. If a woman remained consistently drunk throughout her part of reproduction, would you say she wasnt responsible when a baby was ultimately born and that she had no obligations toward it if the father had full custody? In consensual acts, men should ALWAYS be wearing a condom, even if their partner also uses contraception. They should also ALWAYS pull out, even with a condom on and ensure they are the ones to provide it. If theyre not protecting themselves, thats, again, on them because their part of reproduction ends at ejaculation.Rape is, of course, completely different and I absolutely agree that rape victims should be able to completely absolve themselves of any obligation OR be allowed full custody with child support from the rapist and she have no contact with the child. All laws regarding rape, for both men and women, are disgustingly poor.No they dont. They have the choice of whether to remain pregnant or not. The thing that happens BEFORE parenting.

Kamala's campaign had very clear blind spots when it came to demographics she needed to win on Election night. So much of her campaign focused on how terrible Trump was/is, combined with the usual anti price-gouging and \\"he'll cut taxes for rich people, I'll cut taxes for **you**\\" palaver. Trump's campaign tried as hard as they could to tie Harris to the Biden administration to take advantage of anti-incumbency sentiment. **That** is the message the Harris campaign needed to repudiate, and you can't sit there and tell me with a straight face that they did a good job in that department.Was she correct about Trump being awful? Yes. Did she hammer it effectively? Yes. But in the end, was she telling people what they already knew? Also yes. The campaign focused on giving people reasons not to vote for Trump, and less on giving people reasons to vote for her. That doesn't work with an electorate easily swayed by populism. The theory for why Harris should focus on bread-and-butter issues instead of Trumps autocratic ambitions is simple: Nine years after Trump launched his first presidential campaign, voters already know what they think about him. And if undecided voters still arent convinced that Trump is an authoritarian menace, they probably cant be persuaded on that point. After all, Trump-curious voters remember Democrats issuing apocalyptic warnings in 2016, yet did not personally suffer nor witness any political repression during his time in office. To the contrary, they tend to recall life under Trump as utterly normal  at least, before the worldwide pandemic for which, in their view, he had little responsibility. They simply arent interested in debates over Trumps character  what they care about are the elections implications for their own finances.","title":"This election wasnt lost because of your least favorite interest group"},{"text":"My favorite part is he won the popular vote, so they don't have that talking point any longer.And, based on the 17 States and DC that have signed up for the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), if that were in effect they would all have to give their electors to Trump, giving him 517.It isn't in effect, but since he did win the popular vote AND that is what this is all about, surely those 17 States &amp; DC are all going to fully accept his election as legitimate, right?

They either came in on legal immigrant visas or, in Puerto Rico's case, were always US citizens. Furthermore, the Hispanic peoples in the US are now deeply rooted and have been in the US multiple generations. Many who are US-born don't even speak Spanish. They simply don't see themselves as connected to refugees and illegal immigrants, who now mostly come from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Just because these countries are also majority Spanish-speaking doesn't make them the same. They are of different ethnicities. Remember that many refugees are Indigenous people who don't even always speak Spanish.So some US citizen Hispanics react to them the same way white British people did to white Eastern European immigrants a decade ago - with revulsion, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to keep them out. They are US citizens and don't think deportation will happen to them - and tbf, it probably won't.The fact that opposition to immigration nationwide is driven largely by white hostility to more Hispanic and Asian faces in the country doesn't matter. There are plenty of Hispanic men who are willing to identify as white for this reason - just as many immigrants in the UK and their descendants voted for Brexit. You don't have to be white to be racist.

NATO this summer announced it was establishing a special mission, known as the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which would be headquartered in Germany. Its creation essentially means that from now on it will be NATO itself, rather than its biggest contributor the United States, that will coordinate training Ukrainian troops and providing military equipment.  The Group of 7 C which unites the United States, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan C finalised a $50 billion long-term loan to Ukraine that would be funded largely by the interest on frozen Russian assets in Europe.   Outgoing US President Joe Biden has backed up his European allies by pre-empting the potential risk of a US withdrawal from the deal should Trump be re-elected by making sure the $20 billion US contribution will start becoming available by the end of the year. Congress has approved five bills on Ukraine assistance since the start of the war worth $175 billion, with $106 billion going directly to the government of Ukraine. At a news conference in Riga in mid-October, James OBrien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Biden will be emptying out the funds the US Congress has earmarked for Ukraine before the end of his term. \\n Although it is not possible for a US president to unilaterally pull the country out of NATO C Congress last year passed a law that such a decision needs Senate approval C Trumps threat still remains very real as he calls the Alliance's golden rule on mutual defence into question.TL;DR NATO and the Biden Administration have been formulating a contingency plan that empties out current US funding for Ukraine, while transitioning responsibilities to European powers, who are funding it with frozen Russian assets.","title":"Trumps victory could mean US withdraws support for Ukraine in war with Russia"},{"text":"Oh, sorry.
