We could absolutely go back to before that when it was cheap. A populist campaign could easily run on cutting defense spending, literally tens of billions of which just goes into the pockets of private contractors who don't actually sell anything to the military or create anything of value. It's a black hole of money that lots of people would love to see cut, but won't happen because liberals and right-wing populists are too tied to our current economic system and get donations from wealthy Private contractors. Different types of schools are not a solution to the increasing costs of college. They train you for completely different things, and increasing access to college not only leads to a more educated workforce down the line, but a workforce more capable of building personal and generational wealth, and enough people in the workforce to support something like a universal health care system, which is a left-wing populist policy. But if barely anyone can afford to get educated to be a doctor, we won't have enough doctors for that. Obviously just for giving student loans as things are and getting rid of them would make things more expensive for everyone else, but that's just like saying Obamacare is bad because it made insurance premiums rise for everyone with health insurance. You're missing the forest for the trees, the problem with this system isn't the public spending, which is good for everybody, it's the greed of private entities that want to create artificial barriers to entry for poor people. Student loan forgiveness is a step in the right direction to making college cheaper. Any major economic change has a period of tumult where things will probably get more expensive and rougher for people for several years, but sometimes that's necessary in order to make things better after that. I'm in favor of left-wing populism, it seems like the only type of populism you're aware of is the right-wing populism we've seen over the last decade or so. Left-wing populist policies helped to pull the United States out of the greatest economic depression in modern world history. We can absolutely do that again, but it's going to take some serious changes to the way we run our system.","title":"CMV: Jon Stewart will be a Ronald Reagan for the Democrats in 2028."},{"text":"Old school progressives too.","title":"President Biden Should Issue a Blanket Pardon of Undocumented Immigrants: Protecting Trumps enemies from prosecution just reinforces the idea of politics as retribution.

I don't know if this was controlled for; if future studies to this effect are done, it would be a variable to consider.

For Canada, the most pressing issue was the potential tariffs on Canadian goods. A source told The Hill Times that one of Trumps team members suggested tariffs as a means to balance the U.S. budget, with potential exemptions negotiated later on a country-by-country basis.They [Tariffs] make a lot of money, Trump told NBCs Meet the Press on Dec. 8. Ill go a step further: tariffs are going to make our country rich. Tariffs are going to help us pay off $35 trillion in debt.Although the flow of fentanyl and undocumented workers from Canada to the U.S. is negligible compared to Mexico, Canada is taking concrete steps to address Trumps concerns. The government is expected to make official announcements in the coming weeks. Trudeau assured Trump that Canada plans to enhance border security by purchasing helicopters, surveillance drones, and hiring additional officers. The total cost of these measures is expected to be more than $1-billion, according to the government source. Trudeau emphasized in the meeting with Trump that Canadas border is safe, and it was unfair to equate Canada with Mexico on these issues. Despite Canadas efforts, it remains uncertain whether the U.S. will impose tariffs.Given the significance of the Canada-U.S. trade relationship, this will be a key factor in Trudeaus upcoming cabinet shuffle, now expected to occur this month or next, according to Liberal sources. The shuffle has been long overdue. Since September, two cabinet ministers have resigned and their portfolios have been temporarily assigned to other ministers without new appointments. In the last two months, five cabinet ministers have announced they will not run in the next federal election.[...]Political insiders speculate that at least one other cabinet member may also announce in the coming months that they will not run again. Typically, such announcements are co-ordinated with the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). While Rodriguez made his intentions known in September, the other four formally announced their decisions in mid-October, though these plans were anticipated for weeks or months prior. Boissonnault stepped down last month.Meanwhile, Trudeau re-established the Cabinet Committee on Canada-U.S. Relations only a few days after Trumps election. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland (University-Rosedale, Ont.) chairs the committee, and LeBlanc is the vice-chair. In Trumps first term, Freeland was the top Canadian officialthen-foreign ministerto renegotiate NAFTA.Other committee members include Anand, Defence Minister Bill Blair (Scarborough Southwest, Ont.), Industry Minister Fran?ois-Philippe Champagne (Saint-Maurice-Champlain, Que.), Foreign Affairs Minister Mlanie Joly (Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Que.), Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay (Cardigan, P.E.I.), Immigration Minister Marc Miller (Ville-Marie-Le Sud-Ouest-?le-des-Soeurs, Que.), and International Trade Minister Mary Ng (Markham-Thornhill, Ont.).The Privy Council Office told The Hill Times last month that there is no formal Canada-U.S. relations committee at either the deputy minister or assistant deputy minister level. However, senior government officials regularly meet to discuss various topics, including Canada-U.S. relations. The PCO also mentioned that a director-generals committee, established in 2022, continues to bring together multiple departments across the government to co-ordinate and discuss their efforts on Canada-U.S. relations.Even though Freeland is the chair of the Canada-U.S. Relations Cabinet Committee, she did not accompany Prime Minister Trudeau to his Nov. 29 meeting with Trump. This has led MPs and political insiders to speculate that LeBlanc may take on a more prominent role as the lead minister in managing Canada-U.S. relations during the president-elects second term. The speculation is based in the perception that Trumps new team is more combative than in his first term, and LeBlanc may be seen as better suited to handle such dynamics.During a media availability last week, Freeland declined to explain her absence, suggesting that reporters direct the question to the prime minister. However, she stated that her absence was the right decision as the meeting primarily focused on border issues.[...]In the last round of NAFTA negotiations during Trumps first term, the U.S. side was critical of Freeland, describing her as a difficult negotiator. In 2022, Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner took shots at Freeland in his book Breaking History, accusing her of deliberately stalling negotiations and refusing to commit to any substantive changes. In response, the deputy prime minister described Trumps negotiation tactics as similar to a bully.When youre threatened by a bully the answer is not to cave in, she said in November 2022 in answering questions about Kushners comments about her in the book. The answer is to be united, and to stand strong.Wayne Easter, former Liberal MP and chair of the Canada-U.S. relations interparliamentary committee, said that it would have been better if Freeland had gone with Trudeau to the meeting. He said that both the deputy prime minister and LeBlanc will prove to be an asset in dealing with the new Trump administration.Theres some in the Trump circle [who] would like Dominics ways to do things, and then theres some that would like Chrystias way of doing things, said Easter. So to have both there would would have been ideal, in my view. But Dominics kind of a fixture, a fixer in the cabinet. And it makes sense in terms of his portfolio  because the border is certainly going to be the big issue.Meanwhile, Trumps threatened tariffs are expected to significantly raise the price of goods in the United States, but the government source said that the incoming administration does not appear to be concerned about it.An estimated $900-billion of goods and services are exchanged between Canada and the U.S. each year. A July report from the Congressional Research Service revealed that 78 per cent of Canadas exports were sent to the U.S. in 2023. The report also noted that, as of 2022, the U.S. was the largest source of foreign direct investment in Canada, totalling $438.8-billion, while Canada ranked as the fourth-largest source of such investment in the U.S. at $589.3-billion.When Trump took office in 2016, he prompted the renegotiation of NAFTA, which was later renamed CUSMA. With the agreement set for renewal in 2026, significant changes could have major implications for thousands of jobs in both countries.Meanwhile, at this weeks meeting, the cabinet committee is expected to discuss Canadas plans in case Trump goes ahead with tariffs. The committee will also discuss plans to address concerns of the incoming Trump administration and how to prevent fentanyl and other illegal substances from entering Canada and then crossing into the U.S. The Canada-U.S. Cabinet Committee meets every Monday and is expected to meet even through holidays.Further readings:https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-canada-fentanyl-organized-crime-1.7404130https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-tariffs-threat-canada-interview-1.7404846https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/12/09/trudeau-now-tied-with-conservative-leader-on-whos-trusted-to-deal-with-trump/https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-falling-so-consistently-short-on-defence-spending-has-hurt-standing-on-world-stage-but-improving-u-s-ambassador-1.7137270https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/memo-sent-to-justin-trudeau-warns-that-americas-massive-debt-and-deficit-could-cause-problems/article_a4138c2a-b40f-11ef-88ec-4ff358ffdb11.html!ping Can","title":"To address Trumps border concerns, feds expected to spend more than $1-billion: senior government source"},{"text":"Ukraine/Russia (+NK), Israel, Syria all feel like powder kegs atm.

Even in the most authoritarian of countries, there is an opposition; there is a human spirit that just cannot be suppressed forever.Republicans are going to over-read their mandate. Say what you will about the federal bureaucracy, but their attempts to strike terror in everyday employees of the civil service are heartless, and reform should not involve dumping tens of thousands of people into unemployment all at once. People don't want deregulation if that means giving even more power to the petty tyrants in their lives: the boss, some distant for-profit-health-insurance bean counter getting between you and your doctor, people colluding to extract more and more rent from working families.After Trump's second term, there may be no return to the *status quo ante*. People aren't going to sign up for civil-service jobs if they know their job will be in jeopardy four years later if another Republican is elected who wants to take a wrecking ball to the federal government again. Institutional knowledge will be dispersed.Democrats have valiantly defended our nation's institutions, imperfect as they may be. They worked hard to empower workers and take on concentrated corporate power. Unfortunately, our very system of checks and balances makes it hard to deliver quick, drastic relief as misery and precarity worked their way up socio-economic strata. But if these norms and institutions have already been torn down, something different would come next.Our society has come out of balance. Ayn Rand offers the rich and powerful seductive conceit: nihilism and mirror Marxism. All of us stand on the shoulders of giants; we all depend on the hard work of those who came before and those around us; none of us emerged, perfect and fully formed, like Athena from Zeus. Ingenuity and hard work should be rewarded, but everyone needs to be able to live with dignity and a basic sense of security in their lives.Look to Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt. They relished the fight, and that's what we're going to need: people who are willing to break through old ideologies and old coalitions to focus on what matters most. And the goal is simple: to eliminate that misery and precarity and to invest in the future.

That research was critical for one specific reason. In the late 90s, the bi-directional connection between gut and brain was not well researched. This was actually Wakefield's claim, that vaccines were triggering an immune response that impacted gut health, which directly linked to neurological development.In the late 90s, these claims would have been considered quite fringe, even without vaccine involvement. The global controversy behind Wakefield's gut-brain vaccine link had a direct hand in more resources being diverted to studying the gut-brain axis (as well as immune response during pregnancy and it's role in brain development), which in 2024 is now considered directly linked to everything from depression to schizophrenia and overall neurological development. This shouldn't be ignored. He is largely responsible for triggering this research, which is now helping millions of people. My conspiracy theory is that he was convinced of this gut-brain link (he wasn't the first), could not get enough attention on it, so committed fraud to bring his theory into the mainstream...which it basically did, albeit just not with vaccines.It's a more interesting story than many people give it credit for.","title":"Trump announces that Robert F.

I have been saying this for almost 10 years. I am a historian (degree-holding) and have studied 20th-century fascism. I lived and worked in Rome for a year where I catalogued and archived more than 2,000 names of the Holocaust victims of Rome as part of the [Stolpersteine](https://www.stolpersteine.eu/en/home) project. I've studied what happened during the Holocaust, and how it happened. I have stood in the homes of people who were taken in the night, loaded on trucks, and shipped to concentration camps. Yet, despite all my warnings over the past decade, I was constantly decried as being an extremist for labeling him a fascist - as if I didn't know what fascism is. Fast-forward a decade and now those people who once denounced me are getting awfully quiet. Honestly, I have lost hope in the American people. Unless you have formally studied history at the university level, the overwhelming majority of Americans are simply too uneducated to fully understand the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the parallels between then and now. Most Americans have no direct connection or knowledge of fascism, and we are blindly reenacting it as a nation right now. We, as a people, are historically ignorant. Hell, something like 98% of Americans don't even know the difference between a nation and a country, and much less about the histories of other nations and countries. You don't learn the whole truth and detail about the Holocaust at the K-12 level, and we are now beginning to experience the consequences of that ignorance. What is coming will not be pretty. Unless the DOJ, the military, or intelligence agencies step up, I fear for the future of this country. I do not see us making it through the next four years without widespread inequity, violence, and abhorrent human rights violations. We are quickly approaching the point of no return, and I don't know what else to do at this stage.I hate sounding like a doomsdayer, but I and many others have been sounding the alarms for a decade now and nearly every single thing we have anticipated and feared is already becoming a reality. From the Supreme Court overreach, to Trump's corruption and criminality, to the targeting of racial, sexual, and religious minorities, to the targeting of his political opponents, to the degradation of civil rights, to so much more, we are rapidly sliding into a very authoritarian era. And like nearly all previous instances of fascist regimes, the only way out will likely be through force. I am deeply afraid for the future of this once great country. I know that \\"history repeats itself\\" to various degrees, but some lessons should have been learned by now. The fact that they haven't is what makes me lose all hope for the near future.I try not to focus on it too much because it really brings me down, and it's largely out of my control. Speaking of which, I think I'm going go outside and watch the birds for a while. I recommend you all do the same.

This is my home state now, and has been for three years. This is where Eric and I live, and truly to have that opportunity, I think would be incredible, she said.No one knows better than I do the America First agenda or the goals of Donald Trump in the coming four years.

The United States has two choices, then: become homogeneous or die.  For conservatives, \\"**unity**\\" indicates a **monocultural**, authoritarian society.  If there are people of dissenting opinions, *they* are the ones that are wrong.  Their different-ness -  in culture, in politics, in language, in ethnicity - *that's* what threatens unity.  In the conservative dictionary, unity and conformity are synonyms.   Or, [in their own words](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/heritage-explains/the-3-big-differences-between-conservatives-and-progressives):  As opposed to a variety of individuals making up one American community, progressives seek to place individuals in a variety of competing communities. The first creates unity. The second, identity politics.By \\"competing communities\\", they refer to everything from cultural enclaves to advocacy groups of all kinds from minorities rights groups to unions.   They believe the existence of these groups undermines unity.  Learn English, be (or act) cis and straight, be (or act) Christian, be (or act) white, obey your husband, be grateful to your employer, and conform.  *That's* unity.  When Trump or any of his people use the word unity, you should understand that that's what they are referring to.  With that understanding, you can see that promising unity and then threatening to throw dissenters and enemies in jail are not contradictory or hypocritical at all.  \\"I have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to the new Empire\\"\\\\- Darth Vador","title":"Trump pledges unity  then says rivals should go to jail"},{"text":"I dont know if its the real President, but its a President that they know does what he says and they fear him if they dont listen to him.","title":"The World Sees Trump As America's Real President"},{"text":"This will be unpopular on the Reddit left wing echo chamber, but its not the candidate, as you pointed out main stream media has been carry water as hard as possible for Joe/Kamala. They made Trump sound like Hitler 2.0, which he most certainly isnt. Joe Rogan had a big audience, but thats not what shifted the whole country rightwards. Its the messaging, plain and simple. People do not want kids being sterilized by puberty blockers . People dont like seeing 9 year olds performing drag routines. People dont like seeing drag queens at elementary schools. People dont like seeing trumped prosecuted on property law that was twisted in ways never used before. The NY lawsuit was insane, a Business deal that stated explicitly the bank was to do its own due diligence with regards to the value of trumps property, and they did, and they loaned trump money which he then paid back, and all the parties were happy come on. The documents case against him, while Joe Biden was guilty of the same thing, but too senile to stand trial.  Yes I know the minimizers sayoh but trump was way worse because he didnt return them when asked immediately but at the end of the day they both broke the same law. The nonsense about our democracy under attack when democrats are openly screaming about packing the court, and killing the filibuster. January 6th was bad, but no worse than cities burning during BLM. Dont take my word for it look at the polls on the topic. Trump asked Pelosi for national guard troops for January 6th and was denied. \\n \\nThe simple fact that democrats appear to be ok with millions of illegals pouring in, and all of the malfeasance that takes place with it. Rapist and killers roaming our streets, people with no skill and no economic value flooding across to take advantage of our public systems that we already cant pay for. The whole world is sick of mass migration and this is just the beginning of that. The amount of hypocrisy is at an all time high. Bidens son was actually guilty of a crime, and the DOJ tried to cut him a sweetheart deal so outlandish and unprecedented that the judge was like WTF is this and then Biden saying how he respected the law and courts, then dropping a BLANKET Pardon for 10 years. The Steele dossier, that we spent millions of dollars and an impeachment over, that ended up being funded by Hillary Clinton, and was bunk. \\nDemocrats have also become the party of censorship. If you dont strictly adhere to all the ideologies of the woke left then you are cast out. If you say something as simple as boys cant become girls on a democrat ran platform like Bluesky or Facebook or Reddit you will be silenced. If youre a nazi incel , or a marxism supporter I dont care, you should be free to say what you think, and be ridiculed for it. This was greatly amplified by the Covid censorship where true facts was labeled misinformation and banned from the public forum. I consider myself fairly centrist, and Ive seen this coming for a long time. Youre excluding anyone who doesnt agree with EVERYTHING that is leftist, and that bubble will shrink the further left you go.

Advocate for and protect those who cant do for themselves.3. Put together an emergency fund. Start with getting to $1,000. 56% of Americans cant handle a $1,000 emergency, 37% couldnt handle $500.  If you can save $10/week after a year youll have a $520 fund.  Find a savings amount that is comfortable for you and sock it away weekly.4. Once you have $1,000 saved up start putting together a 1 month, 3 month, 6 month emergency fund.  All your essentials for the month (rent, utilities, groceries, etc) in case of job loss.5. Therapy, mindfulness, prayer, meditation. Whatever works for you to keep you centered while the world is going crazy. Anxiety is a killer and its important to find things that bring you peace.6. Have your emergency documents in a secure place and ready to go.  Renew or apply for passports for yourself and your loved ones.7. Stock your pantry.  Buy whats on sale in bulk, buy 2 of things you use frequently. Canned goods and non perishables for the pantry. Learn to cook what you have on hand.  See how long you can go without using the grocery store.8. Ready.gov 72-hour emergency checklist. Be prepared for fires, floods, and natural disasters.9. Get to know your neighbors. Making connections with them can help you feel less isolated. Its also a good network for mutual aid and support. Start small- your immediate neighbors, your floor, your kids soccer team parents, whoever. 10. Do one kind thing for someone else every day.","title":"Republicans Could End Up Owning A Jump In Health Care Premiums: Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers are about to see that governing is harder than campaigning."},{"text":"And his supporters will only hear about him calling for unity and will be upset when people bring up the fact he wants to jail opposition.","title":"Trump pledges unity  then says rivals should go to jail"},{"text":"This guy praising the criminal-in-chief cant be reasoned with.

Democrats have policies that sound good, are better than Republicans, and leave a better record to run on. Theres just an execution problem in bringing it all together under charismatic advocates that have a clear vision people can imagine.I dont even think Harris had to shift to the left, I just think the base and independents open to Democrats have a harder time understanding what theyre advocating for. So many start more left when campaigning locally before moving to the center or even the right the longer a national spotlight is on them.Even those policies are still better than Republicans, but it becomes less clear to people what the bigger goal is beyond defeating Republicans. Especially when Republicans will use the earlier positions and the shift to portray Democrats as secretly more extreme than they actually are. Ironically its Republicans who use more less extreme rhetoric to cover more extreme positions while Democrats actually do end up supporting their own moderate compromises.  Find effective ways to get people away from Republicans.I think we solve this problem with the same general approach of becoming clearer, but being more conscious of how our messaging is going to land with different demographics. For example the rights case to men is in openly praising what we call toxic masculinity and claiming its necessary for restoring social order after the last few decades of rapid changes. A lot of boys and young men are brought to the right because they provide a clear way to feeling valuable by reinforcing old gender expectations. For the left to cut into that, they need to figure out how their platform gives young men opportunities to be valued and express masculinity in a healthy way, and then elevate symbols and advocates that reinforce that instead of old gender expectations. If we have a clear core vision, we just need to make sure the messaging and policies are being adapted for different audiences. Addressing everyones concerns individually without a clear central theory of what the problems are and what we want to do about it makes our own job much harder.","title":"Tim Walz surprised that he and Kamala Harris lost election to Donald Trump"},{"text":"My dad is a refugee that doesn't like refugees it is interesting how his logic works.

Politics is never staticparties adapt, and voters shift over time. After Obama won in 2008, people said the GOP was dead, yet they stormed back in 2010. After Reagans landslide in 1984, everyone thought Democrats were toast, but they regained power in the 1990s. A single election cycle doesnt dictate a partys long-term future.Yes, rural areas are a challenge for Democrats, but rural America isnt growingurban and suburban areas are, and those places lean blue. Younger generations still favor Democrats overall, even if theres been a small swing recently. People change as they age, and issues like climate change, reproductive rights, and economic justice will likely bring many of these voters back. Its also worth noting that Democrats still hold a significant edge with women and people of color, demographics that are growing in influence.Your Senate argument also assumes the current map is set in stone, which isnt true. Georgia flipped recently after decades of being solidly red. Colorado and Virginia were swing states not long ago, and now theyre solid blue. North Carolina and Texas could follow similar trends with the right candidates and organizing. Yes, rural overrepresentation makes the Senate harder for Democrats, but its not impossiblelook at Jon Tester or Sherrod Brown. Strong candidates can win in tough states.On media, I get your frustration, but Democrats dont need to replicate Joe Rogan. Theyre already making strides with alternative platforms like TikTok and Instagram, which are hugely influential for younger voters.

Like it or not, 2016 and 2020 were even-split elections and Democrats should have put forth the most experienced, knowledgeable, and likable candidate possible in 2024, as well as promoted that candidate early on. Biden ran on a campaign of being a transition president but did not step back until it was too late and the Democrats were seemingly stuck with Harris.I challenge your perspective that Harris should have been a layup and Biden was historically unpopular. I would also challenge your perspective that Trump was historically unpopular. As the last 3 elections have been so close, you could argue that both candidates were equally popular.Harris did not succeed on her own and during Bidens presidency, she showcased her lack of experience at every turn. She struggled to build more than 5% of primary voters and suspended her own campaign early. On 60 Minutes a few months after winning the election and being named the Border Czar, she revealed that she had not done much international travel before, having only been to Mexico. Seemingly (in the court of public opinion) her solution to the border crisis was lambasted as Do not come. Her role in the Biden administration was the same as many traditional VPs: to court a larger voting pool, then sit at the kids table while the adults are talking.Bidens uniqueness over Trump was that he was the most experienced candidate, having spent over 30 years in the Senate and 8 years in the White House. He did not stand in the way of the Federal Reserve, unlike Trump. He did not court controversy, unlike Trump. He projected an image of a wise old man, unlike Trump.In my opinion, the political machinations of the rest of the Democratic Party lost the election for them. Imagine if they simply moved on after Trump, without the highly publicized, controversial cases that kept him in the spotlight. Would the Republicans have rallied behind him if it werent for him appearing to be attacked by the left? Would they have moved on to other candidates in the primaries? The historical precedent is to move on from ex-Presidents and even from popular enemies of the state, which is what Democrats believe Trump to be. Nixon was pardoned without serving time. The entire Confederacy was pardoned after open rebellion. (although Jefferson Davis served 2 years) Why not move on from Trump?As a secondary point, I do feel that Democrats should have been generally supportive of alternative Republican candidates in the primaries rather than attacking them too. I understand that, by default as their competition, they felt obligated to compete, but wouldnt it be better to bring the country together (Bidens ethos) rather than sowing further division?","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Well Im glad Im on the side of unity by success rather than the side that just wants to be right.

However, the language was saying that if anything contributing to their intoxication wasn't known or consented to the victim (e.g., a date rape drug was administered, or the actor gave them more alcohol than the victim allowed) then this presumption of consent vanishes, and it is considered rape.I tried digging into the legislative history, but as this was passed in 1988, and Michigan hasn't digitized all their legislative materials from that session, I was limited in my quick search.  It seems to me the author of the law was imagining a kind of situation where, as an example, perhaps a married couple were drinking together then one partner went to bed early, the other came to bed later, and may not have ever realized that the victim wasn't conscious or in a condition to give affirmative consent.The Mississippi language mirrored the same thing, and has also been repealed so is no longer in effect in any case.In California, looking at the statue, spousal rape was a crime before then.  It looks like in 2019, California reframed consent generally to require affirmative consent, as opposed to presuming consent, so the 2021 changes appear to really be putting other parts of the penal code into compliance with that principle.  Before this change, the law specifically said that spousal rape was rape, but it had a carveout in the punishment section that any punishment shouldn't negatively affect the victim.  The example given in the statute is that a defendant may be ordered to pay money to a local battered women as part of restitution, but that such a fine shouldn't be imposed if it would mean the victim would be worse off or couldn't otherwise collect a judgement.That said, I don't think these were all that unreasonable beforehard.  All of them recognized marital rape prior to these changes.  And especially considering that we're dealing with language from the 70s/80s, it makes sense that would be the mindset of the time.  Would it have been nice for a legislator in the 2000s to have come up with these tweaks?  Yeah, it would have been better that way, but in no way were these laws saying that marital rape was acceptable in any way.","title":"Trump says he doesnt plan to restrict abortion pills, but also says, things change"},{"text":"No. They mean..and I was guilty of this myself because I'm old.

One way we do that is to start reaching out as pro-democracy Americans, not Democrats and liberals, to family, friends, neighbors and co-workers who voted for Trump, but are not diehard MAGA. As well as those who sat out the election altogether. These are generally low engaged voters. We need to get them to start paying attention, just watching, what Trump and his surrogates are doing. They will incriminate themselves, and hopefully these voters will wake up from thinking both sides are the same. And don't pitch Democratic policies. These people are resistant to what the Democratic Party says. They are suspicious of Democratic politicians. We just have to get them to regularly notice what Trump and the Republicans are doing. They'll come around to Democrats if they wake up to what's going on.And also, anybody with teenage kids, especially teenage boys, needs to be making their kids resistant to fascism. It's not enough just to teach them your values, you have to help them to understand how fascist propaganda works, and why it's evil. Because otherwise, young adult males are the most easily radicalized demographic. If we don't do these things, the propaganda machine is going to keep chugging along, radicalizing more voters.

Across 23 grainy episodes on YouTube, we watched a young Duffy stir up controversy with his six housemates on?[The Real World: Boston](https://web.archive.org/web/20100108115842/http://www.mtv.com/shows/realworld-season6/series.jhtml), accusing a Black housemate of being biased against white people, sleeping through a speech by President Bill Clinton, and flashing the women at the house before dashing off in American flag underwear.Aired in 1997, the sixth season of MTVs longest-running reality series featured Duffy as a 25-year-old bespectacled, flannel-clad law student. He and his fellow cast members lived in a converted firehouse on Beacon Hill for six months, experiencing a new city as cameras followed their daily lives and interpersonal relationships.The group quickly adjusted to Boston, frequenting such bygone local spots as the Beacon Hill Pub, a Fenway club called AXIS, and a grocery store that is now succeeded by a Nuts Factory, as well as places that still exist today, including restaurants The Paramount and Figs.Those relationships,?as fans of the show know well, feature no shortage of dramatic confrontations and heated discussions over sensitive social issues.?He notably butted heads with roommate Kameelah Phillips, whom he called a bitch during a heated argument and later compared to Adolf Hitler while accusing her of reverse racism.During a conversation with castmate Jason Cornwell, Duffy claimed another housemate had told him they heard Phillips say that Blacks are the king and queen of society.That is the mentality of the white man of the 1850s, that we are the king race and were gonna put the Black man in slavery. She wants to have that racism right now and that same mentality for the Black people against white people, Duffy said. Thats a master race kind of thought, thats what Hitler thought.When Duffy confronted Phillips about the alleged comments, she responded I dont think Ive ever said anything like that. As a Black person living in the US, how do I have room to be prejudiced?Just because my grandpa enslaved your grandpa doesnt mean I should be punished for that, Duffy said.Reminiscent of his conflict with Phillips, Duffy argued white people can face discrimination as well.If we switched and I walked into a Black neighborhood, you know I would be taunted or whatever, be discriminated against, probably like you may be if you walked into a white neighborhood, Duffy said to Yarbrough. Its the same, its all relevant.I havent been exposed to a lot of the issues that Syrus has brought to the table with me but Im open to him and Im trying to learn, Duffy said during a direct-to-camera interview.Sean was jumped by some Black guys one time, Yarbrough said in a later clip. For him to actually come to live with me shows you that he has to have an open mind.Phillips, however, did not share the sentiment. In a different episode, Phillips spoke to a friend over the phone and expressed her frustration at having to educate Duffy about the Black experience.He is like the whitest white boy Ive ever met. The first Black person hes been a friend with is one, my roommate Syrus, and then me, Phillips said. I dont think its fair for me to have to live here and be his roommate and spend all of my time teaching him about Black people and blackness.","title":"Trumps choice for transportation secretary was once on The Real World: Boston.

Now take that extra money that immigrants spend on Verizon, Hormel, Pepsi, Hershey's, McDonalds and all the grocery/clothing stores that sell merchandise and turn the spigot off.

Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that were talking about including child care that its going to take care  were gonna have, I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time. Coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country because I have to stay with child care, I want to stay with child care  but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that Im talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just, that I just told you about. Were going to be taking in trillions of dollars and as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, its relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers well be taking in. Were going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people. And then well worry about the rest of the world. Lets help other people.

We need to get them to pay attention to what Trump and his surrogates are doing. They will incriminate themselves. We just need people to wake up to it.And Democrats need to stop suggesting that we need to do more on social media. Face to face interaction. Phone calls to people you know. Those are more persuasive communication methods than social media, where your posting is on Reddit or Facebook gets lost in all of the misinformation noise. Where those voters I talked about are not listening to people they don't know. And they certainly aren't listening to Democratic politicians. When these voters told us that both sides are the same, they meant it. That's how they perceive things. They need to hear it from people they *know* personally.","title":"Trump should not be treated like a \\"normal\\" president."},{"text":"Sorry, i got to the line- \\"A layup\\"? Are you joking?

So Any American job gets paid more than them.  Think of the worst job you can thst gets minimum wage and the illegals get paid less.  And no America is going to go do the cleaning, construction, picking fruit all day in the hot sun.  And they certainly aren't for that pay.  If all of a sudden their labor force disappeared they wouldn't be able to just pay triple the price for fruit pickers with out the cost of everything sky rocketing.The same with manufacturing jobs.

The problem has been growing for decades - the rich (mostly Republican) like the idea of cheap labour, but their politicians have always blocked the Democrats' idea of an anmesty and residency for long-term illegals (\\"path to citizenship\\") which is kind of necessary to clean up the mess - legalize the long term ones and deport the rest and any newcomers who are not real refugees. By refusing to deal with it, they got to the situation where you have adults with established careers, who came so young they have no knowledge of their homelands, but in danger now of deportation.  Or a family where half the children are deportable and half born American citizens.  Married couples with children where one spouse is liable to be deported.  I expect an equally loud screaming from rich business owners when they realize their cheap labour force is about to disappear.

The only barrier they have right now is a Republican controlled Congress that might have enough foresight to realize that if allowed, this federal government is basically doomed.It's not just these 4 years.  It's not just the cabinet picks.  It's their want to literally gut the entire government, clean slate, remove everything, and build up a business that suits only them.It is unprecedented.  The risk of harm of this is insane as a nation.The sad part for Trump is he's simply a puppet, a dog that's happy to be included, but he's the one that brought the votes for victory.  Trump is equally a prisoner of this game too, either part of the game or would be forcefully removed and Vance at the beck and call of Theil would simply take over.  Trump no longer matters anymore.  He did his part.All hail the oligarchy?All I know is the federal government is a massive institution.  Any mucking about would decimate thousands of processes that are intertwined with hundreds of thousands of services between federal and state and between government and people.  It would be like Elon and Twitter but 10,000 fold, and millions will be harmed by it.  Because many government functions drive many critical services, these bad actors will likely kill people from their actions.  They just don't care.  They very literally don't care what exists right now.  They are ignorant and 100% happy about that ignorance.  They don't want to understand how the government currently works.  They just want to scorch earth the place and rebuild it to their liking.The saving grace is the US government system is heavily decentralized into what is effectively 51 largely independent governments, including independent leadership, judiciary, and funding.  Sadly, the most harmed states will be the ones who are not already self-sufficient, particularly red states that voted Trump in.  They will experience the greatest burden when the federal government breaks.Again, the only thing standing in the way right now is Congress and the Republican party.  They are the ones that will decide on who Trump actually gets and how this whole mess plays out.  Most of what Trump wants to do has to go through Congress, so the fate of a lot of Trump's and of the oligarchical will is on them.  They will save or break this institution.  They are also the ones who can impeach and remove bad actors, so it is also on them to protect what could be significant harm to the institution.The big question is:  Do you believe in the Republican party to do the right thing?","title":"Trump is stacking his White House roster with uber-rich backers"},{"text":"Ha!

Obama comes in a gets to work to correct course and has a pretty good economy by the end of his 2 terms.Trump rides the coattails of Obama's economy until covid hits and everything goes to shit. Trump prioritizes short term gains rather than fixing the problem, and the economy goes to shit again. Biden comes in, Dems pass the inflation reduction act, the economy starts to correct itself. Now Trump gets to crash it again.Republicans always ruin the economy. Dems always have to clean up after them. Unfortunately, the economy is a massive machine and can't turn on a dime. Anywhere from 2-3 years of a new president's term will still be the effects from the previous administration's work. And Republicans know this quite well. Just look at how the tax cuts passed under Trump were designed to expire (for the common folks like us at least) during the next presidential term.

There is never a single incident that galvanizes them into a revolt, just a steady stream of ad hoc situations that degrade democracy until it is gone. If you look at the literature surrounding totalitarian regimes in the last century you'll find the same process happening every single time. This degradation of democratic norms in the USA has been going on for decades (at least since Nixon), but it's one of those \\"slowly then suddenly\\" situations that has now accelerated into openly oligarchic rule. The press kept normalizing this because that's what many people want: they want to believe this is normal, that their support for or tolerance of this is normal, so they can keep living normal lives and not look at the bad things that happen to other people. That, in fact, anything bad that happens to them is caused by those other people rather than by the fat cats at the top eating all the cake.The only way to avoid this is to have strong political or labour movements that act as a focal point for resistance, but the USA has neither of these. The Democratic party is effectively the only viable democratic party in the two party system and they're not prepared to either do what is necessary, nor to stand aside for a more militant successor or competitor. Unions have been weakened by decades of hostile governments and are in no position to act effectively. This becomes even more problematic if you look at the USA's electoral system. The Republican party doesn't even need to cheat all that much, or in many places, to ensure there will be no more competitive elections.Unless they are really stupid or somehow unwilling to actually do this, the USA is in this mess for the long haul, probably until they do something so heinous or irresponsible that the usual distractions cease to work and their own supporters turn on them. Since those supporters are authoritarian and reactionary, the natural basis for dictatorships around the globe, that might take a while. It might also make matters even worse.","title":"Biden must act now to block Trumps retribution threats"},{"text":"I think you dont understand the difference between climate and weather.?","title":"Climate Activists Need to Radically Change Their Approach Under Trump"},{"text":"Shouldn't Trump pardon them instead?

There's no short-term wins to be had in Syria, whatever happens there has to be a long-term strategy requiring years of work. If there is a domestic emergency that requires swift actions I fully expect Biden to step up and do something.

I cant remember if it was Mises or Hayek writing about it, but run government like a business has been a mantra for reformers for literally centuries. The problem is that, governments are foundation-ally going to be wasteful and inefficient, and other than eliminating entire departments or programs completely, your success will be limited or temporary. Hopefully DOGEs aspirations of complete departmental eliminations will come true.Thats not even getting in to how trying to eliminate waste/fraud/abuse often creates MORE regulatory burden, of which I have firsthand experience with in my former corporate life.Trump has indeed based his tariff proposals on protectionist grounds (literally saying protect US industries in his detailed platform), and I have every reason to believe he will raise them, since hes promised it over and over in speeches, and Trump tries very hard to keep his promises. Raising tariffs because other countries have high tariffs is akin to raising our income tax rate because other countries have high income tax rates. In any case, while he did get some trade concessions in his first term, on balance he raised tariff rates. I expect a repeat.If he doesnt do a mass deportation as promised, well, then Id say that is a high expectation that wasnt fulfilled.It appears we agree on most things, just differ on odds of success and to be clear Id thrilled with even 50% success as that would beyuge.","title":"Donald Trump is poised to have a successful 2nd term as Commander-in-Chief"},{"text":"There is no point in posting fact checks anymore and it is legitimately safe to assume anything any member of the GOP says is false.

Hasnt taken office yet. I dont think you know what lame duck means.

He's entering office unable to ever hold thr position Hes the first President to be both at the same time, due to Grover Cleveland existing before the 22nd Amendment.But theyre more in danger from getting in trouble with MAGA than they are from any alleged moderate republicans. Not particularly.Trump's fantastic at turning out voters in years, He's on the ballot. However those voters tend not to turn out when hes not on the ballot based on the midterms the last few cyclesAnd since he is a lame duck, hes never on the ballot again. Republicans are well aware of this.You don't even need to look hard to see this.This is why depsite Trump demanding Senate Majority Leader Rick Scott and getting rid of the Filibuster, we have Senate Majority Leader John Thune and his pledge to keep the filibuster in its current form.Notably however in its current form, the Filibuster cant be used for cabinet nominees. So democrats have no ability to influence any of that.Yet weve already seen 2 Trump nominees fall, Gaetz and Chronister, and at least 4 more seem to be in various states of trouble: Hegseth, Gabbard, RFK and Chavez-DeRemer. And that whols discussion over \\"recess appointments\\" is Trump acknowledging his hold on the GOP is collapsing.

The only active plans he enacted were horribly racist and or corrupt: Muslim ban, using the contract to \\"build\\" wall between MX and US that fell apart, deregulating anywhere he could.

Eliminating those costs will be stimulative even if it doen't reduce actual spending.2) We have all seen the kind of waste in government spending so eliminating waste is a big focus. WaPo uncovered a $3 Billion fraud just on urinary catheters alone. Eliminating Medicare fraud goes a long way to fixing Medicare.3) We also know there is plenty of fraud and waste at DOD. We need to change the DOD budget to $0.00 based budgeting. If they can't pass an audit they don't need more money.4) There is no reason to believe that Trump will impose Smoot Hawley Blanket tariffs. Trump understand that we live in a worldwide trading economy. He also understands that virtually every country in the world has higher tariffs on US products entering those countries than we have on their products entering ours. His tariff proposals are to leverage that fact. You want access to our markets, you give us access to yours. Also, as we saw with Canada and Mexico, tariffs are used to change behavior. Trump is not looking at protectionist tariffs, no matter what the MSM says.5) His border policy consists of closing the border and deporting criminals and people who have had their asylum claims denied and have deportation orders. Lets let him do that before we speculate about MASS DEPORTATIONS no matter what he says. Trump has been known to exaggerate to make a point.6) Regarding a labor shortage if deportations happen, I doubt it. farmers and construction companies and hospitality still need workers and will find them","title":"Donald Trump is poised to have a successful 2nd term as Commander-in-Chief"},{"text":"Clutches pearls.they called him a hypocrite ?

Moreover, even $2T of spending cuts will NOT fix our spending problems which depend on fixing SS and Medicare, which Trump has pledged not to touch.On the economy, the tax cuts and reduced regulation will indeed be very stimulative, but he also proposes tariffs that are Smoot-Hawley levels of insanity and that could similarly backfire and stifle growth and living standards. I am hoping these are negotiation tactics but it sounds like he is in fact determined to implement them as promised.On the border, agree closing it and even building the wall (finally) should be straightforward, but deporting upwards of 11 million illegal immigrants will be Herculean, and AFAIK they have only talked about a max of 1m per year, and AFAIK historically weve done a max of 1.5-2m per year.

For example, as an American citizen if I leave the US and earn money in another country, the US government can tax that income. I'm under *the jurisdiction of* the US and they claim the right to tax my income no matter where I earn it.  However, if a non-citizen leaves the US and works in another country, the US can not tax that person's income, the US has no jurisdiction over them.  While working within the US, both people can be taxed because the money was earned within the US.For illegals, they are not even obeying the laws simply by being here so even the most generous consideration of the meaning, that they are simply living under US laws, doesn't apply to them.  And then, by association, other US laws do not allow children to benefit from the crimes of their parents.Congress also has the authority to clarify the meaning, the amendment actually provides for Congress to do so.This needs to be addressed in context of those gaming the system.","title":"Trump Drops Bombshell on NBC: Birthright Citizenship to End, Dreamers to Get a New Pathway (Videos)"},{"text":"Slavery, fascism, power, and fear.","title":"Many targeted for removal by Trump cant be deported, ICE data shows"},{"text":"90 million eligible people didnt vote in this last election.

I can tell you why since you were still able to marry a man you should probably have understood something about weddings doesnt work. When the law and culture (movies, tv shows, magazines, etc.) does not allow you to marry or never shows people that look like you getting married, you dont think about the option because it isnt open to you. It would be like learning about all the fancy things that go into a Lamborghini Ill never own a lambo, so why would I have the instruction manual?Also, people may as well know gay men and lesbians generally have very little in common. I have no idea why so many gay men work in the wedding industry, but I can tell you it is not part of the lesbian subculture. I have a lot more in common personally with straight men than straight women or gay men. So I dont know maybe some of us also have about as much interest in an extremely expensive unnecessary party as straight men? Obviously Im speaking in general terms. You can always find the straight guy who loves wedding planning and the lesbian who has dreamed about getting married since she was a child even though the option wasnt open to her (I guess), but its important to note that when youre told This isnt for you, it shapes what you think is even possible. It shapes what you do or do not know.For what its worth when legal marriage became available, my wife and I got a license and went to an officiant within the span of a few days.

Amending the constitution in the 14th Amendment would be difficult as well.you don't have to.

For example, foreign diplomats enjoy expansive immunity from US government jurisdiction as a matter of law (and international norms). The determination of which foreign nationals are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the scope of said jurisdiction, can be defined at will by Congress.The rest of the naturalization clause admonishes state governments that they cannot decide someone isn't a US citizen at will.

Honesty in the people making decisions. A lack of corruption. Impartial means of decision making. Generosity springing from the common man. Joy (or at least indifference) at being equal to others. Lack of greed and avarice. Lack of jealousy between people.You could argue that all of these apply to communism because Marx believed that communism is unachievable without fundamental qualitative changes in people's mentality.  However, socialism does not rely on the traits you mention. Socialism is an ideology prioritising the needs of general society and its members over capital. It emerged as a response to terrible conditions and low living standards typical for working-class people in the early era of capitalism. Socialism does not seek to change human nature. Originally it stood for labour rights and improved workplace safety. Later it evolved into the idea of social ownership of the means of production, which is essentially a workplace democracy.Of course, there are many different branches of socialism (and communism as well) with differing ideas on how to achieve this ideal of social ownership. Some socialists are more extreme and others are more moderate. Some advocate for free markets and some prefer state ownership. They all agree, however, that the state (its institutions) and the economy should serve the society and its members.I agree that any -ism taken to the extreme is bad. But I still think that socialism is more desirable because it focuses on people and their needs rather than anything else.","title":"Trumps policies should be turning off farmers C why did so many vote for him?"},{"text":"Richard Nixon seems quaint these days.","title":"WWE sexual abuse lawsuit naming Trump education secretary pick Linda McMahon is paused"},{"text":"The fact he made it out of 2015 still a candidate for president was the indication that we were already on our way to becoming a failed state.It's been going in fits and starts, but we edge ever closer.","title":"Donald Trump's 'Meet the Press' interview was a media failure to defend truth"},{"text":"It's almost like a bit of a game to them, isn't it?

The anti-incumbency narrative has been broken in Romania where a stranger has won the first round of voting. Hes not from one of the opposition parties. Luckily, the Romanian Constitutional court has declared his win as invalid, and Romanian security services have said that Calin Georgescus TikTok campaign was partially funded by a foreign government. And the security services have also said that TikTok treats him differently than other candidates.?Furthermore, to me, the anti-incumbency theory is a behavioral science theory with applied game theory to it. The way I have broken it down is that voters had three choices. First option, pick the incumbent, which suggests they are happy with the economic response by the incumbent. Second option, pick an opposition party, which suggests they dont approve of the economic response by the incumbent. The third option is a nonstandard and arbitrary candidate. This suggests that voters are confident with a random choice.Now, allow me to draw a scenario in your head. We already know that the economy has dramatically slowed down, and that has caused an economic crisis, so we can say the anti-incumbent theory is propped up by the bad economic recovery post-COVID . So I am proposed 3 options: I perceive option A (the incumbent) will give me $50. But I also believe that option B will give me $100. Finally, option C is a completely random reward and it is unknown to me. Its something new and I dont know how things will work out.?So, the way I see it, the anti-incumbent theory has fallen completely flat. In other words, the anti-incumbent theory suggests buyers remorse. But reality is far detached from that. Its no longer just about economic conditions, its about perceived risks posed by established political parties and something out there is using these sentiments to bring new leaders who favor authoritarianism.?","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Or Melania.","title":"Trump aims to end birthright citizenship, says American citizens with family here illegally may be deported"},{"text":"This is wrong.
