The WCoE, led by John D. Ratliff, Executive Director of the WCoE and Vice President at Natcast, will lead collaborative efforts with NSTC members to ensure workers at every stage of their careers C from students to seasoned professionals C are equipped with the necessary skills and training to thrive in the semiconductor industry. The WCoEs focus will be on fostering collaboration to ensure good-paying jobs and sustainable career pathways for American workers, while also driving U.S. innovation forward.To achieve this mission, the WCoE will seek to be a trusted, interconnected, and neutral third party, with access to data and a focus on improving workforce access for all to help mitigate risks, reduce friction, and spread the rewards of collaboration. There will be three inaugural programs within the WCoE, each aimed at reshaping the workforce development ecosystem:* **The Amplifier Program:** Focuses on scaling efficient, equitable, and industry-driven worker-centered workforce development practices that place workers in high quality jobs with family-sustaining wages and the free and fair choice to join a union. It will provide funding, foster partnerships, and recognize best practices in workforce retention, training, and education.\\n* **The Signals Program:** Leverages data and research to monitor workforce trends and evaluate program progress and outcomes. It aims to create a comprehensive understanding of the talent landscape, including supply and demand, while developing actionable insights.\\n* **The Connections Program:** Facilitates member services, tailored events, and hands-on assistance to meet the specific needs of NSTC member organizations, helping them to build the U.S. semiconductor workforce of the future.*Inaugural NSTC Workforce Partner Alliance Awardees*As part of this groundbreaking effort, Natcast intends to fund $11.5 million in anticipated awards to seven institutions supporting efforts to develop the semiconductor workforce ecosystem across more than a dozen U.S. states. The WFPA is the first Amplifier Program award and the first of many WCoE award programs expected to launch in the next decade. These inaugural projects are estimated to support the career development and deliver experiential training with innovative delivery models of more than 12,000 individuals, preparing them for long-term roles in the semiconductor industry. All projects include employer commitments, including commitments to interview, paid internships, and research projects. The first cohort of awardees, who will support demand-driven programs that address key skills and workforce gaps in semiconductor research, design, manufacturing, and production consists of the following lead organizations:  \\n...List of recipients for the first round of funding is in the press release along with the scope of their projects. Link to a more detailed list is at the end of it. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo: Our nations competitiveness relies on a strong, diverse, and empowered workforce. Thats why under President Biden and Vice President Harriss leadership, were taking decisive action to provide our workers with the resources, skills and opportunities they need to secure good-paying jobs in industries of the future. The mission of the WCoE and WFPA will play a crucial role in this effort, said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. With the Departments proposed investments of over $500 million in workforce efforts, this announcement is a critical milestone in our strategy to build a robust workforce in the semiconductor industry to help fulfill the mission set forth by the CHIPS and Science Act.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Launches NSTC Workforce Center of Excellence with Expected $250 Million Investment"},{"text":"Both of them also would have glassed Iran if Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel and funded mass attacks on Us civilians","title":"Kamala Harris says U.S. will support Israel's right to defend itself after Iran's missile attack"},{"text":"The same people who made the Winnie the Pooh horror movie already released a Mickey Mouse horror movie.

A few reasons/thoughts:* Even if two groups seem to broadly agree on the surface, they might have strong disagreements about niche topics, or simply go about doing things in a really different way. I work with many institutions that are very broadly aligned - probably support most of the same policies, largely vote for the same party, have similar values - but within these groups there are really, really heated disagreements.\\n* Think tanks and other NGOs collaborate on specific projects or papers all the time, if there's alignment on specific topics it's pretty easy to work together without having to make any bigger structural changes. There are incentives to avoid replication because you're less likely to get funded for something someone else is already doing.\\n* It's a pain logistically, and there often wouldn't really be an efficiency gain in the way that there might be with businesses. It's also worth noting that most of these organisations won't have the flexibility to do this easily even assuming all of the senior management agrees, you'd also need to get your funders to agree. So combining resources when you're two entities funded by different sources with different targets and values is difficult. It's also a costly exercise with no immediate financial gain. \\n* Incentives aren't really inherently opposed to efficiency - though I would agree there is less need to focus on (immediate) efficiency than the private sector. Consolidating influence would often increase pay, and potentially prestige, for individuals within think tanks - but it would decrease an individual's ability to shape policy in the way that they would like.\\n* As a more fundamental point, I'm not sure we really want all policymaking from a particular part of the political spectrum to be made by one group. Getting ideas from multiple places is, generally, a positive thing. Though to be fair I'm against the idea of think tanks functioning as arms of political parties in general (though I do think partisan think tanks probably do generally make better policy than if it were done fully inside a political party), even if this is the reality in many cases.","title":"Mergers and Acquisitions in the Nonprofit Industrial Complex"},{"text":"I think Vance won much more comfortably than that.

If you did, you would learn how difficult it is for the victim/defendant to sue the government to get their assets back.One issue is simply not having the resources to sue. Last time I checked, Blacks were less likely to have bank accounts and therefore more likely to transport their cash savings around. The police steal those assets which makes it even harder for those victims to sue. Try suing the government after they steal and withhold thousands of dollars.If you like, I believe I can show studies supporting the idea that 70% of the money stolen through civil asset forfeiture comes from Blacks; 65% of that being Black men. The amount? Roughly 1.5BILLION per YEAR. Many of those that have their money stolen are INNOCENT. They simply give up on suing the government to get their assets back.

These two influences often act in conflict with one another. Christian theological thought underpins most Western ideas about religion, culture, death, and sexuality, shaping personal beliefs and behaviors. Meanwhile, Roman and Greek ideals shape the intellectual side of Western culture, which is why so many Western intellectuals study Greek and Roman philosophers like Socrates and Plato.Western identity is rooted in an understanding of the nature of Jesus Christabsorbed both through cultural osmosis and direct teachingand an appreciation for Greek philosophy. This is part of what makes someone \\"Western.\\" People who grow up within this framework, regardless of race, have a vague sense of \\"Greekness,\\" \\"Romanness,\\" and \\"Christianness.\\" It's this blend of cultural and intellectual traditions that defines Western culture. This is why you can have people who might look racially Western but aren't truly Western in a cultural sensethey don't have Socrates, Plato, or an understanding of Jesus in the Christian perspective, where He is viewed as both a prophet and God.\\nThe most likely thing I think that will happen in the west is that they'll be an anti-immigrant sentiment  some racialized violence. I think that's inevitable I think most people can tell that's just what's going to happen anywa.  Most states are probably going to limit the number of immigrants that they're  going to want to accept(which is fine) in the years coming forward.

Also to ensure rural communities are not forgotten. Without the Electoral College, candidates' best bet would be to hop from city to city promising residents the world to get their vote and never bother visiting \\"flyover country\\". It would effectively disenfranchise most of the country.California and NY are quite large states AND very populated, could benefit from being split up so their voices are better represented.In California, the red rural areas outside the Bay area and LA have movements to do just that. They've even put forth ballot initiatives. They're always non-starters. For one thing, such splits would create competition for Mississippi being the worst, most poor, least educated state in the country. Being consistently at the bottom of every positive metric is the only thing Mississippi has going for it.These arbitrary lines, and \\"rules\\" that people obsess over are stupid, popular vote is the \\"fairest\\" because all the others are just \\"these lines give us more strength with less numbers\\"International borders are also \\"*arbitrary lines*\\". Maybe we should ignore those as well, have everyone in the world just vote on one big government in a popular vote? The people of China and India can then just get together and decide how the rest of us should live. That go over well with you?The fact is that the US is a highly diverse place with different people having different needs. The needs of tech workers in Silicon Valley and financial system workers in NYC are very different from the needs of all those farmers in the midwest. But I can't eat computers or stocks. People who live in Vermont or Wyoming also do matter, but they wouldn't in a simple popular vote contest. Throw away the Electoral College and you get national fragmentation, disenfranchisement, and entire regions and demographics being utterly forgotten. Is the Electoral College perfect? Absolutely not. Could states do better than first-past-the-post? 100% yes. Should we have more than two viable candidates? Yes. Especially since most of the candidates of the last two decades have been terrible. One change I'd advocate for would be adding a \\"None of the above\\" option to each political race. If it wins a plurality, all the candidates are disqualified from the race and you vote again. Plenty of other things you could do to better the system, but simply tossing the Electoral College in the trash would be a disaster for an already polarized nation.","title":"Another poll shows Ted Cruz trailing Democratic challenger Colin Allred"},{"text":"Having \\"super hero\\", trade marked is ridiculous.?","title":"US Trademark Office cancels Marvel, DC's 'Super Hero' marks"},{"text":"I hear it also creates jobs.","title":"Kamala Harris says U.S. will support Israel's right to defend itself after Iran's missile attack"},{"text":"It would be a political sin if she didn't pardon the Hamburglar","title":"Kamala Harris on working at McDonalds in her 20s: 'It was not a small job'"},{"text":"They will give the Trump treatment to who ever is next.??","title":"Fantastic Debate"},{"text":"Confirmed, DC is in play!","title":"12 states have shifted to Kamala Harris in past monthNate Silver model"},{"text":"I felt a wee bit bad for him last night, but I remember those images from Minneapolis during the riots.  then there's his attitude and record on illegal immigration, on \\"gender-affirming care\\" for minors and MN becoming a \\"trans-refuge\\" state and I'm sure there's other things not coming to mind right now.

And theyve been disproportionately affected by rising prices over the last several years, an issue many blame Democrats for.Single issue voters.  Gabriel Lopez grew up in a family of Democrats in the Kensington neighborhood of deep-blue Philadelphia. So in 2016, the first presidential election he was old enough to vote in, he picked Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.\\n \\n But Lopez, now 27, says his views have changed. He switched his registration to Republican this year, and he plans to vote for Trump, whos running for president a third time.\\n \\n Democrats keep saying [Trump] is going to bring down the economy, but Trump was already president for four years, and taxes were lower, Lopez said. Were tired of the same politics. We got a different type of guy, and the people actually love him.\\n \\n A home health aide and rideshare driver, Lopez said Democrats havent kept their promises to bring down prices or improve life in his community. Trump, he said, is at least straightforward. Single issue voters. They don't have to be right or wrong. If Democrats really want low earning voters they need to deliver something tangible. Other people don't like to hear it but that's what it takes. Gas prices could be rock bottom and their single issue would just move to something else. Like taxes instead of a living wage that would negate taxes. Doesn't matter what Democrats have done or will do. Single issue voters just want to complain about something. And for some it's easier to complain about taxes than Republicans trying to take over control of the country.  So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America todayan attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we arewho we are as Americans. For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country. It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career Id ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to Godto preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And thats an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic. \\n \\n The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally. \\n \\n Ive said it before: Were are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. Thats not hyperbole. Since the Civil War. The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th. Im not saying this to alarm you; Im saying this because you should be alarmed. - President Joe  When Project 2025 is in full effect I guarantee that one single issue voter won't be complaining about taxes.The shift was most stark in working-class communities.

Getting overly caught up in electoralism before building strong left coalitions outside of the electoral system is putting the cart before the horse. It's also worth noting that, like most deep-thinking people, Ben is learning and evolving. His debate with Niko was 4 years ago, that seems like a lifetime on our current timeline.Greenwald's assessment (3YO) of Ben's position in his book seems to correlate with what I'm presenting, \\"*The philosophy professor and writer Ben Burgis is as much on the political left as it is possible to be. A writer at the socialist magazine Jacobin, vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders, and advocate of socialist economic policies in the name of stopping corporatism and neoliberalism and elevating the quality of life for the working class, the bona fides of Burgis leftism are impossible to contest.*\\"Ben still writes for Jacobin, I won't hold that against him, ostracizing everyone at Jacobin is just an example of the leftist infighting that is counter to building coalitions left of the Shitlibs. Does the link you shared have anything to do with Ben? I have never heard him cosign all views expressed on Jacobin.

Harris is the mean. Biden was just that unpopular because theres no defending his obvious cognitive issues. Replacing Biden with Harris was simply taking all of the non-Biden voters and making them comfortable voting democrat again. Youll notice that Trumps number never really dipped in the polls after the change, just Harris numbers went well above what Biden was polling. And VP is a significant pick. I mention this in another thread but Palin is part of my McCain lost. Biden is part of why Obama won. Pence is part of why Trump won in 16. Vance will be part of why Trump wins this year. Who the VP is sends a message to voters, even if its a message most voters dont necessarily comprehend. Biden was a blue collar rust belt edge to Obamas elitism and smoothness. Pence brought a calming effect to Trumps presidency in 16 as a traditional religious conservative. Vance shows that Trumps MAGA platform will exist beyond Trump and that theres a new generation of politicians waiting in the wings to carry it on after Trump. It shows health of a movement. Palin showed erratic decision making and made McCain seem out of touch and potentially desperate. Kaine came off as a goober and nerd Hola Amigos! out of touch politician. Walz shows how out of step the DNC is with their blue collar roots.  Its an attempt to get an outdoorsy macho man in office, but everyone can see through the facade (especially when you dig past surface layer with him). Instead, he looks like an old out of touch grandpa who isnt ready for the spotlight. VP picks matter big time.

I am watching all these debates and interviews through the eyes of a former Republican, libertarian, and Christian.  I am not also very knowledgeable about how the government works etc, so I consider myself a pretty good test subject.

IMO Walz won with his last answer but if I didnt stay for the entire debate I would not have thought that.  I think Walz said some incriminating things and also didnt defend enough against Vances accusations.  When Trump did that I thought his campaign was toast.  That worries me.  I know trumpers will run with this and use his words and lack of words against Kamala, when the race is already so close. The thing I wonder about is how this reflects on Trump to his supporters.  Vance clearly upstaged him but I think the magas will see that as a smart choice by Trump, even though Vance has fucked up pretty much everything else.  People are watching these debates now because of how crucial the Biden one was.  The good thing is that a LOT of people are having glass shatter moments and will see through the chicanery.  Vance was clearly adopting Kamalas tactics and bald faced lying.  Walz missed so many opportunities.  For instance, when Vance said they are trying to win the trust of women he should have asked what they have done in the past year to show that.  That was an easy one - Trump Vance have been doing the *opposite* this whole time.

Empire is an essential opponent of liberalism. The classic empires of Europe in Britain, France, Germany, and the USSR all were defeated and deconstructed by liberal forces. They mistake the ability of liberal systems to span multiple nationalities with empire's need to subjugate multiple nationalities. It's the difference between the Austro-Hungarian empire and the EU. While there is a point to be made about concentrations of political &amp; economic power, liberal capitalism doesn't expand because it needs to step on and subjugate the masses to the benefit of an elite aristocracy, it expands because it can actually present a better political deal &amp; standards of living to the people of the world than nearly any other system.","title":"Why do people argue imperialism is essential to liberalism?

The GOP should have to explain to America how creating free riders in an insurance program makes that program better for anyone except the person getting a free ride. What it does (obviously) is raise the cost of insurance for everyone else. And that was the GOPs intent, to make Obamacare more expensive just so they could say see, its so expensive. They were preying on 15% of America to appeal to unpatriotic men wanting insurance just in time when they needed it, but not paying anything until then. Thats not fair.

What's interesting is that many of the algorithms aren't so much algorithms and weren't developed in computer science, but are instead taken from statistics/operations research literature. e.g. Optimal Stopping and Bayes Theorem. This is something that happens often, where ideas from other disciplines are implemented in code once and then come to be seen as computer science/programming problems.After watching this happen again and again I've come to see programming as being to science and maths what accounting is to business and economics and marketing. It's just a language for organizing stuff. You need accounting to organize a big, complex business. But the business value is not in the accounting. Even when you're writing software, I think you should get into an accounting mentality rather than a maths or science mentality. Maths and Science will have you trying to divine the underlying truth of what you're building. But the Accounting mentality is much better - your job is to find a set of artificial rules to impose on the system which constrain it to make sense and be trustworthy. It's not even engineering because in engineering there are pre-existing constraints from nature.Computer science and programming are not core sciences, and it's bad that we obfuscate the origins of the real valuable ideas (statistics, signal processing, electrical engineering, operations research...)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Is she going to single handedly fix our infrastructure?

That relationship continued for 10 years, until she got pregnant. He then killed her on the same day his wife was undergoing a C-section and staged it as a suicide. Now, weve learned his twin brother had sex with her weeks prior to her death. And then helped his brother cover up the crime.  Investigators have uncovered text messages between disgraced former Stoughton police officer William Farwell, whose twin brother Matthew is in federal custody for the alleged murder of Sandra Birchmore, that suggest he knew Birchmore was pregnant with his twin brothers child when he met the victim apartment buildings parking lot for a sexual encounter 22 days before she was killed. Birchmores death was ruled a suicide, despite overwhelming evidence that suggested she was not suicidalincluding plans she was making for her babys future on February 1, the day of her death. That same day, Matthew Farwell visited Birchmores Canton apartment during a blizzard, after dropping off his wife Michelle for a planned C-section at Newton-Wellesley Hospital.

But still if I really search my heart, I still think Walz won.) He consistently knew what he was talking about and spoke from a genuine place of empathy, positivity, and trustworthy experienced leadership.If overall, most people think the debate was a tie then I still think that's a win for Walz and the Harris campaign. Walz didn't say anything crazy to genuinely hurt him or the campaign. (Yes he misspoke a time or two, he was nervous for the first 10 minutes, and the China answer [and question!] was kinda awkward) ... but besides that he really said some great, thoughtful answers that shows he really knows his stuff as governor and gives off \\"I would be trustworthy and helpful in a crisis\\" energy.Like, if he somehow lose the election in November, I don't think people will specifically pinpoint this debate as one of the reasons we lost. I understand that maybe Vance himself may have helped Trump since by comparison Vance blew Trump's performance out of the water. But we couldn't control what Vance did.

Why do you blame the breakout of war in the middle east on Trump but not on genocidal Jihadists who's stated goal has been the elimination of Israel for decades now? Is the Hamas backlash to the Abraham Accords not just further evidence of that? Why should we give into the demands of a fundamentalist islamist group by limiting Arab-Israeli cooperation? This only makes sense if you're a \\"river to the sea\\" kind of person that deliberately wants the conflict to be extended until Israel is disbanded.

Secretary Vilsack announced that the projects, if approved, will receive more than $248 million to help lower electricity bills for households, expand reliable access to renewable energy and create jobs for rural families, small businesses and agricultural producers.Also today, USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator Andrew Berke joined White House Domestic Policy Advisor to the President, Neera Tanden, to highlight the projects at the Wisconsin Farmers Unions Investing in Rural Wisconsin event.The funding for USDAs PACE program is from the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936 as part of the New Deal. The Inflation Reduction Act partners with rural communities to deliver clean, reliable and affordable energy.  \\n...  \\nBy using renewable energy from natural sources, these investments would make it more affordable for people to heat their homes, run their businesses, power cars, schools, hospitals and more.In May 2023, USDA made $1 billion available through PACE to fund new clean energy projects and energy storage in rural America. This program provides low interest loans with up to 60% loan forgiveness to renewable energy developers, rural electric cooperatives and other rural energy providers for renewable energy storage and projects that use wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal and biomass.It is part of the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy and other investment areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.To date, USDA has selected 27 projects totaling more than $916 million to move forward in the PACE application process.USDA expects to continue making PACE awards in the coming months.USDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas. Visit the Rural Data Gateway to learn how and where these investments are impacting rural America.USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming Americas food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.List of projects for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from Secretary Vilsack:Rural electric cooperatives and utilities are the backbone of Americas power delivery and when we invest in them, we strengthen the nations energy security, Secretary Vilsack said. Under the leadership of the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is proud to partner with these organizations to create a more affordable and sustainable future benefiting rural families, businesses and the health of our planet for generations to come.&amp;nbsp;In other press releases:* [FACT SHEET: New Report Shows 4.2 Million Entrepreneurs Get Health Insurance Through the ACA Marketplaces](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/25/fact-sheet-new-report-shows-4-2-million-entrepreneurs-get-health-insurance-through-the-aca-marketplaces/)* [FACT SHEET: Biden-?Harris Administration Announces New Investments to Protect Freshwater Resources, Enhance Drought and Climate Resilience](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/25/fact-sheet-biden-%e2%81%a0harris-administration-announces-new-investments-to-protect-freshwater-resources-enhance-drought-and-climate-resilience/)* [FACT SHEET: During Climate Week, Biden-?Harris Administration Announces Continued Progress on the American Climate Corps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/25/fact-sheet-during-climate-week-biden-harris-administration-announces-continued-progress-on-the-american-climate-corps/) * [Biden-Harris Administration Launches Nationwide Environmental Justice Climate Corps](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-launches-nationwide-environmental-justice-climate-corps)* [US Department of Labor, Albany State University launch partnership to support veterans, enhance employment opportunities at HBCUs](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/vets/vets20240925)* [US Department of Labor awards $6.5M in grants to support delivery of temporary, permanent housing services to farmworkers, dependents](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240925-0)* [HUD Joins Federal Agencies and AmeriCorps to expand Workforce Training for Clean Energy Jobs](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_247)* [Biden-Harris Administration Calls on Class I Freight Railroads to Guarantee Paid Sick Leave and Get to 100% Worker Coverage](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-calls-class-i-freight-railroads-guarantee-paid-sick-leave)-Enforcement:* [FTC Announces Crackdown on Deceptive AI Claims and Schemes](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes)* [FTC Announces the Addition of Three Consumer Protection Agencies to an International Agreement Aimed at Enhancing Cooperation in Cross-Border Enforcement Matters](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-addition-three-consumer-protection-agencies-international-agreement-aimed-enhancing)* [Biden-Harris Administration Requires Transit Agencies Nationwide to Address Assaults Against Transit Workers](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-requires-transit-agencies-nationwide-address-assaults)* [CBP officers seize $815K in cocaine at Eagle Pass Port of Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-officers-seize-815k-cocaine-eagle-pass-port-entry)* [Colorado Man Sentenced to Prison on Felony and Misdemeanor Charges for Actions During Jan. 6 Capitol Breach](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/colorado-man-sentenced-prison-felony-and-misdemeanor-charges-actions-during-jan-6)* [Over 100 Defendants Federally Charged With Fraud Related To The COVID-19 Pandemic](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/over-100-defendants-federally-charged-with-fraud-related-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/)* [Former Pharmacy Chief Financial Officer and Former Pharmacy President Admit Roles in $33 Million Pharmacy Compounded Medication Scheme](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/former-pharmacy-chief-financial-officer-and-former-pharmacy-president-admit-roles-in-33-million-pharmacy-compounded-medication-scheme/)","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Partners with Organizations to Bring Affordable Clean Energy to Rural Americans as Part of Investing in America Agenda | Funding Will Lower Electricity Costs and Spur Economic Growth for Families and Businesses Across 9 States"},{"text":"https://i.ibb.co/MVcMQXG/Untitled.png","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So the democrats supported the Trump administration lockdown?

This selectivity is necessary to maintain the integrity of the analysis.When we talk about raw numbers, we have to remember that those numbers come from studies that may vary in quality and design. Without careful selection, a meta-analysis could include studies that may skew the data or misrepresent the overall findings. This is why the methodology, including how studies are chosen, is critical.In many cases, meta-analyses are considered superior to single studies because they increase statistical power by combining data from multiple studies, which enhances the ability to detect true effects that might not be evident in smaller studies. They also provide a broader perspective by synthesizing findings from various studies, helping to identify patterns, trends, and inconsistencies that may not be apparent when looking at isolated research.Additionally, meta-analyses reduce the impact of random errors that can influence individual studies. By aggregating data, they lead to more robust and reliable conclusions. They often evaluate the quality of included studies, focusing on those with rigorous methodologies, which strengthens the validity of the findings. Furthermore, since meta-analyses encompass diverse populations and settings, their findings are often more generalizable than those from single studies. They also highlight areas where research is lacking or where results are inconsistent, guiding future research directions and informing clinical practice.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

Im assuming your lowering implies less education requirements which will cause more harm than good. First, you are not thinking about mental health treatment from the appropriate perspective. A major problem is that there is a chasm between physical health (medical) and mental health and this should not exist. Physical health and mental health are both medical and should be treated as medical. Doctors and other medical professionals have a very high burnout rate, suicide rate, just like mental health providers. Other medical professionals need 8+ years of school, then post school clinical hours, etc. I dont think anyone would suggest to lower the education requirements for doctors, nurses, etc, to solve those high burnout rates because people rightly understand medical providers need education, experience, and time. The first rule is to do no harm and we dont meet that rule by lowering requirements and expectations on who can provide medical services (mental or physical). What would help with burnout is less stigma of mental health, eliminating the erroneous chasm between physical and mental health, better healthcare (insurance reform or whatever), providing more paid leaves, vacations, and a 35 hour work week (I believe Europe work week is less than 40 hours). You are also wrong in terms of there being no outcomes measures to show progress or whatever. There are many validated tools and assessments to track outcomes for depression, anxiety, quality of life, etc. you can also measure progress in terms of decreased hospitalizations, stable employment, etc. You seem to know very little about the actual work, outcomes, etc. in the mental health profession. I do agree that gatekeeping mental health professionals (I.e., preventing bad therapists from becoming licensed etc.) needs work and more bad professionals get licensed than I would like. However, gatekeeping absolutely exists and education, national testing, and supervised clinical experience have absolutely stopped some people, who would suck as therapists, from the profession. It just needs to happen more.","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"I wish more people could see that understanding each others views can lead to better conversations.

Its two houses represent two different approaches to representation in a federation of states: one house is based purely on state population, effectively giving different weights to states based on where people happen to live, and the other house ensures each state is treated as an equal entity with equal say. The two are meant to balance each other out conceptually. The real issue is that the House of Representatives is capped at 435 members, when it should really be 3 or 4 times that by now. If the House were uncapped and members were actually added based on population, it would effectively nerf the Senate and, ironically, make the Electoral College less of a problem (but it would still be a problem just on principle, and should still be abolished)","title":"Another poll shows Ted Cruz trailing Democratic challenger Colin Allred"},{"text":"Imagine if the same was done for Harris or Biden... the outrage and criminals charges would fly","title":"Democrats would be outraged if Republicans hung a naked balloon of their Presidential candidate by a noose / Hate Crime?"},{"text":"its more like 20-30%, the same amount since pre-colonial times, stretching through history.

Then during the war the US tortured people and detained innocent people. Another dumb thing was when the CIA agent who was in charge of studying whether Niger sold uranium cake to Iraq came out and said the Bush admin was lying that they did, the Bush Admin doxxed his wife who was in charge of tracking loose nuclear and chemical weapons and dragged her name through the mud.?It was basically if someone did the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The same kind of gaslighting, goal post shifting and even persecution of critics.

However, there are some really tough questions a president (or all politicians) have to consider  - - What are the nuances and optics of sending weapons and stockpiles that are just sitting around (which is what I believe we're mostly doing for Israel and Ukraine) vs. giving direct financial support (which we are also doing and have done)? \\n- How does our presence in these wars impact our global military reach and ability to support and defend our allies across the globe? What are the externalities of backing away from supporting our allies (for example, in areas like the south china sea)? \\n- How does our presence in these wars impact our diplomatic position and soft power, and what are the downstream effects on trade and the economy and more? Point being, there are real consequences to these decisions to move money away from defense. I'm certainly no expert in military affairs or geopolitics, and definitely not a war hawk, but there is an argument to be made for having a solid military (which also could use significant reform and efficiency gains) and boosting our soft diplomatic power (which Trump absolutely nuked). Maybe the defense budget is genuinely the cost of dominating the globe militarily and even though it's outrageously expensive we as a country are not ready to give up that power and security, which maybe could be our downfall someday. Maybe also that we have such a huge industry based around manufacturing all of the things the military is creating or using or consuming, from weapons to gear and much, much more, which supports families and even entire cities and towns and would leave a giant hole if we started gutting it (like what conservative policies have done to education). I hope we can figure out how to meet the needs of real people first and support diplomacy rather than wars, but it's a hard sell to advocate gutting the defense budget and that's pretty much why it only goes up.","title":"Kamala Harris says U.S. will support Israel's right to defend itself after Iran's missile attack"},{"text":"I'll say it again, JD vance went into depth on literally every single subject and answer he gave.. something Tim walz barely did, and hence tim got stressed when JD rebuttalled with better, smarter, and logical answers.JD is a natural debater!","title":"JD Vance Had A Great Night"},{"text":"And DeSantis.The party has built a surprisingly deep bench for the national level, just gotta get this year and we'll be okay.","title":"JD Vance Had A Great Night"},{"text":"Then no.

He nailed it hard on the gun control, abortion stuff, and ended VERY strong pointing out the Jan. 6 stuff. Vance refused to state trump lost when given a couple of opportunities to do so. Walz's closing argument was coherent, optimistic, articulate, and strong. Vance's was just rambling negativity and hot air.I think the refusal to explicitly claim trump lost will bother people.

While its true that meta-analyses must be selective in choosing studies to include, this is done with rigorous criteria designed to ensure the quality and relevance of the data analyzed. Researchers often use established guidelines to minimize bias, such as PRISMA or MOOSE, which help maintain transparency and reproducibility.Furthermore, the strength of a meta-analysis lies in its ability to synthesize findings from multiple studies, providing a more comprehensive view of a particular issue than any single study could offer. This aggregation helps to identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent in isolated research. Its also important to consider that not all studies are equal in quality. A meta-analysis can help filter out less rigorous studies while focusing on those that meet specific standards for validity and reliability. While no research method is perfect, meta-analyses are often viewed as a powerful tool for summarizing evidence and guiding informed decision-making in both research and practice.As for your claim about easily finding thousands of studies, its crucial to evaluate their quality and relevance rather than just quantity. The conversation should focus on the strength of the evidence presented, rather than simply the number of studies available.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

Like, I hate Vance, but after years of shitty debates having most of this be normal with only a few heated moments was nice. Its refreshing.On Walz, he had a slow start but got better and had some great moments. Definitely struggled in areas, he had previously admitted he wasnt a good debater, but I think he did a good job. Did make some flubs (the school shooter comment) but again mostly fine with some really powerful moments, such as his abortion comments.Vance came off more reserved and less, well weird, but he did have some moments that he bombed (like arguing about fact checking). He really started spinning the lies and getting a bit Trumpy in the last 3rd, but I think comments praising Walz and sympathy towards Walzs son are going to do good for his favorability. Overall, Im curious to see what public opinion is to this debate. Obviously most of us will say Walz won, but I dont think Vance really did terrible, at least in comparison to rock bottom expectations from his past public comments. I think polling of the debate will be notably closer, and Im not positive who will have the edge in the eyes of independents (obviously hoping Walz).","title":"Vice-Presidential debate and Alabama State House District 55 watch thread"},{"text":"Exactly the point.

While the study raises valid concerns about the potential negative effects of pornography consumption, it is important to consider a more nuanced perspective. First, the study focuses heavily on the negative aspects of pornography without adequately addressing its potential positive effects. Many users report that pornography can enhance their sexual experiences and provide a safe space for exploration.Additionally, the emergence of platforms like OnlyFans and other adult content sites has increased representation of diverse body types and sexualities. This variety challenges the notion that pornography exclusively promotes unrealistic beauty standards, which could mitigate the body image issues highlighted in the study.The authors also note the absence of proper sexual education as a contributing factor to negative outcomes, yet they overlook the growing availability of comprehensive sex education. This education equips individuals with the tools to engage with pornography in a healthier manner.Furthermore, issues of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem are complex and not solely attributable to pornography consumption. Factors like social media, societal pressures, and personal circumstances also play significant roles in these mental health challenges and should be considered in the evaluation of pornographys effects.Its also essential to recognize that not all pornography is the same. The study treats pornography as a monolithic entity, whereas there is a wide range of content available, some of which promotes positive sexual health, consent, and diversity. The context in which pornography is consumed can greatly influence its effects.Lastly, while the research suggests a correlation between pornography consumption and negative psychological outcomes, it fails to establish direct causation. Individuals who struggle with anxiety or depression may be drawn to pornography as a coping mechanism rather than being negatively affected by it.2. This study may have limitations that could impact its validity. For instance, a non-representative sample might limit the generalizability of findings. Technical issues, particularly for older participants, could lead to incomplete data, while varying interpretations of pornography could affect response consistency. Additionally, self-selection bias might skew results toward those more comfortable discussing sexual topics, and religious participants might underreport due to discomfort. Finally, if covariates arent adequately controlled, they could influence results, undermining the studys conclusions.3. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) is often criticized for several reasons. First, its claims about pornography and sexuality are seen by some as misleading and contradictory to findings from peer-reviewed studies. Additionally, NCOSE is perceived to have an anti-internet stance, capitalizing on the #MeToo movement while promoting views that oppose online freedom.Their Dirty Dozen List has also been called disingenuous, as it reportedly overlooks issues of sexual abuse within religious organizations. Furthermore, critics argue that NCOSEs activism is rooted in a purity culture that promotes shame, abstinence, and stigmatizes women.The Anti-Trafficking Review has pointed out that NCOSE often presents misleading research to create a false medical consensus about the dangers of pornography. Many argue that pornography should not be classified as a public health crisis, as indicators of sexual assault and teen pregnancy suggest improvements rather than deterioration.\\n4. The study might not show the full picture regarding pornographys impact for several reasons. First, it relies on a nonprobability convenience sample, which limits its generalizability. While it identifies associations between pornography use and lower relationship quality, it does not establish causation; other factors, like individual relationship dynamics and personal values, may contribute to both issues. Additionally, the study focuses on perceived addiction and religiosity but overlooks other influences, such as communication styles and sexual attitudes. There are also potential biases, as certain demographics may have been more likely to drop out of the survey, which could skew results. The lack of a specific definition of pornography may lead to varying interpretations among participants, affecting the reliability of self-reported data. Furthermore, the study simplifies relationship quality by only examining satisfaction and stability, ignoring other aspects like emotional intimacy. Lastly, the findings may reflect specific cultural contexts that dont apply universally. Overall, the studys limitations suggest it cant definitively claim that porn is bad without considering the complexity of individual experiences and relationships.\\n?Here are some additional studies, resources, and meta-analyses worth exploring. I believe meta-analyses provide a more comprehensive understanding than individual studies alone.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23167939/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8362880/#:~:text=Across%20these%20samples%2C%20we%20found,was%20not%20moderated%20by%20gender.https://www.woodhullfoundation.org/our-projects/fact-checked-by-woodhull/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/202104/does-porn-use-lead-sexual-violencehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679165/https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/02/religious-moral-porn-addictionhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30621919/https://youtu.be/fqsBWnPfr8o?si=TJ9GyMa5SglxBp9Ihttps://youtu.be/S79C-HGTIM0?si=L-","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.
